t sure what the point would be, as the only person people wanted to be Minister, other than Fudge, was Albus Dumbledore, who preferr
ed to be the headmaster of Hogwarts). Right before his birthday he would be leaving the Dursleys forever and going to live with his godfather, Sirius Black, in Scotland. Although he was definitely looking forward to that, it was the birthday he was really
 anticipating.
\par 
\par Naturally, having all of these things to look forward to meant that each twenty-four-hour day felt more like twenty-four years. In the short time he\rquote d been home he thought he would go mad from the waiting. Plus, in addition to the usual dail
y verbal abuse he had to tolerate from his aunt and uncle (And their annoying little Yorkshire terrier, Dunkirk, who hated Harry with a passion) was the fact that they had decided to use the last month of his tenure with them to squeeze as much free labou
r out of him as possible. It had begun on his third morning back from school.
\par 
\par Harry had risen early to go running as usual, having dashed out of the house just clear of the snapping jaws of the highly-annoyed terrier. While he made a circuit around the par
k, he noticed with interest that there was a large tent erected in the middle of the green, near the artificial lake that was created with funds raised by the Royal Gardening Society of Little Whinging, of which his aunt was recording secretary (She
\rquote d been angling for president for years, with no luck, as Agnes Bringhurst kept successfully campaigning against her). The tent was very large and white, with mesh \'93Windows\'94
 giving one the impression that you could put your hands through the openings. When Harry 
peered through one of these, he saw two men in jumpsuits setting up white folding chairs in neat rows with an aisle down the centre. The chairs faced a dais with a handful of chairs looking back at the audience. The dais was skirted in white, so the suppo
rts weren\rquote t visible.
\par 
\par Must be a wedding, he decided. It was the end of June, after all. He looked up at the blue cloudless sky. The wedding party was overcompensating for the weather; if they had thought that they\rquote d guarantee clear skies by ordering a tent,
 it seemed to have worked. (Although his aunt and uncle were adamant that the word \'93Magic\'94
 not be uttered in their house, they were absolutely convinced that carrying an umbrella was a fool-proof charm against rain. Harry knew that they were hardly alone i
n this very common muggle superstition, yet people carried umbrellas in Britain almost all the time and it rained quite a lot).
\par 
\par Harry turned away from the tent and immediately collided with a very familiar person who was panting heavily. He hadn\rquote t realize
d this person had walked right up to the tent and was also peering in the mesh window. Harry frowned. He had last seen him on the platform at King\rquote s Cross, and had not been looking forward to seeing him again so soon.
\par 
\par \'93How considerate--\'94 wheeze! \'93--of you to let me know--\'94 gasp! \'93--you were going running, Potter--\'94 gulp! \'93--and to let me hare after you--\'94Pant! \'93--for a mile while you went on, oblivious--\'94
\par 
\par Harry frowned. \'93I didn\rquote t know you were behind me, Malfoy, else I\rquote d have stopped.\'94 He wouldn\rquote t have wanted to stop, but he knew it would be good form to stop. \'93You could have said something.\'94
\par 
\par Draco Malfoy collapsed on the ground next to the tent. \'93No. I. Couldn\rquote t.\'94 He breathed heavily for another minute, then looked like he was starting to get his breath back. \'93When did you get so damn fast?\'94 he said in a rush. \'93
Have you been holding out on us when we were running round the Quidditch pitch every morning?\'94
\par 
\par Harry shrugged, trying very hard not to grin smugly. \'93I might have been without knowing it. Where\rquote ve you been for the last two days? It wasn\rquote t like I expected you. I just started running and running.\'94
 He glanced around at the green of the park. \'93It\rquote s nice to be back.\'94 He remembered his fleeting moments of missing Surrey in his other life. It felt like he\rquote d been gone for a thousand years.
\par 
\par Malfoy frowned. \'93I took a break for a couple of days, but this morning, I just had to get out. I can\rquote t believe I\rquote m stuck in that house with my old nanny again. All summer. And stuck in this hell known as Surrey. Gah. It\rquote 
s nice to be back? Are you mental?\'94
\par 
\par Now Harry grinned. \'93Chin up, Malfoy. Stiff upper lip and all that. After all, you get to live with all those lovely kitties....\'94 he taunted, knowing how Malfoy detested--indeed, feared--cats of all kinds.
\par 
\par Malfoy lunged for him and Harry hopped nimbly out of the way, starting to jog in place. \'93Come on. We can run back together, if you like. I can drop in and say hello to Mrs. Figg. She\rquote s not all that bad. Even when she snaps, she\rquote 
s not as bad as my aunt. She\rquote s just a bit like--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--Mad Eye Moody. Yeah, I know. But younger and female. As if that\rquote s an improvement.\'94
\par 
\par Harry considered. \'93Well--she doesn\rquote t have a magic eye. That\rquote s something. You\rquote d never get any privacy if she did.\'94
\par 
\par Malfoy shuddered. \'93Okay, now I\rquote m going to have to get that image out of my mind...\'94
\par 
\par Harry started running back toward Privet Drive, laughing, but tempering his pace until the other boy had caught up with him. As they jogged, Harry said, \'93So. I guess we\rquote d better go back to first names. For the summer.\'94
\par 
\par He received a nod in return, as Draco was turning quite red and dripping with sweat. When they reached Mrs. Figg\rquote s house, they both collapsed on the lawn and did some warm-down exercises before going round the back to enter through the kitchen 
door. Mrs. Figg had gone out early, leaving a note, so Harry bade Draco Malfoy farewell and returned to the Dursleys\rquote  to shower and eat breakfast.
\par 
\par When he entered the kitchen, his aunt was dishing up kippers for his uncle, and the dog was sitting in Dudley\rquote 
s old spot at the table, waiting for his own kippers with ears standing at attention and his front paws on the edge of the table. It would have been cute if it hadn\rquote 
t been Dunkirk, the hound from hell. Harry went to the fridge for some orange juice, bumping his head painfully on the top of the opening when his aunt screeched at him.
\par 
\par \'93You! You got a call from that Dick. Wants you to work for him again.\'94
\par 
\par Harry had been expecting Dick Abernathy to call, who was really Aberforth Dumbledore, his headmaster\rquote 
s brother. Abernathy Landscaping was a thriving business which also employed the wizard Sam Bell, who had served ten years in Azkaban for casting a spell which caused his wife\rquote s death. Sam was Katie Bell\rquote 
s dad; Harry had played on the Gryffindor Quidditch team with Katie for six years, but now she was out of school. He liked Sam and looked forward to seeing him again.
\par 
\par Vernon Dursley put down his newspaper and looked at Harry with narrowed eyes. \'93Oh, no you don\rquote t. You\rquote re not spending your last month here working for someone else and making money hand over fist. You\rquote 
re going to make up for all those years of free room and board, you are. You will make yourself useful. Starting tomorrow, when you go for that morning run of yours, you\rquote re going to take Dunkirk with you. He needs more exercise. You\rquote 
ll walk him in the evening as well. And you\rquote re going to replace the roof. Needs it badly. Last time it rained, it leaked right over our bed, and in our en suite bath, and over Dudley\rquote s desk and in the guest room as well
. Your room seems to be the only one without a leak. You wouldn\rquote t know anything about that, would you?\'94
\par 
\par Harry dropped his jaw. \'93I spent most of last summer at Mrs. Figg\rquote s, so I haven\rquote t even set foot in this house for almost a year. What would I know about leaks in the roof?\'94
\par 
\par Vernon made a harumphing sort of noise. \'93I wouldn\rquote t put it past you...\'94
\par 
\par \'93And,\'94 Harry went on, \'93I have no intention of fixing your roof. I already did your garden landscaping for practically nothing.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Nothing! Five pounds a day that cost us!\'94 his aunt screeched, as though this represented a fortune. Harry groaned.
\par 
\par \'93You\rquote re not serious? You actually expect me to fix the roof?\'94 He stared back and forth between their two equally-repugnant faces. He folded his arms and held his ground. \'93Well, you can\rquote t make me.\'94
\par 
\par Vernon folded his paper and raised his eyebrows at his wife. \'93You hear that, Petunia? From the ingrate who\rquote s lived here for sixteen years--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Fifteen-and-a-half,\'94 Harry corrected him.
\par 
\par \'93--Eating our food and wearing the clothes our money bought him--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--Clothes that were Dud--er, someone else\rquote s first--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--And this is the way he responds when we ask him to do us a tiny favour...\'94
\par 
\par \'93Tiny!\'94 Harry exploded. \'93You want me to fix the bloody roof!\'94
\par 
\par \'93Not just fix--replace. Completely. It\rquote s been ages. No good in repairing something that old. Needs an entirely new covering.\'94
\par 
\par Harry\rquote s jaw dropped. \'93You must be mad. I am not replacing the roof. I am working for Dick starting tomorrow, and that\rquote s final.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Final, he says,\'94 Vernon said in a musing voice, standing to leave. \'93Final. Do you hear that, Petunia?\'94 His voice had become soft and sing-song. She nodded, her mouth very thin. \'93Final. Well,\'94
 he went on, his voice louder and more menacing now. \'93We\rquote ll just see about that.\'94
\par 
\par And with a knowing and triumphant look, he stalked out of the kitchen to go to work at the Grunnings Drill factory. Harry frowned after him. Brilliant. A row with my uncle at the beginning of the summer. Just what I need.
\par 
\par But Harry had a queasy feeling about this. What, exactly, did Vernon Dursley mean by We\rquote ll just see about that?
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par Harry talked with Aberforth on the phone after eating lunch; the next morning he was to be at Mrs. Figg\rquote s at eight o\rquote clock sharp for Sam to drive him and Draco to the estate where they\rquote 
d planted the trees during the previous summer. They were doing more elaborate landscaping on the grounds, building a garden folly to look like a Greek temple and putting in a lot of shrubbery which would then be carefully sculpted. H
arry was looking forward to the job. He spent the day alternately sunning himself in the garden and, when he grew bored, he pulled some weeds or pruned some roses and made a mental note that the bench needed a coat of paint. And then he remembered that in
 the fuss over the roof, he hadn\rquote t had a chance to register his displeasure with the order to take Dunkirk on walks. As if that dog would do anything he wanted him to! He wondered whether the real goal all along had been to turn him into Dunkirk
\rquote s walker, and the roof was just a diversion.
\par 
\par When he went indoors to make a sandwich for lunch, he heard voices coming from the upstairs. One was his Aunt Petunia, but he wasn\rquote t sure about the other, as it was muffled. He walked into the front hall, unsure what he w
ould find, and was startled when his uncle suddenly came jogging down the stairs, an unnaturally happy grin on his face and a Grunnings drill in one hand. Upon seeing Harry, he turned his smile on him, and Harry fought the urge to recoil.
\par 
\par \'93Hello, there! Just stopping home briefly. It\rquote s so convenient to work for a company that produces such excellent drills! Must get back to the office now!\'94
 And then he was gone; he strode outside and through the glass in the door Harry saw him get into his car. He had take
n the drill with him. It looked like a very large drill, and Harry had noticed that the bit was also very large, capable of boring a hole at least an inch in diameter.
\par 
\par He turned, startled again, when his aunt came down the stairs. She was brushing what lo
oked like white powder from her clothes. When she saw him, she looked even more smug than his uncle. She passed him without a word and went to the kitchen. Harry shook his head; he just could not wait for the day he didn\rquote 
t have to live with two such mental people any more. His brief bout of missing Surrey was very effectively cured.
\par 
\par After he ate his lunch, he decided to go to Mrs. Figg\rquote s. He had been putting it off, but there was no denying that Draco Malfoy needed to know about the Obedience Charm Voldemort had put on him when he was a baby. He\rquote 
d been distracted by the tent in the park and had not thought to tell him that morning. What if Voldemort did the same thing with Malfoy he\rquote d done with Harry the previous September, used the Tempus Fugit spell to ta
lk to him? What if he gave him a direct order and Malfoy refused? Malfoy would drop dead in a second. And if he agreed to whatever it was, lying, and thinking, \lquote Well, I just won\rquote t do it,\rquote  he\rquote 
d get the shock of his life when he felt magically compelled to do it anyway. There was no denying it: Malfoy had to know.
\par 
\par He thought about his mother telling him about the Obedience Charm in the cave, before she tried to kill Ron. Why hadn\rquote t she told him before his initiation? It would have been nice to know. Perhaps,
 in that setting, she expected him to have the sense to do as he was told. Luckily, he wasn\rquote t told to do anything like engage in cannibalism. He managed to spirit away Viktor Krum\rquote s body before it came to that. Perhaps that\rquote 
s what Voldemort was after, he thought. Perhaps he was counting on my refusing to eat part of a human, and Draco Malfoy too, and then we\rquote d have dropped dead and he wouldn\rquote 
t have had to worry about us any more....perhaps there was more to that than gaining Viktor\rquote s power by consuming his still-warm body....
\par 
\par He shuddered, feeling his lunch move uncomfortably within him as he walked to Mrs. Figg\rquote s in the warm June afternoon. Malfoy had to know. He could have died at his initiation in this life. Harry remembered the way he had interrupted Vo
ldemort to suggest using the Hara Kiri curse on Karkaroff. (Fortunately, the Obedience Charm carried no penalty for rudeness.) Harry thought about a father who would put a curse like Hara Kiri on his son, and he stopped being surprised that Lucius Malfoy 
had said nothing about the Obedience Charm.
\par 
\par When he reached the house, the car wasn\rquote t in the drive, so he assumed Mrs. Figg was out. He knocked at the door, receiving no answer. He waited several minutes, then walked around to the rear; no one was in the g
arden, either. Malfoy had gone out as well, it seemed. To give himself something to do while he waited, he set to work weeding Mrs. Figg\rquote s peony border, which was being encroached by dandelions. He knew that in her terse, gruff way, she\rquote 
d be grateful.
\par 
\par Harry lost track of time, and finally he heard the sound of Mrs. Figg\rquote s elderly maroon Ford trundling into the drive. He looked up from his weeding and got a shock; Mrs. Figg wasn\rquote 
t driving, Draco Malfoy was. His jaw dropped open in astonishment.
\par 
\par Malfoy emerged from the driver\rquote s side of the car, grinning and leaning on the open door, saying, \'93Oh, that\rquote s attractive, Potter. Keep it up and you might solve our bug problem, though.\'94
\par 
\par Harry clamped his mouth shut again. He looked at the car and then Mrs. Figg, narrowing his eyes suspiciously. \'93You did this!\'94 he declared, seeing her blanche upon being accused. She looked flustered and put her hand to her breastbone.
\par 
\par \'93Well, you see, I, um...oh dear....\'94 her voice quavered.
\par 
\par Malfoy slammed the car door. \'93Oh, lighten up, Potter. Muggle red tape is ridiculous. Who hasn\rquote t wished they could move things along a bit, skip steps like getting a provisional license....\'94
\par 
\par \'93But--but--\'94 Harry sputtered. \'93You\rquote re not supposed to do more than wish it! You\rquote re not supposed to use magic to--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Hush!\'94 Mrs. Figg declared, suddenly losing her feeble-old-woman fa\'e7ade. With a wave of her hand, Harry\rquote s mouth was sealed. Or rather, it was gone. He put his hands up
 to the place where his mouth had been. There was slightly bristly uninterrupted skin from his nose to his chin; no orifice whatsoever.
\par 
\par \'93Mmm mmm MMM!\'94 Harry yelled to the best of his ability. He at least still had a voice box in his throat, from which the noise emanated. Draco Malfoy looked like he was about to roll about on the ground laughing fit to kill.
\par 
\par \'93Get in the house!\'94 the old woman snapped irritably. Harry\rquote s throaty moans grew louder and more indignant. \'93Well, that\rquote ll teach you to shut yer yob in public, won\rquote t it?\'94
 She sighed and shook her head as she herded the boys toward the house. \'93Muggle upbringing, no sense....\'94 Draco Malfoy was turning purple from trying not to laugh at the mouthless, irate Harry.
\par 
\par Once they were in the kitchen again, Mrs. Figg waved her hand casually at Harry, and his mouth reappeared. He gasped and immediately took up yelling again. \'93
What the hell was that? What are you going to do next? Turn him into a bouncing ferret, like your brother did?\'94
\par 
\par She squinted at him. \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par \'93When she removed your mouth she must have removed a few brain cells as well, Potter. That wasn\rquote t the real Moody, remember? And--\'94 he lowered his voice, \'93Don\rquote t give her any ideas.\'94
\par 
\par Harry threw himself grumpily into a kitchen chair. \'93Point out that someone\rquote s breaking the law, and the next thing you know your mouth is gone. It isn\rquote t like I grassed on anyone....\'94
\par 
\par She was standing at the cooker, putting the kettle on, even though it was a very warm day. He remembered that she never considered it too warm fo
r a cuppa. She waved her hand at the kettle and it almost immediately started whistling. She waggled her eyebrows at the cupboard, and three cups and saucers flew to the table, joined by three spoons soaring from the drawer next to the cooker. With a slig
ht finger movement, the kettle was pouring water into the old brown teapot, which then floated to the table, along with the sugar bowl and cream pitcher.
\par 
\par Mrs. Figg sat down opposite Harry and nodded at him. \'93You can be mother,\'94 she told him, and he grimaced, irked that she hadn\rquote 
t even apologized for hexing him. But he reached out and poured the already-perfectly-steeped tea into their respective cups.
\par 
\par As they took turns with the cream pitcher and sugar lumps, Mrs. Figg spoke. \'93Now, Harry, hear me out and don\rquote t pass judgment until you know what\rquote 
s what. First, I want to ask you a question. How exactly do you think a witch or wizard who didn\rquote t grow up in the muggle world goes about getting a license to drive an automobile?\'94
\par 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93The same way everybody else does. You go to the post office and fill out the form, then send it to the DVLA....\'94
\par 
\par \'93And what does the witch or wizard use for identification?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I dunno. A passport. A birth certificate. The usual sort of thing.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Harry, as far as the British government is concerned, we don\rquote t exist. Unless we do a little wand-waving, we don\rquote 
t have muggle birth certificates or passports. And I wanted Draco to have a license with a minimum of waiting and bureaucracy, so I just--sped things up a bit.\'94
\par 
\par \'93In addition to creating a false identity for him.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, his license says Draco Malfoy. However, it lists this address as his official residence and June 7 for his birthdate, rather than July 7, and of course, his provisional license dates back to June 7 as well...\'94
\par 
\par \'93You couldn\rquote t wait one more week for him to turn seventeen? Even if he doesn\rquote t exist as far as the government knows, you could at least generate a birth certificate for him with the correct birthdate and apply for a provo and
 wait for it to come in the post like anyone else...\'94
\par 
\par Mrs. Figg finished her tea and put her teacup down with a clatter. \'93You, Harry Potter, do not know what you are talking about. How do you think your friend Aberforth Dumbledore has functioned in busine
ss all these years? Do you think he explains to all of his clients that he\rquote s really a wizard and that his name isn\rquote 
t Dick Abernathy? Do you think he shows government employees a one-hundred-forty-year-old birth certificate issued by the Ministry of Magic? Grow up--you\rquote 
ve lived for years in the muggle world. Your parents had your birth recorded in Cardiff and you have a record of attending a muggle school. The queen\rquote s government believes you\rquote 
re a person. That was not true of Draco. I have wards on my house preventing anyone from Apparating in or out, now that Draco\rquote s staying with me again. I can\rquote 
t very well take off on my broom any time I want--not that I care for brooms at my age--and it\rquote s a security risk to have my fireplace on the Floo Network. I do not ca
re for driving; my reflexes and vision are not what they used to be. If you had your choice, would you rather I was behind the wheel of an automobile or Draco?\'94
\par 
\par Harry grimaced and Draco Malfoy mumbled, \'93Typical Gryffindor reaction...\'94
\par 
\par \'93Typical Slytherin behavior, circumventing the rules, anything to achieve an end...\'94
\par 
\par \'93Now, now. All wizards who suddenly find themselves needing to function in the muggle world do it. And your beloved Aberforth was a Hufflepuff. So there,\'94 she said, as though that settled i
t. Harry drank his tea, still feeling miffed about his mouth.
\par 
\par \'93And,\'94 he shot at Malfoy, \'93Your girlfriend is a Gryffindor, and everyone in her family, whom you\rquote re trying to impress, so I wouldn\rquote t advise you to make too many comments about \lquote typical Gryffindor\rquote 
 behavior around the Weasleys....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Speaking of Weasleys, weren\rquote t you the one who flew to school in the Weasleys\rquote  car at the beginning of second year? Weren\rquote t beyond breaking more than a few rules there, were you? If I remember correctly, it was all ov
er the Evening Prophet that night that loads of muggles had seen you, and then there was another story a few months later about Weasley\rquote s dad getting in trouble at work because of it....\'94
\par 
\par \'93He\rquote s also Ginny\rquote s dad, and you\rquote d better stop being so smug about that if you ever expect him to let you near his daughter again.\'94
\par 
\par Mrs. Figg sighed and waved her hand; the cups and saucers and other tea things hurled themselves into the sink, which started filling with a mixture of hot and cold water from the separate taps. Harry frowned; he\rquote 
d had his teacup to his mouth, still drinking, and it had flown out of his hand.
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s enough,\'94 she said. \'93You didn\rquote t know we\rquote d gone to Swansea to get Draco his license, obviously, so you must have come for some other reason besides accusing us of high crimes and misdemeanors.\'94
\par 
\par Harry grimaced. In the fuss over Mrs. Figg bending the rules, he\rquote d almost forgotten. Of course, that was what had happened virtually every day since he\rquote 
d restored the timelines--something always seemed to get him sidetracked before he could find a moment to talk to Malfoy about the Obedience Charm.
\par 
\par \'93Well, I recently found out something that I thought Malfoy--er, Draco--should know. Actually, I\rquote m surprised you didn\rquote t tell him--wait. Maybe you did...\'94
\par 
\par Draco Malfoy looked back and forth between Harry and Mrs. Figg. \'93All right. I give up. What are you talking about?\'94
\par 
\par Mrs. Figg scowled. \'93Yes, Harry. What are you talking about?\'94
\par 
\par Harry drew his lips into a line. \'93Okay. Here\rquote s what I know.\'94 He turned to Malfoy. \'93When you were about a year old, Voldemort came to your parents because of the Prophecy. He gave them a choice: raise you to be his servant or he\rquote 
d kill you. They chose to cooperate, and he put a spell on you as a kind of insurance. It was an Obedience Charm.\'94
\par 
\par Draco Malfoy looked at his former nanny. \'93Did you know about this?\'94
\par 
\par She shook her head vigorously. \'93This is news to me. How did you find out, Harry?\'94
\par 
\par How did he find out? Oh, he could say, I was trying to prevent my mum killing Ron Weasley, and she explained to me that she was doing it so I wouldn\rquote t be ordered to by Voldemort, because if I refused, I\rquote d die.... Right. I\rquote 
m going to have to deal with this I can\rquote t tell you stuff all over again.
\par 
\par \'93I can\rquote t--well, how really isn\rquote t the important part. The important thing is the way the spell works. If you--\'94 he nodded at Draco Malfoy, \'93Received a direct order from Voldemort, you\rquote d have to either agree to wh
atever it was or refuse to do whatever it was....\'94
\par 
\par The blond boy smirked. \'93And how is that any different from not being under an Obedience Charm?\'94
\par 
\par \'93What happens after that is what\rquote s different. If you agree to do whatever you\rquote re told, even if you were lying and never had any intention of doing it, once you agree, you will do whatever it is, or die in the attempt. If it\rquote 
s at all possible, that is. For instance, if you\rquote re told to kill someone who\rquote s already dead, there\rquote s no effect. It can\rquote t be overcome, like Imperius.\'94
\par 
\par Draco Malfoy frowned. \'93Well that\rquote s definitely not good. I mean, I wouldn\rquote t have been able to lie at the initiation, since there were so many other people around, but that\rquote s why I suggested using the Japanese spell, so I couldn
\rquote t be sent to prison for performing an Unforgivable Curse, if anyone in the Ministry ever found out...\'94
\par 
\par Harry shuddered. He had performed two of the three Unforgivable Curses; he had attempted to kill Tom Riddle with one, and he had influenced his mother with Imperius when he changed the timelines. He\rquote d never put Cruciatus on anyone, though.
\par 
\par \'93Yeah,\'94 he went on. \'93That\rquote s why I thought you should know. Lying won\rquote t do any good in a situation like that.\'94
\par 
\par Draco Malfoy stared down at the table.
\par 
\par When the uncomfortable silence had stretched for quite some time, Harry cleared his throat. \'93There\rquote s--there\rquote s more.\'94
\par 
\par Mrs. Figg looked up. \'93How much more?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well--if Voldemort gives you,\'94 he nodded at Draco Malfoy, \'93A direct order and you refuse to do it--\'94 He stopped; he didn\rquote t know how to do this. How had his mother put it?
\par 
\par \'93Well?\'94 Malfoy burst out. \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par \'93You\rquote ll drop dead.\'94 He just blurted it out. Malfoy stared.
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par Harry nodded, remembering the cave again, the wild look in his mother\rquote s eyes....
\par 
\par \'93But,\'94 he added, \'93There\rquote s actually one good thing. Kind of.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Kind of?\'94 Malfoy practically squeaked. \'93What? I get some wizarding trading stamps? What could possibly make up for what you just told me?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I didn\rquote t say it makes up for it. I said there was a good thing about all this. Okay, not a good thing precisely--more like something that\rquote s not awful.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, that\rquote s not exactly the same, it it? What the hell is it?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well--when he performs this spell--or when anyone performs it--he gives up a part of his power and you get it. The idea is--since he wants to use you to do things, the extra power makes it more likely you\rquote ll succeed. The power leaves him. That
\rquote s why he wanted your parents to agree to raise you to be his servant; if they didn\rquote t, and he put the Obedience Charm on you and then starting giving you orders when you were older--if you didn\rquote 
t know about what would happen by refusing to do as you\rquote re told and you didn\rquote t feel any loyalty to him--you could just say \lquote No\rquote  and drop dead. If that were to happen, all of the power he\rquote 
d put into you would just die with you--he wouldn\rquote t get that back.\'94
\par 
\par Malfoy looked very grumpy. \'93That\rquote s hardly what I\rquote d call \lquote good.\rquote \'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, you do have a little more power than most wizards. Some of his power went into me, too, when he tried to kill me and the curse rebounded. That\rquote s why I can speak Parseltongue. But my parents wouldn\rquote t promise me to him, so he didn
\rquote t put the Obedience Charm on me. He tried to kill me instead.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Extra power. I don\rquote t feel bloody extra powerful....\'94
\par 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93Maybe you\rquote ll find that some advanced magic you\rquote ve never tried before seventh year just comes naturally to you. Who knows? And you already kno
w how to Apparate. If you found it fairly simple to learn to do, the extra power he gave you could be a possible reason.\'94 But then he remembered yet another thing about the Obedience Charm. \'93Oh, erm, there\rquote s one more thing...\'94
\par 
\par Malfoy sighed. \'93Something else?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yeah. You, um--you can\rquote t cast a spell on Voldemort that will hurt him.\'94
\par 
\par \'93And that\rquote s good?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I didn\rquote t say this one was good. You can\rquote t put Avada Kedavra on him, or Cruciatus or Hara Kiri. If there\rquote s the possibility that he could hurt himself falling if you were to stun him, you couldn\rquote t do that either.\'94
\par 
\par \'93What do you mean, I can\rquote t?\'94
\par 
\par \'93You just can\rquote t. If you aim your wand at him and try, it will just veer off at the last minute and the spell will hit something--or someone--else. If another person is 
standing nearby, it could be very dangerous. If you were in a situation where you needed to hurt him, you\rquote d have to do it indirectly, or without magic at all. If the spell wouldn\rquote 
t hurt him, you could cast something on him like the Impediment Curse. As long as it doesn\rquote t mean stopping him in the middle of a busy motorway with a large lorry bearing down on him. Then that probably wouldn\rquote t work either.\'94
\par 
\par Malfoy stared down at the table again, then up at Harry. \'93Is that it?\'94
\par 
\par Harry nodded. \'93If my parents had agreed to do what he wanted, I\rquote d have the same spell on me. But, like me, you do have some of his power.\'94
\par 
\par Malfoy grimaced. \'93You have some of his power without the problem of not being able to hurt him and not being able to refuse an order, and with the ability to lie about following an order. Yeah. That\rquote s the same,\'94 he added sarcastically.
\par 
\par Mrs. Figg raised her eyebrows. \'93I just pulled off some very complicated magic on muggle computers and paper records in order to get you behind the wheel of my car, and you\rquote re going to start whinging about this?\'94
\par 
\par \'93But--but--\'94 Malfoy sputtered.
\par 
\par She waved her hand and Malfoy flinched, perhaps assuming that he might be the next one to lose his mouth. \'93No. You just have to deal with it. You\rquote re lucky Harry found out about this. Now you\rquote re forwarned and forearmed.\'94
\par 
\par \'93The best thing to do would be to make sure Voldemort doesn\rquote t get anywhere near him.\'94
\par 
\par Draco Malfoy gave him a withering look. \'93And winner of this year\rquote s Most Painfully Obvious Statement goes to Harry Pot--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Listen, Malfoy, I didn\rquote t have to say anything, did I?\'94
\par 
\par \'93And you still haven\rquote t said--how did you find out about this? And how long have you known?\'94
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s my business. Since I can see that you\rquote re so grateful about it, I think I\rquote ll just go home and have my tea!\'94
\par 
\par \'93Fine!\'94 Draco Malfoy spat at him.
\par 
\par \'93And I\rquote ll see you at my house for running tomorrow morning!\'94 he said as he opened the door, still in his yelling-spitefully mode, in spite of the wild inappropriateness.
\par 
\par \'93Fine!\'94 Malfoy responded, evidently also stuck in a rut.
\par 
\par Harry stalked home, his stomach churning with emotion. He\rquote d have liked to be able to drive before his birthday, but now he was going to be spending his birthday in a castle on the Isle of Bute, which didn\rquote t even have any bridges connecting
 it to the mainland; the only access by road required ferries. He couldn\rquote t say that he was slightly jealous that Mrs. Figg wasn\rquote 
t breaking the law for his sake, so his response came out as stiff-necked objection to law-breaking in general. He ran his hand through his hair as he walked. Oh well. If he saw Draco Malfoy tooling around in Mrs. Figg\rquote s car he\rquote 
d just have to make the best of it and not admit that it made him green with envy.
\par 
\par He walked in the kitchen door and washed his hands at the sink, then set
tled at his usual place for his tea. His uncle had already tucked into his bangers and mash and was reading the evening newspaper. Before he hid behind the rustling pages, Harry thought he saw a smug smirk on his face. As his aunt helped herself to anothe
r sausage, she looked like she had a smile hovering around the corners of her mouth which she was trying unsuccessfully to suppress.
\par 
\par Harry gulped down his food, looking back and forth between them every so often, but mostly attempting to pretend he wasn\rquote t 
paying any attention to them. To have somewhere else to look, he occupied himself reading an article in the newspaper that Vernon was holding up before his face:
\par 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Charismatic Speaker Comes to Surrey
\par 
\par Rodney Jeffries, the new sensation in the world of inspi
rational speakers and faith healers, is bringing the show to Surrey for the next fortnight. Mr. Jeffries has been taking the country by storm since last Bonfire Night, when he spoke at a gathering in Blackpool, where he convinced a young man who had inadv
ertantly set himself ablaze for the celebration that he not only wasn\rquote t afire but talked him out of having the very burns that others had already seen on his skin! Rodney Jeffries\rquote 
 unique blend of inspiration and mind-over-matter has made him a sensation not to be missed! Tickets: \'a3 20.
\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par Harry shook his head. What some people did for entertainment; twenty pounds was pretty steep, as well. He\rquote d rather go to the cinema; he\rquote d gone for the first time the previous summer, when he\rquote d developed a habit of taking him
self to a different film every week on one of his days off. Since Draco Malfoy was working on that day, he went alone, sitting in the dark eating Mars bars, wishing he\rquote d thought to take Hermione to a film or two during the previous summer when she
\rquote d been staying on Privet Drive.
\par 
\par Now he just wished he could talk to Hermione as a friend again. He wondered how soon they\rquote 
d get past the awkwardness that had resulted from their breaking up and her (Sort of) getting together with Ron. He also missed Ron; since Lupin had bitten him and turned him into a werewolf, he\rquote 
d been a bit distant with both him and Hermione, even though Harry had accompanied him on all of the nights that he\rquote d been a wolf so far.
\par 
\par Oddly, he had the best chance of becoming good friends now with Draco Malfoy, since he was staying in Surrey again this summer. The only problem with that was the fact that Malfoy was Ginny Weasley\rquote s boyfriend, and, as much as he\rquote 
d tried to talk himself out of it, Harry was completely and utterly in love with Ginny. He knew it was hopeless, but he couldn\rquote t help it. He daydreamed about her; he had dreams about her at night, as well. He\rquote 
d been surprised by the nature of these dreams; they were just walking hand in hand, or she was flying on his back while he soared over the Forbidden Forest as a golden griffin. He felt incredibly peaceful after having these dreams, with only a few ex
ceptions; sometimes, the pleasantness of the dream was interrupted by Draco Malfoy appearing and taking her away from Harry. The really disturbing one was where Harry and Ginny had walked into one of the greenhouses and Draco Malfoy had been there, reclin
ing on a robe on the floor with his shirt open, saying, \'93Thanks awfully for bringing her, Potter,\'94 as Ginny ran toward him and started kissing the blond boy passionately....
\par 
\par Harry shook himself as he walked up the stairs toward his room. Suddenly, a wall o
f rain hit the house, the drops thudding noisily off the window at the top of the stairs. Harry walked to the window and looked up into the sky, frowning; it was still a pale blue, the sun wasn\rquote 
t even getting ready to go down yet as it was high summer. Where the hell was all this water coming from?
\par 
\par Then Harry looked down; his uncle had gone outside after Harry had left the kitchen and he was aiming the garden hose at the house, spraying it as though it were burning violently. Harry could hear the water str
iking the roof as he walked down the corridor to his bedroom; then he heard a different sound coming from within the room. It sounded like--like it was raining inside his room.
\par 
\par He flung open the door and saw how his uncle planned to get him to repair the roof; he\rquote d used the drill he\rquote d brought home during lunch to drill holes in Harry\rquote 
s ceiling right over his bed. That was why Aunt Petunia was covered in plaster dust. And, he assumed, Uncle Vernon\rquote s voice had been muffled because he was probably doing all o
f this from the attic, making some holes above his head in the roof itself, and others in Harry\rquote s ceiling, through the floor of the attic.
\par 
\par Harry had been angry during his short life. He had been angry enough with Vernon\rquote s sister Marge when she had insulted his parents that he\rquote d inflated her into a very large and unattractive balloon. He\rquote 
d been angry enough with Malfoy and his goony sidekicks, Crabbe and Goyle, to put the Furnunculus Curse on the three of them on the Hogwarts Express after fourth year. He recalled being very angry in his other life as well, but he didn\rquote 
t think it was possible that he\rquote d ever been angrier than he was at this moment.
\par 
\par He strode quickly to his desk and pulled out his wand, ready to put the Aegis shielding charm on his entire cei
ling and the Dessicatio charm on his bed to dry it out. He stopped himself just in the nick of time. Two spells, just for the sake of not having a wet bedroom, might not be so easily overlooked by the Ministry. He was the new Hogwarts Head Boy. Carving Ja
mie\rquote s name into his parents\rquote  gravestone was one thing, but he would be performing these spells in the house at number four, Privet Drive. It would be rather difficult to explain why he absolutely had to do this. (It couldn\rquote 
t be explained away as self-defense, for instance). He put his wand down dejectedly, watching the water cascade onto his sodden mattress, streams flowing down onto the floor via the messy sheets.
\par 
\par He stomped down the corridor and stairs again, then out of doors to the tap that controlled t
he hose, turning it off thoroughly. He looked up, seeing his uncle staring into the end of the dripping hose nozzle with confusion. Harry was tempted to turn the water on again full blast while the thing was pointing right at his uncle\rquote 
s face, but he resisted this urge. Instead he strode up to his uncle and crossed his arms, glaring at him.
\par 
\par \'93All right. I\rquote ll replace the ruddy roof--\'94
\par 
\par His uncle looked up at him and smiled beatifically, as though he hadn\rquote t just been attempting to drown all of Harry\rquote s earthly belongings and soak the bed in which he slept. \'93Splendid, splendid. I\rquote ll order the supplies--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--But I\rquote m still working for Aber--I mean, Mr. Abernathy. Dick. I\rquote ll do the roof after work and on my days off.\'94
\par 
\par His uncle considered this with narrowed eyes. \'93All right. But you just make sure it\rquote s done before you leave.\'94
\par 
\par Harry agreed to get the roof done before leaving for the Isle of Bute, and then went back to his bedroom to assess the damage. His bed was hopeless, but to limit the amount of water that wou
ld get all over the house, he threw the mattress straight out the window, along with the spring. Then he hauled in the mattress and spring from the guestroom, leaving them without a place for guests to sleep should there be any. However, Harry was fairly 
c
onfident that Hermione would not be turning up on his doorstep this year. Sirius was not staying with the Grangers during the holiday, as he had the previous summer, but Hermione had hinted broadly that another witch or wizard was going to be a guest and 
so she would have plenty of protection.
\par 
\par When he\rquote d finished putting his room in order again and it only smelled slightly damp, Harry collapsed on his new mattress without benefit of sheets, exhausted, asleep almost as soon as he put his glasses on the bedst
and and his head on the pillow. In one month he would be seventeen. He could make it, he told himself as he dozed off. He could. He would not hex his aunt and uncle\rquote s roof so that it leaked like a sieve the next time it rained....
\par 
\par But then that thought caused him to fall asleep with a broad smile on his face....
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par He was abruptly awoken by an odd whirring noise, it felt as though he\rquote d only been asleep for five minutes, but, judging by the sun in the east, it was already morning. When he\rquote d been assessing damage, he\rquote 
d taken some damp magical supplies out of his slightly-flooded trunk, including his Pocket Sneak-O-Scope, which he\rquote d left on his desk. He groaned. That stupid thing again. Normally he kept it in the bottom of the trunk stuffed i
n one of the crazy hand-knit socks Dobby the house-elf had given him, but he\rquote d thrown the damp socks out the window along with his mattress.
\par 
\par He groaned as the small metal ball continued whirring and clicking. He pulled on his running shorts and a clean sh
irt, tied his running shoes. What the hell was wrong with the thing? He went to the desk to examine it, glancing carelessly out the window at the milkman, who was making a delivery to a house two doors away. Except he wasn\rquote 
t. He had put down a plastic crate of dairy supplies and appeared to be holding a wand, pointing it at the door and saying something Harry couldn\rquote 
t hear. Without pausing for a second, he shoved the Sneak-O-Scope into the pocket of his shorts and sprinted down the steps and out the front door, racing to the neighbors\rquote  house by leaping over the intervening hedges.
\par 
\par In his rubber-soled shoes he\rquote d been fairly quiet, despite the fact that to him his breathing and heartbeat were deafeningly loud. The intruder was already in the house and didn\rquote t 
notice that he had been seen. When Harry reached the open doorway, he held out his hand and cried, \'93
Expelliarmus! just as the ersatz milkman was turning around. The startled man flew backward and hit his head on the wall, and a framed picture next to his head crashed to the floor, the glass shattering. The wand flew neatly into Harry\rquote 
s hand. He stared at it.  Bollocks. What now? The Sneak-O-Scope had stopped going mad, perhaps because the \'93Milkman\'94 was out cold. The wand was only seven inches, so Harry stuf
fed it into his sock. He ran back to his house, leaving the door to his neighbor\rquote s house open, the slumped man still on the floor, the plastic crate of dairy products growing warm on the front walk.
\par 
\par He picked up the telephone in the kitchen and struggled to remember Mrs. Figg\rquote 
s number for a moment; when he looked up and saw it on a slip of paper on the fridge door it was the first time in his life he felt like kissing his aunt. He dialed the number, tapping his toe impatiently, starting to wonder whether i
t would have been faster to just go to her house. At length, someone answered.
\par 
\par \'93Wha--?\'94 came a sleepy voice too deep to be Mrs. Figg\rquote s (But not by much).
\par 
\par \'93Malfoy, is that you? Listen, I\rquote ve got trouble over here. The milkman was breaking into the Nelsons\rquote  house with a wand. They\rquote re two doors away. I disarmed him and he\rquote s out cold and I\rquote ve got his wand. I don\rquote 
t know whether the Nelsons have woken up or not and I don\rquote t know where the real milkman is. Because this obviously isn\rquote t really our milkman. I mean, I know what the real milkman looks like--he\rquote 
s called Oscar or something like that--and this one looks just like him, but obviously it\rquote s a wizard who\rquote s taken his place, and I need Mrs. Figg to contact the Ministry and get people over here to do memory charms
 or something if the Nelsons wake up and wonder what\rquote s going on and also to figure out who this wizard really is and what he\rquote s done with Otto--wait, that\rquote s his name, it\rquote s Otto--and why he\rquote s done it....\'94
\par 
\par He paused for a moment, hearing only silence on the other end. \'93Malfoy? Are you still there?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Who is this?\'94
\par 
\par \'93What do you mean, who is this? It\rquote s Harry!\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, I\rquote m sorry, the Harry I know doesn\rquote t wake people up at dawn babbling incoherently about wizard milkmen...\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, evidently, the Harry you know does do that. Listen, will you just tell Mrs. Figg to call the Ministry and to get someone over here to find out what\rquote s going on?\'94
 he practically screamed into the phone, not caring whether he might wake his aunt and uncle. \'93This wizard could be a Death Eate
r for all we know. I mean, he was breaking into a house two doors away from where I live. Maybe he thought it was my house and he was just off by two. Maybe after taking on the form of the milkman he was going to take on the form of one of the Nelsons so 
he\rquote d live near me. Just tell Mrs. Figg!\'94
\par 
\par Before the other boy could answer, Harry slammed down the phone and went to his room, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his wardrobe, where he\rquote d hung it to dry. He put it on and examined himself in the mirror; the brief dampness hadn\rquote 
t hurt its effectiveness any, but it was giving off a faint odor of mildew now. He couldn\rquote t be bothered with worrying about that. He left the house again and walked to the Nelsons\rquote , the other wizard\rquote s wand still in his sock. He stepp
ed gingerly into the house, careful not to tread on the broken glass from the framed picture that had fallen. The wizard was starting to waken, rubbing his head, so Harry pulled the wand out of his sock and pointed it through the cloak, saying, \'93
Stupefy!\'94 
He had given up caring about doing magic outside of school. Let the Ministry come down on him for this, just let them try. At the very least, this man was breaking into a house, which was against muggle laws. Never mind what he might have done that was ag
ainst wizarding law.
\par 
\par The wait seemed interminable to Harry. He wondered why the Nelsons hadn\rquote t come downstairs when the body had struck the wall, but now he noticed that their car wasn\rquote t in the drive. They must be away. So--a fake milkman was pretending to
 make a delivery to an empty house. He must have known it was empty. At least the Nelsons were a worry he didn\rquote t have now....
\par 
\par He heard a siren in the distance, growing closer and closer, finally stopping in front of the house. Two constables from the Little Whinging police department emerged from the car and walked down the neat path to the front door. Harry withdrew into the do
orway to the dining room. Where the hell was Mrs. Figg and someone from the magical authorities?
\par 
\par The constables were very similar, brown-haired young men not much older than Harry, it seemed, who had probably been up all night and were waiting to go home when this happened.
\par 
\par \'93Scott,\'94 said one of them, \'93Where did she say the control panel is?\'94
\par 
\par The other one consulted a small notebook he withdrew from his pocket. \'93Um--next to the back door.\'94
\par 
\par The two officers walked right toward Harry, who neatly sidestepped them so they could pass through the dining room on the way to the kitchen. He followed them. The one who wasn\rquote 
t Scott went to an electronic control panel with flashing lights and punched in a code he read from the same small notebook. The flashing lights stilled and both young men breathed a sigh of relief.
\par 
\par \'93Well, that\rquote ll stop the alarm bell at the monitoring station. The girl there says this lot are on holiday for the next month. Called before they left. Silent alarm here in the house, luckily. The neighbors probably weren\rquote t disturbed. We
\rquote d better see about that bloke on the floor.\'94
\par 
\par The three of them went back to examine the milkman. The officers tried to get him to come round, with no success. Harry knew that no muggle method of rejuvenation would work. Only the Enervate counter-spell could waken a stunned person.
\par 
\par After they\rquote d been trying for what seemed to Harry several days, they gave up. \'93Dunno what\rquote s wrong wif\rquote im, Bert. Got a pulse, but not really doin\rquote  much breathin\rquote ....\'94
\par 
\par Bert picked up the hall phone and dialed. \'93Right. Ambulance...\'94
 He gave the address and hung up. In no time, the ambulance was pulling into the drive, and still neither Mrs. Figg nor Draco Malfoy had arrived, and no one from the Ministry of Magic either. The muggles were going to take him somewhere. Harry couldn
\rquote t decide whether that was good or bad. Good if Mrs. Figg or the other operatives could figure out where he was; bad if the Death Eaters figured it out first and went to retrieve him.
\par 
\par He watched, resigned, as they bore him outside. He slipped out the door with the police, practically tripping over the crate of milk bottles and eggs. The officers closed the door, then the one called Bert stared at it. \'93Family on holiday,\'94
 he mused, \'93Milkman breaks in, as though desperate to deliver his wares, he gets knocked silly and can\rquote t be brought round....\'94
\par 
\par His partner seemed less interested in actually working out what happened; he was trying to make sure they had all of their T\rquote s crossed and I\rquote s dotted. \'93We\rquote ll have to call the dairy. So\rquote s they know what\rquote 
s happened to their man. And what\rquote ll we do about the deliveries?\'94 Scott wanted to know. Bert stared at him.
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, there\rquote s all these people expecting their milk and eggs on their doorstep like always, and there\rquote s no one to do it today, is there? How are they to know what\rquote s happened? What will they think?\'94
\par 
\par Bert walked to the police car shaking his head, as though wondering how he\rquote d been stuck with this git for a partner. \'93What we do is get back to our own job. It\rquote s not our look out if someone can\rquote t do theirs because they\rquote 
re in hospital.\'94
\par 
\par \'93But we should at least call the dairy--\'94
\par 
\par \'93If you like. Fine. You call the dairy when we get back,\'94 he said, then stopped. \'93Wait,\'94 he said to his partner, clearly thinking hard. \'93Before they went on holiday, they called the alarm monitoring station to say they\rquote 
d be away. And is there a newspaper on the step?\'94 Harry, along with the partner, turned to look. \'93No there is not. They cancelled delivery, too, I\rquote ll wager, before leaving. So--if you\rquote 
re going on holiday, there are certain things you do. You cancel the newspaper, you call the alarm monitoring station, if you have an alarm, and--\'94 he said suggestively, prompting his partner. Scott looked blank, his eyes squinted as he worked ve
ry hard to think of what Bert was implying.
\par 
\par \'93Oh!\'94 he said finally. \'93You cancel the milk delivery!\'94
\par 
\par Bert nodded. \'93Precisely. So here we have someone who knew they were going on holiday, but apparently not that they had an alarm system, and he thought he\rquote d just let himself in and nick a few things while they were away...\'94
\par 
\par His partner nodded, clearly impressed by the mental prowess of the other man. \'93See, Bert, that\rquote s why you\rquote re gonna get that promotion. Now, me, I\rquote d be wond\rquote rin\rquote  who\rquote d knocked \lquote im out. \lquote Spe
cially since you\rquote d \lquote spect that person to hang \lquote round, seein\rquote  as \lquote e\rquote s a \lquote ero.\'94
\par 
\par Now Bert frowned, clearly not wanting to admit that his simple explanation of the milkman using his inside knowledge to choose an advantageous break-in time might be just a bit off. He sighed as he climbed behind the wheel. \'93Yes, well,\'94
 he heard him say awkwardly to Scott. \'93Happens all the time. You got to watch who you tell these things....\'94 Harry watched the ambulence and police car set off toward the village, worrying about th
e real Otto, who was now likely to be accused of breaking into the Nelsons\rquote  house. Where was Otto? he wondered. Then he had a bad feeling he knew.
\par 
\par The milk van was still parked near the entrance to the Nelsons\rquote  drive. Harry walked to it and took hold of t
he handle to the cooling compartment by grasping it through the fabric of the cloak. The door popped open abruptly, and Harry froze. The real Otto the Milkman, bound and gagged, was sitting in the back of his own van in nothing but his underwear. If he ha
d
 actually been aware of his surroundings, he would have been very surprised by the door of the compartment opening itself. But Otto had been stunned just as Harry had stunned the impostor, and no expression registered on his utterly blank face. Harry clos
ed the door again, but not all the way-- he didn\rquote t want Otto to suffocate. Who cared if the dairy products spoiled if there was a choice between that and keeping a man alive? A man who didn\rquote t know he\rquote 
d been framed for a break-in. Harry didn\rquote t dare revive him while he was in the back of his van. If he had known how to do a memory charm, that would be one thing, but he didn\rquote t. That was another thing underage wizards weren\rquote 
t allowed to do. Finally, he felt he couldn\rquote t wait any longer; he ran the best that he could while wearing the cloak, and when he reached Mrs. Figg\rquote 
s house, he pounded on the door impatiently. While he waited, he took off cloak and rolled it into a ball.
\par 
\par Just when he felt tempted to cast the Alohomora spell on the door, Malfoy flung it open. He was wearing his running clothes but still looked asleep on his feet.
\par 
\par \'93Bloody hell, Potter. I thought we were meeting at your house?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Bloody hell yourself. And I thought we were using first names now, Draco.\'94 Harry forced himself to do this; maybe it would remind him of his other life enough that he could manage to stop thinking of Draco Malfoy as the Git of the Year. \'93
And I thought you were going to tell Mrs. Figg to send someone over to the Nelsons\rquote  house,\'94 he added grumpily, stalking into the entrance hall and then through to the kitchen. He needed a drink of water before going running.
\par 
\par He found Mrs. Figg up unnaturally early, pouring herself some tea. She sat and pulled a slice of toast out of the toast rack, preparing to butter it. \'93Good morning, Harry. Did you enjoy waking us at an ungodly hour?\'94 was her acid greeting to him.

\par 
\par Harry sputtered. \'93Why didn\rquote t you send someone? I told Malfoy--er, Draco--that a wizard who made himself look like our milkman broke into my neighbors\rquote  house, and all I get are muggle police and a muggle ambulence!\'94
\par 
\par She calmly bit into her toast. \'93How do you know it was a muggle ambulance?\'94
\par 
\par Harry\rquote s mouth was open; he froze, unable to answer this question, then shut his mouth again before Draco started in on more jokes about solving the bug population explosion problem. \'93You--you mean--\'94
\par 
\par She nodded, her mouth full. She took a swig of tea and swallowed. \'93Those were ours. Operatives. And the ambulance has a strong memory charm on it, so in a little while, the police who were there won\rquote 
t have any recollection of the milkman nor his being taken away in an ambulance. You wouldn\rquote t remember it either, if I weren\rquote t telling you about it right now, after you\rquote re out of range of the spell. It doesn\rquote 
t discriminate between wizards and muggles. I\rquote ve also already seen to it that no one goes over there from the ambulance company they actually called.\'94 She looked up at him. \'93What? Just because I didn\rquote t do exactly as you said doesn
\rquote t mean I\rquote ve been sitting around idle. I don\rquote t take orders from a 
sixteen-year-old, thank you very much. I spoke to Albus and we worked out who to contact and what should be done. It was quick and discreet. What did you want us to do, send five Aurors in there in robes and pointed hats, waving their wands around? Or wou
ld you rather call out the dementors at times like this?\'94
\par 
\par Harry grimaced, feeling stupid. Truthfully, he\rquote d been completely fooled. He\rquote d had no idea it was wizards taking away the so-called milkman. He couldn\rquote 
t even recall their faces now, nor what the ambulance looked like....That must be the spell, he thought. Good one, that.
\par 
\par \'93So,\'94 he said, sitting at the kitchen table. \'93Will they question him?\'94
\par 
\par \'93In time. They\rquote ll take him to an infirmary we have in London and let him stew for a bit. Just answer questions related to his health, nothing about his legal status. Let him wonder. It\rquote s more likely he\rquote ll crack that way.\'94
\par 
\par Harry reached down and pulled the wand out of his sock. \'93This is his. He was using it to break into the house. After I disarmed him I, er, used it to stun him.\'94
\par 
\par She nodded, sipping her tea. \'93Don\rquote t worry about that. It\rquote s good we have his wand. It\rquote s evidence. And you\rquote re a witness, unfortunately, but hopefully it won\rquote t come to that. Fletcher\rquote s an exce
llent interrogator; gets us plenty of confessions. No one else comes close for it.\'94
 Harry suppressed an involuntary shudder, trying not to think about what interrogation methods Fletcher used to achieve his success. He remembered seeing Mundungus Fletcher 
in his own tartan, MacGregor, at the ceilidh in Hogsmeade, and he also remembered Arthur Weasley saying that he\rquote d inflated the damages he\rquote d experienced at the Quidditch World Cup (If, indeed, he\rquote 
d experienced any) all out of proportion. So, even though Fletcher was on their side, he obviously didn\rquote t feel that scrupulously sticking to the truth was an absolute necessity in all situations....
\par 
\par \'93The queer thing is,\'94 Harry said, \'93The Nelsons wouldn\rquote t normally be away at this time of year. She\rquote s usually getting 
ready to show her prize-winning roses right about now. They generally wait until August to go on holiday. So I wonder where they are?\'94
\par 
\par Mrs. Figg looked rather disgruntled. \'93Hmm. Not a good sign. I\rquote m starting to wonder whether I should let the two of you go out running before next Monday....every time you leave your house, Harry, you\rquote re vulnerable....\'94
 She tapped her fingers on the table, thinking, before continuing to speak.
\par 
\par \'93And for your information, I knew about someone breaking into the Nelsons\rquote  before
 you did. Years ago Albus disguised himself as a burglar alarm salesman to go round and sell units to everyone on Privet Drive and the houses behind you as well. Much lower prices than anyone else out there. It seemed a better idea to take advantage of mu
g
gle technology rather than having spells on every house. We have a monitoring station in an office in the village, upstairs from the stationers and across the corridor from a quite respectable solicitor. Nice girl works there during the day, muggle. She g
oes in every day and sits patiently in case there are any alarms. Young man handles the evening shift, old bloke who\rquote s retired and doesn\rquote 
t care for sleep much anymore handles the overnight. No witches or wizards ever go near the place and all of the equipment is muggle. There are no magical signatures anywhere. They\rquote 
ve been told that an office elsewhere handles the billing for the monitoring fees, which is how they\rquote re paid--except it\rquote s not, of course. One reason why no one on Privet Drive has ever changed to a different alarm company is that they
\rquote re never actually charged. Soon after each alarm was installed, there were problems with each of them and--as expected--each household threatened to change over to someone competent. Of course, we hastened to fix the
 problem and begged them not to change. \lquote We\rquote ll give you sixteen years free,\rquote 
 we said, and they all bought it. Of course, there are spells on your house, various types of complicated protection spells that only Albus knows about or understands, but we neede
d to safeguard against someone going after one of your neighbors in order to be close to you. And now we have to work out what happened to the Nelsons....\'94
\par 
\par \'93How will waiting for Monday to go running make a difference?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Because that\rquote s Draco\rquote s birthday, and once he\rquote s of age he\rquote ll be able to take his wand with him when he goes out. He can watch your back.\'94
\par 
\par Harry tried not to sputter. Draco Malfoy, his bodyguard. Oh, it was too humiliating. He put his hands into his pocket, miserable and glowering, and his right hand hit the Sneak-O-Scope. He took it out of his pocket and showed it to her.
\par 
\par \'93But look--I have a Pocket Sneak-O-Scope. It told me when the Nelsons\rquote  house was being broken into. We\rquote ll be fine.\'94
\par 
\par She looked dubious. Harry didn\rquote t want Draco Malfoy to be his babysitter until his own birthday rolled around. He\rquote d never hear the end of it. Especially from Draco Malfoy himself. He changed the subject subtly.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, there\rquote s another thing. The real milkman was stunned and stuffed into the back of his van. I opened the door a bit, to give him some air, but someone will have to revive him and put a memory charm on him. And the police still think he
\rquote s the one who broke into the house, so will that memory charm on the ambulance make them forget that, so they don\rquote t give him any trouble?\'94
\par 
\par \'93It should. Oh, by the way--what were you thinking, leaving the house carrying your wand?\'94
\par 
\par \'93What? I didn\rquote t leave the house carrying my wand.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Then how did you do the Disarming Charm?\'94
\par 
\par He shrugged. \'93I did it with my hand.\'94
\par 
\par She stopped and stared. \'93You did a Disarming Charm without a wand?\'94
 Harry remembered doing this to Lucius Malfoy when he was seven, in his other life. He tried not to smile as he remembered the wand floating up around the ceiling of the study, and the furious expression Draco\rquote s father wore.
\par 
\par \'93Er, yeah. I didn\rquote t really think about it, I just did it.\'94 There was an awkward silence as Mrs. Figg regarded him with what seemed a great deal of suspicion. \'93Er--so someone will take care of the milkman, yeah? Revive h
im and make sure the police don\rquote t come after him? Give him a nice Memory Charm so he doesn\rquote t remember being stuffed in his van?\'94
\par 
\par Mrs. Figg nodded. \'93I\rquote m on it,\'94 she said, draining her tea and rising. The dirty dishes flew into the sink and began to wash themselves. She calmly walked out of the kitchen without saying goodbye, and, to Harry\rquote 
s relief, without saying they couldn\rquote t go running.
\par 
\par When she was gone, Harry said, \'93What\rquote s the big deal? See how much wandless magic she does? Why\rquote d she look at me that way when I said I hadn\rquote t used a wand to disarm him?\'94
\par 
\par Malfoy sighed, reminding Harry of Bert sighing over Scott. \'93Potter--I mean, Harry--making the dishes fly around and wash and organize themselves is one thing. They were probably charmed ahead of time and 
now they do what she wants them to do. And that thing where she took away your mouth--easy trick, really. Disarming someone without a wand is something else. That\rquote s like--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--Being able to do the Animagus transfiguration?\'94 Harry said, raising one eyebrow. Malfoy grimaced.
\par 
\par \'93Yeah. Like that. I know, I know....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Listen, you can probably do this kind of thing too, you just haven\rquote t tried.\'94
\par 
\par \'93You mean because of that Obedience Charm?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Right. Maybe after your birthday you could find out more about what you can do.\'94
\par 
\par Draco Malfoy stood lost in thought, considering this. \'93Maybe. Could be interesting.\'94
\par 
\par They left through the back door, and after stretching, started to jog toward the park. Suddenly Harry stopped dead and Draco almost tripped.
\par 
\par \'93Potter! I mean, Harry!\'94 I mean--hell, what\rquote s wrong with you?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Damn!\'94 Harry answered. \'93I just remembered. I promised I\rquote d take the sodding dog with me.\'94
\par 
\par Draco Malfoy raised his eyebrows. \'93You have a dog?\'94
\par 
\par \'93It\rquote s really my aunt\rquote s. We have to go back to my house and get the stupid animal.\'94
\par 
\par Draco shrugged and they changed direction, heading back to Privet Drive. When they came in sight of the house, Harry noticed that the milk van was gone. He let them in the back door and Harry looked around for Dunkirk. Ma
lfoy turned in circles, staring around the kitchen. Since Mrs. Figg wasn\rquote t technically a muggle, Harry guessed this was the first real muggle house Draco Malfoy had been in.
\par 
\par Harry strode down the corridor toward the front of the house and found the dog lying on the mat before the front door. He emitted a low growl when he saw Harry. Harry backed up for a second. Malfoy passed him and said, \'93Hey, now, he\rquote 
s not so bad.\'94 As soon as Dunkirk saw Draco Malfoy, he started wagging his tail, then he sat and looked up at him expectantly. Malfoy knelt and petted the dog, scratching behind his ears as Dunkirk put his paws on Malfoy\rquote s legs. Harry couldn
\rquote t hide his surprise.
\par 
\par \'93He--he likes you! I don\rquote t believe it!\'94
\par 
\par Malfoy turned and made a face at him. \'93Hell, Harry, you don\rquote t have to be so complimentary. I don\rquote t frighten babies either.\'94
\par 
\par \'93No, it\rquote s just--he doesn\rquote t like anyone, aside from Aunt Petunia. Just growls at me and Uncle Vernon. He was saying that soon he\rquote s afraid the postman will refuse to come here, as Dunkirk keeps trying to take his leg off.\'94
\par 
\par Draco scratched the dog behind the ears. His tail was going like mad. Dunkirk was clearly very, very happy. Draco shrugged. \'93I\rquote ve always got on well with dogs. It\rquote s cats I can\rquote t stand, and they can\rquote t stand me. Dogs are b
rilliant. Give me a dog any day.\'94
\par 
\par Harry picked up Dunkirk\rquote s lead from the hall table. \'93Fine. You walk him then.\'94 Draco shrugged and took the lead from Harry, then leaned down to clip the end to Dunkirk\rquote s collar. Harry couldn\rquote t tell what he was saying as h
e did this, but it seemed to be sing-song endearments about what a fine dog Dunkirk was. This is just weird, Harry thought, and a side of Draco Malfoy that he found frankly disturbing.
\par 
\par \'93Who\rquote s there?\'94 came a shrill voice down the stairs. Harry groaned. His aunt appeared at the top of the stairs in her dressing gown. \'93First it was those sirens, now--\'94
 When she saw Draco she looked suddenly flustered and her cheeks became very pink. She walked down the stairs, her left hand on the rail, her right hand going nervously to her long neck. \'93Who--who is this?\'94
 she said, her voice cracking slightly. Harry looked back and forth between them. Oh, please, he thought. I just may retch.
\par 
\par \'93Er--\'94 Harry didn\rquote t know what to say. Draco smiled at her in what he probably thought was a charming, dashing manner and stepped forward with his hand out.
\par 
\par \'93You must be Harry\rquote s lovely aunt,\'94 he said smoothly, taking her hand gently in his. \'93Was his mother very much older than you? You must have been a girl when you became an auntie.\'94
\par 
\par Petunia\rquote s colour had gone from pink to fuchsia. \'93Well, actually, I\rquote m the older sis--I mean, yes,\'94 she fluttered. \'93I was rather a young auntie.\'94
 Harry opened his eyes wide and clamped his mouth shut. I will not say anything, I will not say anything...
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m Draco Malfoy. Mrs. Figg used to be my nanny and I\rquote 
m staying with her again for the summer holidays. I met Harry last year when he was also staying with Nanny Bella. My parents are having an architect do over Malfoy Manor right now, and there\rquote s plaster dust everywhere....\'94
\par 
\par She smiled broadly and batted her eyelashes. \'93Oh! Your nanny! Well. And Malfoy Manor, you say? Sounds lovely. Arabella never told me she worked for such distinguished people.\'94 Her voice was positively breathy. Harry was no longer disturb
ed by Dunkirk liking Draco Malfoy. He\rquote d sunk to a new all-time low when it came to being disturbed.
\par 
\par \'93Yes, well--we were going for a run and Harry said he promised to bring Dunkirk with us.\'94 He picked up the dog who enthusiastically licked his chin. Draco laughed. Harry made a face, but his aunt didn\rquote t notice; she didn\rquote 
t take her eyes from Draco Malfoy.
\par 
\par \'93He likes you!\'94 she said rapturously. \'93Well, of course, you know what they say--a dog is an excellent judge of character,\'94 she added, with a withering side
long glance at Harry, who had never fought harder in his life to not stick out his tongue.
\par 
\par \'93We really should be going,\'94 Harry said stiffly. Dunkirk turned in Draco\rquote s arms and gave him a low growl. His aunt laughed.
\par 
\par \'93Don\rquote t worry,\'94 Draco told her, without looking at Harry. \'93I\rquote ll be the one holding Dunkirk\rquote s lead. We\rquote ll give him a good run, down to the park and back.\'94
 He put Dunkirk down and put the loop on the end of the lead around his wrist, then opened the door. Harry couldn\rquote t help a guffaw escaping him as Draco was suddenly jerked forward by the excited little dog, who was surprisingly strong. \'93G
\rquote bye!\'94 he called awkwardly over his shoulder. Harry ran out the door, trying to catch up. His aunt could close the door, he reckoned. When he looked over his sho
ulder, though, she was watching Draco Malfoy run off with a dreamy expression on her face.
\par 
\par Eergh, was the only thought that came into Harry\rquote s head.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par When they finally reached the park, Draco collapsed onto the grass, and Dunkirk came to him for
 petting. He received some lackadaisical pats on the head, but Draco was clearly too winded to bother with more. The dog had pulled the blond boy along the whole way, running enthusastically toward the park. Draco had clearly found the pace a bit difficul
t, and Harry felt a bit smug; the pace felt about right to him. He didn\rquote t say anything about this, though, just kept up a steady pounding with his feet and ignored Draco\rquote s laboured huffing and puffing.
\par 
\par Dunkirk sat down next to Draco, his front paws together neatly, his tongue hanging out. If Harry didn\rquote t complete detest him, he might have found the terrier rather cute. Then he noticed that the large white tent was still up. He frowned. \'93That
\rquote s odd,\'94 he said, nodding toward the white cloth building that rather dominated the landscape. \'93They haven\rquote t taken the tent down.\'94
\par 
\par Draco looked now and shrugged. \'93Why should they?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, if you remember, there wasn\rquote t a tent permanently set up in the park last summer. I thought it was for a wedding, and that it would be gone by now.\'94
\par 
\par \'93What, do you own the park or something?\'94
\par 
\par \'93No, it\rquote s just that--\'94
\par 
\par Suddenly, the Pocket Sneak-O-Scope started going mad again, vibrating against his leg and making a whirring noise. Draco frowned. \'93What\rquote s that?\'94
\par 
\par \'93It\rquote s the Sneak-O---never mind,\'94
 he said quickly as a young woman came round the side of the tent, walking toward them. She was tall and slim, with long light hair and bright blue eyes that shone vividly out of her deeply tanned face. When she smiled she seeme
d to have more teeth than anyone else Harry had ever seen, and the legs below the hem of her very short skirt seemed abnormally long.
\par 
\par \'93Hello there!\'94 she said, grinning. \'93You\rquote re up early!\'94 She sounded either American or Australian to Harry, he couldn\rquote t decide which.
\par 
\par Draco brightened when he saw her, scrambling to his feet. She didn\rquote t seem sorry to see him either. First my aunt, he thought. Now this girl.... He glanced at Draco Malfoy, trying to see him objectively. His shoulders had broadened and the sturd
y arms protruding from his T-shirt showed part of the dragon tattoo he\rquote d gotten the previous summer. His legs were still pale from being hidden under robes, but they were also quite sturdy. His blond hair was longish, flopping over his brow.
\par 
\par Now the girl turned to Harry, and she saw more appreciation there. Well, he thought. At least I haven\rquote t got a girlfriend right now. It was odd; he\rquote 
d never really thought about this before. I could go out with other girls now, if I wanted. The trouble was, the only girl he really wanted to be with was taken. He looked sideways at Draco again, trying not to be resentful and failing.
\par 
\par \'93We were just out for a run with the dog,\'94 Draco informed her, picking up Dunkirk. She cooed at the Yorkshire terrier, who licked her hand i
n a friendly way. The Sneak-O-Scope continued to go mad, and Harry slipped his hand into his pocket, wrapping it around the noisy thing to muffle the sound.
\par 
\par It was too little too late. She looked around, frowning. \'93What\rquote s that sound?\'94 Draco looked at him with his eyebrows raised.
\par 
\par \'93Umm--it\rquote s my telephone,\'94 Harry said, taking his hand out of his pocket and patting the leg of his shorts. \'93It\rquote ll stop eventually.\'94
\par 
\par She frowned. \'93Aren\rquote t you going to answer it?\'94
\par 
\par He tried to look unconcerned. \'93Nah. I know who it is. I\rquote ll talk to them later.\'94
\par 
\par She turned back to Draco. \'93I\rquote m Grace. So, are you two coming tonight?\'94
\par 
\par They looked at each other in confusion. \'93What?\'94 Harry responded.
\par 
\par \'93Coming to hear Rodney. We had a fabulous turnout last night. Standing room only. And the things he did!\'94 she said rapturously. Draco looked at Harry for an explanation, but he didn\rquote t give him one.
\par 
\par \'93Er, probably not tonight,\'94 Harry answered. \'93But maybe before he leaves. So this is where he\rquote s been speaking?\'94 he asked, patting the tent lightly.
\par 
\par \'93Yes. It\rquote s nice to have a familiar setting everywhere we go. I\rquote 
ve been with the staff since last December. I was working at the American embassy in Paris, it was the dream of a lifetime, but a friend in London had me up to visit at Christmas, and we went to hear Rodney speak, and it changed my life....\'94
 She sighed and looked at Draco again, then Harry. Well, Harry thought, she\rquote s equal-opportunity. Then Harry had an idea.
\par 
\par \'93Too bad Ginny lives so far away, Draco,\'94 he said. \'93She might like to hear Rodney.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Who\rquote s Ginny?\'94 the girl asked.
\par 
\par \'93Oh--his girlfriend,\'94 Harry answered, looking pointedly at Draco, who was looking daggers at Harry.
\par 
\par \'93Girlfriend?\'94 Grace looked genuinely perplexed. \'93Oh--so--you\rquote re not a couple?\'94
\par 
\par Draco sputtered and practically dropped the dog. \'93Hell no!\'94 he cried, and Harry tried not to laugh, even as he was getting a very strong sense of d\'e9j\'e0
 vu; from his other life, when he and Draco were traveling south from Scotland. He had a sudden urge to drape his arm around the other boy\rquote s shoulders and go along. Draco would want to kill him if he did that. He didn\rquote t dare.
\par 
\par \'93No,\'94 Harry said, \'93We\rquote re just friends and co-workers,\'94 he added. \'93I\rquote ve recently broken up with my girlfriend.\'94
\par 
\par The girl\rquote s wrist beeped and she checked her watch. \'93Oh, crud. I\rquote ve got to go. Duty calls. Well, some other time, then.\'94 She started to go, then called over her shoulder to Draco, \'93Bring your girlfriend if you can!\'94
 before disappearing around the corner of the tent again.
\par 
\par As they jogged back toward Privet Drive, Draco asked Harry, \'93Who the hell is this Rodney?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Mrs. Figg gets the muggle papers. Check yesterday\rquote s. He\rquote s an inspirational speaker of some sort. But something bothered me about the way the article described him...\'94
 He reeled off the information for Draco about the man being healed of his burns on Bonfire Day.
\par 
\par \'93So--what? You think he\rquote s really a wizard?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Possibly. There are some muggles who can do mind-over-matter pretty well, but usually just for themselves. That\rquote s how you get people who are firewalkers and sleeping on beds of nails and things like that. Doing it for some
one else is unheard of, as far as I know. He\rquote s going to be here for a fortnight. Perhaps--well, perhaps we can come after your birthday and you can bring your wand....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Why bring my wand?\'94
\par 
\par \'93There\rquote s a spell I want you to cast in the tent after the show is over,\'94
 he said, remembering Angelina casting the Revelatio spell in the auditorium of the British Library after Hermione broke her cello. He could ask Mrs. Figg about any complexities he should know about before performing it. Maybe she had a book about it...

\par 
\par \'93What spell?\'94
\par 
\par \'93A spell for detecting recent magical signatures, whether wand magic or wandless magic. Then we\rquote ll know whether this Rodney Jeffries is a muggle or a wizard cashing in on doing magic tricks for crowds of people. What does 
the Ministry think about that sort of thing? I can\rquote t imagine they\rquote d condone it, or it would be a huge problem, if there were a slew of witches and wizards trying to make a living that way.\'94
\par 
\par Draco didn\rquote t answer; Dunkirk was pulling him forward and he looked like he was straining to keep up again. Harry was hardly breaking a sweat, and he shook his head, laughing silently as he handily passed both of them.
\par 
\par When they finally reached the Dursley house, Draco collapsed on the lawn, red-faced. Harry took the Sneak-O-Scope out of his pocket. It was humming a tiny bit, but not very loudly, and he put it away again.
\par 
\par After he\rquote d showered and dressed for work, Harry came down to eat breakfast. His aunt was pouring some tea for his uncle, who was reading the morning p
aper. When he said good morning to them, all he received was a grunt from his uncle, but his aunt was downright friendly, which was unnerving.
\par 
\par \'93So!\'94 she said as she sat down to her own breakfast, positively glowing. \'93How did Dunkirk like his exercise?\'94
\par 
\par Harry took a sip of orange juice and a piece of toast from the rack. \'93I suppose he liked it fine,\'94 he said while he opened the marmalade jar.
\par 
\par \'93That young man staying with Mrs. Figg seems very well-bred,\'94 she said, sipping her tea daintily and turning rather pink again. Her husband remained buried behind his paper.
\par 
\par \'93Eh?\'94 he said from its inky depths. She put down her cup on the saucer with an exasperated clatter.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, never mind,\'94 she practically snapped at him. Harry rolled his eyes. Good grief. Just what he needed in the last weeks before he could leave Privet Drive--Aunt Petunia having a mid-life crisis. Brilliant.
\par 
\par Suddenly there was a banging against the kitchen window and a frantic beating of wings. Without even looking, Harry recognized the sound of 
a post-owl trying to get to him. He dashed to the door and opened it, which was easier than the window, and the owl quickly figured it out and flew round. It landed on Harry\rquote 
s shoulder and he took the large creamy parchment envelope from its beak. As it fl
ew off again, Harry turned it over, seeing the green ink and the Hogwarts seal he had been expecting. When he returned to the breakfast table, he saw that Uncle Vernon, quivering, had put his newspaper over his head, and his Aunt was clutching Dunkirk to 
her chest while the little dog whined piteously. Their eyes were very round. Harry thought of the eagle owls that used to deliver Draco Malfoy\rquote 
s sweets packages, and the ominous falcons Lucius Malfoy had employed to deliver the Death Eater recruitment lette
rs. Dunkirk would probably have been considered a tasty snack by the large birds. Trying not to smirk, he sat, ignoring their predictable owl-terror, breaking the purple wax seal and taking the letter out of the envelope. He read it over quickly, not taki
ng much note of the names of the new prefects (He didn\rquote t really know many people in that year) but when he was done he looked up, grinning at his aunt and uncle, saying, \'93Well. It\rquote s official.\'94
\par 
\par They had gone back to eating their breakfasts and ignoring him.
\par 
\par \'93I said it\rquote s official,\'94 he repeated, very loudly and clearly.
\par 
\par Now his aunt looked up from her plate, muttering, \'93Oh, are you still here?\'94 Her eyes went back down again.
\par 
\par Harry frowned. They knew he had a letter from Hogwarts, and they were being more beastly than usual. They wouldn\rquote t care, he knew, but he had to say it anyway.
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m Head Boy.\'94
\par 
\par There, he\rquote d said it. And as per usual, when he said anything concerning Hogwarts, they behaved as though he didn\rquote 
t exist, sometimes going so far as to say things like, Petunia, dumpling, do you hear the wind blowing? Rather blustery and pointless, don\rquote t you think? while she simpered and responded, Yes, Vernon, utterly windy and useless.
\par 
\par Of course, they\rquote d spent the last fifteen-and-a-half years trying to forget he existed at all, so their present behavior was hardly surprising. He\rquote d known since the last prefects\rquote 
 meeting of the year that all of the other prefects had voted unanimously for him as Head Boy and Hermione as Head Girl, but seeing it on paper made it more real, somehow. It meant that the teachers hadn\rquote 
t overridden the choice of the other prefects (Not that that would be likely--in Harry\rquote s limited experience the teachers generally just rubber-stamped the students\rquote 
 choices). Well, he could tell Aberforth and Sam anyway. That would be something. He could even tell Nigel and Trevor, although of course, they would think he was Head Boy at a public school, having no idea that he was a wizard.
\par 
\par \'93Well,\'94 he said, carrying his plate and glass to the sink, giving up on them taking any notice of his Head Boy announcement. \'93I\rquote m off. Dick\rquote s picking me up at Mrs. Figg\rquote s. Draco\rquote 
s working for him too--you know, as a lark,\'94 he added, keeping up Draco\rquote s son-of-the-lord-of-the-manor act for no particular reason except it would be too complicated to reveal the truth to them. \'93He doesn\rquote t need the money, like I do,
\'94 he added, having succeeded for six years in keeping the secret of his gold-filled Gringott\rquote s vault. He wasn\rquote t about to let on to them now that he had a fairly large inheritance, mostly in solid-gold coins. He wasn\rquote 
t sure they actually cared how he\rquote d afforded school for the previous six years; maybe they thought Hogwarts had taken him on as a charity case. He also knew they\rquote 
d sooner stand in the middle of Trafalgar Square extolling the virtues of James and Lily Potter before they\rquote d admit to being curious about this, if in fact they were.
\par 
\par Now that he wasn\rquote t talking about Hogwarts, he suddenly existed again--for a purpose. Vernon put his paper down. \'93Now don\rquote t think you\rquote re going to go upstairs and be a layabout as soon as you get home. I\rquote 
m bringing the supplies and tools for the roof job today. You can get started after dinner. Plenty of daylight to work in still. First thing is to take off the old roof. And don\rquote t forget--after that you walk the dog again.\'94
\par 
\par Harry stopped at the door. \'93I hope you\rquote re bringing home a rather large ladder, because the one in the potting shed isn\rquote t nearly long enough. Unless you\rquote d like me to use my broom to fly up to the roof....\'94
 he added mischievously, slipping in a magic reference. His aunt and uncle both winced.
\par 
\par \'93Of course not! Don\rquote t be daft! Of course I\rquote ll bring a ladder. What do you take me for?\'94
\par 
\par Before he gave in to temptation and answered that question, he left, wondering whether he should suggest that he fly up under his own power, as a golden griffin, but they didn\rquote t yet know he could do this, and somehow he wasn\rquote 
t anxious to tell them. He walked to Mrs. Figg\rquote s house, whistling. Aberforth,
 looking again like his muggle persona of Dick Abernathy, was sitting in his car with Draco beside him, waiting for Harry. After Aberforth started the car again it was only a matter of minutes before they were on the motorway heading toward the estate whe
re they would be working for the next few weeks.
\par 
\par "Morning, Aber--um, Dick. I thought Sam was driving us..."
\par 
\par \'93Good morning, Harry! Change of plans. I had a few things to discuss with Arabella. I understand you\rquote ve had an exciting day already?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Rather too exciting.\'94 He nodded at Draco. \'93So you\rquote ve told him everything?\'94
\par 
\par \'93He has,\'94 Aberforth answered. \'93Arabella\rquote s going up to London to see about the fellow pretending to be your milkman. And Sirius is going to look into where the Nelsons have gone on their holiday. He\rquote 
s to go to the alarm monitoring office, pretending to be a supervisor from accounting, doing a spot check. We want to make sure there\rquote s been no foul play. It\rquote s possible someone simply gave them an offer they couldn\rquote t refuse.\'94
 Harry looked horrified, having seen too many American police procedurals concerning the Mafia. Aberforth could see his expression in the mirror, so he hastened to add, \'93
I just mean they might have been given the trip unexpectedly, like a prize in a contest they didn\rquote t know they\rquote d entered. We don\rquote t necessarily have to assume they\rquote ve been hurt at this point. We\rquote ll try to track them down.
\'94
\par 
\par Harry nodded. He sat back, suddenly quite tired; it was hard to believe that he now had a day of work ahead of him, when it already felt like he\rquote d been through a week of mayhem. Between the intruder at the Nelsons\rquote 
 and the information that Dumbledore had arranged years ago for muggle alarm systems to be in all of his neighbors\rquote  houses to the information that the tent in the park was for the travel
ing show that was Rodney Jeffries, who might or might not be a wizard....
\par 
\par He mentioned Jeffries to Aberforth, who frowned and said, \'93Who? Never heard of him. But then, I don\rquote t read the papers much. Mostly gardening journals and catalogues. There are some 
nice gardening programs on the muggle radio, too. And, of course, I haven\rquote t read the Daily Prophet for years. I suppose I\rquote m rather out of the loop of both muggle and wizarding news. Ask me about rose hybrids, though, and that\rquote 
s another story....\'94
\par 
\par \'93No thanks,\'94 Draco said with feeling. Harry knew he was just working for the money, not really being the son-of-the-lord-of-the-manor any more. He couldn\rquote 
t care less about actually learning anything during the summer. Harry frowned. He wished that he felt he could count on the Draco Malfoy in this life the same way he\rquote 
d counted on the Draco in his other life, but he just felt like that was a very bad idea. He put his hand in his pocket; the Sneak-O-Scope was still humming softly....
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par When they arr
ived at the estate, Harry was glad to see Sam Bell again, and Nigel and Trevor as well. They were unloading some shrubbery with burlap-wrapped roots from the truck, already working up a sweat. Then Harry noticed a fourth person with them wearing cut-off j
eans and a large, loose blue shirt and a cap with a bill turned round to the back. Then this person turned and Harry could have fallen over in shock.
\par 
\par \'93Katie!\'94
\par 
\par She smiled and gave him a hug. \'93Hello, Harry!\'94 she said, grinning. Her blue shirt was unbuttoned
 in front, revealing a rather tight white T- shirt. She took off her cap and wiped her brow, and Harry saw now that she had her short reddish-brown hair pulled back into a small ponytail that hadn\rquote t been visible when the cap had been on backwards.

\par 
\par \'93What are you doing here?\'94
\par 
\par She reached up and patted Sam on the back. \'93Thought I\rquote d spend some time with my old dad before deciding what I want to be when I grow up,\'94 she answered, grinning. Harry noticed that Trevor and Nigel were giving Katie very appreciative 
looks, which earned them a withering glare from Sam. Oh, this was going to be interesting. Then he saw that Draco Malfoy was looking at Katie as though he\rquote d never seen her before either.
\par 
\par \'93Hello there,\'94 he said, giving her a lopsided smile. Harry frowned. All right, he thought, how many times a day am I going to have to remind him that Ginny is his girlfriend? Even though he\rquote 
d thought it would be nice if Draco were more like the friend he\rquote d had for years in his other life, he didn\rquote t want him to be like this, like the Don-Juan-of-Hogwarts. This was why he\rquote 
d been so nervous about Jamie becoming his girlfriend....
\par 
\par But Katie was a smart girl, he remembered, and she proved it now. \'93So--how\rquote s Ginny?\'94 she asked him brightly, giving Harry a merry sidelong glance. H
arry resisted the urge to laugh. Unlike the American girl, Grace, Draco was now dealing with someone who knew Ginny was his girlfriend, who had lived in the same house, was at prefects\rquote 
 meetings with the pair of them and played on the same Quidditch team as Ginny.
\par 
\par Draco shook himself. \'93Who?\'94 he said. Harry put his elbow in his ribs. \'93Oh! Ginny\rquote s fine, thanks,\'94
 he recovered, tearing his eyes away from her legs and looking in her face now. He rubbed his ribs and glared at Harry, who was exchanging a knowing 
look with Katie again. They got to work moving the shrubbery, laying it out according to the plan Aberforth had placed on the bonnet of his car, the corners held down with small stones. Harry found that Katie was a no-nonsense worker, much as she had been
 when playing Quidditch. She wore heavy tan workboots like the others and although she sometimes showed some strain when lifting something heavy, she never complained.
\par 
\par The next step was digging the holes for all of the new plants, and she was a little slower than the others, but Harry remembered that he\rquote d been the same way when he started. It wasn\rquote 
t because she was a girl--woman, he reminded himself--it was just that she wasn\rquote t used to the work. As the day went on, Harry was able to look at her at close ran
ge, which he never really did at Hogwarts, and he saw the physical resemblance to her father, including the way she would raise her right eyebrow when she looked like she wanted to make an acid remark about something and was restraining herself.
\par 
\par Aberforth
 had Harry and Katie working together; while Sam worked with Nigel and Draco with Trevor. This seemed deliberate to Harry. While they were eating lunch, Sam admitted this to him. Katie had gone to the large manor house with Aberforth to put some rubbish i
n the dust bins, and Sam leaned in to Harry, saying, \'93I\rquote m glad you\rquote re here, Harry. During the Easter holiday Kate started working with us, and I thought I was going to have to lay out one or both of my mates,\'94
 he said, jerking his head at Nigel and Trevor. \'93Couldn\rquote t keep their eyes in their heads.\'94
\par 
\par Harry smiled. \'93The hazards of having a pretty daughter, I guess.\'94
\par 
\par Sam nodded and also smiled, admitting this. \'93I know. But those two are a bit old for her, in my opinion. Plus,\'94 and he dropped his voice further, \'93They don\rquote t know I\rquote m a wizard and she\rquote 
s a witch. Once, years ago, Nige saw Dick do--something--which would have given him away, but a quick memory charm took care of that, and he\rquote s been more careful since then. Me too. I don\rquote t even bring my wand to work. I\rquote 
m pretty careful about it, you know? First thing I did after I got out was go to Ollivander\rquote s for a new one, and I don\rquote t take that privilege lightly.\'94
 Harry nodded; he knew that was something that was very important to Sirius, too. He probably had a new wand by now.
\par 
\par Katie walked back toward them with Aberforth and Harry felt his spirits lift, watching her. She was one of the girls who had been placed under Imperius by Lucius Malfoy, and although she had asked him to dance at the Christmas party she\rquote d thr
own at her great-aunt\rquote s house in Hogsmeade, she\rquote d been smitten with Lee Jordan at the time and as a result, she was somewhat more resistant to the curse\rquote 
s influence than the other girls had been. He remembered the previous Christmas, Lee\rquote s family trying to play matchmaker for him when they\rquote d all been at Hog\rquote 
s End for the holiday. Katie had seemed a bit cut off from the Quidditch crowd after their breakup the previous year, he recalled. Lee and the twins were still inseparable, and that meant Angelina too, p
lus Alicia was working in the village and still saw her old crowd quite a lot. But Katie was still in school, finishing her seventh year. Harry realized that during the previous few terms he had seen her for the first time spending free periods with the o
ther students in her year. From the time in second year when she\rquote 
d started playing Quidditch until her sixth year, her companions were usually her fellow Quidditch players. Sometimes that happened; a large group of friends would start to pair off, and then 
when a couple broke up, one of the pair would suddenly be on the outside looking in, no longer part of the group. His heart went out to her, wondering not for the first time what would happen between him and Ron and Hermione, whether they\rquote 
d ever be able to get their old comfortable friendship back after all that had happened.
\par 
\par When Katie was near him again, though, he just smiled at her and they went back to work. A few minutes later, Harry happened to look up and see Sam\rquote 
s face, it definitely seemed that Sam was smiling on the two of them. Is he trying to be a matchmaker? Harry wondered. If so, he wasn\rquote 
t sure he minded. Katie was nice and uncomplicated. He could do worse than go on a few dates with Katie, possibly feel a little like a normal teenage boy for once.
\par 
\par When he was lying back on the lawn sunning himself after lunch, he thought he caught Katie looking at him once, and lay back again, fighting a smile breaking out on his face. He glanced at Draco Malfoy, lying nearby with his shirt off too, but she wasn
\rquote t looking at him. Then Harry did a double-take. Draco wasn\rquote t wearing the basilisk amulet. Harry laid back again and closed his eyes. What had he done with the pair of amulets? he wondered.
\par 
\par When Aberforth was driving
 him and Draco home, Harry felt like every bone in his body ached, his muscles unused to the hard work again. He knew that would go away, but the first day was always rather hard on him. And now he had to rip off a roof. When he mentioned this in passing 
to Aberforth, the old man turned to Draco and said, \'93We\rquote ll help you out, won\rquote t we Draco? And I\rquote ll call the lads--they\rquote ll be happy to pitch in.\'94
\par 
\par \'93No--wait--I didn\rquote t mean--\'94 Harry tried to say, embarrassed that Aberforth might think he was fishing for help w
hen he was merely grousing about his uncle taking advantage of him. But by the time Aberforth had put away his telephone, it was too late. Only a few minutes after they arrived at number four, Privet Drive, Sam and Katie pulled up in Sam\rquote 
s old Volkswagen and Nigel and Trevor parked behind them in an ancient van which had a ghost of \'93Williams Plumbing and Heating\'94 on the side in faded white lettering. Harry couldn\rquote t help a smile creeping across his face. He couldn\rquote 
t quite believe that after the same sort of long day of work he\rquote d done, they were willing to come help him, all because his uncle was the cheapest person on the planet.
\par 
\par Uncle Vernon had already set up the ladder against the side of the house. Nigel climbed up and happened to have his face right at the bathroom window when Harry\rquote 
s aunt was evidently using the commode, and her scream almost sent Nigel tumbling to the ground. This brought Vernon out the back door, screaming in turn at Nigel.
\par 
\par \'93Here now, what the hell do you think you\rquote re about, peeping at my wife while she\rquote s doing private things in the privacy of her private bathroom? Never hear of privacy? And who the hell are you lot?\'94
\par 
\par Aberforth walked up to Vernon Dursley and held out his hand. \'93Ah! Mr. Dursley. How nice to see you again,\'94 he said, as though Harry\rquote s uncle hadn\rquote 
t just been yelling at them very crossly. He shook his hand while Uncle Vernon frowned at Aberforth, as though mystified about why he should know this person. Aberforth saw this. \'93Dick. Dick Abernathy. Abernathy Landscaping.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh!\'94 Harry\rquote s uncle responded, finally remembering. \'93Right, right.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Anyway, Harry told us about his little roofing problem. Seems he has a leak right over his bed, yeah? We told him we\rquote d pitch in. We don\rquote t mind, do we, lads?\'94
\par 
\par They answered with a chorus of nahs as they moved about, getting the various tools needed for ripping off the old roof. Harry smiled at Katie; she didn\rquote t seem to mind being lumped in with \'93The lads.\'94
 Her hat was on backwards again and now her blue shirt was buttoned, which hid her body almost as effectively as a Hogwarts robe; it was possible that Vernon hadn\rquote t noticed that she was female.
\par 
\par Harry\rquote s uncle looked like he would have liked nothing better than to require Harry to do the job alone, but in that Harry had absolutely no experi
ence, he looked like he also was hoping that this would mean someone who actually knew what they were doing might be working on the roof. And for free. Which was Vernon\rquote 
s favourite price for anything. So he held his tongue and started to go into the house.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, and guv,\'94 Trevor called to him, \'93We\rquote ll need a coupla stouts each fer when we\rquote re done. It\rquote s firsty work, yeah? Fanks,\'94
 he called, turning back to his work. Harry wondered what Vernon would do, hearing that, and to his surprise, he returned to his car and drove away. Was he actually going to buy the stout? Harry wondered.
\par 
\par He didn\rquote t have long to wonder, however, for soon he was up on the roof with the others, using a crowbar to rip out the nails holding on the old shingles. Harry shook his head over hi
s good fortune as he worked. He worried for Katie sometimes, but she walked about on the roof calmly, not in the least afraid of heights, and he remembered some of the daredevil things she would do while playing Chaser and stopped worrying. As long as she
 wasn\rquote t nervous, he wouldn\rquote t worry about it.
\par 
\par Vernon pulled up in the car again with the stout just as they were all climbing down to the ground, the sun disappearing behind the low skyline of the village houses and the church where Dudley\rquote s funeral had bee
n held. Vernon looked up at the roof, nodded at them all, and went into the house without a word.
\par 
\par Nigel and Trevor took their bottles and waved, getting into their van and driving off, and the others moved to leave as well. Draco reached for a bottle of stout, but Aberforth got there first, taking it out of his reach, his eyebrows raised. Harry bade t
hem all goodnight and went into the house, ready for a hot shower and some food before taking Dunkirk out for his evening constitutional. He didn\rquote t care what anyone said; independence was all very well, but good friends were absolutely priceless.

\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par Over the next few days the pattern was repeated; work all day, work on the roof as a team until it was too dark to see. It seemed ironic to Harry that they spent all day on the ground (Sometimes literally in the ground) planting green things, and then sp
ent the evening in the air, far from the earth. Trevor had attached a small evergreen bough he'd brought from their landscaping job and nailed it to the front gable of the house. When Vernon Dursley had demanded to know why this was, Trevor told him, "Wel
l
, we're not building a new roof, strictly speakin', but it never 'urts to do that. Appease the spririts of the wood. A little sympathetic magic. Me dad was a carpenter, always did that when he put on a new roof." Harry thought his uncle was going to explo
de when he heard the word "Magic" and Harry ducked behind Sam.
\par 
\par Although the roof wasn\rquote t done yet, on Thursday, Aberforth informed Vernon that none of them would be working on the roof on Friday night. \'93End of the week, see? The lads want a night out, yeah?\'94
 Vernon nodded, handing him a bottle of stout, which Aberforth didn\rquote 
t drink, but tucked into the boot of the car. Harry understood that this made sense, but he was just a little depressed at the thought of working on the roof by himself the next evening.
\par 
\par Sam put his arm around Harry\rquote s shoulder then, saying, \'93And Harry has a date with Kate, so he can\rquote t work on it either,\'94
 he said to Vernon Dursley, who opened his eyes wide, turning to look at Katie Bell. By now he was aware of the fact that Katie was \'93One of the lads\'94 and also Sam\rquote s daughter.
\par 
\par \'93You\rquote re going to let him go out with your daughter?\'94 he said incredulously, pointing at Harry and wearing the sort of expression he bore when anyone suggested he might someday vote for a member of the Labour Party.
\par 
\par \'93Certainly. Harry\rquote s a fine young man,\'94
 he said, patting Harry on the back rather hard, almost making his glasses fly off. Harry pushed the frames up his nose and resisted the urge to wince. When Vernon was out of range, he turned to the older man.
\par 
\par \'93What--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, that was just to get him off your back, so you\rquote re not up there working alone tomorrow. But as long as we\rquote re throwing it around as an idea....why not? You two don\rquote 
t want to hang about in a pub with a bunch of old men, do you? You\rquote re young. Go out. See a film. Have a nice dinner. Do something other than work for once.\'94
\par 
\par Harry and Katie looked at each other uncertainly. Even if they had felt compelled to pursue each other during the summer, as their work situation offered ample opportunity for them to g
et to know each other better, somehow it felt strange for her father to be engineering everything.
\par 
\par \'93Er--\'94 Harry said. She shrugged.
\par 
\par \'93Want to go up to London?\'94 she asked, no-nonsense. He nodded, looking at Sam out of the corner of his eye.
\par 
\par \'93All right.\'94
\par 
\par Sam pulled both of them into a hug. \'93My daughter\rquote s going to be going out with Harry Potter!\'94 he declared before letting them go, walking to his car and shaking his head in wonder. Harry and Katie looked after him, each bright red.
\par 
\par \'93Sorry about that,\'94 she mumbled. Harry tried to smile at her reassuringly.
\par 
\par \'93Don\rquote t worry about it. But--this does feel a little--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--Awkward?\'94 He nodded. \'93And weird? And--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--I mean, we\rquote ve known each other for--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--Six years. And we\rquote ve just been--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--Friends. Acquaintances, really.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Right.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Right.\'94
\par 
\par They stood looking at each other uneasily.
\par 
\par \'93Well, then,\'94 Katie said finally, \'93We\rquote ll just go out as friends. A night off. And--and we can get to know each other better. The question is--how do we keep Dad from getting his hopes up? I mean, I feel rather stupid saying this, but--I
\rquote m not really over Lee yet. I know I\rquote m an idiot, that it\rquote s been over six months--\'94
\par 
\par Harry put his hand on her arm. \'93You\rquote re not an idiot. At least you had a relationship with Lee. I\rquote ve been obsessing over a girl I wasn\rquote t even--\'94 he started to say, then clamped his mouth shut.
\par 
\par \'93What? I thought--I thought you and Hermione--\'94
\par 
\par Harry grimaced. \'93I should have ended it with her months and months ago. I\rquote ve been focussed on someone else for a long time now. Trouble is, she\rquote s someone else\rquote s girlfriend and there\rquote s absolutely no hope, but I can\rquote 
t seem to stop thinking about her anyway.\'94
\par 
\par Katie sighed. \'93We\rquote re pathetic, in other words, both of us. Well, I suppose there\rquote s nothing for it but to go out tomorrow and commiserate with each other.\'94 She smiled at him. \'93I\rquote 
ve half a mind to make Dad think things are getting very serious between us very fast, just to teach him a lesson about matchmaking....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, no you don\rquote t,\'94 Harry said quickly, stepping away from her. \'93I have to work with your dad every day. I don\rquote t want him trying to kill me. We\rquote ll go out as friends and let him know in no uncertain terms that that\rquote 
s how it is.\'94
\par 
\par Katie smiled at him. \'93I didn\rquote t know you couldn\rquote t take a joke, Harry. Then again, perhaps I spent too much time with the twins over the years....\'94
\par 
\par Harry laughed as she said goodbye. After work the following day, Sam got into Aberforth\rquote s car instead of Harry, while Katie drove Harry to Privet Drive so h
e could shower and change. When he emerged from the house in clean tan trousers and a crisp white shirt open at the neck, smelling of soap, she smiled at him.
\par 
\par \'93You clean up very nicely, Mr. Potter.\'94
\par 
\par He smiled back at her, wondering whether they would really be going out as \'93Just friends.\'94 It didn\rquote t take them long to reach her father\rquote 
s flat, on the outskirts of London, and he waited in the lounge while she did her showering and dressing. He flipped through television channels aimlessly, then started when he heard something familiar. Going back to the channel he\rquote 
d just been on, he heard a news announcer saying:
\par 
\par \'93And that\rquote s all from Little Whinging, Surrey, where Rodney Jeffries has evidently again performed what could only be called a miracle. There will be another opportunity to come hear Mr. Jeffries speak this evening at seven o\rquote clock. Don
\rquote t miss it!\'94
\par 
\par Standing next to the perky young dark-haired woman who\rquote d been speaking was a handsome man who appeared to be in his late twenties. He had curling brown hai
r, blue eyes, a deep tan and a dazzling smile. The American girl, Grace was standing nearby, looking awed and amazed by her luck, and an elderly man was standing next to a wheelchair, which appeared to belong to him, except for the fact that he no longer 
seemed to need it. A commercial started then, and Harry turned off the television before the jingle that the dancing tin of fruit was singing became embedded in his brain for a month.
\par 
\par Soon after, Katie emerged from the corridor leading to the bedrooms and 
bathroom, looking fresh as a daisy. She wore her soft brown hair down on her shoulders instead of pulled back, as she did at work. Her hazel eyes shone in her work-tanned face and she wore a simple pink shirtdress that buttoned down the front with simple 
strappy sandals that matched her purse.
\par 
\par \'93We should be off! The film starts at nine, so we have time to have a nice meal first.\'94 Harry started to walk to the door, but Katie seemed to be moving away from it. \'93Where are you going, Harry?\'94
\par 
\par He frowned. \'93Where are you going?\'94
\par 
\par \'93To the fireplace. It\rquote s faster if we Floo to the Leaky Cauldron, and then we can just catch a taxicab to the cinema. I don\rquote t want to take the car into London proper. I\rquote ll drive you home again, don\rquote t worry.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh--I didn\rquote t realize--I\rquote m not used to just being able to Floo whenever I like.\'94
\par 
\par She smiled. \'93Dad just had the flat added to the Network when he found out I was staying the summer. He doesn\rquote t normally like the idea of just anyone being able to come into his place. He\rquote s got anti-Apparition wards on the flat as well.
\'94
\par 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93I suppose he has as much reason as anyone not to want too much contact with the wizarding world.\'94
\par 
\par Katie looked down and away. \'93So you know about all that, do you?\'94
\par 
\par Harry nodded. \'93He told me and Draco about it last year. I\rquote m--I\rquote m so sorry about your mum, Katie.\'94
\par 
\par She looked up again and nodded, looking brisk once more. \'93Well. We should be going.\'94
\par 
\par They stepped into the fireplace one at a time and soon Harry found himself in the Leaky Cauldron on a Friday night. It was full of wizards getting drunk at the bar, running poor old Tom ragged. Harry winced at the noise.
\par 
\par \'93We can go eat in one of the dining rooms,\'94
 Katie hollered above the racket, and Harry nodded, following her down the corridor. They entered a small dining room where two other tables were already occupied by diners. They looked up casually when Harry and Katie entered, then did a double-t
ake when they saw the scar on his forehead, their heads swiveling now as they followed Harry\rquote s and Katie\rquote s progress across the room to the table of their choice. Harry felt himself redden. He just hoped no press were present, so this wouldn
\rquote t wind up in the Daily Prophet or Witch Weekly. He wasn\rquote t even seventeen yet.
\par 
\par They sat and Harry turned to glare back at the rubber-neckers, who promptly pretended to have been staring at the very interesting wallpaper on the wall behind Harry\rquote s head. He and Katie picke
d up their menus, stifling their laughter, and when they both decided upon roast beef and Yorkshire pudding, they placed their orders with their plates, which soon after produced the food. Harry couldn\rquote 
t help noticing that Katie had a very healthy appetite. But then, she\rquote 
d been working as hard as he had all week. And yet, her hands looked pretty and dainty and clean as they grasped her knife and fork, and he smiled when he noticed the scattered freckles the sun had brought out on her nose. She looked up and met his eye.

\par 
\par \'93Were you staring at me, Harry Potter?\'94 she said in that straightforward way she had. He decided not to be defensive.
\par 
\par \'93Yes, Kathryn Bell, I was. Is that a problem?\'94
\par 
\par She couldn\rquote t keep up the imperious act. She blushed and went back to cutting her meat. \'93No,\'94 she mumbled. \'93It isn\rquote t.\'94
\par 
\par Harry smiled. Barring the stares from the other diners, he felt so--so normal. He was out on a Friday night with a pretty girl whom he liked, having a nice dinner, planning to go to the cinema. He felt a bit like he was waiting for the other shoe to drop.

\par 
\par After their meal, they sat dranking tea and eating some ice cream. They still had a little time before the film started. \'93So,\'94 he said to her, \'93You still don\rquote t know what you want to do for a living?\'94
\par 
\par She sighed and shook her head. \'93No idea. I was actually thinking of training to be an Auror for a while, like Dad, but well...he didn\rquote t like the idea. He said I\rquote m too young.\'94
\par 
\par \'93My mum trained to be an Auror right out of school. Your dad worked with her, in fact.\'94
\par 
\par She nodded. \'93I know,\'94 she said softly.
\par 
\par They were quiet for a while. Then Harry said, \'93It\rquote s okay, you know. To mention my parents. I am capable of talking about them. Do you--do you dislike talking about your mother?\'94
\par 
\par She looked up, startled. \'93Wouldn\rquote t you be if your mum did something awful and just because your dad was trying to stop her he had to give up ten years of his life? And I had to give him up too--and her. I\rquote 
ll never get those years back. I went through my childhood with no parents, and it shouldn\rquote t have happened. I know I shouldn\rquote t be complaining about this to you, of all people, Harry, but still--it seems dreadfully unfair...\'94
\par 
\par Harry put his hand over hers on the table. \'93Of course it\rquote s unfair. And just because I was orphaned--well, it doesn\rquote t make what happened to you and your family all right. Why can\rquote 
t you feel resentful about all that? If anyone has a perfect right, you do. But--remember. Your mum was under Imperius. She didn\rquote t want--\'94 his voice caught; he thought of his own mother, her wand pointing at Ron Weasley. \'93She didn\rquote 
t want to hurt you--\'94 He had to stop talking; his throat felt very tight.
\par 
\par Katie nodded. \'93I know,\'94 she said softly. Then she looked up and swiped at a single tear with an irritated expression. \'93It shouldn\rquote t be paralyzing me, it shouldn\rquote 
t be. But I keep thinking that this is a decision which will affect the rest of my life, it shouldn\rquote t be made lightly...\'94
\par 
\par \'93What about Quidditch? You were always a good Chaser.\'94
\par 
\par She grimaced. \'93Not good enough. Really--if I tried out for the worst team in the league, they\rquote d laugh me out of the stadium. Quidditch just never mattered enough to me. I enjoyed it and I wasn\rquote t bad for a student player, but I couldn
\rquote t see doing it for a living. I mean, I\rquote m certainly no James Potter when it comes to Chasing--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Don\rquote t be silly. You were a part of our winning the Quidditch Cup as much as anyone else--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Your dad didn\rquote t just win the Hogwarts Quidditch Cup.\'94 She looked at him shrewdly. \'93You--do you mean you don\rquote t know?\'94
\par 
\par Harry looked around, then back at her. \'93Know what?\'94
\par 
\par She smiled slyly. \'93I\rquote ll show you on the way out.\'94
\par 
\par They paid their bill at the bar, and then made their way toward the door that led to muggle London. Before they got there, however, Katie steered him to the wall where the pictures 
of various English Quidditch teams hung. She pointed at one which was labeled 1978. \'93
They actually went to the World Cup, and should have won, but the Seeker had an injury and they had to go with a reserve. They had a brilliant young Chaser that year, fresh out of Hogwarts.\'94
 He frowned at her merry smile, then leaned in and looked at the photograph,  really looked.
\par 
\par There in the middle of the back row was his father, James Potter.
\par 
\par He had played Quidditch for England.
\par 
\par \'93It was apparently all over the sports pages of the Daily Prophet that James Potter was going to help England win the World Cup. When they didn\rquote t, everyone started talking about eighty-two, except--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--Except my dad was killed in October of eighty-one,\'94 he said softly, watching the tall young man with the messy hair and glasses smile from the back row, jostling good-naturedly with his teammates. Katie nodded.
\par 
\par \'93He wasn\rquote t an unemployed bum,\'94 he said suddenly, fiercely, to the photograph, remembering Vernon\rquote s sister Marge.
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94 Katie was very confused.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, nothing. It\rquote s just--thanks. Thanks for showing me.\'94
\par 
\par She shrugged. \'93I can\rquote t believe you didn\rquote t know. I think everyone just assumed you did.\'94 Harry remembered then the way Hermione had stopped and stared at one of the Quidditch photographs when he\rquote 
d brought her to the Leaky Cauldron after telling her she was a witch. He\rquote d thought that she was just amazed by the people moving in the photographs;
 what must have caught her eye was the image of the young man who bore such a striking resemblance to Harry....
\par 
\par They went to the cinema and sat in the dark together while advertisements played for other films and for the sweets and other food available in
 the lobby, and Harry draped his hand casually on the back of her chair as they watched these things. Then, when the film started, one of the first things they saw was a young woman walking nude across the screen, far larger than life, while her boyfriend
 lay in bed still, evidently used to seeing her parade around like this. Harry turned to glance at Katie surreptitiously, but she was still looking at the screen, the flickering light reflecting eerily on her skin.
\par 
\par As the film went on, his hand had shifted
 to her shoulder and somehow her head came to be resting on his shoulder. Cars collided, people shot one another and the naked young woman walked around her flat sensuously, sometimes partially clothed, sometimes not, usually ready to jump into bed with h
er boyfriend at a moment\rquote s notice....
\par 
\par Harry was having trouble remembering who was with the police and who was with the criminals. The American accents and slang were sometimes a little confusing. And then the young woman would walk across the screen again with nothing on, distracting him....

\par 
\par He looked down at Katie after one of these times and found her looking up at him. It seemed perfectly natural to lean down and brush his lips again hers. He felt an equal pressure from her. That\rquote s all they did; their 
mouths parted and they continued watching the film, which evidentally required a large portion of Los Angeles to be blown up or burned and a number of people to be shot or stabbed.
\par 
\par Harry was getting tired of the film, and when a huge yawn overwhelmed him, Katie whispered to him, \'93We can go if you like.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Are you sure?\'94
\par 
\par She nodded. \'93This is getting pretty tedious.\'94 So they crept from the dark auditorium, trying not to block anyone else\rquote s view, (Some people complained anyway) and soon they were back in the
 Leaky Cauldron stepping into the fireplace. When they emerged in Sam and Katie\rquote s flat, they found him sitting in a chair reading a book, enjoying a cup of tea and a cigarette.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, hello! You\rquote re back early. Everything all right?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Fine. We\rquote re both just knackered from working all day,\'94 Katie told him, kissing him on the forehead. \'93I\rquote m going to drive Harry home. Shouldn\rquote t be long.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Are you sure?\'94
\par 
\par Katie rolled her eyes at her matchmaking father. \'93Quite.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Um--goodnight, Sam,\'94 Harry said awkwardly, unprepared for how uncomfortable he felt about taking his friend\rquote s daughter on a date.
\par 
\par When they were in the corridor, Katie slumped against the door. \'93Sorry about that, Harry. He\rquote s just--\'94
\par 
\par \'93A father whose daughter is on a date with Harry Potter. I know, I know,\'94 he answered, smiling. She grinned.
\par 
\par \'93You\rquote d think by now he\rquote d realize that you\rquote re just a regular person,\'94 she said, shaking her head. Although he was very tired, he couldn\rquote t help think
ing how pretty she was as she stood there, her gleaming hair swinging around her face, and he suddenly bent down and touched her lips with his. She was caught unawares, but after a moment she relaxed and let her mouth drop open a little, running her hands
 up to clasp his neck. Harry was pleasantly surprised as the kiss deepened, but then he found himself reminded of something--kissing Hermione by her car in Godric\rquote 
s Hollow. That had been a nice kiss, like this one. Something about being with Katie felt very familiar, very safe. And yet, something was also very wrong...
\par 
\par He separated from her, pressing his lips to her forehead. \'93I\rquote m sorry, Katie. I thought--\'94
\par 
\par \'93You thought you could get yourself to forget the other girl?\'94 He nodded, ashamed. \'93It\rquote s all right, Harry. Do you mind--do you mind if I ask you if it\rquote s Ginny Weasley?\'94
\par 
\par His jaw dropped. \'93How\rquote d you know?\'94
\par 
\par She laughed. \'93Well, you said it isn\rquote t Hermione, so I thought about other girls in Gryffindor--since that seemed most obvious--and Ginny\rquote s really the only logical choice. Once I thought about it, I don\rquote t know why I didn\rquote 
t see it before.\'94
\par 
\par Harry was the one to lean against the door now. \'93Yeah, well, she\rquote s with Malfoy. I mean--Draco. There\rquote s no hope for me.\'94
\par 
\par Katie frowned. \'93No hope at all? She\rquote s said so?\'94
\par 
\par \'93As good as. She wants to be with him. I have to get over her. It\rquote s just--\'94
\par 
\par \'93I know.\'94
\par 
\par \'93--Really difficult--\'94
\par 
\par They were both silent. Then Katie laced her fingers through his and said quietly, \'93Let\rquote s go.\'94
\par 
\par They didn\rquote t speak in the car. Harry stared out at the night, the houses and other buildings passing by. When they\rquote 
d reached Little Whinging and were going by the park, Harry saw the large white tent, looking dark and empty. The second show of the evening must be over, he thought. Then he had another thought.
\par 
\par \'93Katie,\'94 he said suddenly, \'93Do you have your wand with you?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yeah. It\rquote s in my purse. Why?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Can you drive back to the park? There\rquote s something I want to find out about.\'94
\par 
\par She used a private drive to turn the car around and soon they were back at the park. They got out of the car and Harry started walking purposefully across the grass. Katie followed him. He stopped outside the cloth building.
\par 
\par \'93What\rquote s all this about, Harry?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Can I--can I use your wand? Please? It\rquote s not bad, honestly. And I\rquote ll be seventeen in a few weeks. I just need to know--something.\'94
\par 
\par She frowned, but then took her wand from her purse and handed it to him. The tent entrance was zippered shut; he opened 
it carefully, wincing at the noise the plastic zipper made as it moved. He stepped into the tent and she started to follow, but he said to her, \'93You\rquote d better stay out there, keep watch, say something if it looks like someone\rquote 
s coming, all right?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I thought you said you weren\rquote t doing anything bad!\'94 she hissed.
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m not. I\rquote m finding out whether anyone else is doing something bad.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, well, that isn\rquote t the least bit dangerous,\'94 she answered sarcastically. \'93I\rquote m starting to feel like I might as well still be hanging out with the twins...\'94
 But she stood outside the tent, looking about nervously, while Harry entered the huge space with its army of folding chairs divided neatly by an aisle. He had been reading about this for a couple of evenings, using books he\rquote 
d borrowed from Mrs. Figg, and he felt ready to try it. The worst that could happen was it not working. Of course, it would be hard to tell that apart from there simply being no hidden information to reveal, so he wasn\rquote t sure what he\rquote 
d do if it seemed it hadn\rquote t worked....
\par 
\par Harry took a deep breath and closed his eyes, thinking about the way he felt when he was young and would do magical things accidentally, the tingling he felt all over his scalp. He opened his eyes and brandished the wand, continuing to f
ocus on this memory, saying, \'93Revelatio!\'94
\par 
\par The spell worked instantly. Harry gasped. The previously-dark tent was suddenly aglow with ghostly pink figures. They looked like people, like hundreds of different, distinct human beings. Harry turned to the left
 and to the right. Everywhere, the tent vibrated and pulsed with the beautiful, shimmering and unmistakable afterglow of--magic.

\par Harry wasn\rquote t sure that he\rquote d ever seen anything quite so beautiful. The shimmering figures pulsed and vibrated with life. He lowered Katie\rquote s wand and just stared. \'93Sitting,\'94 if it could be called that, in every 
chair, was the figure of a person who had attended Rodney Jeffries\rquote  most recent engagement, earlier in the evening. Harry looked at the dais; oddly, there were no magical signatures there, only in the audience. If Jeffries was a wizard, wouldn
\rquote t there be s
ome blue signatures? he thought. He knew from his other life that blue signatures were for wand magic, pink for wandless or accidental magic. He looked around the tent. Could everyone who had attended be a witch or wizard? Could Jeffries have made all of 
them perform some kind of accidental magic? What of the old man who no longer needed his wheelchair, the one Harry had seen on the television in the Bells\rquote  flat?
\par 
\par As stunning a sight as it was, thinking about the ramifications of what he was seeing was starting to hurt Harry\rquote s head. He jumped when he heard Katie hiss at him through the tent opening.
\par 
\par \'93Harry!\'94 she said in an excited whisper. \'93Someone\rquote s coming!\'94 She ducked into the tent nervously. \'93I think it might be someone who works for Jeffries.\'94
\par 
\par Harry swallowed. \'93What do we do?\'94 he said, thinking aloud.
\par 
\par Katie held out her hand and Harry put her wand into it. \'93I have an idea,\'94 she said tersely, not sharing her thoughts.
\par 
\par She stood very close to him, and when the man she\rquote d evidently seen walking toward the tent entered and saw them, he only had time to say, \'93Here, now, no one should--\'94 before she pointed her wand at him and cried:
\par 
\par \'93Stupefy!\'94
\par 
\par He went rigid and then lost his balance, falling over, knocking over some chairs, but not disturbing the magical signatures. Harry couldn\rquote t tell if he\rquote 
d had a chance to take notice of the ghostly pink figures populating the tent. He turned to Katie.
\par 
\par \'93Um, was that your plan?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Not completely,\'94 she said, still sounding very businesslike. \'93I\rquote m waiting for the signatures to fade.\'94
\par 
\par Harry looked around. \'93It takes a few minutes.\'94
\par 
\par \'93I know,\'94 she said, looking around. Then Harry saw that she was really looking at them. \'93It\rquote s quite beautiful, isn\rquote t it?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes,\'94 Harry agreed. \'93I just wish I knew what it meant. Who did the magic? What spell or spells are we talking about? I thought doing this would tell us something, but in some ways I feel more confused than ever....\'94
\par 
\par \'93There!\'94 she said triumphantly, pointing at some glowing people near them. \'93Fading a bit. Shouldn\rquote t be long now.\'94
\par 
\par Little by little, the images became fainter, until Harry could no longer see them at all; it was as though he had blinked and they had all Apparated away. Katie motioned for Harry to help her stand up 
the man whom she had stunned. She pointed at the opening in the tent and Harry nodded, then helped her position the man outside the tent. The stiff figure was somewhat precarious; Harry was worried that he was going to topple over again at any moment. Kat
ie quickly revived the man, then immediately pointed her wand at him again, saying, \'93Impedimenta!\'94
\par 
\par He looked frozen once more, although Harry knew he was merely moving very, very slowly, and that the spell would wear off in a matter of minutes. While the m
an was standing there, his eyes staring past them, unseeing, Katie reached into his jacket pocket, pulling out his wallet.
\par 
\par \'93What are you doing?\'94 Harry demanded. She made a face at him.
\par 
\par \'93Information gathering.\'94 She found a driver\rquote s license with a London a
ddress, and some business cards with the same name on it. The cards were for a law firm in London: Shaw, Booker, Forrest and White. There was also a key in his pocket which hung from a plastic disk bearing the name and logo for The Hare and Hounds, a pub 
in the village where Jeffries and his retinue had presumably taken rooms. \'93Hmm,\'94 she said, staring thoughtfully at it. \'93Still using actual keys here. Of couse, it\rquote s not an international hotel chain, so that\rquote 
s probably to be expected....\'94
\par 
\par \'93What are you talking about?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Many large muggle hotels don\rquote t use keys for the rooms any more, just electronic passes. They don\rquote t even confiscate them when people leave the hotel, they just reprogram the door. I wasn\rquote t terribly surprised that I wasn\rquote 
t chosen to be Head Girl, since I only had seven O.W.L.s, but four of them were in Defense Against the Dark Arts and Muggle Studies, although that\rquote s not where I learned about hotel keys. That\rquote 
s not in the text. For my summer homework I did a lot of research on muggle security measures.\'94
\par 
\par \'93I thought you were visiting relatives in America?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I was--that\rquote s where I learned about this; the Americans even require many people to use electronic security passes to get into their offices, much more advanced than most businesses in the Bri
tish Isles. There are exceptions, of course. You wouldn\rquote t believe what--\'94
\par 
\par \'93I think we\rquote d better keep moving before the spell wears off,\'94 he said quickly, not liking the look on the man\rquote s face; he definitely thought his facial expression was changing; it was changing very slowly, but changing.
\par 
\par Katie was squinting at one of the business cards in the dim light. \'93His name\rquote s Adam Justice. Isn\rquote t that perfect? He\rquote s probably been pressured to read the law all his life. Oh, wait--he\rquote s not a solicitor or a barrister
. According to this he\rquote s just a clerk.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, clerks can be very important to their bosses.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Sorry; I just meant that the theory about being pressured to read the law is probably a bit off.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Not necessarily--this just means he did the next best thing. He\rquote s probably happier, I should think. Shouldn\rquote t we--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Obliviate!\'94 she cried suddenly, pointing her wand at Adam Justice. Then Harry noticed another figure was in the distance, heading toward them. Katie saw too, and cursed under her breath, surprising Harry.
\par 
\par \'93Back in the tent!\'94 she hissed, and Harry found himself obeying. Adam Justice had hopefully blocked the other person\rquote s view, so they hadn\rquote t been seen, but if they made a break for the car that would no longer be true.
\par 
\par When they were standing in the tent, Harry threw up his hands and whispered, \'93Now what? Hide behind some chairs? Under the platform?\'94
\par 
\par The other person\rquote s footsteps were growing nearer, and then they heard Adam Justice start moving as well; the Impediment Curse had worn off.
\par 
\par \'93No time!\'94 she hissed back at him. Then suddenly, she pulled his face down to hers and he stumbled; the next thing he knew, they were on the ground, her mouth attached to his still. Her hands were locked a
round his neck and just as her mouth opened he felt the earth vibrating very subtly as two people entered the tent. He realized what her plan was then, and threw himself into the pantomime wholeheartedly, also opening his mouth and running his hands up in
to her hair.
\par 
\par The intruders didn\rquote t say anything at first. Harry\rquote s lips had moved to her neck and she was breathing warmly into his ear when one of the two people behind them finally spoke.
\par 
\par \'93This tent,\'94 said a very indignant man\rquote s voice, \'93Is the property of
 Rodney Jeffries, and no one is authorized to be here when tickets to hear Mr. Jeffries are not being sold. We have permission from the town council to have this tent in this location and have paid all of the appropriate fees for the use of public propert
y; you, I daresay, have not.\'94
\par 
\par Harry finally pulled his mouth away from Katie\rquote s neck. Her breathing was very shallow and her eyes looked slightly glazed-over; she was either an excellent actress or had utterly forgotten the original purpose of what they were doing.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, hello,\'94 she said brightly, as Harry helped her to a standing position. \'93Are we not supposed to be here?\'94
\par 
\par Adam Justice threw his hands in the air with exasperation. \'93That\rquote s what I just said.\'94
\par 
\par Then Harry noticed who the other person was: Grace, the girl who\rquote d been working at the American Embassy in Paris. \'93Well, hello again,\'94 Grace said, smiling at Harry. \'93Thought you\rquote d broken up with your girlfriend.\'94
\par 
\par He turned and smiled briefly at Katie. \'93New girlfriend.\'94 He turned back to Grace. \'93Sorry. We thought this would be, erm, more private than the car. We\rquote ll be going. Very sorry...\'94
\par 
\par Katie gave the two a lopsided grin and buttoned two open buttons on her dress. (When had she opened them? Harry wondered). She walked past them looking very different, to Harry\rquote 
s eyes, than she usually did, and he realized that she was moving her hips much more than usual. She obviously wanted there to be no mistake what they were up to. Normally she walked with a very focused, no-nonsense stride, he realized, although he
\rquote d never really thought about it before. Somehow, there was something very eye-catching about this new walk....
\par 
\par When they were back in the car, they noticed Grace and Adam zipping up the tent again and walking across the grass in the other direction to another car. When they suddenly turned their faces toward Katie\rquote s car, she yelped and abruptly pulled Harry
\rquote s face to hers. He found their mouths locked again, and then he opened his eyes and saw that hers were open, too; she was looking over his shoulder, presumably watching the other pair until they reached their car. She didn\rquote 
t actually do anything with her mouth this time except keep it in contact with Harry\rquote s while she watched Grace and Adam Justice. Harry couldn\rquote t decide whether he was disappointed about this.
\par 
\par Finally, she pulled back from him, then put her hand up to her mouth, looking mildly horrified. \'93Oh, Harry--sorry about that. I didn\rquote t want them to see us looking at them. Are you all right?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, you know, it\rquote s pretty traumatic to be forced to kiss a pretty girl as a subterfuge...\'94 he said, trying to keep a straight face, but then couldn\rquote t help smiling at her. He could see that she was blushing in the moonlight.
\par 
\par \'93You are too charming by half, Harry Potter. That will get you in trouble, you know,\'94 she said, starting the car. He leaned back and grinned at her.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, it already has. It already has.\'94
\par 
\par They both laughed. As she started the car, he realized that she was probably heading for Privet Drive. \'93Let\rquote s go to Mrs. Figg\rquote s instead,\'94 he said. \'93
I think we should tell her about the magical signatures we found in the tent. For one thing, we should say that you\rquote re the one who did the spell, since I\rquote 
m not seventeen yet and I did use your wand. Plus--I just think she should know as soon as possible so she can tell Dumbledore.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Mrs. Who? Dumbledore? What are you going on about, Harry?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Mrs. Figg. That\rquote s where Draco\rquote s staying. She was his nanny when he was small and also my babysitter when Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia wanted to do something nice with Dudley and didn\rquote t want me around. She\rquote 
s really a witch, and she\rquote s going to be the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher in September. She\rquote s also Mad-Eye Moody\rquote s little sister.\'94
\par 
\par She didn\rquote t take her eye off the road as he told her all this, but said dryly, \'93You\rquote re not serious.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Completely. Turn left here instead of right.\'94
\par 
\par She followed his directions and they were soon at Mrs. Figg\rquote s house. When they reached the door, Harry rang the bell, hoping somehow that Draco would be the one to answer. Unfortunately, it was Mrs. Figg.
\par 
\par \'93Harry! What the hell--and who\rquote s this?\'94
\par 
\par Katie swallowed, the look on her face making i
t clear that she was very glad to be out of school, with no danger of having Mrs. Figg for her teacher in September. Harry saw her steel herself as she thrust out her hand, saying in an only slightly-shaky voice, \'93Katie Bell. Sam Bell\rquote 
s my father.\'94
\par 
\par Mrs. Figg took her hand and shook it firmly. \'93Ah. Sam Bell. Yes, yes...Come in, come in.\'94
\par 
\par In the entrance hall, Harry told her, \'93We\rquote ve been to the park, to that tent Rodney Jeffries is using. We\rquote ve something important to tell you, something Dumbledore may want to know, too.\'94
\par 
\par She raised her eyebrows. \'93And what were you two doing in the park at this time of night, may I ask?\'94
\par 
\par Katie seemed to be gaining confidence. She lifted her chin and looked her in the eye. \'93No,\'94 she said raising her own eyebrows at the old woman. \'93You may not.\'94
\par 
\par Harry was expecting Mrs. Figg to respond with a typically Moody-like retort, but instead she chuckled and moved toward the kitchen. \'93I see we have a feisty one here...\'94
\par 
\par She motioned for Harry and Katie to sit at the kitchen table, then moved her finger a tiny bit, causing the tea things to start zooming around the room. \'93Draco should probably hear all this too,\'94 Harry told her. Mrs. Figg immediately howled Draco
\rquote s name, making Harry and Katie wince (Harry fought the urge to cover his ears).}{\f1\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par \'93WHAT?\'94 came the annoyed response from the second floor.
\par 
\par \'93JUST GET YOUR ARSE DOWN HERE!\'94 was Mrs. Figg\rquote s answer. Harry glanced at Katie; he had become accustomed to this from having stayed in this hou
se during the previous summer, but he was a bit embarassed to have Katie witness the usual mode of communication for the Figg household: top-of-the-lungs bellowing. Katie, however, only winced the one time.
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote M COMING, YOU OLD--\'94
\par 
\par By the time he was entering the kitchen, all of the tea things were laid out on the small table. Draco stopped short when he saw Katie.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, hello,\'94 he said, suddenly attempting to turn on the charm, smirking and looking her up and down pointedly. \'93Don\rquote t you look different....\'94
\par 
\par Harry pretended to swat at him. \'93Sit down and put your eyes in your head. She\rquote s my date tonight.\'94
\par 
\par Draco Malfoy sat in the empty chair, laughing. \'93Some date, Potter. Giving her a tour of Figg\rquote s kitchen. You really know how to show a girl a good time.\'94 This time Harry wasn\rquote t pretending about the swatting. \'93Hey!\'94
 Draco yelled, holding his arm.
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s enough, the pair of you, or I\rquote ll start telling the girl about how I changed both your nappies,\'94 Mrs. Figg threatened. The boys clamped their mouths shut and Katie did too, but in her case, she seemed to be suppressing laughter.

\par 
\par \'93If you\rquote re on a date, what are you doing here?\'94 Draco asked them as he poured the tea. He looked disgruntled about the fact that he wasn\rquote t out and about on a Friday night.
\par 
\par Harry explained to them that they\rquote d stopped by the park on the way back to Little Whinging and Katie (They said) had cast the Revelatio spell. He told them what they\rquote d seen--but not that they\rquote 
d been seen by muggles (At least, for the time being, he was assuming they were muggles).
\par 
\par Mrs. Figg had a very strange look on her face when she\rquote d heard why they\rquote d come to her. She stood and started pacing. Then Harry said, \'93Mrs. Figg--can I tell Katie about the--people working for--um, You-Know-Who--no! Wait! I don\rquote 
t mean Voldemort. I mean--\'94
\par 
\par 
\par \'93You mean Dumbledore,\'94 Mrs. Figg nodded. \'93You mean about the operatives.\'94 She sat again and nodded at Katie, actually patting her hand affectionately. \'93I daresay she\rquote s a good girl. Trained your dad, I did, when he was fresh ou
t of school. Excellent Auror. Such a shame what happened....\'94 She patted Katie\rquote s hand again and smiled sympathetically at her. Katie acknowledged this silently with a small smile.
\par 
\par Once Katie understood that Sirius Black had been working as an operative before he\rquote d been cleared, and that Remus Lupin and Severus Snape were also operatives, they brought her up to speed concerning the milkman who wasn\rquote t.
\par 
\par \'93Do you think Jeffries is connected to the milkman?\'94 Harry asked Mrs. Figg. \'93And have they found out who he is?\'94
\par 
\par Mrs. Figg looked very disturbed. \'93We already suspected there was something funny about Jeffries, but it\rquote s not what you think, Harry. And I do think there\rquote s a connection with the milkman--but not for the reasons you might assume....\'94
 She trailed off, frowning into her teacup. \'93We\rquote re still trying to work out some problematic things concerning the milkman....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Like what?\'94 Harry wanted to know.
\par 
\par \'93Well--like the fact that he\rquote s not a wizard. He\rquote s a muggle.\'94
\par 
\par \'93I know Otto\rquote s a muggle. Of course he is.\'94
\par 
\par \'93I don\rquote t mean the real milkman. I mean the fellow you disarmed, Harry. He\rquote s a muggle.\'94
\par 
\par \'93But--but he was using a wand to get into the house--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Was he? Are you certain?\'94
\par 
\par Harry\rquote s head was spinning. \'93I don\rquote t understand--he was breaking and entering, wasn\rquote t he? And the Nelsons were away when they normally wouldn\rquote t have been--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Actually, it turns out that Mrs. Nelson\rquote s neice had a baby and she and her husband flew to Florida to spend a fortnight visiting. I severely doubt that someone forced a young woman in
 America to give birth to a child and then arranged for her aunt and uncle to fly to America to visit her just so they could break into their house and be two doors away from you.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well--they may not have done it because of that, but they may have taken advantage of the fact that the Nelsons were gone for a little while....\'94
\par 
\par Mrs. Figg sighed. \'93And then there\rquote s Jeffries.\'94
\par 
\par Harry sat up. \'93Yes?\'94
\par 
\par \'93No wand magic. No accidental magic. Absolutely nothing goes on in the hotel rooms where he stays, either. No magical signatures of any kind. His staff all seem to be muggles, too. If he himself is a wizard, he\rquote s not doing magic.\'94
\par 
\par \'93But--but we saw the signatures.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Right. He doesn\rquote t seem to be doing magic. But the people who come to see him--\'94
\par 
\par \'93How could his entire audience have been witches and wizards? It just seems so unlikely--\'94
\par 
\par \'93They\rquote re not. They\rquote re muggles.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Huh?\'94
\par 
\par She sighed. \'93Exactly, Harry. That\rquote s what we\rquote re trying to figure out. And I do think that your muggle milkman imposter used that wand to break into the Nelsons\rquote 
 house. The question is--how? Did someone teach him the spell? Where did he get the wand? It\rquote s a good one, chestnut and dragon heartstring. And how did he manage to get it to perform magic?\'94
\par 
\par Harry frowned. None of this was making sense. Muggles performing magic?
\par 
\par \'93So--\'94
\par 
\par \'93So we have been paying very close attention to Mr. Jeffries since last November and we are as mystified about him as you are right now.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, I\rquote d also like to know how he just happens to be in Little Whinging just as I happen to be starting my holiday....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Harry, trust me when I say that the Ministry is very concerned about Jeffries in general, and that the operatives are specifically interested in the fact that he is in Little Whing
ing and interested in working out your milkman imposter problem. Plenty of highly qualified people are on the job, Harry, and you should go home and get some sleep and let others do their jobs. Your job is to be a teenage boy home from school for the holi
days.\'94
\par 
\par Harry frowned; he felt so useless. This was very frustrating after being the captain of the Dueling Club, leading the other club members into battle in the forest....
\par 
\par Katie was standing. \'93Mrs. Figg is right, Harry. I\rquote ll drive you home. You\rquote ve got a day off tomorrow. Relax and do nothing. We\rquote ve all been working hard this week.\'94
\par 
\par He couldn\rquote t argue with that; while he was getting more used to it now, after the first few days of working for Aberforth again he\rquote d had muscles aching that he\rquote d forgo
tten he possessed. A day or two of rest sounded wonderful. Whether he could stop worrying was another story.
\par 
\par They said goodnight and left--although Harry noticed Draco Malfoy ogling Katie\rquote s legs again as they departed. When they were in the car once more, Harry simply stared out the window while she drove the short distance from Mrs. Figg\rquote 
s house to Privet Drive; he spoke only to give her cursory directions.
\par 
\par When they pulled up in front of number four, Harry turned to her. \'93You know, you really were good back at the park.\'94
\par 
\par In the illumination from the street lamps he could see her blush. \'93A good kisser? Or--\'94
\par 
\par Now Harry was the one blushing. \'93Well, that too. But--I meant your response to that--that Adam Justice. You made sure he wouldn\rquote t remember the magical signatures, and you came up with a plausible reason for our being in the tent....\'94
\par 
\par She shrugged, her hands still on the steering wheel. \'93It was nothing.\'94
\par 
\par They were silent, both staring out the front window of the car. When Harry finally spoke, Katie seemed startled. \'93You know why you can\rquote t figure out what to do for a living?\'94
\par 
\par She turned her head, frowning. \'93I have a feeling you\rquote re going to tell me.\'94
\par 
\par \'93It\rquote s because you already know what you want to do, but you\rquote ve promised your dad you won\rquote t.\'94
\par 
\par She looked down at her hands, her mouth very thin. \'93Yes,\'94 she sighed. \'93You\rquote re right, Harry. The only thing I\rquote 
ve ever seriously considered doing is being an Auror. Defense Against the Dark Arts was my favorite class in school. Any time I paid any attention in any other class it was only if it was something I could use against dark wizards. I\rquote 
m not the fastest dueler in the world, but I can usually figure out a way not to be in a position where I have to be dueling someone, which is probably wiser, really. That\rquote s why I didn\rquote 
t join the Dueling Club. And I found History of Magic and Potions to be unbelievably dull. Transfiguration wasn\rquote t bad--I actually had two O.W.L.s in that one. And I had one in Divination. Beginner level. Beyond that I lost interest. And Astronomy-
-well I don\rquote t even want to think about that....\'94
\par 
\par She looked up at the sky. \'93If you asked me what part of the sky to look in for Orion\rquote s Belt or Sagittarius, I\rquote d have no idea, but if you want me to follow someone through Diagon Alley without their knowing they\rquote re being followed, I
\rquote m the one for the job.\'94
\par 
\par He grinned. \'93Why\rquote d you say that?\'94
\par 
\par She ducked her head. \'93Because before Lee and I were going out, I saw him in Diagon Alley shopping for school supplies during the summer and I followed him because the twi
ns had told me he had a girlfriend and I wanted to see if he was going to meet her. Turned out they\rquote 
d been lying to me; they knew I fancied him and they were trying to get us together. Sneaks. But Lee never suspected I was following him. People can be really daft, you know?\'94
\par 
\par He smiled at her. \'93So you know I\rquote m right.\'94 It wasn\rquote t a question. \'93When the time comes--what are you going to tell your dad?\'94
\par 
\par She sighed and leaned back with her eyes closed. \'93I don\rquote t know. I suppose that\rquote s what I\rquote 
m really doing here this summer. Trying to get dad to see that I really am an adult, that I can make these decisions for myself. Spend a little more time with him before he disowns me...\'94 She turned, and on seeing Harry\rquote 
s frown, she gave a feeble smile. \'93Joking. I know he wouldn\rquote t do that. But--oh, Harry. The way he goes on, sometimes. Did you know that his best friends arrested him? Not your mum--she was on holiday. And these so-called \lquote friends\rquote 
 treated him like any other criminal. I know, I know, technically they should have. But--but he was one of them. And he was protecting me. The way they suddenly didn\rquote t seem to think he was the same person, the way they took him away--that\rquote 
s something he\rquote s still not gotten over. Not that he\rquote s gotten over mum; even after sixteen years. I just wish...I wish he could be happy. The only time he seems happy is when he\rquote s working, but I think that\rquote 
s just a distraction. And he won\rquote t talk about prison; I\rquote ve tried asking him. The only thing he\rquote s said about it was that if he\rquote d known what he was sending people to, he might not have been such a good Auror. And now I\rquote 
m supposed to tell him that\rquote s what I want to do with my life?\'94
\par 
\par Harry put his hand over hers. \'93Most of the people in Azkaban really deserve to be there. It\rquote s true that there need to be some changes in wizarding law, so we\rquote re not punishing people who are defending others, but that\rquote 
s a problem with the law, not with the people enforcing it.\'94
\par 
\par She grasped Harry\rquote s hand. Her voice had become very soft. \'93All those years when da
d was in prison, I thought of his being an Auror, and how I would make him proud of me, how I would be just like him when I grew up. I played at being an Auror with my friends and for a while I tried to get them to call me \lquote Aurora,\rquote 
 since I hated the name Katie....\'94
\par 
\par \'93I rather like the name Katie,\'94 he said quietly. Suddenly he realized that they were sitting very close together, their faces only inches away. They looked at each other for what seemed a very long time.
\par 
\par \'93Do you want to go to Kew Gardens?\'94 Katie asked suddenly, in a strangled sort of voice. Harry backed up and cleared his throat, taking his hand from hers.
\par 
\par \'93Um--all right. I\rquote ve never been.\'94
\par 
\par \'93We--we could go tomorrow.\'94
\par 
\par \'93What happened to relaxing tomorrow?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Kew is relaxing. It\rquote s one of my favourite places in the world. After--after Dad came home, it\rquote s the first place he took me. We\rquote ve been gardening all week--we can enjoy the fruits of someone else\rquote s labours for once.\'94

\par 
\par She smiled at him, although it looked a bit forced, and he nodded. \'93When?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I can pick you up at ten-thirty. We can have lunch in London.\'94
\par 
\par \'93All right then.\'94 He opened his car door and was mildly surprised to hear her open hers and follow him to the front door.
\par 
\par \'93Goodnight, Harry. Except for the people gawping at us in the Leaky Cauldron, the horrid film and meeting your Mrs. Figg and having to see Draco Malfoy again it was the perfect date,\'94 she said with a mischievous look in her eye.
\par 
\par Harry winced. \'93That\rquote s just about everything. What\rquote s left?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I think just--this--\'94
 she said, standing on her toes and brushing her lips against his. He reached for her shoulders and held her in place before him, barely needing to touch her, preventing her from leaving him immediately, so he could kiss her properly. She didn\rquote 
t complain but behaved rather as though she\rquote d been hoping he would do this. He shivered in the night air; her fingers were brushing his bare forearms lightly, making the hairs there stand on end. Their bodies didn\rquote 
t quite touch; he was aware of her being very near, but she wasn\rquote t pressed against him. They seemed to stay like that for rather a long time. When he finally pulled his face back from hers she had a look in her eyes he\rquote d seen before. He
\rquote d definitely seen both Ginny and Hermione look at him that way when they\rquote d been snogging, as well as Cho, for that matter....
\par 
\par \'93Good night, Harry,\'94 she said so softly he had to strain to hear the words, then she turned and walked back to the car. While she started the engine and prepared to move off, he raised his hand, and she
 nodded back at him with a small, secret smile. He went into the house and leaned on the closed door, hoping his aunt and uncle weren\rquote t waiting up, hoping they wouldn\rquote t say anything to him about Sam \'93Letting\'94
 his daughter go out with him. He closed his eye
s, smiling to himself as he remembered the long, slow, leisurely end-of-date kiss. Unbidden, then, the image of Ginny in the greenhouse with Draco crept into his mind, and he had to abruptly open his eyes to banish it.  Katie, he told himself. Think about
 Katie. She wasn\rquote t someone else\rquote s girlfriend, and she wasn\rquote t in love with his best friend and his best friend wasn\rquote t in love with her. He hadn\rquote 
t done anything to lead to the death of her last boyfriend. For once in his life, maybe he could feel almost-normal and go out on a few dates with a perfectly nice, perfectly normal girl.
\par 
\par For once.
\par 
\par As he strode up the stairs two at a time, he couldn\rquote t help smiling to himself. If his aunt and uncle ever found out she was a witch, not to mention Sam and \'93Dick\'94 being wizards, they wouldn\rquote t think she was so \'93Normal\'94 any more.

\par 
\par She wasn\rquote t in love with his best friend....
\par 
\par Suddenly, having been able to talk so easily to Katie, he realized how much he missed Hermione. Still with a calm, contented feeling filling him from th
e date, and putting Rodney Jeffries and the milkman out of his mind, he sat at his desk and pulled out a piece of parchment. He found his favourite eagle quill that Hermione had given him and the ink that changed colors as you wrote; he\rquote 
d bought it on his very first shopping trip to Diagon Alley with Hagrid, when he was eleven but he didn\rquote t use it very often, so there was plenty.
\par 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Dear Hermione,
\par 
\par I\rquote m sorry I didn\rquote t write sooner to officially congratulate you on becoming Head Girl! Everyone knew for years you would be, of course, so it\rquote s a good thing you didn\rquote t disappoint anyone!
\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par He stopped and flicked the feathery part of the quill over his chin as he thought. He couldn\rquote t write a letter that was punctuated by nothing but exclamation marks. It sounded like f
alse laughter or something. He thought for a few minutes before continuing writing.
\par 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I also wanted to write to you to tell you something that should probably come from me, instead of someone else. I went on a date tonight with Katie Bell. I know this comes
 out of the blue, but it seems to be just what I needed. It was actually her dad\rquote s idea, but Katie\rquote s very nice and we had a nice time--
\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par Erg. He was going to wind up using the word \'93Nice\'94 to describe everything at this rate. He scribbled out the end of the sentence and wrote, \'93Good time.\'94
\par 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I know you were hacked off at me for breaking up with you, but I still think I did the right thing. Have you written to Ron? How are the two of you getting on? Please don\rquote 
t be too cross with him; he has a lot to deal with right now. Not that you\rquote re cross a lot. I\rquote m not putting this very well....
\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par He thought for a very long time before continuing.
\par 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 You\rquote re my two best friends and I want you to be happy. Please forgive me for being such a prat and handling things so badly. I love you both very much and you both mean the world to me.
\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par He was unsure about including the last part, but before he could lose his nerve, he signed it and tied it to Hedwig\rquote 
s leg. He watched her fly into the night, silhouetted against the moon for a moment before swerving and disappearing in a stand of pines. Then he thought she was coming back. Already? he thought. But although he could tell that a small flying object was h
eading toward him, it never seemed to grow larger. When the object practically zoomed into his forehead, threatening to replace his old scar with a larger, messier one, he ducked and saw Ron Weasley\rquote 
s owl, Pigwidgeon, flapping around the room excitedly, like a flying, fuzzy, tennis ball on too much caffeine.
\par 
\par He watched it for a while, waiting for it to tire out, but Pig\rquote s enthusiasm for his work was boundless, and finally, Harry gave up and used an old butterfly net that had been in the room when he\rquote d moved
 in to snag the little bird. He took the note off its leg while it continued to jump about excitedly and discovered that there were actually two notes; one in Ron\rquote s handwriting and one in Ginny\rquote s.
\par 
\par He swallowed. Ginny. Damn. Why couldn\rquote t he just have gone to bed? Why did he have to sit down and write to Hermione? Of course, that wouldn\rquote t have kept Ron from sending Pig with the letters. He opened Ron\rquote 
s leter first, hoping for a little sanity.
\par 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Dear Harry,
\par 
\par Congrats on being Head Boy. No surprise there, of course.
\par 
\par You haven\rquote t wasted much time, have you? But you better hope Hermione doesn\rquote t have that Prophet subscription any more. You know she hates finding out about things that way.
\par 
\par Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that later this month, Remus Lupin and I are going down to London to try that dungeon thing the Ministry has for werewolves who want to be locked away safely. And before we go, Snape\rquote 
s going to be using the fireplace to give us potion every day for a week. (Lupin\rquote s back in Manchester most of the time, but he\rquote s come here a couple of times to do some training with me. We\rquote ll probably do that twice a week). It\rquote 
s possible I could stay here for the full moon, since I\rquote ll have the potion, but somehow I just don\rquote t want anyone at home to see me that way, especially mum.
\par 
\par Sirius wrote to me and said that I\rquote m invited to spend August with you at Ascog Castle, so I\rquote ll be there for the next full moon. He\rquote 
s invited Lupin too, so you and Sirius can keep us company again. And Snape can still get the potion to us. You know Sirius told Lupin he might even invite Snape to stay as well? Dunoon isn\rquote 
t that far from Bute. Did you ever think Sirius Black would invite Snape to his home? I had to ask mum to pinch me after I read Lupin\rquote s letter (Lupin told me, not Sirius). U
nfortunately, the twins were visiting Mum and Dad, so they straightaway put a pinching hex on me and my bum was black and blue in seconds. I miss the buggers sometimes.
\par 
\par Ginny\rquote s sending a letter too. I think it\rquote s about Draco Malfoy\rquote s birthday. Just imagine me making retching noises right now and you\rquote ll understand how I feel about that. Now she\rquote s hit me (She\rquote 
s reading over my shoulder). I have to go now. I have a little sister who needs throttling. See you soon.
\par 
\par --Ron
\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par His signature was somewhat distorted, as though he\rquote d already started scuffling with Ginny. Harry smiled, remembering good-natured squabbling and wrestling with Jamie and the twins. Putting a pinching hex on someone who said, \'93Pinch me, I think I
\rquote m dreaming\'94, was exactly the sort of thing Simon and Stuart Snape would have done.
\par 
\par Then he looked at the other piece of rolled-up parchment. So, Ginny was writing him a letter. He unrolled it slowly and then read:
\par 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Dear Harry,
\par 
\par Draco tells me the landscaping work is going well so far and that Katie Bell is also working with you. You both already get on well with her dad, so that\rquote 
s nice. When Draco wrote to me last summer he told me that the two of you had become good friends with him.
\par 
\par I\rquote m writing to ask you for your help in planning a birthday party for Draco. I\rquote ve already written to Mrs. Figg, and she\rquote 
s arranging most of the details, but we need some way to keep him away from the house on Monday (His birthday) so he won\rquote t know what\rquote s happening. The trouble is, he asked off from work, so he won\rquote t be with you. I don\rquote 
t have a clue what to do. You\rquote re coming to the party, too, I hope? Tell Katie and her dad that they\rquote re also invited. Draco didn\rquote t have a party on his birthday last year, and he\rquote s turning seventeen now, so he\rquote 
ll be of-age. I want it have a proper party for him. Let me know what ideas you might have.
\par 
\par Love,
\par 
\par Ginny
\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par Harry stared into space for a moment. He could think of plenty of places he\rquote 
d like to send Draco Malfoy, none of them particularly nice. Then he tried to think of something he could actually tell Ginny. Finally, he pulled out a piece of parchment and wrote:
\par 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Dear Ginny,
\par 
\par I went to the cinema with Katie Bell tonight. Have you ever been to a muggle cinema? If you choose a better film than we did you might actually like it. Ha ha. Of course, Malfoy may not have been to a film either, in which case you\rquote 
ll need someone with you who knows what to do. So I was thinking you could ask Hermione and Ron to come along, so Hermione can act as your muggle guide and Ron won\rquote 
t complain about the two of you being out alone together (And Hermione might be able to distract him so you can forget you\rquote re not really alone and you might actually get some privacy).
\par 
\par Tomorrow Katie and I are going to Kew Gardens. If the film you go to see on Monday isn\rquote t long enough, perhaps you can do something like that, or just wander around Diagon Alley for as long as you need to in order to let Mrs. Figg get the house re
ady. Sam and Aberforth and Katie and I can come after work. Maybe while we\rquote re in London tomorrow Katie and I can get him a gift. Do you have any ideas?
\par 
\par Love,
\par 
\par Harry
\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par Harry went back and scribbled out the \'93Ha ha.\'94 How stupid, he thought. After that he scribbled out \'93Malfoy\'94 and wrote \'93Draco.\'94 Then he worried that mentioning Ron and Hermione would make it sound like he was the one who didn\rquote 
t want Draco and Ginny to be alone in London together. Then there was the casual way he\rquote d mentioned Katie. Would she think he was trying to make her jealous? (Was he trying to make her jealous? he wondered). If he didn\rquote 
t mention Katie, would she think he was trying to keep it from her when she found out? It\rquote s just been one date, he thought irritably. They liked each other and so far they seemed to get on well together. He didn\rquote 
t have some pre-existing best friend or sister-of-best friend relationship to muck up by going out with her. (Although he did have a daughter-of-co-worker relationship--a co-worker who was doubling as a matchmaker).
\par 
\par Suddenly he understood the appeal of Parvati for Ron. Katie was uncomplicated for him, as Parvati had been uncomplicated for Ron. It was a relief, really. He wasn\rquote t sure it would really stop him completely from thinking about Ginny (Being w
ith Parvati had clearly not taken Ron\rquote s mind off Hermione) but it was worth a try.

\par He set aside Ginny\rquote s letter and wrote a brief note to Ron:
\par 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Dear Ron,
\par 
\par Thanks for the letter. Sorry I didn\rquote t write much this week. I\rquote m knackered from work and also rambling around on the roof of our house in the early evenings. Don\rquote t ask. I\rquote ll explain when I see you.
\par 
\par I\rquote m not sure what you mean about wasting time. And what are you expecting Hermione to read in the paper? She knows she\rquote s Head Girl and I\rquote m Head Boy. Do they usually put that kind of thing in the Prophet?
\par 
\par I hope the dungeons at the Ministry aren\rquote t too bad. I understand you not wanting your mum to see you. I\rquote m glad you\rquote re coming to Scotland in August! I really wanted to be there for you during this full moon, but at least you\rquote 
ll be with Lupin. You know, I think I might need to get Aunt Petunia to pinch me too. (She\rquote d be very happy to.) Sirius is inviting Snape to Ascog? Maybe we can go up to Dunoon for a day, get Snape to give us a tour. Dunoon\rquote 
s a nice place, and the Firth of Clyde is great. His uncle has a sailboat and Snape knows how to use it. A cloudy day would probably be best so he doesn\rquote t have a problem with the sun.
\par 
\par I suggested to Ginny how she might get Draco Malfoy out of Mrs. Figg\rquote s house during the day on Monday so he won\rquote t see her getting the place ready for his birthday party. I said the two of them could go up to London and see a film. Don
\rquote t scream at me! I also said that they could take you and Hermione along, which means you
 could keep an eye on them and Hermione could be a muggle guide for the three of you. (Have you ever been to the cinema?) Then you and Hermione could both come to the party afterward as well and keep me company. I need some other friendly faces there; I j
ust cannot handle the idea of celebrating that git\rquote s birthday (Insert retching sounds here) without the pair of you to talk to.
\par 
\par Don\rquote t throttle Ginny. Be nice to your sister. You can\rquote t be too careful. Remember--she\rquote s learned a lot from the twins and she\rquote s one of the top duelers in the club. (Do you want your bum to turn black and blue again?)
\par 
\par By the way, I\rquote m going to start working on finding those people we talked about. I hope I\rquote ll be able to tell you more soon.
\par

\par 
\par Harry tied both letters to Pigwidgeon\rquote 
s leg, gave him an owl treat, and watched him fly off again. He climbed into bed thinking about how he might go about finding the missing Weasley sisters in this life, but before he could come up with a plan, he was fast asleep.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par In the morning, he met Draco at Mrs. Figg\rquote 
s, Dunkirk in tow. When he returned home from running he noticed a letter from Ginny had been left on his desk by Pigwidgeon. He showered and dressed, stuffed the letter in his pocket without reading it, and waited for Katie.
 She drove up right on time and he strode to the car, smiling. When he got in, she said, \'93Oh!\'94 suddenly and pulled a newspaper off the dashboard, throwing it quickly into the backseat.
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s okay,\'94 he said. \'93Uncle Vernon doesn\rquote t really keep his car nice and Aunt Petunia\rquote s always nagging him about it. She\rquote s pretty compulsive.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Um--right,\'94 she said, blushing for no reason Harry could figure out. She started the car without saying anything else.
\par 
\par After driving in uncomfortable silence for a while, Harry said, \'93While we\rquote re in London, can we stop in Diagon Alley?\'94
\par 
\par She looked startled. \'93Oh, um--I thought we\rquote d avoid wizarding London today. That\rquote s why I borrowed the car from Dad, so we wouldn\rquote t have to Floo to the Leaky Cauldron.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Are you sure we couldn\rquote t just make a quick stop there? I need to get Draco Malfoy a birthday gift. By the way, you and your dad are invited to his birthday party. It\rquote s to be at Mrs. Figg\rquote s on Monday night.\'94
\par 
\par Katie turned her head slightly. \'93You\rquote re celebrating the birthday of the boyfriend of the girl you\rquote re crushing on?\'94
\par 
\par He grimaced. \'93I\rquote m not--oh bother. I\rquote m trying to be big about all this. Get Ginny out of my mind. Treat him like a human instead of a flesh-eating slug, which is my first impulse, frankly. So I\rquote m going to get him a b
irthday present and go to his party and smile and be nice even if it kills me. Which it might.\'94 He gave her a lopsided smile.
\par 
\par \'93Well--maybe I can help you put Ginny out of your mind.\'94 Her tone of voice was light, but Harry took a good look at her now. She was wearing a blue skirt and white blouse. Her arms looked very tan from her work outdoors and her legs looked--
\par 
\par He turned at faced the road, trying not to think about her legs. He had a feeling 
he knew now how she was going to try to get him to put Ginny out of his mind. He remembered the two of them at the front door the previous night. Katie is uncomplicated, he reminded himself. Then why did he have the sudden nagging feeling that he was chea
ting on Ginny?
\par 
\par He found that Kew Gardens was a wonderfully relaxing place. There were fountains and waterfalls and marvelous plants and a generally peaceful atmosphere. He found himself wanting to talk to Katie about his other life, about Jamie, but he didn\rquote 
t quite know how to bring it up without her thinking he was barking mad. So he sat with her on benches and walked holding her hand through leafy arbours and once, in the shadow of a huge old chestnut tree, he kissed her again. While he kissed her, he tho
ught that maybe he could show her some things in the Pensieve and then she might not think he was insane. But, he realized, he probably shouldn\rquote 
t show her something like his initial meeting with Maggie Parrish, which only came about because of his years of experience with stalking Ginny....
\par 
\par Maggie Parrish.
\par 
\par He stopped kissing her abruptly. She looked up at him and gave him a small smile, then stopped when she saw the look on his face. \'93Is everything all right, Harry?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Um--yeah. I just--I just had an idea for how to do something--I mean, for how Ron can do something. I want to make sure I don\rquote t forget it before I can put it in a letter to him.\'94
\par 
\par She grinned. \'93I\rquote m glad kissing me can be so inspirational, but weren\rquote t we trying to get you to stop thinking about a Weasley?\'94
\par 
\par He grinned back mischievously. \'93Well, it\rquote s a different Weasley, anyway.\'94 She swatted him playfully and they walked on, laughing. He finally looked at Ginny\rquote 
s note while they drove to the Leaky Cauldron, so they could get to Diagon Alley. Frowning while he read, he decided not to get Draco the all-too-practical school items she\rquote d suggested. That wasn\rquote 
t a seventeenth birthday present. Instead, he picked out a new broom for him, and told Katie that she and her father could go in on it with him. If Ron and Hermione also wanted to contribute, he thought, then it wouldn\rquote 
t amount to as much for each person. He thought she was looking rather twitchy and nervous when they were in Quality Quidditch Supplies. She kept looking around at the other people 
in the shop and then away again, as though she were trying to make it look like she wasn\rquote t looking at them at all.
\par 
\par When they were back on Privet Drive saying goodbye, Harry kissed her without hesitating this time, holding her against him, feeling her warmth and life, the contours of her body. Do it right, he told himself sternly. She\rquote s a nice girl. Don\rquote 
t daydream about Ginny all the time. Enough\rquote s enough.
\par 
\par But once she was gone he raced up to his room; he had an idea for how to go about finding one of Ron\rquote 
s older sisters and he wanted to see whether it would work. He took out his Pensieve and put it on his desk. He locked the door to his room, but just as he was getting out his wand, Hedwig came soaring in the window with a reply from Hermione. She dropped
 it on his desk and landed on top of her cage and began preening. Harry unrolled the letter and began to read.
\par 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Dear Harry,
\par 
\par I hope you are having a ripping good time with your new girlfriend, Katie Bell. Ron and I are going to London with Draco Malfoy and Ginny on Monday to see a film before we come to his birthday party. I suppose we\rquote ll see you there.
\par 
\par --Hermione
\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par It was extremely terse and, he thought, rather snippy as well. What was her problem? He looked at the note again; he couldn\rquote t remember ever getting a letter from Hermione that wasn\rquote t signed, \'93Love from Hermione\'94
. No love was being sent this time.
\par 
\par Then he saw that a newspaper clipping had fallen out of the parchment. Uh-oh; now he saw what her problem was; she had sent him a page from the \'93People\'94 section of last night\rquote 
s Evening Prophet, the late edition, which had a story about him and Katie going out and a picture of the two of them eating dinner; Harry was leaning over and kissing her at the table, it seemed. Under the table, her foot was snakin
g out of her sandal and toward his, without quite making contact. I didn\rquote 
t kiss her at dinner, he thought. Maybe that was when I was whispering to her about the people looking at my scar. And if her foot really was doing that, I was certainly not aware of it...
\par 
\par He wondered who\rquote d taken the picture. He hadn\rquote 
t noticed a camera. He knew that modern muggle cameras could be very small and unobtrusive. Perhaps there was a wizarding equivalent (Or someone had simply taken the photo with a muggle camera and develop
ed the film the wizarding way). Then he sat down with a thump as he read the story. Oh, this just keeps getting worse, he thought.

\par CHASER CATCHES SEEKER
\par 
\par by Daisy Furuncle
\par 
\par Former Gryffindor prefect and Chaser Kathryn Bell was seen dining at the Leaky Cau
ldron this evening with none other than Gryffindor Seeker and newly-minted Head Boy, Harry Potter. Bell and Potter dined very cozily in a secluded corner of a private dining room, away from prying eyes. Potter has apparently parted ways with new Head Girl
,
 Hermione Granger, also of Gryffindor, who has evidently been his paramour since before the Triwizard Tournament, although they only owned up to their secret relationship in June of last year. During the Tournament, Miss Granger was linked romantically bo
th to Potter and to the late Bulgarian Seeker Viktor Krum, who died in suspicious circumstances in the forest at Hogwarts just over a month ago. Potter was seen bent over Krum\rquote s dead body; Krum had been seeing another cast-off girlfriend of Potter
\rquote s, the former Head Girl and Ravenclaw Seeker, Cho Chang. Potter started seeing Chang not long after her previous boyfriend, Hufflepuff Seeker and Triwizard champion Cedric Diggory, died in Potter\rquote 
s presence under still more suspicious circumstances.
\par 
\par During the summer holiday, Bell and Potter are both working for a landscaping concern owned by Albus Dumbledore\rquote s brother, Aberforth (Who has had legal problems of his own in the past), along with Bell\rquote 
s father, convicted killer Sam Bell, and Draco Malfoy, Slytherin pre
fect and son of convicted Death Eater Lucius Malfoy. Sam Bell has earned his living doing this work ever since he was released from Azkaban, and Potter and Miss Bell are evidently doing it on a lark, but young Malfoy reportedly needs the money very badly,
 his finances having been in dire straits ever since his mother disowned him for conspiring with Potter and Granger to send his father to Azkaban.
\par 
\par Bell, Chang, Granger and Alicia Spinnet (Another former Head Girl) are the four girls whom Lucius Malfoy had 
allegedly placed under Imperius, part of the basis for his life sentence. All of the girls were ordered to pursue Potter romantically while under the curse, which would explain how the very pretty Miss Chang in particular came to be his girlfriend for a t
ime (It was certainly convenient for Potter that her boyfriend happened to be killed). Has your curse not worn off yet, Miss Bell?
\par 
\par Potter is evidently continuing his practice of befriending rather dodgy people, following on his friendship with the Hogwarts
 groundskeeper and Care of Magical Creatures instructor, the half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, who was expelled from Hogwarts years ago following a student\rquote s death. Hagrid\rquote 
s mother is infamous giantess Fridwulfa. He also did a stretch in Azkaban four years ago.
\par 
\par Although Potter is credited with helping to recover the kidnapped Hogwarts Potions master, Severus Snape, who was once accused of being a Death Eater, he is also being blamed by Ambrose Davies for his son Evan\rquote 
s death. The Ravenclaw prefect received burns over 95% of his body and died of asphyxiation during Snape\rquote 
s rescue, which Potter recklessly spearheaded without permission from the headmaster nor any other members of the Hogwarts teaching staff. But then, Potter has shown a tendency to disregard authorit
y before (The Triwizard Tournament was to have been for students over the age of seventeen, while Potter entered at the age of fourteen) and has yet to get his comeuppance for it. Instead he is rewarded with the post of Head Boy.
\par 
\par Miss Bell should perhaps consider more carefully whether she wishes to compromise her future by consorting with someone whose actions have led to two Hogwarts students being killed in two year\rquote 
s time (Diggory being the other) through his carelessness and bravado, but as she seems to have a cavalier attitude about forgiving her father for killing her mother, perhaps such advice would simply fall on deaf ears.}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par 
\par Harry just groaned continuously. Almost no one he knew was not being dragged through the mud in this article. Mrs. Figg miraculously escaped the reporter\rquote 
s notice, but he half expected to see something about his aunt and uncle, and he probably would have if they weren\rquote t muggles. Sirius wasn\rquote t mentioned, and neither were Ron and Ginny. That was good. But even Snape\rquote s history as 
a Death Eater was brought up, and that was ancient history--let alone the question of why Hagrid was expelled. Damn damn damn, he thought.
\par 
\par The tone of the article was distressingly familiar. He checked, but the byline wasn\rquote t Rita Skeeter, it was Daisy Furuncle. He frowned. Where was Rita Skeeter, come to think of it? he thought. Hadn\rquote 
t she gone missing about the same time as Snape the previous summer? He would have to write to Dumbledore to ask him. Or maybe Mrs. Figg would know, since she was also an operative.
\par 
\par He perused the article again. Bell and Potter dined very cozily in a secluded corner of a private dining room, away from prying eyes. Yeah, we were so far away from prying eyes that they managed to take a picture to make us look like we were snoggi
ng when we weren\rquote t.
\par 
\par Hermione didn\rquote t come off very well, as the reporter clearly believed the rubbish Skeeter had put out during the Tournament concerning her and Harry. Was the writer accusing him of killing Krum and Diggory? So he could get Cho Chang? An
d then Aberforth and Sam were portrayed in the worst possible light, and Draco Malfoy would have a fit about the \'93Dire straits\'94 part. He was very touchy about his money situation. As if that weren\rquote 
t bad enough, the reporter had to go and bring up Hagrid again. And had Ambrose Davies really been putting around that it was Harry\rquote s fault Evan had died? Harry shuddered, seeing Evan again, screaming, clothed in fire....
\par 
\par He balled up the article and threw it across the room. Just what I need right now. He hoped Katie hadn\rquote 
t seen it. Then he realized she probably already had; she must have been throwing a copy of the Prophet into the back seat of her car when she picked him up. That\rquote s why she was behaving so awkwardly, and why she didn\rquote 
t want to go to Diagon Alley.
\par 
\par And Hermione. Eerg. That wasn\rquote t going to help him mend fences with her.
\par 
\par Bloody hell.
\par 
\par He felt distracted and upset. What on earth was he doing when the owl arrived from Hermione? He looked up and saw the Pensieve on his desk. Oh, right. Looking for Peggy Weasley. Or Maggie Parrish. Or whatever Maggie Parrish\rquote 
s name was before she married Bernard Parrish.
\par 
\par He knew he couldn\rquote t count on her having married Bernard in this life, so he needed to know the name of her adoptive parents. He remembered seeing a framed copy of their wedding invitation near the door to the flat, but without magic he couldn
\rquote t pull the names on it out of his brain. He had decided to put the memory of that visit to Maggie and Bernard into the Pensieve and enter it, try to really see the invitation this time....
\par 
\par He thought of that day, of following her on the tube and then ringing her doorbell; he thought of the conversation he\rquote d had with her and Bernard in the foyer of the building, with the dog Billy. He thought of sitting in their flat, talking....

\par 
\par Harry put his wand to his temple, then drew it away slowly, sending the th
ought arcing in a silver stream to the large stone bowl. When he was done he put his wand to the viscous surface, stirring until he saw in the bowl the living room of the Parrish flat in his other life. Bending over, he touched his nose to the viscous flu
id, and suddenly found himself tumbling head over heels into the Pensieve once more.
\par 
\par He was back in Maggie and Bernard Parrish\rquote s sunny London flat during the previous autumn. The two of them were sitting on the sofa with their dog, talking to the other Har
ry, without the scar. Harry stared at himself; he seemed so different, and he had that accent. Somehow it made him sound older, he thought. He understood now why Maggie had thought he looked a bit old to be with her fifteen-year-old sister.
\par 
\par He wandered into the corridor that led to the front door of the flat; it was here, he thought; I\rquote 
m sure of it. Finally, he found it. He had seen it in his other life, he had even read it, but to know what it said in detail, he needed to enter this memory physically, walk up to it and take a really good look.
\par 
\par He read the Parrishes\rquote  wedding invitation:
\par 
\par Mr. and Mrs. Sean R. Dougherty
\par request the honour of your presence
\par at the marriage of their daughter
\par 
\par Margaret Mary Beatrice
\par 
\par to
\par 
\par Bernard R. Parrish, III
\par 
\par Saturday, the third of August, nineteen-hundred and ninety-six
\par one o\rquote clock in the afternoon
\par 
\par St. Bartholomew Roman Catholic Church
\par Dorchester
\par 
\par Reception to follow at the White Swallow Inn, Dorchester
\par 
\par The favour of a reply is requested.
\par 
\par Harry swallowed. Her name had been Margaret Mary Beatrice Dougherty and her father was Sean R. Dougherty and they went to the parish of St. Bartholomew in Dorchester.
\par 
\par He flipped himself out of the Pensieve again and after stumbling for a moment, he scrambled for some parchment and ink and scribbled down the information he\rquote d just found. Now--how to find out what he needed to know?
\par 
\par He itched to just go into the next room and use Dudley\rquote s computer, but he didn\rquote t dare; his aunt would skin him alive if he touched any of Dudley\rquote s things, and until now he\rquote 
d been unwilling to disturb the shrine for his own reasons. But this was important; this was restoring the lost Weasley sisters--or one of them--to their family. He paced and thought for the first time, If only Aunt Petunia had fi
xated on me after Dudley died instead of Dunkirk....
\par 
\par Harry stopped his pacing and smiled to himself. He knew how to get into Dudley\rquote s room to use the computer.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par \'93Hello again, Mrs. Dursley.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Hello, Draco,\'94 Aunt Petunia simpered. Harry tried very, very hard not to roll his eyes. \'93Do come in,\'94 she added, ushering him into the entrance hall. \'93How are you today?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Quite well, quite well,\'94 he said, sounding more aristocratic than ever. Well, Harry had told him to use the Malfoy charm (Trying not to gag at the oxymoron). \'93You\rquote re looking quite lovely today,\'94
 Draco added. Harry would have to talk to him later about laying it on so thick. It was starting to verge on the--
\par 
\par \'93Oh, thank you, that really means something, coming from such a handsome young man--\'94
\par 
\par --vomit-inducing, Harry thought, trying to swallow his gorge.
\par 
\par \'93So,\'94 she said, looking very pleased with herself for having him in her home. \'93What brings you to our humble abode?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m, er--Harry. When he stayed at Mrs. Figg\rquote s last summer he was reading a book of mine, and he said I could come over and get it back.\'94 Harry groaned inwardly; that wasn\rquote t the story they\rquote 
d agreed on, but evidently the Malfoy brain wasn\rquote t capable of remembering more than--
\par 
\par \'93Harry!\'94 his aunt immediately reprimanded him. \'93I knew we were right not to get you a library card. You shouldn\rquote t have made the poor boy come over here looking for his book! Now go get it, and apologize when you get back!\'94
\par 
\par This was not how it was supposed to go. \'93Um--I\rquote m not sure where it is now. I may have left it in Dudley\rquote s room--\'94
\par 
\par \'93You left it in--!\'94 his aunt started to say, turning white. \'93You know you are forbidden to go in there!\'94
\par 
\par Harry tried to look sheepish. \'93I know. I\rquote m sorry.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Is it all right if I go into your son\rquote s room, Mrs. Dursley?\'94
\par 
\par She smiled on him with beneficence. \'93Of course, dear boy, of course.\'94 She gave Harry a cold look over her shoulder as the three of them ascended the stairs. When they reached Dudley\rquote s room, there was no sign of a book anywhere. When 
Harry had moved into Dudley\rquote 
s second bedroom not long before he turned eleven, the only things in the room other than the bed and desk were broken toys and books-- in other words, things which had been banished because they were of no use to Dudley. Books 
were not usually part of the landscape for Dudley Dursley, and if there were one in his bedroom now, it would have stood out like a wizard\rquote s hat on Vernon Dursley\rquote s head.
\par 
\par Instead, Draco had the desired reaction to the computer on Dudley\rquote s desk. \'93Oh! Is that an Alpha--4000X?\'94
 he asked in apparent rapture, upon seeing the simple putty-coloured machine, but pronouncing the name awkwardly, as though he were trying to remember what Harry had coached him on.
\par 
\par Petunia Dursley smiled. \'93Yes. Do you enjoy computers?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Do I! Mine is in storage right now, and I probably have ever so many e-mails--\'94 Harry dug his elbow into his ribs and mouthed the letter \lquote E\rquote  at him. \'93Er-e-mails waiting for me when I leg on--I mean, log on again...\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, why don\rquote t you just use Dudley\rquote s machine while you\rquote re in Little Whinging? It\rquote s just gathering dust. Harry wouldn\rquote t know what to do with it,\'94
 she said contemptuously, her voice dropping. She rolled her eyes, as though Harry were far too stupid and hopeless to ever learn how to use a typewriter that had only two keys.
\par 
\par \'93Really? You mean it? That would be smashing. I\rquote d really appreciate that.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, don\rquote t mention it,\'94 she said, blushing. \'93Go right ahead. Harry! Get him a chair!\'94 There had been a desk chair at one time, but Harry noticed t
hat it was broken and the pieces were piled in a corner. Harry scrambled into his own bedroom and returned with his own chair. Petunia watched Draco sit down and stood looking at him and the dark computer monitor expectantly. Harry was afraid she wouldn
\rquote t leave; Draco Malfoy knew nothing about computers. Harry was going to have to be the one to operate it, and if she didn\rquote t get out that wouldn\rquote t be possible.
\par 
\par \'93Actually, shouldn\rquote t we get over to Mrs. Figg\rquote s?\'94 he said suddenly to Draco. \'93We were going to, er, do some gardening for her. Perhaps Draco could come back tomorrow afternoon. I can look for his book tonight.\'94
 He knew that on Sunday afternoons, Petunia usually pretended to be cutting roses to put in the house when she was actually 
craning her neck over the garden fence, spying on the neighbors. This was an important part of her week, and she tried not to miss it. He also knew that Draco wouldn\rquote t come in the morning as he reveled in having Mrs. Figg\rquote 
s house to himself while she was at church.
\par 
\par \'93Why not the morning?\'94 she asked. Harry grimaced; did she want to hang about? he wondered. Draco\rquote s eyes were very wide; he was clearly thinking furiously to figure out a way to avoid giving up his empty-house time. \'93
Well, er, we go to church in the morning. Right. Every Sunday. Did last summer too. Except Harry. He wouldn\rquote t come with us.\'94
\par 
\par Harry resisted the urge to kick him in the shins. Prat. Brown-nose.
\par 
\par \'93Harry!\'94 Aunt Petunia said in her most disapproving tone. (And she had some very disapproving tones). \'93You are to respect the rules of the home in which you are staying!\'94 Then she turned back to Draco, smiling. \'93Well, isn\rquote 
t that a good idea. We, er, would have seen you in church last summer except that we were on holiday, of course, which is why Harry wasn\rquote t staying here. We\rquote ll see you in church tomorrow morning, then, won\rquote 
t we? And then in the afternoon you can come use Dudley\rquote s computer, all right? Say you\rquote ll come after church?\'94
\par 
\par Harry groaned. \'93Church? We\rquote re going to church tomorrow? We never go to church. Only Christmas and Easter.\'94
\par 
\par Aunt Petunia became very military. \'93You will attend church tomorrow morning young man and you will behave yourself accordingly.\'94 She tsk-tsked with her tongue and looked at Draco again. \'93Your parents must be so p
roud to have such a fine young man, going to church with your old nanny. There aren\rquote t many,\'94 she looked pointedly at Harry, \'93Young people still willing to do what\rquote s right these days.\'94
\par 
\par \'93And when\rquote s the last time you were in church, I wonder?\'94 Harry muttered under his breath, but not so softly she couldn\rquote t hear; she chose to ignore him. When they left number four and were walking to Mrs. Figg\rquote 
s house, Harry resisted the urge to push Draco Malfoy into a prickly rose bush.
\par 
\par \'93You never did tell me why you need to use that thing--\'94 Draco Malfoy began, but Harry wasn\rquote t interested in that conversation.
\par 
\par \'93Thanks a lot, Malfoy,\'94 he said instead, kicking a fence post irritably. \'93Now we\rquote re stuck going to church tomorrow morning, thanks to you.\'94
\par 
\par \'93How did I know she was going to do that?\'94 His voice rose in pitch to a squeak. \'93You think I want to go to ruddy church?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, you shouldn\rquote t have pretended to so pious. Don\rquote t know why you\rquote re being such a toady with my aunt anyway.\'94
\par 
\par But now Draco Malfoy had stopped and he became very quiet, fingering a piece of shrubbery. \'93She fusses over me. She--she reminds me a bit of my mum.\'94 He started walking again then and Harry frowned for a moment before catching him up.
\par 
\par \'93What did you say?\'94
\par 
\par \'93You heard me. I\rquote m not repeating myself,\'94 he answered irritably, striding forward purposefully. They had actually gone past Mrs. Figg\rquote 
s without noticing and were headed toward the park now. Harry remembered when Ginny was telling him about how she and Draco Malfoy had become friends, the way she\rquote d held his hand in the infirmary when he\rquote 
d called out for his mother in his delirium.
\par 
\par \'93She wasn\rquote t bad, you know. When I was younger. Always gave me whatever I wanted.\'94
\par 
\par Harry pursed his lips disapprovingly. \'93That\rquote s called spoiling. That\rquote s what my aunt and uncle did with Dudley, too.\'94 Then he remembered that the first time he met Draco, in Madam Malkin\rquote 
s dress shop, he had immediately been reminded of Dudley, due to Draco\rquote s saying that he was going to bully his father into buying him a racing broom (Despite the fact that brooms were forbidden to first year students).
\par 
\par Draco remained silent as they walked. Soon they were at the park; evidently Rodney Jeffries was putting on another show, for people were in a queue that wrapped around the hug
e tent and across the grass to the pavement, waiting to pay their twenty pounds. Harry stood and shook his head, watching, then noticed Draco Malfoy doing the same thing. Well, he thought, at least there\rquote s something on which we agree.
\par 
\par Then Harry noticed a lone figure at the edge of the green, a man around thirty, small and thin, wearing a pale grey suit and a clergyman\rquote s collar. He recognized Mr. Babcock, the vicar. He wasn\rquote 
t shaking his head, like Harry and Draco, but he was visibly shaking, and in fact looked quite ill as he beheld the queue of people waiting to hear the charismatic speaker. Harry watched him turn away from the park and walk toward St. Bede\rquote 
s, as though he were a doomed man walking toward the gallows.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par When he returned to Prive
t Drive he noticed what appeared to be a flock of owls clustered on the tar-papered roof. One of them was nibbling at the evergreen branch attached to the gable. When he began to walk toward the front door, they started to descend on him and he had to bea
t them away. \'93Wait on the roof again!\'94 he told them irritably. \'93I\rquote ll go upstairs and open my window!\'94
 The birds retreated to the roof once more and when Harry opened his bedroom window and whistled to them, they began to stream in. Soon there were owls perc
hed all over the room. Harry went to a medium-sized tawny owl first so he could get it off his bedstead and removed the letter from its leg, shooing it out the window afterward.
\par 
\par \'93No, I\rquote m not giving you anything! I don\rquote t have enough owl-treats for all of you!\'94 He unrolled the parchment, irritated. What he found didn\rquote 
t surprise him a bit. Letter after letter had been sent on the heels of the Prophet article, vilifying him for causing Evan Davies\rquote  death, asking him what sane father would allow his daughter ne
ar him, and how could Albus Dumbledore allow such a person to be Head Boy. He was making the rounds of the letters as quickly as he possibly could, shooing the owls out the window again as soon as he\rquote 
d retrieved the parchments they were carrying, but a couple of times he didn\rquote t get to a howler in time and soon there was screeching all over the house from irate witches and wizards who now thought he was the scourge of the wizarding world.
\par 
\par \'93What\rquote s going on up there?\'94 Vernon Dursley bellowed from his previously-peaceful living room, where he was watching football.
\par 
\par \'93Nothing!\'94 Harry bellowed back, just as another howler burst open. This time phrases like \'93Wizarding Don Juan\'94 were being shouted at top-volume, and Harry winced and shoved the alarmed owl out the w
indow. When he was finally down to three owls, and it didn\rquote t look like they had howlers, he approached them cautiously and took their parchments, prepared for more personal attacks. The first one, however, was a surprise.
\par 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Dear Harry,
\par 
\par I hope you haven\rquote t read the Prophet lately, but I should warn you that there\rquote s a dreadful article in it which may get some people wound up for a while. If you get any negative reaction from it--
\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par If? Harry thought ruefully.
\par 
\par --}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 don\rquote t pay it any mind. The people who know you and love you know not to believe any of that rubbish. I just wanted you to know you have my complete support. 
\par 
\par When did you start seeing the Bell girl? I remember Sam Bell; he worked with your mum. At any rate, this will all blow over. I have some interesting things to tell you about Wormtail\rquote 
s confession when you come to Ascog Castle, and the entire family is looking forward to meeting you.
\par 
\par --Sirius
\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par Harry smiled. The people who know you and love you....
\par 
\par He opened another letter and found, to his surprise, that this one was from Mariah Kirkner.
\par 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Dear Harry,
\par 
\par I\rquote ve used our fastest owl, so I hope this reaches you quickly. I am writing this just after reading that thing passing for journalism in the Prophet. 
No one who was in the forest blames you for Evan Davies. We know he turned on you and the rest of us. You have the support of the entire Dueling Club, and the rest of the students at Hogwarts as well. Those of us who are prefects elected you Head Boy by a
cclamation for a very good reason. I am writing to the Prophet as soon as I send this to you. They will be getting a storm of owls from the rest of the students and teachers as well. I will see to it. Say hello to Draco for me.
\par 
\par --Mariah
\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par Harry sat down on his bed with a thump. He was floored. He remembered in his fifth year when Will Flitwick declared that he wasn\rquote 
t to blame for Cho and his great-uncle being in the hospital wing, and all of Gryffindor House had joined in the show of solidarity. When he read the article he hadn\rquote 
t expected either attacks or support to come to Privet Drive from the wizarding world. Except for letters from Ron, Hermione, Sirius and Hagrid he usually didn\rquote t have much contact with the wizarding world during the summer. Even the pr
evious summer, when he was working with three other wizards, he didn\rquote t feel that his summer had any more of a wizarding component than usual.
\par 
\par There was only one owl left, which Harry recognized now as Hermes, Percy Weasley\rquote s owl, which he had received from his parents when he was made a prefect. Harry didn\rquote t remember whether Ginny had received anything in particular when she
\rquote d been made a prefect. He unrolled the parchment and read the letter.
\par 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Dear Harry,
\par 
\par I expect you\rquote ve seen the Prophet article by now. I\rquote ve had such a time getting Fred and George to shut up about it! They think it\rquote 
s riotously funny, of course. Ron and I are staying in Hogsmeade with Percy and the twins this weekend, and on Monday we\rquote re Flooing to the the Leaky Cauldron, where Hermione and Draco are supposed to meet us. Thank you for thinking of all this. I
\rquote ve never been to the cinema and I\rquote m quite looking forward to it. I hope Draco doesn\rquote t suspect anything about his party.
\par 
\par I\rquote m assuming you were only talking to Katie in that photograph, since the reporter seemed determined to make you look as terrible as possible. Katie\rquote s very nice and you\rquote re working together; I\rquote 
m sure you were just out together as friends. Why do other people have to twist things so? No one who knows you will believe any
thing in that dreadful article, and that means everyone at the school, students and teachers alike. We all know you should be Head Boy even if this Daisy Furuncle doesn\rquote t.
\par 
\par Thank you again for helping with Draco\rquote s party. I\rquote ll see you Monday night. Ron says hello and that he already wrote you last night. He\rquote 
s been spending quite a lot of time out back today with Remus Lupin doing what seem to be very strange dances. Don\rquote t ask; when I did I received an answer that made my eyes glaze over. I\rquote m sure he\rquote ll be ha
ppy to enlighten (Which is to say bore) you on Monday.
\par 
\par Love,
\par 
\par Ginny
\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par Harry stared at the letter. She didn\rquote t believe he and Katie were anything more than friends. He felt himself flush, remembering kissing her. Ginny always believed the best in everyone un
til it was absolutely proven that something else was the truth. He thought of the way she\rquote d befriended and then become more than friends with Draco Malfoy. She\rquote 
d given him a chance where many, many others never would have. What was between him and Katie? We\rquote re just dating a little, he told himself. But somehow he felt embarrassed at the idea of Ginny finding out that it was actually a date.
\par 
\par He waved Hermes out the window, still holding Ginny\rquote s letter. It sounded like Lupin was keeping Ron busy, so he wasn\rquote t surprised that he didn\rquote 
t get another letter from him. Hermione had only written to send him the article and to be snippy; she obviously believed that he was already \'93Involved\'94 with Katie. Was she upset that he seemed to be over her so quickly, or over Gi
nny? Did she even realized the depth of his feelings for Ginny?
\par 
\par He sighed, watching Hermes fly out of sight, then looking down at the letter in his hand from the girl he needed to try to forget. The final two words kept echoing in his head:
\par 
\par Love, Ginny.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par Harry managed to get through the service the next morning by daydreaming about Quidditch. He was also occasionally afforded some amusement by the fact that Draco Malfoy had no idea what he was doing and would invariably stand, sit or kneel at t
he wrong time. Several times he read words aloud from the prayer book along with Mr. Babcock, who was eying him in a very unfriendly way by the end of the service.
\par 
\par When they stood to sing the final hymn, Harry looked around while the organist played the verse through once. There weren\rquote t very many people present at all; it seemed there had been a lot more when he was young. Of course, he\rquote 
d only ever experienced Easter and Christmas services, which were well-populated. He understood now why St. Bede\rquote s could no longer afford a rector. There couldn\rquote 
t be more than twenty-five people in attendance, and four of them (Harry, Draco and the Dursleys) weren\rquote t normally there.
\par 
\par As the postlude was cranked out on the rickety-sounding organ, Mr. Babcock walked down the ai
sle of the church, his cassock slightly frayed and a haggard look on his face. Harry already felt the heat of the summer day making his white shirt stick to his back, and it was only noon. There was no ventilation in the little stone church and it felt li
ke an oven. The flowers on the communion table were already wilting. It\rquote s probably much cooler outside, Harry thought, yearning for the shade of leafy trees and cool grass to walk on barefoot.
\par 
\par But they weren\rquote t allowed outside yet. They filed into the parish hall for some weak tea, stale biscuits and tea sandwiches, and Harry grew nostalgic for the lovely soft bread with egg wash he\rquote d had after the Sabbath service at Rabbi Pelta
\rquote s synagogue. There had also been crunchy pickles and salty fish salad and crisp raw vegetables and other good food.. He watched Draco Malfoy pick desultorily at a very sad specimen of cucumber sandwich.
\par 
\par While they were drinking the horrible tea, Mr. Babcock meandered toward him and struck up a conversation. \'93Well! Some unfamiliar faces are here today,\'94
 he said, trying unsuccessfully to sound cheerful. Harry had actually made a go of listening to the sermon for a little while, but the man\rquote s voice was uniquely downbeat and he\rquote d had to tune it out or go mad. Perhaps that\rquote s what
\rquote s happened to the other parishioners, he thought.
\par 
\par \'93Well, the last time I was here was for my cousin\rquote s funeral,\'94 Harry said evenly, trying to get rid of him. Mr. Babcock looked at him now through narrowed eyes.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, yes, you\rquote re Mr. and Mrs. Dimsley\rquote s nephew--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Dursley,\'94 he correct Mr. Babcock, trying not to laugh. Maybe he wasn\rquote t so bad after all.
\par 
\par \'93Your name is Dursley? I thought it was Henry.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Er, no, my name is Harry Potter. My aunt and uncle are Mr. and Mrs. Dursley.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, right, of course, of course.\'94
\par 
\par Harry felt somewhat sorry for him; he seemed prematurely addled (Although he might be older than he looks, he thought) and was as terrible as ever at making small talk and doing simple things like remembering people\rquote 
s names and relationships. To change the subject, Harry said, \'93I saw you yesterday when that lot of people were queued up for Rodney Jeffries.\'94
\par 
\par He saw immediately that he had hit a nerve. \'93Rodney Jeffries,\'94 Mr. Babcock said bitterly. \'93Charlatan. He puts on a good show, that\rquote s all. Do you know we have virtually no choir now because he\rquote 
s taken all of the best singers to work for him while he\rquote s here? They\rquote re doing selections from stage musicals, of all things. Yes, I\rquote m sure I could attract plenty of people if we decided to perform \lquote Phantom of the Opera\rquote 
 during mass. Bread and circuses, just bread and circuses....\'94
\par 
\par \'93So,\'94 Harry began, interested in the fact that he\rquote d never seen Mr. Babcock remotely animated about anything, \'93You don\rquote t believe then that he\rquote s healed anyone?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Healed? Oh, yes, I daresay he\rquote s healed several people of hypochondria....\'94
\par 
\par \'93You think they were faking their illnesses? What about that man\rquote s burns on Bonfire Night?\'94
\par 
\par He snorted into his tea just as a balding man came upon them. \'93Who says he was ever burnt? The reports were so cloudy.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Really? So no one can corroborate the report that the man had burnt himself?\'94
\par 
\par The balding man spoke now. He looked vaguely familiar to Harry. \'93Ah, you\rquote ve gotten him going on Rodney Jeffries again, it seems.\'94
\par 
\par Mr. Babcock looked up, startled, then calmed again. \'93Oh, hello, Forbes. Harry--er--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Potter.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes, of course. Harry Potter, this is Dr. Forbes. As you can imagine, the medical community isn\rquote t exactly throwing parties in Jeffries\rquote  honour, either.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Hello, Harry. I remember you, of course. You look quite different, but I\rquote 
d know that scar anywhere. Been many years since your aunt and uncle brought you and your cousin for check-ups. I suppose once you both went off to boarding school you had your school matrons to care for you....I was so sor
ry when I heard about your cousin. My condolences.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Thank you, sir,\'94 Harry answered. He quickly changed the subject. \'93So--are you as upset about Jeffries as Mr. Babcock?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I don\rquote t know whether \lquote upset\rquote  is quite the right term....I mean, there are safegua
rds in the medical profession, you know? The government ascertains whether someone is fully educated and fit to be a doctor. If you feel you have not received competant care, you have channels you can go through for redress of grievances. Who has ascertai
ned that this Jeffries fellow is only helping people and not hurting them? Even if he convinces someone that they don\rquote 
t need a wheelchair any longer, what happens when they suddenly become convinced again that they do and go tumbling downstairs? If someone believes he has in fact hurt them instead of helping them, how do they get satisfaction?\'94
\par 
\par Harry frowned. \'93Do either of you actually know what he does when all these people come to hear him?\'94
\par 
\par Both men shook their heads. \'93No idea,\'94 Mr. Babcock said. \'93I\rquote m not about to throw away twenty pounds finding out.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Hmmm...\'94 Harry said, his hand on his chin. \'93I admit--I\rquote m curious. I don\rquote t think I believe he\rquote s really doing what people say, but I\rquote d like to at least see it, find out why people are so thoroughly conv
inced. I can tell you about it afterward, if you like.\'94
\par 
\par Mr. Babcock nodded. \'93I\rquote d appreciate that. Mind you don\rquote t get sucked into his world, though.\'94
\par 
\par Dr. Forbes agreed. \'93He\rquote s seems to be like some sort of Svengali, hypnotizing people with his eyes and whatnot. I daresay they\rquote d believe him if he told them all they were purple hippos.\'94
\par 
\par Harry thought it was possible they were exaggerating and grew more and more curious to see the real thing and judge for himself. \'93Well--I\rquote m not usually taken in by people like that. I have a pretty healthy skepticism.\'94
\par 
\par Dr. Forbes clapped him on the shoulder. \'93Good boy. That will serve you well, mark my word.\'94
\par 
\par After they returned home, Draco came with him to Dudley\rquote s room, and they were able to use Dudley\rquote s computer without Aunt Petunia hanging over them. (Harry had secretly chuckled at the way she\rquote 
d hung over Draco Malfoy in the parish hall while he ate his tea sandwiches.) Harry didn\rquote t have any trouble finding several search engines so he could attempt to locate a Sean or Ma
rgaret Dougherty. The problem was the sheer number of people with those names in Great Britain. Harry saved all of the information the search engines found so he could plow through it later and Draco went back to Mrs. Figg\rquote s (He\rquote 
d found Dudley\rquote s hand-held games machine and quickly became addicted to it--Harry let him take it with him, assuming his aunt wouldn\rquote t notice).
\par 
\par The next day Harry took Draco Malfoy\rquote s new broom out to the car when Sam and Katie picked him up for work, since Draco had taken the day o
ff. When Katie saw him she looked quite red; perhaps she had also received some owls in reference to the Prophet article. Sam turned around before starting the car and Harry braced himself, but then he saw that the older man was smiling sunnily at him.

\par 
\par \'93Have a good laugh over that Prophet article, Harry?\'94 he said, before facing front again and putting the car into gear. Harry turned in confusion to Katie, who was sitting next to her dad.
\par 
\par \'93Erm--\'94 was all he could think of. Sam laughed.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, don\rquote t worry Harry. I don\rquote t particularly care what the wizarding community thinks of me or I\rquote d spend more time in Diagon Alley than I do--which is no time at all. I didn\rquote 
t even get the Prophet or have the flat on the Floo network before this summer. Katie already explained to me that you two weren\rquote t really kissing in that photo. I know how these things work. What did you think, Harry, I\rquote 
d be hexing you as soon as you came out here this morning? If I didn\rquote t trust you I never would have suggested the two of you go out. Kati
e thought I was mad because when the tenth owl came flying into our flat Saturday night with yet another marriage proposal, I couldn\rquote 
t stop laughing for almost twenty minutes. A number of young--and some not-so-young--wizards want to rescue her from you. I\rquote ve never seen anything so funny....\'94
\par 
\par Harry swallowed and smiled feebly at Sam, who had glanced at him in the mirror, a merry look in his eyes. \'93It wasn\rquote t just what they said about Katie and me, though. They said awful things about--about why you went to 
Azkaban, and about me being responsible for Evan dying, and Cedric and Viktor Krum. And all that about Hermione and Cho being my \lquote Cast-off\rquote  girlfriends. Hermione sent me a copy of the article. She was not happy. You wouldn\rquote 
t believe the horrid letters I\rquote ve
 been getting--including some howlers. I also had three letters from friends, which made me feel a little better. My aunt and uncle were screaming back at me about the noise from the howlers--the neighbors must have thought we were having a terrific row--
\'94
\par 
\par Sam pulled onto the motorway leading to New Stokington. \'93Oh, Harry. Buck up. It\rquote ll blow over in no time. And just think--Nigel and Trevor don\rquote t know anything. You won\rquote t have to think of it at all today. And later we\rquote 
ve a party to go to. Thanks for getting a gift, by the way. I brought some wizarding money to pay for my portion and for Katie\rquote s. What kind of broom did you say it was, Katie?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Nimbus 2001,\'94 she said. \'93It\rquote s the same kind he had before, but now the price has come down. They\rquote ve a new model.\'94
\par 
\par \'93I still need to get a new broom for me, as well,\'94 Harry said. \'93My Firebolt bit the dust in the forest, like Draco\rquote s. This\rquote ll be my third broom since starting school.\'94
\par 
\par Sam shrugged. \'93I never much fancied traveling by broom. I used to Apparate a lot. Once you\rquote ve been to Azkaben, though, you get your Apparition license revoked and don\rquote t ever get it back. I haven\rquote 
t found that I miss it, actually. And by the time I was released it had been so long that I was afraid I\rquote d splinch myself if I tried. Out of practice. These days I like to keep the car in good repair, and then I feel like I can go anywhere....\'94

\par 
\par Harry leaned back, watching the other cars whip past them on the motorway (It seemed that Sam was driving very fast) and he tried to take Sam\rquote s advice about not letting the article get to him. He hadn\rquote 
t received any nasty letters on Sunday, and only two before he went running with Draco early that morning (Neither were howlers, fortunately). He wondered whether Mariah had gone through with her plan and whether,
 if the Prophet received letters of support for him, they\rquote d print them. Then he thought again about Ginny\rquote 
s letter; it was really very sweet of her to write to him and reassure him. Then he shook his head as if to dislodge this thought from it. No. I am not going to be spending my time thinking Ginny is sweet. He looked at the back of Katie\rquote s head. I
\rquote m sure you were just out together as friends. The trouble was, he wasn\rquote t so sure. Did he want it to be more? I just don\rquote t want to go for years fixating on someone who doesn\rquote t want to be with me...
\par 
\par Katie was slightly awkward around him at first when they arrived at the estate, but as the day went on, she behaved more naturally with him. While they were eating lunch, sitting near each other, Harry asked her quietly, \'93
Are you as all right about the article as your dad is?\'94
\par 
\par She blushed again now and took a bite of her sandwich. \'93I was telling the truth about the photo, of course, but, well--Dad doesn\rquote t know about--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--About the other kissing.\'94
\par 
\par \'93And about the tent in the park. And that I want to be an Auror.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, right.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Of course, I\rquote ve gotten rid of that ridiculous idea now...\'94
\par 
\par \'93Why?\'94
\par 
\par She frowned. \'93How stupid was it for me not to notice that someone was photographing us? I mean, a fine Auror I\rquote d make if I couldn\rquote t detect that...\'94
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s the sort of thing you learn in your training, I\rquote m sure. You shouldn\rquote t let that discourage you. I didn\rquote t notice either. You know, I think you\rquote re overlooking something that may indicate you\rquote 
d make a very good Auror.\'94
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par \'93
The fact that Lucius Malfoy put Imperius on you and you resisted. That stupid article aside, you and I both know that you were mad about Lee that year and the curse had very little, if any, effect on you. Except at that Christmas party you threw. If tha
t isn\rquote t an excellent indicator that you might do well as an Auror, I don\rquote t know what is. I\rquote m the only one in my class who almost overcame Imperius on my first try, in fourth year.\'94
\par 
\par \'93What do you mean?\'94
\par 
\par \'93You know, when we all thought Barty Crouch, Jr. was Moody and he was putting Imperius on us all?\'94
\par 
\par She shook her head. \'93He didn\rquote t do that with us.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Really? I didn\rquote t know that...\'94
\par 
\par \'93And what do you mean \lquote except at that Christmas party?\rquote  What did I do at the Christmas party that made you think I was after you?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, um, when we were dancing....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, that. I was trying to get Lee\rquote s attention again. We\rquote d already been seeing each other--well, I think you figured that out after I had mononucleosis.\'94 She smiled shyly. \'93
He was being a little-stand-offish for a while after that. And it was my birthday, so I was trying to get him to--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Your birthday?\'94
\par 
\par She sighed. \'93Well, I wanted a party for my seventeenth birthday, but I was shy about inviting people to a birthday party so I said it was a Christmas party. I still got my wish. I\rquote m just not as comfortable about these things as the twins; they
\rquote re so outgoing. Maybe that\rquote s why Lee and I finally fizzled--I suppose we\rquote re too different. It\rquote s just hard getting someone out of your head when you\rquote ve crushed on them for so long, and then you\rquote 
re actually a couple for a while....\'94
\par 
\par Suddenly, someone cleared a throat; it was a high-pitched clearing, and obviously for the purpose of getting their attention, not for actually t
hroat problems. A girl with strawberry-blonde hair and rather tight clothing was standing before them. Harry hadn\rquote t noticed her walking up from the house, but now he recognized her as the daughter of the people they were working for. He\rquote 
d so far only see her from a distance.
\par 
\par \'93Um--excuse me,\'94 she said in what seemed to be a very upper-crust voice. \'93You wouldn\rquote t happen know the whereabouts of Draco, would you?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Home. He took the day off, as it\rquote s his birthday,\'94 Katie told her tersely. Harry thought she sounded a little hostile and this surprised him.
\par 
\par \'93Oh--oh, that\rquote s too bad. I was--well, just tell him that Felice Harrington-Smyth wishes him many happy returns of the day.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Right,\'94 Harry said, suddenly feeling mischievous. \'93Felicia Hampton-Sims wishes him many--\'94
\par 
\par \'93No, no, Harry,\'94 said Katie, quickly catching on. \'93It\rquote s Felicity Harper-Smee--\'94
\par 
\par The girl did not look pleased. \'93That\rquote s Felice Harrington-Smyth,\'94 she said icily before walking away. Harry and Katie waited until they thought she was sufficiently distant before bursting into laughter.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, we\rquote re terrible people,\'94 Harry said, practically crying with glee.
\par 
\par \'93Horrid, awful people,\'94 Katie agreed, holding her middle, then wiping tears from her eyes.
\par 
\par \'93Have you seen her before?\'94 he asked her. She surprised him by looking rather embarrassed.
\par 
\par \'93Well--last Thursday I was going into the kitchen up at the big house so I could use the loo, and they were, um talking in the scullery. Except that they weren\rquote t talking all the time--\'94
\par 
\par \'93What do you mean?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I mean that I heard their voices--both rather unmistakable, I think you\rquote ll agree--and then the talking stopped....\'94
\par 
\par \'93You\rquote re not saying--\'94
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m saying I don\rquote t know anything. Technically I didn\rquote t see anything. I know that they\rquote ve talked and she wants to wish him a happy birthday, that\rquote s all. I didn\rquote t like to say anything because--well, I didn
\rquote t want to get your hopes up--\'94
\par 
\par He frowned. \'93Get my hopes up? That he\rquote d be cheating on Ginny?\'94
\par 
\par She sighed. \'93Yes. I mean, if they break up--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh,\'94 he said, suddenly understanding. \'93I see.\'94
\par 
\par She frowned. \'93I should have told you. I\rquote m sorry. Maybe this is good. For you. If he breaks up with Ginny--\'94
\par 
\par \'93That doesn\rquote t necessarily mean she\rquote d want to be more than friends with me,\'94 he said bitterly. \'93And anyway--we don\rquote t know they were doing anything other than talking, do we?\'94
 They were sitting very close together and speaking in low tones; Harry wondered whether she was being completely open about why she didn\rquote t mention Draco and the Harrington-Smyth girl.
\par 
\par Then he flushed the same red as Katie as Nigel and Trevor started ribbing the two of them about planning to go off into the hedge maze for some snogging, now that they\rquote d started dati
ng (The brothers had awoken from their brief lunchtime naps). Harry was startled at first, then remembered that they probably had heard Sam arranging things when they were on Privet Drive. Harry threatened to turn the hose on the two of them and they fina
lly stopped, after making loud kissing noises and and love-sick faces at Harry and Katie.
\par 
\par After Sam and Katie took him home (They kept the broom in the car) he went in to shower and change for the party. When he was coming downstairs in clean trousers and a blue-button-down shirt open at the collar, his uncle stopped him abruptly. \'93
And where do you think you\rquote re going?\'94
\par 
\par His aunt was coming out of the kitchen wearing an apron, clearly in the midst of dinner preparations.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, I, ah--Sorry I forgot to mention it, but I won\rquote t be here for dinner tonight--\'94
\par 
\par \'93To hell with you eating dinner. When is my roof going to be finished?\'94 he bellowed. Oh, Harry thought, having forgotten all about this. There was still only tar paper protecting the house.
\par 
\par \'93We\rquote ll get back to work on it tomorrow, but today\rquote s Draco\rquote s birthday, and Mrs. Figg\rquote s giving him a party. The--the lads are coming to celebrate. And Katie. I may be back late.\'94
\par 
\par Suddenly his aunt\rquote s eyes had lit up. \'93Birthday, you say? Party? At Arabella\rquote s?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Er--yeah,\'94 he said uncertainly. He didn\rquote t like the way she looked.
\par 
\par \'93Well,\'94 she said, suddenly sounding testy, \'93Why don\rquote t you have a present?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I, er--I\rquote m going in on one with Sam and Katie. They\rquote re bringing it.\'94
\par 
\par She made a harrumphing noise as though doubtful of this. He mumbled his goodbyes and managed to escape from the house, practically running to Mrs. Figg\rquote s in case they proposed coming along.
\par 
\par When he reached Mrs. Figg\rquote s block, he slowed down to a walk so he wouldn\rquote t knock on the door looking as though he\rquote d run a marathon. Katie answered the door.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, good, you\rquote re here. They\rquote re not back from London yet. Hermione is supposed to be guiding them through the process of getting a bus to Little Whinging.\'94 She smirked. \'93I can\rquote t wait to see what Draco thinks of that.\'94

\par 
\par He laughed and entered the house, and in a moment he was overwhelmed by Sirius slapping his back and giving him bear hugs. He sheepishly accepted the affection and hugged him back, remembering the article again. At least Sirius\rquote  name wasn\rquote 
t mentioned. A reporter could make quite a lot of his connection to Sirius Black.
\par 
\par \'93So,\'94 he said, dragging Harry into the living room, where he gave him a cup of punch, \'93When\rquote s the wedding?\'94 His dark eyes twinkled at Harry and Katie.
\par 
\par \'93Sirius!\'94 he exclaimed, mortified, just as Sam entered the room. \'93We aren\rquote t--\'94
\par 
\par \'93I know, Harry!\'94 he laughed. \'93I\rquote m sorry. I couldn\rquote t resist. You\rquote re not taking that seriously, I hope?\'94
\par 
\par Harry grimaced. \'93I\rquote m not very happy about it, if that\rquote s what you mean. That article as much as said that I killed three people, two of them in order to get their girlfriends, that I shouldn\rquote t be Head Boy because I\rquote 
m always flouting authority, including entering the Tournament when I was too young, and it implies that Katie went out with me because she\rquote s still under Imperius. Yeah. I\rquote m thrilled with the article. Never happier.\'94
\par 
\par Sirius laughed again, and just as the doorbell rang and Mrs. Figg went to answer it, Harry found himself face-to-face with her brother, Mad-Eye Moody. Harry grinned at his homely visage.
\par 
\par \'93Professor Moody! I didn\rquote t know you were coming!\'94
\par 
\par \'93Ah, well--I can spare some time for a crafty Slytherin who\rquote s going to be of-age,\'94 he said with a crusty grin. \'93And who\rquote s managed to put Lucius Malfoy in Azkaban,\'94 he added. \'93That doesn\rquote t hurt.\'94
\par 
\par Just then a tremendous amount of noise assaulted his ears as Hermione, Ron, Ginny and Draco spilled in the door and everyone started screaming, \'93Surprise!\'94 Harry wasn\rquote t sure he\rquote 
d ever seen Draco Malfoy look more shocked and pleased. There was general mayhem then, with Hermione looking very pleased to see Sirius and even Moody, who congratulated her upon being Head Girl (It seemed to Harry that she was avoiding him), Ron whisperi
ng to him amid the hubbub, \'93So, Katie...?\'94
 with his eyebrows dancing up and down madly, making Harry frown as he glanced at Ginny. Time seemed to stop for a moment then, and Harry almost thought someone had cast the Tempus Fugit spell, making everyone else
 in the world freeze while Ginny launched herself at him and gave him a huge hug. He held her for an agonizing moment, his nose in her hair, her warmth pressed to him, before she was gone again, laughing and talking with the others; he felt his heart turn
 over inside him. He had thought he was doing so well, too, forcing himself to get over her, and all he had to do was see her and receive one hug and he was hopelessly mooning over her again....
\par 
\par Katie walked up to him and smiled with understanding. He looked down and then up into her hazel eyes, knowing that she knew what he was feeling.
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m sorry Katie. I really am hopeless, aren\rquote t I?\'94
\par 
\par She shook her head. \'93No more than I am. You\rquote re fine, Harry. You\rquote re just human is all. Hardly a chargeable offense,\'94 she added with a smirk.
\par 
\par \'93Now don\rquote t you go harking back to that article,\'94 he warned her, \'93Or I just may--\'94
\par 
\par \'93May what?\'94 she said, a laughing challenge in her voice. But just then the doorbell rang again and Katie went to answer it. Harry looked around the room; who else was supposed to be coming? he wondered. Then he realized that Aberforth wasn\rquote 
t there yet, and reckoned that must be him.
\par 
\par It wasn\rquote t Aberforth.
\par 
\par An all-too-familiar voice wafted into the living room from the entrance hall, and to his horror, Harry looked up to see his aunt and uncle standing in the doorway.
\par 
\par \'93Harry told us that it was the dear boy\rquote s birthday, and we just wanted to stop by to give our good wishes,\'94 Aunt Petunia was saying. Harry noticed that she\rquote d taken the trouble to put on a dif
ferent dress and some fresh makeup, and that his truculent uncle did not look the least bit interested in wishing Draco Malfoy a happy birthday.
\par 
\par Very unfortunately, at that moment, the birthday boy was opening his new broom, grinning over it. When he noticed Petunia Dursley staring at him with a blank expression, he blanched (He actually had tanned a little already, so the difference was noticeabl
e). Mrs. Figg came in the room then from the dining room and also noticed her former employers standing in her living room doorway.
\par 
\par \'93Oh--oh, Petunia, dear. Um, how--how unexpected--\'94
\par 
\par But what Harry\rquote s aunt had noticed was the presence of Sirius Black.
\par 
\par \'93You!\'94 she said, her eyes wide, pointing at him. Next she noticed Hermione. \'93And you!\'94
 Hermione looked distinctly uncomfortable. Then she noticed Mad-Eye Moody and screamed at the sight of him. His sister immediately whipped out her wand and caused the still-open front door to slam shut.
\par 
\par \'93Quiet, you stupid woman! Do you want the neighbors to hear?\'94
\par 
\par Petunia Dursley turned to her now, to the woman she\rquote d always thought was a cranky old woman who hated Harry enough to make his life miserable in her place when she couldn\rquote 
t be on hand to personally oversee making his life a misery. She was pointing shakily at Arabella Figg, who still held her wand. \'93You--you too--\'94 she said feebly, with some effort, before putting her hand over her eyes and crumpling to the floor.

\par 
\par Harry\rquote s Aunt Petunia had fainted dead away.

\par 
\par 
\par To Harry\rquote s shock, Draco Malfoy dropped his new broom and leapt across the room when he saw Harry\rquote s aunt go down. Vernon Dursley shielded his wife from Draco, saying, \'93Get away from her! You--you--\'94
\par 
\par He was sputtering incoherently at the blond boy. Draco sank back on his haunches, his mouth very thin.
\par 
\par \'93I--I might be able to help--\'94 he said feebly.
\par 
\par \'93You\rquote ve helped enough!\'94 Harry\rquote s uncle bellowed at him. Harry stepped forward and put his hand on Draco\rquote s shoulder; suddenly he seemed very much like his best friend in his other life, and he was glad he\rquote 
d bought him the new broom. Harry mouthed the words \'93Thanks anyway,\'94 to him and gestured with his head to the chair where Draco had previously been sitting. He moved there obediently, looking a little put-out.
\par 
\par \'93Let\rquote s move her to the couch, Uncle Vernon,\'94 he said quietly; his uncle nodded, his mouth clamped shut as he looked desperately down at his wife. What he imagined would happen to them in a house full of witches and wizards Harry didn\rquote 
t know, but at least his uncle was letting him help.
\par 
\par Together they moved her limp body and out of the corner of his eye he noticed Mrs. Figg leaving the room. Vernon Dursley perched precariously on a small sliver of couch next to his wife, patting her hand and brushing her hair from her brow. \'93
Petunia, my sweet....wake up dearie....wake up now, please....\'94
\par 
\par Mrs. Figg was back with a small vial which she unstoppered; she started to move the vial near Petunia Dursley\rquote s face when Vernon Dursley covered his wife\rquote s mouth and bellowed, \'93
You get away from her with your vile concoctions, woman! I don\rquote t want you near my wife!\'94
\par 
\par Mrs. Figg looked down at the vial in her hand and then at Vernon, one eyebrow raised.
\par 
\par \'93It\rquote s common smelling salts, Vernon.\'94
\par 
\par He looked back at her, clearly embarrassed now. She held out the vial to him and he took it, then waved it back and forth under his wife\rquote 
s nose. Her eyes popped open and she coughed suddenly, her hand on her chest. Mrs. Figg took the vial back and stoppered it, then placed it on a nearby table.
\par 
\par Petunia Dursley\rquote s eyes were wild, taking in the roomful of people, including the gruesome visage of Mad-Eye Moody. Then she saw Arabella Figg again, and this time she looked like this was a good thing, someone familiar and reliable. \'93
Oh, Arabella,\'94 she said weakly, \'93What\rquote s going on? Did I imagine it? I thought you--\'94
\par 
\par \'93You thought I was a muggle. Of course you did, dear,\'94 she said, surprisingly warmly. \'93I meant for you to. As well as the entire village. I\rquote 
ve been here to protect Harry for a very long time. I used to divide my time between Little Whinging and Malfoy Manor, where I worked as Draco\rquote s nanny--\'94 she nodded at the blond Slytherin \'93
--but when I was sacked by the Malfoys because they thought Draco was too old for a nanny I moved here full time.\'94
\par 
\par Petunia raised herself up tentatively. \'93Do--do you all live here?\'94 she asked shakily. I see, Harry thought. She wants to know how bad the local infestation is.
\par 
\par \'93No, Petunia, only Draco is living with me. The others have come from all over the country--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--And Scotland,\'94 Sirius cut in.
\par 
\par \'93--}{\f1\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 A}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ll over the island of Great Britain,\'94 she went on, glaring at Sirius, as though daring him to argue that the Isle of Bute was not part of the island of Great Britain, 
\'93To celebrate Draco\rquote s birthday. We didn\rquote t exactly expect you to walk in, you understand.\'94
\par 
\par Harry saw his aunt swallow. She looked at Draco now, a look of great disappointment clearly showing on her face. Then she seemed to be really looking at Draco.
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote ve seen you before,\'94 she said softly. \'93I mean before this summer....\'94
\par 
\par Draco nodded. \'93Yes. I was one of the pall-bearers for your son\rquote s funeral. Harry brought me,\'94 he said quietly.
\par 
\par She nodded, as though she understood now; Harry had wondered why she hadn\rquote t realized this earlier, but had put it down to her being so grief-stricken during the funeral that she hadn\rquote t been pa
ying very close attention to what was occurring around her. She looked up at her husband now and whispered, \'93Help me to stand. I want to go home.\'94
\par 
\par Vernon Dursley was unable to help her to rise unassisted, so Harry stepped forward and took her other arm. To his surprise, she let him. They moved toward the doorway to the living room, and Harry called over his shoulder, \'93I\rquote 
ll be back. Save me some cake.\'94
\par 
\par It took longer than Harry would have thought to slowly walk his aunt the two blocks to Privet Drive and up to her bed. Harry stood by awkwardly while Vernon Dursley took off his wife\rquote s shoes.
\par 
\par \'93Um, I\rquote m going back to the party now. She looks like she\rquote ll be all right now.\'94
\par 
\par His uncle turned a gimlet eye on him. \'93You\rquote ve been keeping things from us, boy. We\rquote ll talk about this tomorrow.\'94
\par 
\par Harry drew his mouth into a line, not looking forward to this talk. \'93Yes, sir,\'94 he said softly before turning to leave. He wasn\rquote t feeling inclined to argue; it was amazing, really, that his aunt and uncle had gone this long withou
t finding out about Mrs. Figg and Draco Malfoy. He couldn\rquote t recall whether they\rquote d taken notice of Sam and Katie. Thank goodness Aberforth wasn\rquote t there yet, he thought.
\par 
\par He walked back to Mrs. Figg\rquote s house with his shoulders hunched, not feeling like he was in a party mood. His spirits lifted when he saw Katie waiting by the gate for him. When he was close enough she stood on her toes to kiss him on the cheek.

\par 
\par \'93You look like someone\rquote s died,\'94 she said, her voice very matter-of-fact.
\par 
\par \'93Not someone, something. It\rquote s the end of an era. And I have to have a talk with my uncle tomorrow because of it.\'94 He sighed and she laced her fingers through his.
\par 
\par \'93Come inside and try to cheer up. We\rquote ve saved some cake for you and you\rquote ve been spared hearing my father throw everyone off-key during For He\rquote s a Jolly Good Fellow.\'94
\par 
\par He smiled at her, but then he saw that there was a shadow behind her eyes. \'93What\rquote s wrong, Katie? Why were you waiting out here? I could have changed my mind and decided not to come back tonight.\'94
\par 
\par She shrugged. \'93I just wanted to get away from the party. I\rquote ve had--something on my mind.\'94 He waited, and after a minute\rquote s pause, it all came tumbling out--Lee had sent her an owl when she\rquote d gone home from work that evening.

\par 
\par \'93And it was just innocuous, really, just a friendly note to say that the business is going really well and I should come up to Hogsmeade to visit some time this summer and that Angelina misses me--\'94
 She sniffled and Harry saw now that her eyes were red-rimmed. \'93Not that he misses me, not that I should go up to visit him. I should come up to visit the lot of them, I should know that Angelina misses me.\'94
 She swiped at an errant tear. Harry hesitated only for a moment before he gathered her to him; her head rested comfortably just below his chin and she put her arms around him, making him feel a slight jolt from the contact.
\par 
\par They didn\rquote t speak but just stood in silent communion. Harry felt a light breeze lifting his hair and her warm breath through his shirt. He knew just how she felt; this was how he\rquote 
d been earlier, when Ginny had hugged him, and Katie had been so understanding....
\par 
\par He felt tempted to kiss her for a moment, but he decided not to, as he didn\rquote t know whether her father might be looking out of one of the windows o
f the house. Instead he pulled back from her and handed her a handkerchief to dry her eyes. As she did so, he smiled at her with understanding, saying, \'93We\rquote re quite a pair, yeah?\'94
\par 
\par She nodded, smiling ruefully at him before blowing her nose. She pocketed his handkerchief and they walked toward the house hand-in- hand; they didn\rquote t need to say anything else. The walking wounded easily recognized each other.
\par 
\par Inside, the party was surprisingly noisy; Harry wondered whether Mrs. Figg had put a silencing charm on the walls of the house so the neighbors wouldn\rquote 
t hear and come investigating, or send the police investigating. All they needed was a muggle police officer walking in and seeing someone doing magic. Perhaps after the episode with his Aunt Petunia, Mrs. Figg decided there\rquote 
d been enough revelations for the night.
\par 
\par Aberforth had arrived since he'd left and was in the living room now; the conversation between him, Sam, Remus and Sirius was so loud it was making Harry\rquote s head hurt. They kept overlapping each ot
her with their loud comments and laughing even louder, and Harry began to doubt that they had the same harmless punch in their paper cups that he had in the one Katie had handed him when they\rquote d returned to the fray.
\par 
\par Mrs. Figg was speaking to her brother, 
Draco and Ginny in a corner of the dining room; evidently, Draco was regaling them with the story of the bouncing ferret himself. (That was fair, Harry thought. He owns the story, he should tell it). He seemed to have gotten over his fear of giving his ol
d nanny "Ideas." Moody was laughing uproariously, his cracked face contorted beyond recognition as human. Ginny met Harry\rquote s eye for a heartbreaking moment; he looked away first, feeling annoyed with himself. He decided to find Ron and Hermione.

\par 
\par They were i
n the kitchen; Hermione was cutting some more slices of cake. Ron was sitting on the opposite side of the table from her, shoveling cake into his mouth and looking as though he was using the table as a shield, to separate the two of them. She looked up at
 Harry stonily when he entered with Katie. Ron didn\rquote t notice Hermione\rquote s reaction but came bounding over to him, grinning. \'93Harry! You\rquote 
ll never guess what! Later in the summer the Holyhead Harpies are playing the Chudley Cannons on the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch, and Percy and the twins said if we want to come up for the match, they\rquote ll put us up. Isn\rquote t that brilliant?\'94

\par 
\par Harry remembered going to Quidditch games with his stepfather in his other life, and he grinned. \'93The Holyhead Harpies are my favourite team!\'94 he responded enthusiastically. Ron frowned.
\par 
\par \'93Since when? I thought you were a Cannons fan, like me?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, when I became your friend, I had to take your word for it when it came to Quidditch teams, didn\rquote t I? Maybe I\rquote ve changed my mind about my favourite.\'94
 Then he grinned mischievously, to show he was joking. He found that his other life crept in at the most unpredictable times. What\rquote s my favourite Quidditch team? The Holyhead Harpies. It was just reflex. It was also e
asy to forget that no one else knew about his other life--except for Severus Snape and Albus Dumbledore.
\par 
\par Ron grinned, showing that he got the joke (And showing, by his discolored teeth, that this wasn\rquote t the first serving of chocolate cake he\rquote d had). He\rquote d 
just opened his mouth to say something else, looking very excited, when Hermione came up to him and put her hand on his arm. He flinched so drastically that the cake on the plate in his hand went flying and then he was desperately rushing to clean it up, 
shaking off Hermione impatiently. Harry saw her look of hostility turn to hurt, and he looked at Katie and motioned to Hermione with his head; Katie immediately understood. She helped Ron clean up the mess, then said, \'93
Have you talked to my dad yet, Ron? Come on out and say hello...\'94
\par 
\par Harry stood in Hermione\rquote s path when she attempted to follow them out of the kitchen. She glared up at him. \'93We have to talk, Hermione,\'94 he said simply. Her glare did not waver. He took her upper arm in his hand and steered her 
toward the back door and out into the garden. She sat on a bench, her hands grasping her upper arms as though she were cold, looking obstinately away from him.
\par 
\par He stood looking at her, arms crossed, waiting. Finally, he grew tired of this and said to her, \'93Out with it.\'94 She looked up at him, a little less hostile, but no more talkative than she had been. He grew exasperated. \'93
Oh, come on, Hermione, you know how so-called journalists warp things. Remember that Witch Weekly article Snape read in Potions class? Was any of that true?\'94 Silence. \'93Cut it out, Hermione. Enough with the silent treatment. I know it\rquote 
s the article. What exactly are you most upset about?\'94
\par 
\par She looked up at him. \'93Yes, I\rquote m upset. Do you want to know why? Do you? Do you?\'94 Her voice rose in pitch with each repetition. Harry frowned and backed off a little.
\par 
\par \'93Erm--yeah.\'94
\par 
\par \'93All right. Let\rquote s just go back to the Yule Ball in fourth year, shall we? Does that prat ask me, even though I know he likes me? No, he does not. And does Viktor ask me beca
use he likes me? No, it turns out Crouch engineered that, too. And just when I decide to let go of the whole idea of Ron because he was just too immature for words, you seem like you might be interested in me, and I\rquote 
m scared to do anything about it, but then I\rquote m under the influence of a potion that acts like Imperius. And even then, I had to use the excuse of teaching you to kiss Cho Chang to get you to kiss me the first time. Then you blame me for Dudley
\rquote s dying--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Hermione--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--And Ron has to convince you to make up with me. And then he finally admits how he feels about me, and it turns out he\rquote 
s told you to break up with me. And then you do, giving me to him like a neatly-wrapped birthday present. And what does he do? Walks away. Then he goes and--\'94 her voice caught for a moment. \'93
--offers himself to the spiders in my place, the great brave git, and we have a few minutes of real happiness. Then he gets bitten by a werewolf, and the next day he wants nothing to do with me. And then today we go to a film 
in London, almost like a real date, except that we\rquote re really babysitting his sister--who needs no babysitting--and I can\rquote t even get him to put his arm around me while we\rquote re in the theatre. He\rquote s been friendly, oh yes; he\rquote 
s been conversational and polite. But he hasn\rquote t been a boyfriend by any stretch of the imagination, and I\rquote m starting to think it\rquote s the last thing he wants!\'94
\par 
\par Her voice had risen again. Harry stared at her helplessly; her chest was heaving with emotion. She wasn\rquote t done yet. \'93So forgive me if I\rquote m feeling rejected in general when, on top of Ron\rquote 
s persistent refusal to even try for us to have a relationship, I open the Evening Prophet on Friday night and discover a picture of you snogging Katie Bell as though you hadn\rquote t a care in the world. And then there\rquote 
s an article describing me as a \lquote Cast-off\rquote  girlfriend of yours. I\rquote m a cast-off, all right. I\rquote ve been rejected by Harry Potter and his best friend, and a world-famous Quidditch player--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--Who you were actually rejecting--\'94 he reminded her.
\par 
\par "Whom I was rejecting," she corrected him. "And the one nice bloke who asked me to the Yule Ball now has a thing for Ginny--\'94
\par 
\par Harry furrowed his brow. \'93Who?\'94
\par 
\par She looked up at him. \'93Oh, you\rquote ll be glad to know that you have company in the Pining-for-Ginny-Weasley club.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Wh-what? P-pining for G-ginny--?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Nice Quirrell impression, Harry. Yes. Pining for Ginny. What, do you think I\rquote m stupid? Ron, on the other hand....Yes, I love him, but I also just want to throttle him sometimes. If he hadn\rquote 
t told you to break up with me, you probably would have done it much sooner. And yes, I still would have been hacked off at you, because that\rquote s still a blow to a girl\rquote s self-esteem. But it would have passed, and at least I wouldn\rquote 
t have felt like I was having to kidnap you to go up to Fluffy\rquote s old lair. That didn\rquote t exactly do wonders for my self-esteem either. But, of course, you\rquote re as stubborn as he is, so you didn\rquote 
t do exactly what you wanted to do just because he wanted you to do it as well; you decided to be contrary. Gah! Sometimes I don\rquote t know why I\rquote ve bothered with the pair of you....\'94
\par 
\par He drew his lips together. \'93I\rquote m sorry, Hermione. You\rquote re right; it wasn\rquote t fair for me to stay with you when I felt the way I did about her, and I was just being contrar
y. I should have ended it a lot sooner, and then you and Ron would have had a chance to really be a couple, and maybe he never would have been bitten--\'94
\par 
\par She grimaced and crossed her leg, jiggling it impatiently. \'93Yes, well, it\rquote s rather late for that now, isn\rquote t it?\'94
\par 
\par \'93And anyway--who are you talking about? Who else is in this Pining-for-Ginny-Weasley club? Other than Jules Quinn, and she\rquote s known he has a crush on her since he was a first year.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Are you blind? Oh, I forget--you are blind. I\rquote m amazed that you didn\rquote 
t fail everything this year--you were in another world constantly. I mean Neville, of course. He asked her to the Ball after I turned him down, remember? I think I should have lied to Viktor and told him I\rquote d already accepted Neville\rquote 
s invitation. Then maybe I\rquote d have a perfectly nice, normal boyfriend right now who wouldn\rquote t be so interested in rejecting me...\'94
\par 
\par Harry sighed and sat down next to her. \'93Hey. Come here.\'94 He opened his arms wide and she hesitated a moment before climbing into them. I seem to be in the business of comforting girls pining after other blokes tonight, he thought. \'93
You know I didn\rquote t reject you; I simply recognized our relationship for what it was: something that grew out of an unnatural situation--you know, that Imperius Potion--and just a bit of curiosity. I mean, we\rquote 
re only human, and being such good friends and otherwise thinking of people of the opposite sex as fair game for dating, probably sooner or later we\rquote d have wondered whether we should try to make a go of it. If you and Ron weren\rquote 
t dating, that is. So it\rquote s just as well we\rquote ve gotten all that out of our systems. I really want us to be good friends again. I miss you dreadfully,\'94 he said, tightening his grip on her and putting his cheek on the top of her head.
\par 
\par She put her arms around his waist. \'93Oh, Harry, so do I. I suppose you must think I\rquote m a vain idiot, but--but I have been feeling so rejected--it\rquote s hard. I look in the mirror and I say, \'93I\rquote 
m Head Girl of Hogwarts. I have marks most of the teachers probably didn\rquote t get when they were in school. I\rquote ve helped you in first, third, fifth and sixth years when you were fighting evil, and I helped you a bit during the Tournament, too.
\'94
\par 
\par \'93And don\rquote t forget that even when you were Petrified in second year, if I hadn\rquote t found that torn page about the basilisk in your hand, we never would have understood what we were up against.\'94
\par 
\par She blushed and looked pleased now. \'93You don\rquote t know how glad I was to see you and Ron when I woke up. Especially--well, I could especially tell that he was glad I was all right--\'94 She ducked her head bashfully again. \'93But I--I didn\rquote 
t want to acknowledge any feelings I might have had for him yet. We were so young....\'94
\par 
\par \'93...And you were still crushing on Lockhart...\'94
\par 
\par She pulled back and hit him on the chest, but it didn\rquote t hurt and she was grinning. \'93I was twelve years old! You\rquote re never going to let me forget what an idiot I was over him, are you?\'94
\par 
\par He grinned back at her. \'93It will haunt you for the rest of your life. Just accept it. You can needle me about Cho and Ron about Fleur Delacour, if that\rquote s any comfort.\'94
\par 
\par She looked at him earnestly. \'93Promise me something, Harry.\'94
\par 
\par He calmed down and looked soberly back at her. \'93Anything.\'94 And the moment he said it, he realized that he meant it.
\par 
\par \'93Promise me that no matter what happens, the three of us will always stay friends. If Ron and I don\rquote t--well, you know. I want the three of us to always be friends, to be there for each other.\'94
\par 
\par He nodded, then rested his brow against hers. \'93Absolutely.\'94 She looked back at him, her brown eyes very close to his.
\par 
\par \'93Harry?\'94 she whispered.
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94 he whispered back, unable to look away from her.
\par 
\par \'93When school starts, the first time you accompany Ron during the full moon--I want to come, too.\'94
\par 
\par Now he pulled back from her in horror. \'93Hermione--no! I know you want the three of us to be friends always, but--even in my griffin form--I can\rquote 
t guarantee that I could keep Ron from tearing you apart! I mean, if he's taken the potion and it works, there shouldn't be a prob
lem--but you can never be too careful. I think that even if he's had the potion, if he's in his wolf form and bites you, even a small nip, you could become a werewolf.\'94 He stopped suddenly, a horrible thought coming to him. \'93
Is that it? You want to become a werewolf too? No, Hermione, you don\rquote t know what you\rquote re suggesting--\'94
\par 
\par She hit him again, a little less playfully than before. \'93Neither do you, you great prat. I don\rquote t want to become a werewolf! Let\rquote s see--what would you say if I told you that Professor M
cGonagall is staying with us this summer and giving me private tuition in something she\rquote d been teaching me all last year--\'94 She paused, watching his face, waiting for the realization to dawn on him. When it finally did, she laughed out loud.

\par 
\par \'93Hermione! That\rquote s wonderful! But--what form will you take?\'94
\par 
\par She sat back and folded her arms across her chest. \'93That\rquote s a secret. You\rquote ll see at the first full moon after the term starts. Minerva reckons I\rquote ll be ready by then. I\rquote m afraid I\rquote m not quite as quick about thi
s as you. Good as I am at Transfiguration, the challenge is to also be very aware of one\rquote s body, and I\rquote m afraid you\rquote ve got me beat there, Harry. It\rquote s probably one reason why you\rquote 
re a natural flyer and I hate to get any higher than six feet off the ground.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Minerva?\'94
\par 
\par She smiled. \'93I\rquote ll be going back to \lquote Professor McGonagall\rquote  in September, but during the summer she suggested that we could be a little more informal. After all, she\rquote 
s a guest in my home. She and Mum get along famously. Oh, and do you know this summer is only the second time I\rquote ve ever seen her in her muggle clothes?\'94
\par 
\par He furrowed his brow. \'93What\rquote s that like? And what was the first time?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, you know. When she came to our house just after I got my Hogwarts letter. They have to make sure muggle-borns know it\rquote s not some elaborate practical joke, you know. I mean, did you credit it the first time you read your letter?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well--they didn\rquote t do it quite the same with me. I think it was assumed that my aunt and uncle had told me about my parents being
 a witch and a wizard and all that. The letters just kept coming, the address changing each time because Uncle Vernon packed us up and tried to outrun them, until finally Hagrid showed up and started doing magic and handed me the letter and explained to m
e about my mum and dad--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Hagrid? Doing magic? It's one thing at Hogwarts, like when he was getting his pumpkins to grow really large...and I didn't really approve of it then, but Ron had just been coughing up slugs, and I really didn't want to get into a
n argument with Hagrid....\'94
\par 
\par Harry drew his lips together. \'93I shouldn\rquote t have said that--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Now you sound like him. He\rquote s not allowed to do magic, Harry. You and Ron and I know that he shouldn\rquote t have been expelled, but technically he hasn\rquote t received a full magical education and he isn\rquote t a credentialed wizard--\'94

\par 
\par \'93Hermione, I know you\rquote re Head Girl now, but this is ancient history. He doesn\rquote t do much magic, okay? And actually, he was given permission to use magic until he found me. We were talking about you and McGonagall.\'94
\par 
\par So she explained to him that seconds after her Hogwarts letter was dropped in her lap while she was playing in the courtyard at the center of her house, Professor McGonagall had rung the doorbell dressed in a severe plaid 
skirted suit with a very high-collared blouse. Hermione noticed right away that the brooch she wore at her throat had the same seal as on the envelope she\rquote d just received. McGonagall had introduced herself briskly to Hermione\rquote 
s parents, took a seat without being asked and proceeded to explain to the shocked dentists that their daughter was a witch and had been accepted to Hogwarts.
\par 
\par \'93How did they take it?\'94
\par 
\par \'93About the way most parents of muggle-borns do, I suppose. They sort of slapped their heads and said, \lquote That explains so much!\rquote 
 You know; my accidental magic from when I was young. She did a little magic to actually convince them, of course, because there was still the chance that they might think she was putting one over on them.\'94
\par 
\par \'93What did she do?\'94
\par 
\par Hermione smiled. \'93Her favourite trick, of course. The Animagus Transfiguration. I knew then and there that I wanted to be able to do that some day.\'94
\par 
\par He pulled her to him in a hug. \'93Oh, Hermione--it would be perfect for you to be with us during the full moon. That\rquote s how it should be--all three of us together again.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Here, here, now. What\rquote s this? Should I go to get Katie?\'94
\par 
\par Harry looked up into Ron\rquote s face; although he had a light tone to his voice, Harry saw the look behind his eyes. He\rquote d seen him and Hermion
e embracing and he wondered whether they might be considering getting back together. Even though he was avoiding Hermione, it was still clear how he felt about her.
\par 
\par Harry looked at both of them. \'93You both do realize that it was Katie\rquote s dad that fixed us up? It didn\rquote t even occur to me to ask her out myself. And I think it took him all of three seconds after that to say, \lquote 
My daughter is going out with Harry Potter!\rquote  I mean--it\rquote s not that I don\rquote t like Katie. But we\rquote re just trying to date a little--it\rquote s not a big deal. Don\rquote t make it one, okay? In a few weeks I won\rquote 
t even be living in England, for pete\rquote s sake.\'94 His voice shook and he wasn\rquote t sure whether he was trying to convince them or himself.
\par 
\par Ron laughed. \'93Take it easy, Harry. Can\rquote t you take a joke?\'94
\par 
\par Harry grimaced. \'93If one more person asks me that--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Anyway,\'94 Ron said, interrupting, \'93I\rquote m out here because Malfoy told me the two of you had been using Dudley\rquote s old computer to try to find someone named Margaret Dougherty. Is--\'94 His voice caught. \'93Is that who I think it is?
\'94
\par 
\par Harry nodded. \'93I don\rquote t know anything yet, though, Ron, so don\rquote t get your hopes up. You didn\rquote t tell Malfoy who you thought it was, did you?\'94
\par 
\par \'93No. Why?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Because I didn\rquote t tell him either, so unless Ginny\rquote s told him, he doesn\rquote t know. Not that he can\rquote t know, I guess; in fact, there\rquote s no reason why he can\rquote 
t, really. He could even help us get to her if we find her; he knows how to drive. Maybe Mrs. Figg would let us use her car....\'94
\par 
\par Hermione frowned. \'93What?\'94 Harry explained to her that he\rquote d told Ron about his missing sisters.
\par 
\par \'93You knew?\'94 Ron said to her. \'93Why didn\rquote t you tell me?\'94 He sounded as upset now as he had been when Harry had first told him.
\par 
\par \'93You knew that she knew, Ron. I told you. Or did you forget when you decided to attack the wall in the infirmary?\'94
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94 Hermione said again, frowning.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, that was his extremely mature reaction to finding out about his sisters; punch the wall really hard.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Okay, okay, we\rquote ve established that I have a temper. This is news?\'94 Ron sai
d, running his hand through his hair, making it stand wildly on end. The white lock of hair over his brow that appeared the morning after Remus Lupin bit him stood out amid the red even more when he did this. \'93
I still think you could have told me, Hermione,\'94 he said, calming down a bit and instead sounding rather hurt. \'93Why didn\rquote t you?\'94 he added, a slightly belligerent edge to his voice again.
\par 
\par \'93Because--because I thought you would behave exactly the way you are now!\'94 she shot back hotly. \'93What good would it have done? I didn\rquote t know anything useful I could tell you and I knew it would just upset you.\'94 She turned to Harry. \'93
How do you know she\rquote s going by Margaret Dougherty, by the way?\'94
\par 
\par He swallowed. \'93I--I found out last year. Listen--I know I was being very weird all last year--there\rquote s a good reason for it and I plan to tell you what that is. But tonight isn\rquote t the best time. I\rquote ll explain when the term starts. I
\rquote ll bring my Pensieve with me to school and then I can show both of you.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Your Pensieve? Why a Pensieve?\'94
\par 
\par He sighed and looked at her sadly. \'93Because if I couldn\rquote t prove it to you with something very concrete, the pair of you would probably have me locked up in St. Mungo\rquote s, that\rquote s why.\'94
\par 
\par Ron laughed and pulled Harry and Hermione back toward the house; he was so strong it was impossible to resist. \'93And what makes you think we won\rquote t put you in St. Mungo\rquote s anyway?\'94
\par 
\par The three of them entered the house again, laughing, and soon after, Harry disentangled himself, going to the downstairs toilet, but finding the door locked. He shrugged to himself and bounded up the stairs to use the hall bathroom, but that was also lock
ed. He was about to cut through Mrs. Figg\rquote s room to use her en suite bath when he heard voices coming from Draco\rquote s room; the door was slightly ajar.
\par 
\par \'93We can\rquote t, Draco! The house is full of people!\'94
\par 
\par \'93Come on, Ginny, I can do magic whenever I want now. I can put a silencing charm on--\'94
\par 
\par \'93It\rquote s not that! I--I just don\rquote t feel comfortable--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Bloody hell. You NEVER feel comfortable.\'94 He sounded bitter.
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s not fair. If Sprout hadn\rquote t interrupted us in the greenhouse--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Then you wouldn\rquote t still be a virgin and maybe you\rquote d be a little less uptight.\'94
\par 
\par \'93--}{\f1\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 T}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 hen I could be pregnant, since I hadn\rquote t had the potion yet. We\rquote re lucky she interrupted us before we did something really stupid. And I also don\rquote 
t know how I can ever look her in the face again. She once implied that I\rquote m too good a girl to ever need Prophylaxis Potion, you know that? When she walked in I was mortified. I was in my bra and knickers! And we\rquote 
re lucky it was the end of term and she decided not to give us both enough detentions to last us until we\rquote re out of school. As it is, she gave us both more summer Herbology homework than I think I\rquote ve had in the last five years combined....
\'94
\par 
\par \'93I don\rquote t care about that. Frankly, when she walked in I was tempted to ask her whether she\rquote s a voyeur, since stopping that was the closest thing to torture I\rquote ve experienced since my dad went to Azkaban.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Stop saying that! I wasn\rquote t trying to torture you. I\rquote m not trying to torture you. But we can\rquote t do anything right now beyond a little kissing. It\rquote s a good thing that we didn\rquote 
t finish what we started in the greenhouse. And frankly, right now I\rquote m not exactly feeling like kissing you.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Ginny,\'94 he said in a wheedling voice. \'93It\rquote s my birthday--\'94
\par 
\par Before Harry knew what was happening, she had flung open the door, but she stopped short when she saw him standing right outside. She pulled the door shut behind her immediately, turning bright red. Harry thought it might be so that Draco Malfoy wouldn
\rquote t see him.
\par 
\par \'93We were just--I mean we weren\rquote t--I mean--\'94
\par 
\par Harry wasn\rquote t any less embarrassed. \'93I\rquote m--I\rquote m just waiting to use th-the loo--\'94 he stammered. She looked like she was still casting about for something to say.
\par 
\par \'93Erm--why don\rquote t you wear your basilisk amulet any more, Harry?\'94 she asked in a brighter voice, trying to pretend that she didn\rquote t know perfectly well that he\rquote 
d heard the conversation between her and Draco Malfoy. She nodded at the space on his chest where the amulet normally would have rested. Harry frowned.
\par 
\par \'93You don\rquote t know?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Know what?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I gave both of them to Malf--er, Draco. He was supposed to give one to you.\'94 He couldn\rquote t prevent the blush that came over him then. \'93You know--you said it was a kind of \lquote couple\rquote  thing to do, two people wearing them--\'94

\par 
\par She looked down and away. \'93Oh,\'94 was the only response he received before she turned and walked down the stairs without looking at him. Should he have said that? he wondered, then he looked at the closed bedroom door. Serves him right.
\par 
\par Then another thought occurred to him and it made him smile; suddenly his heart felt much lighter.
\par 
\par Ginny hadn\rquote t slept with Draco Malfoy.
\par 
\par The bathroom door opened abruptly and Katie stepped out. She looked like she\rquote d been crying again and trying to hide it by throwing cold water on her face.
\par 
\par \'93Oh--Harry. Sorry. I didn\rquote t mean to make you wait.\'94 She stopped when she saw the expression on his face. \'93What are you so happy about?\'94
\par 
\par He couldn\rquote t contain himself; he spoke in a hurried whisper. \'93I just heard--Ginny and Draco didn't--didn't--\'94 Suddenly he stopped and reddened again. \'93Sorry. You don\rquote t want to hear this.\'94
\par 
\par \'93You mean there\rquote s been no shagging?\'94 she said in a hushed voice. \'93Harry, if I expected you to not be happy about that, knowing how you feel about her--well you\rquote re not made of stone, are you?\'94
 Listening to her soft voice, he suddenly felt like a dreadful cad.
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m sorry, Katie. You must hate me now.\'94
\par 
\par She put her finger over his mouth; she was standing very close to him. \'93We both know each other. Stop apologizing. If you keep that up it just means I\rquote ll have to apologize every time Lee crosses my mind in any way. It\rquote 
s all right, Harry. So--it\rquote s very important to you that they haven\rquote t--you know--is it?\'94
\par 
\par He swallowed. All this time he\rquote d thought they had. Knowing now that they hadn\rquote t was very strange. \'93I--I don\rquote t know. I honestly don\rquote t know.\'94
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par The rest of the party was more enjoyable than Harry thought it would be. He talked to Ron and Hermione about Rodney Jeffries and the milkman, and Hermi
one got that look on her face that said she was going to start researching something (It was a pity, he thought, that she didn\rquote t have access to the Hogwarts library during the summer). She also said she\rquote 
d find out what she could about anyone in Britain with the name Margaret Dougherty. It felt so right to be able to talk to Ron and Hermione this way again, even if they weren\rquote t behaving quite naturally with each other. That would take time.
\par 
\par When he returned home from work the next evening, bringing Aberfort
h and the rest of them back to continue working on the roof, his uncle pulled him aside while the others started putting up ladders. Nigel and Trevor went to the shed to get the new shingles that Harry\rquote s uncle had purchased.
\par 
\par \'93I told you we need to talk, boy,\'94 he growled out of the corner of his mouth; now that he knew that Sam and Draco were wizards and Katie a witch, he seemed very nervous about having them working on his house. Harry sighed.
\par 
\par \'93What do you want to know?\'94
\par 
\par Vernon jerked his head at the lot of them. \'93Are they all--all--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--Like me?\'94 His uncle nodded. \'93No. You know about Katie and her dad, and about Draco. Nigel and Trevor aren\rquote t, and they don\rquote t know about the rest of us. And Dick--\'94 Harry hesitated. \'93Well, he\rquote s not muggle either. He
\rquote s Aberforth Dumbledore, my headmaster\rquote s brother. And before you lose it, he likes living in the muggle world, and so does Sam. They may be--like me--but they work hard for a living like any non-magical person. Aberforth and Sam, well--there
\rquote s a lot of people in the wizarding world who don\rquote t like them, and whom they don\rquote t like. It\rquote s rather mutual. They do this by choice.\'94
\par 
\par Vernon Dursley surveyed the work with a suspicious expression, uncertain whether to trust Harry\rquote s words. \'93And Figg?\'94
\par 
\par \'93What about her?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Who else knows about her?\'94
\par 
\par \'93No muggles know about her but you and Aunt Petunia. She goes to church, does her shopping, takes her daily constitutional down to the park in the afternoon, she has a bunch of cats, watches the telly in the evening....Perfectly normal old woman.\'94

\par 
\par Uncle Vernon looked like he wanted to argue about this, but suddenly his wife came striding out the front door, dressed in a smart skirted suit and looking very determined. Her husband sputtered, \'93P-petunia! Where are you going, my sweet?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Down to the village. Poor Agnes Bringhurst has twisted her ankle and I\rquote m going to help her with her tea and pick up her house for her a little. I shall be back by ten. The pair of you can manage your own tea, I presume? I bought sausages today.
\'94 She didn\rquote t wait for an answer, but strode off down Privet Lane.
\par 
\par Harry frowned. Since when did Aunt Petunia like Agnes Bringhurst? Or go out in the evening? Had someone taken Polyjuice Potion to look like his aunt? he wondered. He saw that his uncle was as puzzled
 as he was. Vernon Dursley seemed to have forgotten that he was speaking to Harry about something important and instead wandered into his house in a daze, closing the door quietly behind him.
\par 
\par Harry felt he was on edge all of the time now; at home, his aun
t and uncle were doing a cautious kind of dance around each other, and every evening, his aunt went out, claiming that she was visiting Agnes Bringhurst. His uncle did his best to avoid any of them when they came to work on the roof in the early evening. 
Thank goodness we\rquote re almost done, Harry thought.
\par 
\par At work, he was on edge for a different reason. He found himself being more and more sensitive to the times when it seemed Draco Malfoy and Felice Harrington-Smyth might be alone together, although he had no idea what he would do if he caught them in flag
rante. Finally, on Friday, when most of them were lounging on the grass after lunch, soaking up the anemic mid-day sun, Harry happened to sit up to slap a bug on his leg and saw the two of them enter the hedge maze, looking around surreptitiously.
\par 
\par Katie wa
s lying back on the grass to his left. He tapped her shoulder and pointed at the maze. He mouthed the names Draco and Felice. Harry rose and crept toward the maze, Katie right behind him. When they were in the maze, the tall hedges seemed to shut out the 
noise of the outside world. They moved further and further toward the interior, and eventually they heard an unmistakable noise: a human being moaning in passion. Katie\rquote s eyes opened wide.
\par 
\par \'93Why, that bastard,\'94 she breathed.
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s my line,\'94 Harry said grimly. They heard the girl\rquote 
s cries keening higher and higher; he remembered hearing Niamh Quirke and Draco Malfoy in the Hogwarts library in his other life and wished Malfoy could have at least found a quiet girl to shag, like Niamh--No, wait, he thought. He\rquote 
s not supposed to be shagging anyone.. He put his hand on Katie\rquote s arm and started pulling her back the way they\rquote d come. She actually looked a little glazed-over.
\par 
\par \'93Wow,\'94 she said; it seemed to pop out of her mouth against her will. \'93She really--um--seems to be enjoying herself--\'94
\par 
\par He raised one eyebrow. \'93Thinking of going after him yourself now? I thought he was a bastard.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, he\rquote s still that,\'94 she said musingly, looking over her shoulder for a moment. Then she looked irritated with herself. \'93He\rquote s definitely that. Poor Ginny! What will she say when she finds out? What will she do?\'94
\par 
\par Harry stood looking at the maze grimly. Thankfully, now that they were outside its enveloping walls they could no longer hear the amorous couple. \'93Who says she\rquote s going to find out?\'94 he heard himself saying.
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I said--\'94
\par 
\par \'93I heard what you said. I just thought--I thought you\rquote d enjoy telling her about this. This could be your chance, after all.\'94
\par 
\par \'93You thought I\rquote d enjoy hurting her like this? And why should she credit anything I have to say about him anyway? It\rquote s not like I have any ulterior motives--Oh, wait. That\rquote 
s right--I do. If Ginny knew about this--well, I just hate to think how she\rquote d feel--\'94
\par 
\par Katie\rquote s mouth was very thin. \'93I don\rquote t know Harry. This could really come back to haunt you. What if she finds out eventually and also finds out that you knew? You won\rquote 
t exactly be her favourite person. If you tell her yourself, you might stand a chance with her.\'94
\par 
\par He swallowed. \'93Listen, I told him if he hurts her he\rquote ll have me to answer to. I meant that. I\rquote ll talk to him about this. Maybe--maybe they weren\rquote t really--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, come on, Harry. You know as well as I do what those sounds meant. Don\rquote t try to delude yourself.\'94
\par 
\par He took his glasses off and rubbed his eyes; he felt very tired suddenly. \'93I have to think. I can\rquote t decide this very second.\'94
\par 
\par But suddenly, Draco and Felice came out of the maze and plowed right into Harry and Katie. Harry whirled, unable to stop himself from glaring at Draco Malfoy, who had a very silly grin on his face and a shirt that was wrong-side-out. When he saw Harry
\rquote s face, his grin slowly faded.
\par 
\par \'93We need to talk,\'94 Harry said simply. He saw the blond boy swallow. Felice ignored Harry and Katie, walking up toward the house as though she hadn\rquote 
t a care in the world; Harry noticed that there were numerous twigs and leaves attached to the back of her skirt and cardigan, and she was walking with that swaying-hip movement that Katie had had when she walked away from Rodney Jeffries\rquote 
 tent after they were discovered. He dragged Draco Malfoy into the maze again, trying to control his temper.
\par 
\par \'93What do you think you\rquote re doing?\'94 Harry hissed at him.
\par 
\par Draco Malfoy didn\rquote t wipe the self-satisfied smile off his face. \'93What do you think I think I\rquote m doing?\'94 he said cockily.
\par 
\par \'93I thought you loved Ginny!\'94 he said, tightening his grip on Draco\rquote s arm. He struggled to get loose, unsuccessfully, and stopped, going limp. His mouth was clamped shut obstinately. \'93Just because she said she\rquote 
s glad Sprout interrupted you in the greenhouse--\'94
\par 
\par Draco Malfoy jerked his head up. \'93You were eavesdropping on us! You sneaky--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, it\rquote s not as though it was difficult! I was just waiting for the loo. Sometimes you are so incredibly, colossally stupid it\rquote s painfully obvious why you wound up in Slytherin. You don\rquote t have the brains for Ravenclaw, you\rquote 
re certainly not brave enough for Gryffindor, the way you sneak around, and you don\rquote t work nearly hard enough for Hufflepuff--let alone having enough loyalty not to be shagging some other girl just because you can\rquote t respect that Ginny
\rquote s not ready--\'94
\par 
\par \'93My relationship with Ginny is none of your damn business,\'94 he said through clenched teeth, his arm still firmly in Harry\rquote s grip, which was tightening. Harry saw him wince. He was glad.
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote ve made it my business, Malfoy. I told you that if you hurt her, you\rquote ll have me to answer to. I mean, I didn't know for sure about you and Mariah Kirkner, but this--\'94
\par 
\par Draco looked shaken. "What about me and Mariah?"
\par 
\par "Don't you remember when Ginny came looking for you in the Trophy Room because she found that note you gave Mariah? Why were you meeting her, really?"
\par 
\par "None of your business. Did--did Ginny know about that?" His voice shook.
\par 
\par "No. Like I said, I didn't want her to be hurt." Suddenly Harry realized that he'd kept this from Ginny for months, and there'd been no repercussions.
\par 
\par Draco seemed to have forgotten the hand gripping his arm now. He suddenly looked more smug than Harry had ever seen him. \'93
And who will you answer to for hurting her, eh? That dog that passes for your best friend? That howling thing that you evidently want to be shagging Granger?\'94
\par 
\par \'93What are you talking about? You\rquote re the one hurting her--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Only if she finds out.\'94
\par 
\par Harry stopped cold. \'93What?\'94 It was eerie. Had Malfoy heard what he\rquote d been saying to Katie?
\par 
\par \'93I said only if she finds out. If you don\rquote t tell her, she doesn\rquote t get hurt.\'94
\par 
\par Harry stepped back from him, his face contorted in disgust; now that Draco Malfoy was suggesting it, he heard how vile it sounded. \'93You expect me to keep this a secret?\'94
\par 
\par There was that smirk again, the one Harry wanted to hex right off his face. "You kept Mariah a secret."
\par 
\par "I didn't really know anything about Mariah. Is there something you'd like to tell me?"
\par 
\par He snorted. "Not bloody likely. But tell me, Harry, what do you think she would do if you told her? About Felice, I mean.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Dump you like a load of dung.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Wrong. She\rquote d think you were making it up to try to break us up, that\rquote s what.\'94 He paused, his lips drawn very thin. \'93You think I don\rquote t see how you look at her? You think I haven\rquote 
t been able to figure out that you want her? I\rquote ll bet she knows, too. She would just think it\rquote s a Draco smear campaign. She\rquote s heard enough bad things about me--true
 and false--to last a lifetime. You tell her this and she either believes you and is hurt--which you say you don\rquote t want--or she doesn\rquote t believe you and you look bad. Take your pick. It\rquote s lose-lose for you and win-win for me.\'94

\par 
\par Harry clenched and unclenched his fists by his sides. \'93So you think you can just get away with this?\'94
\par 
\par Draco looked exasperated. \'93It\rquote s not--listen, I\rquote m going to tell you the unvarnished truth, and this goes no further, understand? This will help my relationship with Ginny. I\rquote ve been going mad! And I don\rquote 
t like pressuring her, but--well, you know how it is. Men have needs.\'94
\par 
\par \'93So are you saying Mariah wasn\rquote t seeing to your needs? And we can discuss whether you\rquote re a man or a child some other time.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Shut up. I\rquote m talking now. Mariah--yeah, she offered to, um, help." He ran his hand through his hair. "Saying no to her was--incredibly difficult. So, here I've been for almost a year, tempted and saying no, and then....I didn\rquote 
t plan this whole thing with Felice. I don\rquote t even like her. She\rquote s a muggle, she yaps too much and she thinks far too much of herself. Reminds me of Pansy without the magical powers, except Pansy was a cold fish.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yeah, well, if Pansy Parkinson had the good taste not to shag you, I have a whole new respect for her.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Shut up. I probably should have just gone ahead with Mariah, then Ginny and I would have avoided a slew of rows this year. This will take the pressure off me and Ginny. I can be the model boyfriend when I\rquote 
m around her, let her take her time, do--things--when she\rquote s ready. Isn\rquote t that better than pressuring her?\'94
\par 
\par Harry shook his head. \'93The model boyfriend. Yeah, I\rquote m sure all model boyfriends are shagging girls who aren\rquote t their girlfriends. Are you listening to yourself? I\rquote ll say one thing for you, Malfoy, you\rquote 
re a master of rationalization. You\rquote ve managed to convince yourself that Ginny will be glad you\rquote re cheating on her. Bravo. Sounds like you shouldn\rquote t have nipped that little Death Eater career in the bud; you\rquote 
re obviously perfect for the job.\'94
\par 
\par Harry turne
d and strode out of the maze, unable to see straight. It was time to get back to work; he followed Aberforth to the van and started to help him move sacks of fertilizer. As he worked, he thought with satisfaction that once he told Ginny about Malfoy and t
he Harrington-Smyth girl, that would be the end of them. No more Ginny-and-Draco. Then he stopped. What if--what if she saw it the same way Draco did? As something that was welcome because she wasn\rquote 
t ready yet and was tired of him pressuring her? What if she became angry with him, Harry, for meddling?
\par 
\par He paused for a moment in his work before continuing. I won\rquote t let that happen, he thought. I\rquote ll convince her she should break up with him...
\par 
\par Then he thought of Ron telling him to break up with Hermione and also telling Hermione to break up with him. That had gotten her pretty hacked off at Ron. What if Ginny became hacked off at him? And now Ron and Hermione weren\rquote 
t exactly together anyway. What if I do all this and she becomes--he shuddered for a moment--Neville Longbottom\rquote s girlfriend?
\par 
\par Then there was the matter of still being targeted by Voldemort. Should he be asking any girl to be his girlfriend right now? he thought. He glanced at Katie, who was pruning a rose bush. Am I putting poor Katie at risk every time we go out?
\par 
\par He threw himself into his work that afternoon, irked with himself for ever trusting Draco Malfoy. He thought of the boy who\rquote d been his best friend in his other life. Now that Harry thought about it, Draco Malfoy had done very nearly the sam
e thing in that life. He was technically the same person. He\rquote d been involved with loads of girls before he admitted to Jamie how he felt about her, and according to him, he\rquote 
d felt that way about her even while he was shagging those other girls. The problem was--he\rquote d fallen for a girl who was two years younger than he was. So he found a way to \'93Occupy\'94
 himself while he waited for her to reach her fifteenth birthday. Now Harry remembered furiously that on Jamie\rquote s fifteenth birthday they were going to sleep together, and probably would have, if she hadn\rquote 
t been so upset about her brother killing her mother. He couldn\rquote t wait, he grumbled to himself. Just like on Ginny\rquote s fifteenth birthday....
\par 
\par He shoveled manure onto the flower beds, frowning angrily. Why hadn\rquote t this behavior seemed so reprehensible when he\rquote d been friends with Draco Malfoy for years? Had he simply grown inured to Malfoy\rquote 
s unique brand of rationalization? For once he didn\rquote t need to convince himself that the two boys were one and the same--it was very clear to him that they were. He simply had a much lower opinion now of his best friend from his other life. He
\rquote d learned in recent years to trust Severus Snape\rquote s opinion of people, and he recalled his stepfather\rquote s venomous reaction to finding out that Draco Malfoy was Jamie\rquote s boyfriend....
\par 
\par Later in the day, they were washing up in the scullery in the big house, using two deep adjacent sinks, when Draco Malfoy tried to talk to him again. \'93Listen, Harry--if I don\rquote t do anything with Felice again--does Ginn
y have to know? I mean--haven\rquote t you ever done something like that out of weakness?\'94
\par 
\par He looked uncharacteristically scared and vulnerable. Harry suddenly had a very vivid picture of a very pretty Alicia Spinnett kissing him, and him kissing her back....He turned off the water and dried his hands on an old linen towel. \'93
The main thing is I don\rquote t want her to get hurt, Malfoy. If you keep this up, she\rquote s liable to find out sooner or later, whether I tell her or not. You\rquote ll slip up and do something stupid, like call her the wrong name--\'94
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m not Weasley.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Call him Ron, you prat. He\rquote s Ginny\rquote s brother.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well you seem to have stopped calling me Draco, Potter.\'94
\par 
\par Harry sighed. \'93As I was saying, the main thing is for her not to be hurt. If you stop seeing Felice, it\rquote s possible Ginny won\rquote t find out. Can you guarantee me that you\rquote ll definitely stop?\'94
\par 
\par He held up his hand. \'93I promise.\'94 Harry grimaced, wondering how reliable a Draco Malfoy promise was.
\par 
\par \'93If I think I see you slipping, I\rquote ll step in. Understand? I\rquote m not going to let you hurt Ginny.\'94 Harry suddenly wondered whether his poor sister would have had her heart broken by Draco Malfoy if their world hadn\rquote 
t started to self-destruct.
\par 
\par \'93Right. You\rquote ll step in. What, you looking for a little rich-girl action yourself? Mind, you\rquote ll have to turn your hearing off to tolerate her for more than a few minutes....\'94
\par 
\par \'93No, I do not want her myself. If she\rquote s really that interested in taking up with a gardener maybe Trevor or Nigel can fight over her. I just want to make sure you behave yourself.\'94
\par 
\par \'93At least until you move to Scotland.\'94
\par 
\par Harry stopped suddenly. Oh, right--he wasn\rquote t going to be working with the lads after his birthday. \'93Well then--Katie will keep an eye on you. She doesn\rquote t want Ginny to be hurt either.\'94
\par 
\par \'93No, she doesn\rquote t want me and Ginny to break up because she knows that if we do you\rquote ll try to swoop in and claim Ginny for yourself.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Shut up. Katie and I are friends. She\rquote s not a jealous harpy.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Unlike Granger--\'94
\par 
\par \'93I said shut up,\'94 Harry repeated, pushing Draco into the wall. \'93You do not talk about Hermione, understand?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, Weasley--I mean Ron doesn\rquote t seem to be interested in shagging her, and you\rquote ve stopped because evidently shagging her interferes with you letting my girlfriend know you\rquote re available. I\rquote ve become so desperate I\rquote 
ve already stooped to being with a muggle, so a mudblood would actually be a move up for me. Until Ginny\rquote s ready, maybe Granger and I could--oof!\'94
\par 
\par Harry hadn\rquote 
t been able to control himself any longer; he had punched Draco Malfoy in the stomach as hard as he could. The blond boy sank to his knees, his arms around his middle, biting his lip. Harry would have liked for him to cry out, but he knew Malfoy
 had too much pride for that. Still on his knees, he looked up at Harry, speaking in a low hiss.
\par 
\par \'93Wondered how long it would take you to do something like that,\'94 he managed to say, panting. \'93Feel better now? Got it out of your system? Because I could tell Ginny you punched me if you threaten to tell her about Felice.\'94
\par 
\par \'93You can\rquote t blackmail me, Malfoy. I\rquote m not hiding anything from Ginny. You\rquote re the one doing that. Mariah and Felice.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, yeah, you\rquote re not hiding anything about you and little Miss Katie, eh? You two haven\rquote t snogged once? You haven\rquote t had any naughty thoughts about her at all? Everything strictly platonic? You\rquote 
re all over me for getting some relief while Ginny decides whether to be a lifelong virgin, but you\rquote re not above getting some relief yourself.\'94
\par 
\par \'93She isn\rquote t my girlfriend--she\rquote s yours. And that\rquote s not what I\rquote m doing!\'94 he sputtered.
\par 
\par \'93Still--if you don\rquote t think Ginny would be upset about you hitting me, just try her. Tell her you hit me, see how popular it makes you with her. I\rquote m betting you won\rquote t get shagged any more than I have.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Stop talking about her that way!\'94 Harry shouted at him. Draco Malfoy grimaced.
\par 
\par \'93I didn\rquote t mean--that came out badly. I meant--\'94
\par 
\par \'93I know, I know. Shut up. Let me think.\'94 He paced the small room, running his fingers through his hair. At last he turned to Draco Malfoy. \'93All right. Here\rquote s how it is. You stop seeing Felice. I make sure there\rquote 
s no danger of you backsliding. Ginny doesn\rquote t find out from me that this happened. That\rquote s all I can say. If she finds out some other way, you\rquote re on your own.\'94
\par 
\par \'93How else would she--\'94 Draco started to say before the answer dawned on him. \'93Katie.\'94
\par 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93I\rquote m not her keeper. You never know, Katie could tell her. It\rquote s possible. Women stick together. On the other hand, maybe she\rquote s the last person who would want Ginny to be available.\'94
 As soon as he said it, he had the urge to bite back the words.
\par 
\par Draco Malfoy smirked. \'93So, it\rquote s platonic, is it?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Shut up. We\rquote re not talking about my personal life, we\rquote re talking about yours. You\rquote re going to be a good boy from now on, understand?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes, nanny,\'94 he simpered. He sauntered out of the scullery looking carefree and content. Harry, on the other hand, couldn\rquote t fight the feeling that he\rquote d been had.
\par 
\par Why do I get the feeling that Felice Harrington-Smyth wasn\rquote t the only one in this house who was screwed today? he thought.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par The work on the roof was completed on Thursday night. When Harry awoke on Friday morning to go runni
ng, he stood across the street first, contentedly taking in the sight of the new shingles. Something about finishing the roof felt even more satisfying than the landscaping he was doing for Aberforth. Maybe if I weren\rquote 
t a wizard, I would have been a carpenter. He\rquote d once thought that outdoor work seemed very satisfying, and frequently, housebuilding or carpentry meant working out-of-doors. He sighed. That didn\rquote 
t exactly help him to decide what he was going to do when he was out of school--an event which was now only one year away. Are there wizard carpenters? he wondered.
\par 
\par He and Draco Malfoy had been running together in utter silence since he\rquote d discovered him in the hedge maze with Felice Harrington-Smyth (He kept up running with him because he didn\rquote 
t want to deal with Dunkirk by himself in the mornings). Harry tried to avoid even looking at him. At work, he spoke to him only when it was absolutely necessary, mostly engaging in conversation with Sam, Katie and Aberforth; Draco mostly socialized with 
Nigel and Trevor (Whom Harry was avoiding because of their constant lascivious comments about him and Katie).
\par 
\par When the day was almost over and they were cleaning up, Harry said to Katie, \'93What are you doing tonight?\'94 He\rquote d found it very difficult to get Gin
ny out of his mind after the Draco-Felice incident, but whereas he previously had found his mind wandering into romantic fantasy territory, these days it was almost always nightmares--imagining her horrible reaction to Draco\rquote 
s cheating. He thought perhaps it would help to spend the evening with Katie.
\par 
\par Katie hemmed and hawed for a moment before saying, \'93Actually--I\rquote m going up to Hogsmeade. I\rquote m spending the weekend at Hog\rquote s End.\'94 She blushed furiously.
\par 
\par \'93Oh.\'94
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m sorry, Harry. I feel like--like I need to do this. To face this. I need to try to be around all of them and still feel normal.\'94 She paused before going on. \'93Angelina says Lee has a new girlfriend,\'94 she said softly.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, Katie--are you sure you want to go? It doesn\rquote t sound like it\rquote ll be easy--\'94
\par 
\par She smiled at him. \'93You\rquote re very sweet, Harry. You\rquote re actually making me think you might miss me.\'94
\par 
\par He suddenly thought he might like to kiss her, but decided that Trevor and Nigel (Who were nearby) would have far too much fun with that. \'93I will miss you.\'94
\par 
\par She looked at him for a long minute, then shook herself. \'93I\rquote ll--I\rquote ll be back Sunday night. Maybe we can do something then?\'94
\par 
\par \'93All right. It\rquote s a date.\'94
\par 
\par \'93A date,\'94 she confirmed, still looking at him. He watched her walk toward her father\rquote s car, a dreadful feeling clutching at him; he just hoped that she wouldn\rquote t be a basket-case when she returned from Hogsmeade. He wasn\rquote 
t sure how he felt about her, but he did know that he didn\rquote t want her to be hurt any more than Ginny.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par When he was walking Dunkirk
 after work, he took him down to the park, wondering what he would do with himself that evening, now that the roof was done. He almost felt tempted to go find out whether Draco Malfoy wanted to do something, but he quickly eliminated that as a possibility
.
\par 
\par The large tent still loomed over the park landscape like a white whale. Suddenly, Harry had an idea; he would go to hear Jeffries, find out exactly what he was up to. But then he frowned; going alone didn\rquote 
t appeal to him. He looked up at the evening sky and his eyes lit immediately on the spire of St. Bede\rquote s in the Meadow. He walked purposefully toward the church, Dunkirk fighting him the whole way because he knew this was not the way home.
\par 
\par \'93Stupid dog,\'94 Harry muttered as he dragged him to the vicarage, 
digging in his heels and resisting the urge to growl back at him. (He definitely could not change into a golden griffin in the middle of the village just to frighten the terrier). Struggling to keep the dog under control, he knocked on the door.
\par 
\par After a few moments, Mr. Babcock opened the door. He looks like a normal person, Harry thought; then he was annoyed with himself for thinking it. Of course he\rquote 
s a normal person. He was wearing a simple white button-down shirt and jeans. Harry tried not to stare. He also seemed to have the same sort of running shoes as Harry.
\par 
\par \'93Um--hello. I hope I\rquote m not disturbing you,\'94 he said to the obviously-surprised vicar.
\par 
\par \'93No, not at all,\'94 Mr. Babcock smiled. \'93Do come in.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well--\'94 Harry started to say, looking down at Dunkirk. \'93Let me tie up the dog. Trust me; you do not want him in your house.\'94
\par 
\par Mr. Babcock waited while Harry tied Dunkirk\rquote s lead to the rail for his front steps. In the sitting room, he discovered Dr. Forbes sitting at a chessboard, staring intently at it, frowning. He glanced up, then down again; then he did a double take.

\par 
\par \'93Harry! What brings you here?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well--I wanted to see if Mr. Babcock would like to come check out Rodney Jeffries tonight. I still haven\rquote t had a chance to find out what he does; and you,\'94 he nodded at the vicar, \'93
Said you were curious as well. I can pay for you. Think of it as a contribution to the church.\'94
\par 
\par Mr. Babcock\rquote s eyebrows flew up in surprise. \'93A teenager who doesn\rquote t have anything better to do on a Friday night but treat his vicar to a show by the local charlatan?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well--I\rquote d go with my girlfriend, but she\rquote s up in Scotland this weekend visiting some old friends from school. And I didn\rquote t want to go alone.\'94
\par 
\par \'93What about that boy who was at mass with you last week--Drake-something-or-other--\'94
\par 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93We\rquote re not terribly good friends, really. And I don\rquote t think he cares about this or is curious. You are, and I am too, so I thought--\'94
\par 
\par Dr. Forbes stood. \'93Well, actually that makes three of us curious about this Jeffries, so why don\rquote t I join you?\'94 He put his hand on Harry\rquote s shoulder and smiled. \'93I can pay my own way, though, Harry.\'94
\par 
\par He smiled at the doctor. \'93All right, then. I have to take my aunt\rquote s dog home and change my clothes. I\rquote ll meet you in the park in an hour.\'94
\par 
\par When Harry was passing the park again, Dunkirk started acting strangely. He raised his nose and sniffed the air and wouldn\rquote t come when Harry pulled on the lead. \'93Come on you infuriating animal,\'94
 he grunted at it, then suddenly found himself being jerked acros
s the green to a stand of trees with benches scattered in their shade and some kind of creeper for a groundcover around the roots. Draco Malfoy had been dragged over to these trees during the morning run, Harry remembered, and he\rquote 
d had a hell of a time get
ting the dog to come away again (Which was odd, because Dunkirk generally obeyed Malfoy). Dunkirk stopped and sat down suddenly, then barked three times, looking (Harry thought) at the trees. Harry frowned. What on earth was Dunkirk doing?
\par 
\par Then Harry heard the voice.
\par 
\par \'93Harry Potter.\'94
\par 
\par He froze. His heart was thumping painfully. When he finally spoke, his voice came out in a soft hiss.
\par 
\par \'93Sandy?\'94
\par 
\par As the small green snake slithered out from under the vines, Harry fought the urge to shout and leap for joy. \'93Is it really you, Sandy?\'94 he asked breathlessly.
\par 
\par \'93I have been looking for you, Harry Potter. You have need of me.\'94
\par 
\par \'93How do you know?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I was captured and living in the London zoo for a time. I met a friend of yours, a python whom you once freed.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh--they got him back?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Evidently. He is a very large snake, and he has great Sight. The things of which he spoke....They concerned you. He is able to see farther into the future than I, and his Sight reaches farther afield as well. I knew I ha
d to find you. So I escaped and made my way down here to see you.\'94
\par 
\par \'93What--what are these things that he told you?\'94
\par 
\par \'93He saw you fighting spiders of a monstrous size, and flames, and humans riding tree branches with bundles of twigs on the ends....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Brooms. Wait--when did he predict these things, exactly? How long have you been traveling?\'94
\par 
\par \'93He predicted them on the day when the light and dark are equal.\'94
\par 
\par \'93You mean the equinox? In March?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Is that what humans call it? I have been trying to find you ever since then. I was unsure how soon these events would be occurring, but I knew that you would be arriving in this part of the country soon after the longest day.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Midsummer. That\rquote s in June. That was three weeks ago. I think--I think what you\rquote 
re describing was what happened about three weeks into May. That was about two months after the prediction. There was a battle in the forest at Hogwarts, and we were fighting giant spiders, and there was 
a huge fire in the forest, too. But almost everyone came out of it all right. So you've been traveling since March?\'94
\par 
\par "Yes."
\par 
\par Sandy was silent, and oddly, so was Dunkirk. Harry was very interested to see that the small dog, usually very agitated and disobe
dient around him, was sitting quite still, watching the snake with his head cocked to one side, as though he could also understand Sandy.
\par 
\par \'93Sandy?\'94 Harry said again.
\par 
\par \'93Yes, Harry Potter?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Do you--do you want to be my companion again? I have a feeling--I just have a feeling that a lot of things are going to be happening soon...\'94
\par 
\par \'93I think that would be wise,\'94 she answered. Harry couldn\rquote t remember when he\rquote d felt so glad about anything as he knelt down and picked her up; he let her slither into the collar of
 his shirt and felt her wrap herself around his upper arm. The familiar weight there was comforting.
\par 
\par When he called to Dunkirk and pulled gently at his lead, suddenly the dog started trotting after him docilely, as though he always obeyed Harry and was the model pet. Harry frowned as he walked back to Privet Drive, unsure what to make of this.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par When he returned to the park to meet the vicar and the doctor, there was already a long queue for tickets. Harry bought two, handing one to the vicar, wh
ile Dr. Forbes bought one for himself. They found seats about half-way back and sat, waiting for the show to begin. There were footlights in front of the dais, throwing crazy shadows onto the canvas ceiling of the tent. The choir was already assembled on 
the platform, a good two dozen people or so. Harry could feel Sandy under his shirt, as much a part of him as though she\rquote d never left.
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s our star tenor!\'94 Babcock hissed at Harry, pointing, but Harry wasn\rquote t sure who he meant. The singers all looked fr
eshly-scrubbed and gleaming, wearing immaculate white robes like a host of angels. Harry was starting to feel very uneasy. What if Jeffries was just an old-fashioned hellfire-and-brimstone preacher? He wasn\rquote 
t interested in that sort of thing himself, but he didn\rquote t necessarily think other people were suspicious or up to no good just because they were.
\par 
\par Mr. Babcock sighed. \'93If only I could use Bingo to raise money, like Father Garrison, over at St. Ignatius. It\rquote s something of a gentleman\rquote s agreement, though, you understand, that we don\rquote 
t poach on their territory, so to speak. Some of our parish members go over to St. Ignatius for Bingo, and when we have our Spring Jumble Sale, the St. Ignatius parishioners come to St. Bede\rquote s. Hardly seems fair, though,\'94 he mus
ed, craning his neck to see the front. \'93Ours is only once a year, not once a week...\'94
\par 
\par Harry wasn\rquote t sure when it started, but he was suddenly aware of there being a low rhythmic rumble, and he realized it was coming from the choir. BUM (Ba-da-da bum bum bum bum.) BUM (Ba-da-da bum bum bum\'85)
\par 
\par \'93To dream the impossible dream,\'94 began a young man with a smooth tenor voice--must be Mr. Babcock\rquote s tenor, Harry thought. \'93To fight the unbeatable foe...\'94
\par 
\par The choir started aahing and oohing to accompany him, and then a baritone joined the tenor.
\par 
\par \'93To bear with unbearable sorrow,\'94 they sang together. \'93To run where the brave dare not go...\'94
\par 
\par \'93To right,\'94 the entire choir sang now, harmonizing in a medium volume; \'93The unrightable wrong; to love, pure and chaste, from afar; to try, when your arms are too weary, to reach the unreachable star!\'94
\par 
\par Harry could see the audience getting caught up in the music as the voices swelled and broadened. \'93This is my quest,\'94 the choir sang more loudly now; \'93To follow that star, no matter how hopeless, no matter how far...\'94
\par 
\par Just the men sang, \'93To fight for the right without question or pause, to be willing to march into hell for a heavenly cause!\'94
\par 
\par \'93And I know,\'94 the full choir sang again, more softly, \'93If I\rquote ll only be true to this glorious quest, that my heart will lie peaceful and calm, when I\rquote m laid to my rest...\'94
 They softened further on this phrase, and Harry shivered involuntarily, both because of how effective this was, and because of the meaning of the words they were singing.
\par 
\par \'93And the world,\'94 they continued, growing in volume again, \'93Will be better for this; that one man, scorned and covered with scars, still strove with his last ounce of courage...\'94 They swelled still more. \'93
To reach the unreachable stars, that one man scorned and covered with scars, still strove with his last ounce of courage...\'94 The crescendo was constant now, each note louder than the previous one, the tent filled with the sound, the faces of the audien
ce glowing with rapture as they listened--No, Harry thought; as they absorbed the music, as they made it part of themselves....
\par 
\par \'93To reach the unreachable stars!\'94 most of the choir finished, holding the final note with a triumphant crescendo, while some of the women with very high voices repeated, \'93The unreachable stars!\'94 going up the scale, the notes\rquote 
 vibrations making the hairs stand up on the back of Harry\rquote s neck. He looked around the room, seeing the effect the music was having on everyone present (Even 
Babcock and Forbes), and he suddenly wished he had a wand with him to cast the Revelatio spell, to learn whether he would again see pink magical signatures that had the appearance of each and every audience member.
\par 
\par He remembered the Hermione in his other life describing the phenomenon when she and the rest of the student orchestra in Philadelphia that had been playing Barber\rquote 
s Adagio for Strings had spontaneously floated up into the air. Hermione being a witch and feeling very, very emotionally moved by th
e incident had obviously had an effect, but Harry now had to wonder whether anyone, magical or muggle, could experience something similar when listening to or making music in a crowd, the collective emotions somehow producing a kind of primitive wandless 
magic. He remembered Dumbledore saying, \'93Ah, music; a magic beyond all we do here,\'94 after the students had sung the school song, each to their own favourite tune. Harry wouldn\rquote t exactly have described that cacophony as \'93music,\'94
 but he was starting to wonder at music\rquote s potential magical properties. Were there any spells that needed to be sung? he wondered.
\par 
\par The choir held the final chord, it seemed to him, for a very long time, and suddenly a slit appeared in the tent behind the singers and they parted into t
wo groups (Still holding the note) while Rodney Jeffries himself entered down the aisle they had created, wearing a simple button-down shirt and dark trousers, his face tanned and smiling as he waved to the audience, which went wild now, clapping and stam
p
ing, many of them standing up, some people whistling. The choir finally finished, and then they too were clapping--but not for themselves. It was all for Rodney Jeffries. The ovation was deafening. Harry thought ruefully, Mr. Babcock was right; he does pu
t on a good show. And he\rquote d just arrived.
\par 
\par He jumped nimbly down from the dais and started walking down the passage between the chairs, shaking hands with the members of his enthusiastic audience that he could reach from the aisle. Some women threw their arm
s around his neck and tried to kiss him; Harry noticed that he managed to turn his cheek each time. After a few minutes, he retreated to the dais and stepped up onto the raised surface again, so that they could see him more easily. Rodney Jeffries beamed 
around at the cheering crowd and finally spoke.
\par 
\par \'93Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!\'94 he said, and Harry could hear that there was an amplification system carrying his voice to the far corners of the tent, although he didn\rquote t appear to be using a microphone
; he could be heard even over the loud applause and cheering. \'93Good evening!\'94 he said again, as the ruckus began slowly to abate. Little by little, people sat again. (Harry, Babcock and Forbes had remained seated).
\par 
\par \'93Good evening, one and all!\'94 Jeffries said, showing a lot of gleaming teeth when he grinned. \'93
It is gratifying to see so many people returning! I hope you have found my techniques for self-empowerment helpful in changing your lives for the better!\'94
\par 
\par \'93We love you, Rodney!\'94 cried a woman shrilly o
n the far side of the tent from Harry, and the cheering and clapping started up again. This time, Jeffries held his hands out, as though pushing down the sound, and it finally quieted. While he did this, he never left off grinning.
\par 
\par \'93
And I love all of you! That is precisely why I could not keep my good fortune to myself, why I had to share this with the world! How could I be so selfish not to teach other people how to empower themselves, how to truly change their lives? Rod, I said to
 myself, you cannot be so selfish. It just would not be right!\'94
\par 
\par There was silence, as the crowd took in his words. Then a man\rquote s voice from the back cried, \'93Tell the story!\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes, yes, tell it, tell it,\'94 several more voices joined in the chorus. Harry real
ized that not only did people pay twenty pounds per person to come hear him, some had clearly been multiple times--some perhaps even every time. As the requests for Jeffries to \'93Tell the story\'94
 grew more loud and numerous, he nodded good-naturedly and put his hands up, nodding.
\par 
\par \'93Yes, yes, of course I\rquote ll tell the story. Those of you who have already heard it, please be patient and let those who have not heard it do so.\'94 Harry thought it was unnecessary for him to say this, since it was clearly the people who\rquote 
d heard it already who were clamoring to hear it again.
\par 
\par \'93As many of you know, I had a life like many people in this country. It was boring and stale and lonely. I had a job clerking in a law office--\'94 Harry remembered the man named Adam Justice, who had
 found him and Katie; perhaps they were former co-workers. \'93
I had a girlfriend for a while, and then we parted ways. I had a cat. A comfortable flat. I paid my bills, I did my laundry and cleaned my flat. I had a good life, but it was hardly a special one.
 If I no longer worked at the law practice, some other clerk would be hired to replace me. If I no longer leased my flat, the landlord would surely be able to find someone else to do it. I avoided the truth of my existence, day in and day out. The truth b
eing--that if I disappeared off the face of the planet, no one would notice or care.\'94
\par 
\par His voice had grown softer, yet not a muscle moved, and every breath seemed suspended as the crowd waited for him to continue.
\par 
\par \'93And then,\'94 he said suddenly, urgently. \'93Then it happened.\'94 Harry saw that several people near him were shivering in anticipation, clearly knowing what was coming next. \'93
I was waiting to take the tube home one evening, standing on the platform, reading my newspaper, when suddenly I looked up--and I saw him.\'94
\par 
\par A collective gasp from the audience. Harry looked around, frowning. Who had Jeffries seen?
\par 
\par \'93He appeared to be the devil incarnate. His face--I\rquote d never seen a face like it. Squashed nose, slit for a mouth, deathly pale skin. Perhaps he was Dea
th himself, I thought when I saw him. And then he looked right at me, and I saw his eyes. Red as blood, more evil-looking than any depiction of Satan I had ever seen.
\par 
\par \'93And then--\'94 he said again, pausing for effect. \'93He raised his hand and pointed at me, a
nd a crackling green light shot from his fingers like lightening bolts and struck me in the chest. I experienced greater pain than I ever imagined was possible, like knives piercing every part of my body--\'94
\par 
\par Harry winced. Voldemort! Jeffries had seen Voldemort, and had experienced Cruciatus! He was starting to think all of this almost made sense now. Jeffries had a near-death experience, and now that he\rquote s recovered from it, he\rquote 
s turned over a new leaf. It doesn\rquote t happen for everyone, but it does happen to some people who go through that.
\par 
\par Now Harry actually felt eager to hear the rest of the story. He felt sorry that Jeffries had had to experience the pain of Cruciatus, but clearly his life had greatly improved after that. He wondered whether Voldemort realized that he\rquote 
d inadvertently done this for a mere muggle, and how upset he would be if he knew.
\par 
\par \'93--And then, even in the midst of my pain, I felt something strange start to flow through me. A change. He raised his hand again, and I was no longer in pain, b
ut I felt--I felt as though I was using all of my brain. Now, hear me out! Many of you may have heard that there are actually large parts of the brain that humans do not use, yes? Many of you have heard this?\'94
\par 
\par Scores of people in the audience nodded in agreement and murmured in a low rumble that took a minute to die out; when a respectful silence was restored, Jeffries continued. \'93
Well, after that I felt like I was using all of it. Every last cell and neuron! I felt as though I could see more, hear more! I felt more alive than ever before in my existence!
\par 
\par \'93And then--\'94 he said yet again, and now Harry and even Babcock and Forbes, along with the rest of the crowd, were hanging on his every word. \'93And then,\'94 he repeated, \'93Another crackling beam of light emerged from that demon\rquote 
s hand, and the Westminster tube station exploded into a million pieces!\'94
\par 
\par Westminster! Harry gasped involuntarily, then felt himself colour when Babcock looked sideways at him in surprise. So Voldemort hadn\rquote 
t simply been lurking in some other tube station and putting Cruciatus on unsuspecting law clerks; Rodney Jeffries had been caught in the explosion, the now-infamous Westminster Bombing. Harry was floored. The explosion had been to get his attentio
n. He, Harry, was in a way as responsible as Voldemort for the Rodney Jeffries Phenomenon.
\par 
\par \'93I, like many other people waiting on that platform, was covered in rubble falling from the ceiling of the station. I was unconscious for a time; when I awoke, I was aware of voices in the distance. Rescue workers. I tried to open my eyes and couldn
\rquote t. I am not ashamed to say that I felt like crying. I had felt more alive than ever before for mere seconds before the explosion, and I did not know whether I would be sa
ved or whether I would perish under the rubble while waiting. I felt an anger well up in me, then, and as it grew, I suddenly became aware of the load above me lightening, until suddenly the beam and concrete that had been pressing me to the platform flew
 
up into the air. I was able to rise! I felt all of my limbs; I was evidently unharmed, if more than a bit dusty. I could hear the sounds of suffering people all around me, and I began to move more of the rubble out of the way to remove these poor people f
r
om danger. Heavy beams I should never have been able to lift under normal circumstances virtually flew off men and women and children at a thought from me, and although I was so glad to help them that I was moved to tears, I was also very, very frightened
 of what this new ability might mean.
\par 
\par \'93When the rescue workers were cataloguing the names of those who\rquote d been in the station at the time of the attack, I hid my wallet and gave a false name, claiming that I had lost my identification in the explosion. When
 I had been given a clean bill of health, I bolted for home, unsure whether I should trust my memory of what had occurred. Had I imagined everything but the explosion? Had the demon been a figment of my imagination? I hadn\rquote 
t dared to tell anyone what I\rquote d seen--they probably would have thought I was mad. I wasn\rquote t entirely sure about that myself. What had really occurred? I wondered.
\par 
\par \'93I hid in my flat and did not go out for a week. I was fired from my job. A friend from work came to see me and said that he h
ad convinced our bosses to take me back if I went to the office on Monday morning. I did, and I was immediately employed again. I returned to my job, but I was just going through the motions. At home, every night, I began to experiment with my newfound po
w
er. I could burn myself on the stove and heal myself almost instantly, with a thought. I could cut myself, and the cuts disappeared if I just believed they would be. Over time, I discovered that if I did not truly believe that something I was attempting w
ould work, it in fact did not work.\'94
\par 
\par He paused, staring out into the crowd. \'93Belief. Many of us believe in many different types of things. Gods. Philosophies. Scientific phenomena and theories. Diets. Exercise regimes. Some of us still believe in heroes, a
nd in the likelihood that the person who receives the Nobel Peace Prize will actually be a person who deserves it. We believe in superstitions; we carry umbrellas to ward off rain, we read our horoscopes in the papers, we avoid walking under ladders and w
e throw salt over our shoulders when we spill it. We believe in many, many things. But how many of us can truly claim to believe in ourselves?\'94
\par 
\par He looked out at the crowd, now so silent that it was as though everyone present had been stunned. Harry too was
 waiting to hear more. Had Jeffries been made a wizard by Voldemort? he wondered. Was that even possible? He knew that Cruciatus affected the brain, which believes that the body is experiencing great physical pain, and that Neville Longbottom\rquote 
s parents had been under Cruciatus for so long that they had gone insane from it. They had lived for years in the mental ward of St. Mungo\rquote 
s Hospital for Magical Maladies, not recognizing their son when he came to visit them. Jeffries had not had the curse on him for a
s long as the Longbottoms, it seemed to Harry, yet it must have been longer than Harry had experienced it to have this effect. When Ron had placed the curse on him he had used the pain-blocking technique he\rquote 
d perfected to avoid actually feeling the pain. I believed I could do it, and I was able to, he thought. I believed in myself.
\par 
\par He stared at Jeffries with a new respect. He\rquote s figured it out, Harry thought. He\rquote s gotten mind-over-matter down pat. But does that make him a wizard now?
\par 
\par Jeffries gazed out at the crowd now with a sympathetic smile. \'93I know you\rquote re frightened; of course you are. Believing in yourself isn\rquote 
t easy. You know all of your flaws. You know all of your failings. You are the one person who has no illusions about you.\'94 He held out his hands. \'93
But I have learned that I have enough belief now, enough strength of mind to help others believe in themselves. I first discovered this last Bonfire Night, when I went to Blackpool Pier for the fireworks show, and some burning ash landed on a man\rquote 
s hand. He was screaming in agony; I don\rquote t know what made me do it, but I pushed my way through the crowd and took his burnt hand in mine and convinced myself that his burn was healed. Perhaps I couldn\rquote 
t stand the thought of another person suffering like that, I don\rquote t know. Nothing happened at first. Then I put my hand on his head, instead of his burn, and I said to him, \'93You have to do it! You have to believe your burn is healed!
\par 
\par \'93Believe!\'94 Rodney Jeffries cried out now, his voice carrying to the far corners of the tent and beyond.
\par 
\par \'93BELIEVE!\'94 he repeated even more vehemently.
\par 
\par \'93And then--\'94 he said again, for suspense. Harry waited. \'93We both looked down at his hand. He was healed, completely healed. He looked up at me in shock, then started telling anyone around
 us who would listen what had occurred. And from that moment on, now knowing that I could communicate that ability to believe in myself completely to other people, knowing that I could change others\rquote 
 lives, I knew I could not keep this to myself any longer. It would be irresponsible for me not to share it with the world.\'94
\par 
\par Harry wasn\rquote t sure when it started; he was aware of a low rumble in the crowd, then after half a minute, he was able to hear the people gathered chanting in unison:
\par 
\par \'93Believe! Believe! Believe! Believe!\'94 It wasn\rquote t being pronounced in the usual way, with the emphasis on the second syllable. They were actually saying, \'93BEE-leeve, BEE-leeve, BEE-leeve...\'94
\par 
\par Harry looked around; there were people from all walks of life. He glanced at Babcock and
 Forbes. They looked distinctly uncomfortable, as though they wanted to join in, but found it to be an awkward thing to do after their previous grousing about Jeffries. After a little while, Rodney Jeffries said, \'93
Who here needs to believe in themselves? Needs to get that promotion? Make that sale? Propose to that beautiful girl? Conquer that supposedly unconquerable disease?\'94
\par 
\par \'93You will be known.\'94
\par 
\par \'93I do!\'94 a man cried, standing.
\par 
\par Harry was jolted. Sandy had spoken to him, the sibilant sound of Parseltongue blending into the babble around him; Babcock and Forbes were oblivious to the hissing, he saw immediately. You will be known. Harry didn\rquote 
t like the way that sounded. And judging from his past experience, she was referring to something that would happen in a matter of minutes.
\par 
\par The crowd continued chanting, becoming a blur of white noise. The man who had cried \'93I do!\'94 was no more than forty, but he walked with a stooped posture and
 used a cane for support. He hobbled forward, down the aisle. Jeffries walked down the aisle toward him until now the pair of them were standing in the center of the tent.
\par 
\par \'93What do you need to believe?\'94 Jeffries asked him.
\par 
\par \'93I--I know that I\rquote m always going to have arthritis, but--but I would like to believe that it doesn\rquote t hurt as badly as it does...\'94
\par 
\par \'93NO!\'94 Jeffries cried. \'93Don\rquote t stifle your belief. Believe that you will be rid of arthritis, not merely the pain.\'94 He put his hand on the man\rquote s head and cried, \'93Believe!\'94
\par 
\par The man looked like an electric shock had gone through him. His legs buckled beneath him, and a man--whom Harry immediately recognized as Adam Justice--sprang from his seat on the aisle and caught him under the arms. The arthritic man looked
 like he was unconscious. Then Adam Justice helped him to stand and the man blinked and opened his eyes wide. To Harry, he seemed to be growing, and then he realized that the man simply hadn\rquote 
t been standing up straight before; now he drew himself up, and threw down his cane. He spun in a circle, dancing with delight.
\par 
\par \'93It\rquote s gone! It\rquote s gone! My arthritis is gone!\'94
\par 
\par The crowd went wild, clapping and cheering. The chanting stopped and now the choir started singing again.
\par 
\par "To dream the impossible dream...."
\par 
\par \'93If you need help believing in yourself, come forward and let my belief help yours! Just decide on a goal and together we can realize that goal!\'94
\par 
\par While the choir sang on, the aisle filled with people making their way toward Rodney Jeffries, who would bend his ear to the person\rquote s mouth, then close his eyes and touch each person\rquote s head, crying, \'93
Believe! very loudly. Every time, the person collapsed, was helped up, and stood thanking Jeffries with a radiant face. Several women kissed him, and most of the men 
were pumping his hand up and down. (Although a few also kissed him). The line seemed to grow longer rather than shorter as more and more people plucked up the courage to go forward.
\par 
\par The line in the aisle was two-across now, and suddenly, Harry thought he 
saw someone familiar walking there, but it was hard to see because there was a rather large man in the way. When she was finally standing before Rodney Jeffries, swallowing nervously, Harry gasped. He didn\rquote 
t know what she was whispering into Jeffries\rquote  ear, but a moment later, he was putting his hand on her head and ordering her to believe. A red crackling light connected the two of them briefly (Which hadn\rquote 
t happened before), and then she collapsed, not getting up quickly like the others. Instead she opened her eyes and looked up from the ground. Finally, she started to stand, shaking.
\par 
\par \'93What--\'94 she gasped \'93--what did you do to me?\'94 Her voice carried to the far corners. Harry saw that even Jeffries looked concerned.
\par 
\par \'93I--I don\rquote t know--\'94 Jeffries said softly, which Harry was not expecting.
\par 
\par \'93Did you get rid of the cancer or not?\'94 she demanded, putting her hand to her breastbone, and then to her mouth, clearly not having intended announcing her problem to the world at large. Harry dropped his jaw. Cancer?
\par 
\par \'93I--\'94 Jeffries stammered. \'93I\rquote m not sure--did you truly believe that it would be gone?\'94
\par 
\par She looked livid and desperate and sad all at once. When he tried to move toward her, she held out her hand to stop him, and suddenly he flew backward
, striking the front of the dais. The choir stopped singing abruptly and there was utter silence. She dropped her jaw, horror-struck, then stared at her hand, at the hand that had made Rodney Jeffries fly backwards. Then her eyes rolled back in her head a
nd she fainted.
\par 
\par Harry\rquote s first instinct was to groan and think, Not again, but a more urgent instinct then overwhelmed him and he leapt from his chair.
\par 
\par \'93Aunt Petunia!\'94 he cried, arriving at her side in a split second. He lifted her limp body and tried to call her name again. The tent had been silent as the grave before Harry had spoken; now it was in an uproar.
\par 
\par Harry was aware that someone was standing next to him; the feet belonged to Rodney Jeffries. Jeffries stooped down, asking Harry, \'93She\rquote s your aunt?\'94 But then he stopped cold on seeing Harry\rquote 
s face. He gasped, and it seemed to Harry that time was standing still as he and Jeffries looked at each other. He didn\rquote t move while the other man reached out and lightly traced his scar with his finger.
\par 
\par \'93You\rquote re Harry Potter,\'94 Jeffries breathed, almost reverently. Harry swallowed.
\par 
\par \'93How do you know that?\'94 he choked out. Sandy had said, You will be known. This was what she meant. But how? Jeffries didn\rquote t answer, but just stared at Harry and his scar. Harry shook himself and stood with his aunt\rquote 
s limp body in his arms. \'93Let me through!\'94 he cried to the encroaching crowd. Then Adam Justice spotted him; Grace was with him.
\par 
\par \'93You!\'94 Grace cried.
\par 
\par \'93You\rquote re that kid who was in here snogging your girlfriend!\'94 Adam Justice cried. Harry saw a shocked look on Mr. Babcock\rquote s face and an amused one on Dr. Forbes\rquote .
\par 
\par \'93Mr. Babcock! Dr. Forbes! Help me!\'94 he called to them. They both made their way through the crowd, Dr. Forbes leading the way, and soon they were outside on the grass.
\par 
\par \'93This way,\'94 Mr. Babcock said. \'93The vicarage is close--we can use my car.\'94
\par 
\par Harry was carrying just the upper half of his aunt now; Dr. Forbes was helping with the other half. When they reached Babcock\rquote s car, which turned out to be a Ford that was about thi
rty years old (With a huge back seat), they put Petunia Dursley inside and Dr. Forbes examined her quickly.
\par 
\par He emerged from the car, his hands thrust deep into his pockets. \'93She\rquote s in shock. You get her home and throw cold water on her face and then give her a nice cuppa. She\rquote ll come round.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Dr. Forbes--when--how--I didn\rquote t know. Cancer--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Ah. She didn\rquote t tell you.\'94
\par 
\par \'93No. Was she seeing you about it? Does my uncle know?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m just the village doctor, Harry. And I don\rquote t know whether she\rquote s told her husband. All I can say is that I referred her to an oncologist in London some months ago. There\rquote 
s no harm in telling you that now, as you already know that she has cancer. But I can\rquote t say anything more.\'94
\par 
\par Harry looked into the back seat. \'93We should get her home. Uncle Vernon\rquote s been wondering where she\rquote s going in the evenings...\'94
\par 
\par Harry sat in the back seat with his aunt\rquote s head pillowed on his leg; he felt oddly protective of her suddenly,
 and noticed again the family resemblance to his mother that he was only able to spot in certain lights, or when she held her head just so. It was easier to see in repose, when she wasn\rquote t contorting her features into a sneer.
\par 
\par As he drove, Mr. Babcock hummed The Impossible Dream. Harry was about to comment on this, but he thought it was possible that the vicar didn\rquote t even realize he was doing it. Dr. Forbes didn\rquote 
t seem to notice; he rode half-turned toward the back seat, keeping an eye on his patient.
\par 
\par When they pulled up outside the Dursley house, Harry said, \'93Dr. Forbes--could you ring the bell and talk to my uncle first, so he doesn\rquote t panic?\'94
\par 
\par Forbes nodded and walked toward the front door while Harry and Mr. Babcock carefully removed Petunia Dursley from
 the back seat of the car and carried her toward the door. Dr. Forbes never had a chance to offer Vernon Dursley any reassurance, for he started going mad as soon as he saw Harry and the vicar carrying his wife. Harry motioned to the stairs with his head,
 and he and Babcock started carrying her upstairs while Forbes yelled at his uncle, \'93Calm down, man! She\rquote s all right. Had a bit of a shock, though....\'94
 Harry grimaced; he was a nice man, was Dr. Forbes, but his bedside manner needed some work.
\par 
\par They placed 
Petunia Dursley carefully on her bed and Harry removed her shoes. He asked Babcock to bring a glass of cold water from the bath, and he left. Harry frowned, brushing her hair from her brow. How had she thrown Jeffries back against the dais like that? It l
ooked for all the world as though she\rquote d performed either a banishing charm or the Disarming Charm. Was his Aunt Petunia a witch and never knew it? Did Dumbledore know it? Harry was very confused; he\rquote 
d thought the lost Weasley sisters were the only adult-witches-living-as-muggles he was going to have to deal with in this life.
\par 
\par Babcock made to throw the water in the glass at her face, but Harry took it from him and dipped his hand into the icy water, patting her face with his cold hand. His aunt finally blinked and then widened her eyes when she saw the vicar.
\par 
\par \'93Oh!\'94 she cried, distraught. \'93I--please--please can I talk to my nephew, Mr. Babcock?\'94
\par 
\par The vicar nodded and put his hand on Harry\rquote s shoulder, squeezed it for a moment. \'93Shall I call on you tomorrow, Mrs. Dursley?\'94 he asked.
\par 
\par \'93No!\'94 she said, very suddenly. Harry frowned. \'93I mean--don\rquote t bother yourself, vicar, really. I\rquote ll be fine.\'94 Her voice shook, not making her sound very convincing. Harry had never remembered seeing her vulnerable like this.
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote ll let myself out, then,\'94 he said, looking more than a little rejected. When he was gone. Harry turned to her. He wasn\rquote t certain how to start.
\par 
\par \'93Does--does Uncle Vernon know about--about the cancer?\'94 He waited, surprised that he\rquote d had the courage to say the word. He remembered Snape\rquote s Pensieve, his aunt visiting his mother, talking about their mother dying.
\par 
\par \'93Yes,\'94 she said tersely. \'93But he--he doesn\rquote t know--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--}{\f1\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 T}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 hat you\rquote ve been going to hear Jeffries,\'94 he finished, and she tightened her lips, neither nod
ding nor shaking her head. She swallowed and looked at him, and he realized suddenly how frightened she was.
\par 
\par \'93I never went forward before. On the other nights. I had always stayed in my seat. Tonight I finally stood and--I--I didn\rquote t know he would turn me into--into one of you. He must--he must be like you.\'94
 She shuddered, then covered her face with the pillow.
\par 
\par \'93Aunt Petunia, stop! What makes you think--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, don\rquote t pretend!\'94 she said uncovering her face again. \'93You saw it! And so did everyone there! I\rquote m ruined! I can never show my face in the village again--possibly in all of Surrey--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Aunt Petunia,\'94 he said as slowly and evenly as he could. \'93I don\rquote t mean to frighten you--but there seems to be a--a pattern of people lately doing what seems to be magic even though they seem to be muggles--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Do you think you could say \lquote Seem\rquote  a few more times?\'94 she snapped irritably. \'93How does that help me?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well,\'94 he hesitated, \'93Mrs. Figg has some people looking into it--\'94 he said slowly, wincing, waiting for the negative response. Having only recently discovered Mrs. Figg was a witch, he was uncertain how she would take this.
\par 
\par Surprisingly, she actually looked interested in what he had to say. \'93Perhaps,\'94 she said, her voice still shaking, \'93We can go to see Arabella tomorrow about my, er, little problem.\'94
\par 
\par Harry almost fell off the edge of the bed when she said this. \'93Oh. Um, all right. If--if you don\rquote t mind--don\rquote t mind going over there.\'94
\par 
\par She returned to being her usual irritable self. \'93Yes, I do mind. I mind very much that I am now an unnatural freak of nature--\'94
\par 
\par \'93We don\rquote t know that, Aunt Petunia. Let\rquote s wait and see what Mrs. Figg has to say. Maybe--maybe it\rquote s temporary. You don\rquote t know.\'94
\par 
\par Vernon Dursley entered the room and Harry stood up as his uncle rushed to his wife\rquote s side. \'93Petunia, my darling! Forbes couldn\rquote t tell me anything. Are you all right?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote ll be all right if Harry ever stops gawping like a beached fish and gets me my tea!\'94 
she snapped at him, but for some reason, Harry suddenly felt like this was an act, as though she was trying to convince her husband she was Petunia-Dursley-As-Usual, that everything was normal and she was not in danger of actually having a civil conversat
ion with her annoying nephew.
\par 
\par As he walked down to the kitchen, Sandy spoke again: \'93Bells shall ring.\'94 Harry frowned. What might that mean? But he knew it would do no good to ask her. He went to the kitchen and made his aunt\rquote s tea; when he returned to the 
bedroom and handed her the piping hot mug, his uncle was rubbing her feet and talking in low, soothing tones to her. Harry felt he should leave quickly; clearly, she didn\rquote 
t want her husband to know anything about where she was and what had occurred earlier in the evening. He had a feeling that Dr. Forbes probably hadn\rquote t told his uncle about his aunt making Rodney Jeffries fly backward, or even that she\rquote 
d gone to see Jeffries at all. Forbes seemed to be very circumspect.
\par 
\par Harry was feeling that a cup of tea 
might not be a bad idea for him, either, and he went back down to the kitchen, bustling about and taking out a packet of biscuits to eat as well. When the phone rang shrilly, it jolted him at first, but then he realized that that must have been what Sandy
 meant, and he ran to pick it up, wondering if it was the vicar or the doctor, checking up on his aunt.
\par 
\par He was utterly unprepared for the voice he heard.
\par 
\par \'93Harry! Is that you?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Hermione? Is something wrong?\'94
\par 
\par \'93No!\'94 she said, and now he could hear the undercurrent of delight in her voice. \'93Not at all! I\rquote ve found her! Margaret Dougherty! The right one, I\rquote 
m almost positive! She has a web site. Do you have something to write with, so I can give you the address?\'94
\par 
\par He found a pencil and scrap of paper and quickly wrote down what she told him. \'93That\rquote s wonderful, Hermione!\'94
\par 
\par \'93I know!\'94 she said, unabashed. \'93Wait until we tell Ron. And Ginny,\'94 she added, sounding just a little mischievous.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, you--\'94 he started to say, but then he added, \'93And Ron\rquote s and Ginny\rquote s brothers. Especially Bill and Charlie. Remember how Mrs. Weasley said they\rquote ve always blamed themselves?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh! And Mr. and Mrs. Weasley! They\rquote ll be thrilled! Oh, Harry, this will be wonderful!\'94
\par 
\par \'93Hold on, hold on. We still have to make sure it\rquote s really her. How do you know this is her website?\'94
\par 
\par \'93She talks about being adopted at the age of seven and not remembering anything before that. Who else could it be? Of course, she and I probably won\rquote t get on, unfortunately--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Why not?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well--you know how I am about Divination--\'94
\par 
\par \'93So?\'94
\par 
\par \'93So? That\rquote s what her web site\rquote s all about. It\rquote s her hobby. Tarot, horoscopes, star charts, you name it.\'94
\par 
\par Harry swallowed. \'93Does she--does she say she can see auras?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes--how did you know? Oh, wait. That\rquote s probably another one of those things you can\rquote t explain until you show me your Pensieve....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well--it would just be kind of hard for you to understand until you have. I don\rquote t want to start telling at the wrong end. And I wouldn\rquote t assume right away that you won\rquote t get on with her. You get on with all of the other Weasleys.
\'94
\par 
\par \'93I suppose. I\rquote ll just have to keep my opinions about Divination to myself.\'94
\par 
\par Harry smiled, glad Hermione couldn\rquote t see him. He tried not to laugh outright. \'93And that shouldn\rquote t be at all difficult....\'94
\par 
\par \'93There\rquote s no call for sarcasm. Oh, all right--I suppose there is. Let\rquote s just wait and see. You take a look at the web site and tell me what you think, whether we should try to find out how to contact her in the real world.\'94
\par 
\par \'93All right. But first--\'94 he lowered his voice and peered into the front hall to see whether his uncle might be coming downstairs; he carefully closed the kitchen door and leaned against it. \'93
I have some good news and some--well, some confusing news...\'94
\par 
\par He told her first about finding Sandy. However, instead of being glad for him, she sounded more worried than ever.
\par 
\par \'93Harry--that\rquote s not a very good sign. If she\rquote s worried about you, that other snake may have Seen something Sandy hasn\rquote t told you about yet. Or some other l
arger snake at the zoo may have Seen something. Sandy probably went through quite a lot to get out of the zoo and come all the way down to Surrey from London. That\rquote 
s not a huge thing for a human, but for a snake? Although, I suppose the good thing is that she is with you again....\'94
\par 
\par Harry sighed; he should have know Hermione would have something to say about everything. Next he described his visit to the Rodney Jeffries show that evening, and having to bring his aunt home, and the cancer.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, the poor thing!\'94 Hermione said, as though he hadn\rquote t described his aunt as the worst parent on the planet for the past six years. \'93She must have been going looking for a miracle or something....\'94
\par 
\par \'93I reckon. In all your reading, Hermione, have you ever heard of someone magical not finding out they\rquote re magical until they\rquote re all grown up? Even middle aged?\'94
\par 
\par \'93How old is your aunt?\'94
\par 
\par \'93She turned forty-three at the end of May.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Hmm. I can look through Hogwarts, A History. And writing to Dumbledore would probably also be a good idea. Do you really think she\rquote s magical now, Harry?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I don\rquote t know. But my mum was. Some families have more than one muggle-born magical person. Look at the Creevey brothers.\'94
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s true. And I can\rquote t believe what Jeffries said about the Westminster explosion! What did Voldemort do to him?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I dunno. You should hear his choir, though. Really good. He puts on quite a show. I think the thing that bothers me the most is the fact that he knew who I was. Some bloke who used to be a law clerk just looked at me and said, \lquote You\rquote 
re Harry Potter.\rquote  Why? How?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I don\rquote t know. But didn\rquote t you say Mrs. Figg and the operatives are already looking into Jeffries and that milkman?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yeah. I\rquote m going over there tomorrow; maybe I can find out more.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Drop me an owl when you do; you can ring me up too, if you like, but I like having things on paper. I\rquote ve had a terrible time taking notes while we\rquote ve been talking....\'94
\par 
\par \'93You\rquote re taking notes? Hermione, we\rquote re not in school now...\'94
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s no reason not to be organized. Now--do you think you can get into Dudley\rquote s room to check that web site?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote ll try. Thanks for finding it. I\rquote ll talk to you tomorrow.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Good. Love you. Have a good night.\'94 She hung up and Harry found himself listening to nothingness. Odd, he thought, how we can say that now that we\rquote re no longer a couple.
\par 
\par \'93Love you,\'94 he said into the phone, although he knew she was no longer there.
\par 
\par He crept up the stairs and put his ear to his aunt\rquote s and uncle\rquote s bedroom door, hearing only snoring. He entered Dudley\rquote 
s room cautiously and closed the door securely. The noise of the computer coming on made him wince, but when he was finally able to go to Margaret Dougherty\rquote s website, he couldn\rquote t have stopped grinning if he\rquote d tried.
\par 
\par \'93Hermione, I could kiss you,\'94 he said softly, marveling as he read the site. At one point, Margaret Dougherty even wrote, Now, oddly enough, I\rquote ve never actually been able to do a chart for myself; I can only do them for others
. Harry smiled, remembering that that was because she didn\rquote 
t know her true birthday. As he continued to read, only one word came into his head, inspired by something Mr. Babcock had said earlier in the evening. He grinned broadly and whispered under his breath:
\par 
\par \'93Bingo.\'94

\par 
\par Her heart thumping and drumming, Eleanor scrambled all over

\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par Harry looked sideways at his aunt as they waited for Mrs. Figg to answer the door. Mrs. Figg finally answered the door and she smiled sweetly at his aunt, which very nearly made Harry demand to know who she really was.
\par 
\par His aunt nodded at the old woman, saying tersely, \'93Arabella. Thank you for seeing us,\'94 as though they\rquote 
d only just been introduced. Harry smiled ruefully at her before they were ushered into the living room. Draco was lounging comfortably in an armchair, watching a football match on the television. He looked up at Harry obliquely, saying, \'93
Harry--did you know muggles have something they call a World Cup, too?\'94 Then he noticed Petunia Dursley and he sat up abruptly, switching off the television. \'93Oh,\'94 he choked out. \'93Hello.\'94 He turned very pink and started re
arranging things on the tea table.
\par 
\par To cover the awkward moment, Harry said, \'93Of course I know. I grew up here, remember?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Right, right,\'94 Draco muttered, stirring the sugar with the sugar spoon.
\par 
\par They all sat and engaged in the formalities of serving tea. Then Mrs. Figg fixed Petunia Dursley with an eye that was starting to remind Harry of her brother\rquote s magical eye, and said, \'93Suppose you tell me why you\rquote 
re here, Petunia, unless it\rquote s to tell me off for not informing you that I\rquote m a witch.\'94
\par 
\par Harry\rquote s aunt put down her cup and saucer and pursed her lips. Harry suddenly felt quite sorry for her and put his hand on hers, asking quietly, \'93Do you want me to tell them what happened last night?\'94
 She nodded, not looking at any of them, and Harry explained that he\rquote d gone to see Jeffries out of curiosity and described everything that happened, including his aunt making Jeffries fly backwards.
\par 
\par \'93Remember when Katie and I told you about the magical signatures? Well, now that I\rquote ve been, I know why they weren\rquote t on the dais. He doesn\rquote 
t stay up there; he goes down into the aisle and does--whatever he does--in the middle of everyone. When I was trying to sleep last night, I remembered that when we\rquote d seen the signatures, there was a blur of pink in the middle of the tent, which 
must have been where he was standing when he was doing everything. I still wish I knew how he knew me, though. Oh--and did Draco tell you--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--}{\f1\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 T}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 hat the tent was gone this morning. Yes. When he came back from his run he told me. I called Albus. We\rquote ll talk about that later,\'94
 she said, eyeing Petunia Dursley. She put her own hand on Harry\rquote s aunt\rquote s. \'93How are you feeling this morning, dear?\'94
\par 
\par She swallowed. \'93I feel--odd. When I woke, I thought--I just wanted to feel normal, and eat my breakfast and read the ne
wspaper and be normal, and suddenly, the bedroom door flew open and the newspaper flew into the room and landed right on my lap! And when I was in the kitchen, things were happening....\'94
\par 
\par Harry\rquote s jaw dropped. \'93You didn\rquote t tell me that!\'94
\par 
\par \'93You were out running,\'94 she spat at him.
\par 
\par \'93And walking Dunkirk. But--but--you have to be careful! What if a muggle saw you--?\'94
\par 
\par She stood suddenly and her plate of biscuits crashed to the floor and broke. \'93I am a--a--a muggle, or what I prefer to call a normal person!\'94 she exclaimed. Then she looked down remorsefully at the broken plate. \'93Oh, Arabella--your china--\'94

\par 
\par Mrs. Figg sat back in her chair and raised one eyebrow. \'93Well, Petunia--fix it.\'94
\par 
\par She looked at Arabella Figg. \'93Excuse me?\'94
\par 
\par The eyebrow was still raised. \'93I said to fix it. You may be many things, my dear, but I do not think it would be accurate at this point to call you a muggle.\'94 She nodded at the broken dish. \'93
Go on. Think about it being whole again. Focus all of your mind on it.\'94
\par 
\par Harry\rquote s heart was racin
g; he watched his aunt look back and forth between Mrs. Figg and the pieces of china on the floor. Then he saw her swallow and hold out her hand, looking like the broken dish might be carrying some fatal air-borne virus. She started shaking violently afte
r
 a minute, her eyes looking wild, and then, suddenly, the bits of the plate leapt into the air, joined themselves back together and settled neatly back on the tea table, in one piece. Immediately after, the fallen biscuits leapt up onto the plate where th
ey\rquote d previously been.
\par 
\par His aunt looked at Mrs. Figg, then Harry and Draco. Draco gave her a broad smile. \'93Not bad for your first time!\'94 he said encouragingly. Harry was actually finding it hard to hate him at this moment, but he did feel a discontent rumble through him.

\par 
\par His aunt turned very pink when Draco Malfoy smiled at her. She sat again, moving her hands in her lap nervously. \'93I--I did do that, didn\rquote t I?\'94
\par 
\par Mrs. Figg smiled gently at her. \'93I don\rquote t know whether this Jeffries fellow did it or whether you had already started to evince magical abilities and you\rquote 
d been ignoring it, but you definitely did mend that plate, Petunia. As Draco observed, not bad. Not bad at all.\'94 Harry was amazed to see that his aunt was actually looking rather pleased with herself--although she was trying to hide it.
\par 
\par \'93How--how is this possible?\'94 he demanded of his old baby-sitter.
\par 
\par Mrs. Figg sighed. \'93Well, it\rquote s a little complicated. What do you think, Harry, separates magical people from non-magical people?\'94
\par 
\par He stared at her as though she were mad. \'93Being able to do magic or not do magic, of course.\'94
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s not what I mean. Why can magical people do magic?\'94
\par 
\par He shrugged, at a loss. \'93I don\rquote t know--they\rquote re born that way, I suppose.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Why?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Why?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes. Why?\'94
\par 
\par He opened his mouth, then shut it again. \'93Because,\'94 Draco drawled now, in a bored voice, \'93Of our genes.\'94
\par 
\par Harry felt very stupid. \'93Oh. Right. Of course.\'94
\par 
\par Mrs. Figg frowned at Draco. \'93It\rquote s not quite that simple, of course. It\rquote s not as though there is a single magic gene that\rquote 
s either turned on or off. There are actually a large number of magic genes--no one is really sure how many. Wizards have actually had the human genome mostly mapped for some time now, while muggles are onl
y just now catching up. However, even though we have identified the sequence of genes which have been definitely identified as tied to magic, which I believe muggle scientists have assigned to various abilities like singing and so forth, as some of the ge
nes do more than one thing--although, truthfully, they\rquote re a bit vague about it as well--we\rquote re only a little better off. I can tell you that most wizards have more than half of their magic genes \lquote Turned on,\rquote 
 if you will, while most muggles have more than half of their magic genes \lquote turned off.\rquote  We do not know of anyone who has all of their magic genes turned on, and it seems that even your average muggle has one or two turned on. It\rquote 
s not enough to do real magic, generally, but it\rquote s why, in a large group of muggles, odd things sometimes occur. Collectively, they can bring together enough magical energy to do something--either good or evil.\'94
\par 
\par Harry frowned. \'93I--I never thought about it before. So someone who\rquote s magical might have a gene turned on for--making potions, or flying, or--\'94
\par 
\par \'93She\rquote s ahead.\'94
\par 
\par \'93What? Who\rquote s ahead?\'94 he hissed at his arm. Then he noticed the three of them looking at him. He face felt warm.
\par 
\par \'93Why are you hissing like a leaky balloon, Harry?\'94 his aunt snapped at him.
\par 
\par \'93Does this ignorant woman not know what a snake sounds like?\'94 Sandy snapped right back--although only Harry could understand her.
\par 
\par \'93She doesn\rquote t know--\'94 he started to say, when he met Mrs. Figg\rquote s gaze. If she had been Queen Victoria she would no doubt have been informing him that \'93We are not amused.\'94
\par 
\par \'93When you\rquote ve quite finished, Harry,\'94 she said imperiously. Harry felt like he was in school already. Oh, so that\rquote s how it\rquote s to be with Professor Figg, is it? he thought.
\par 
\par \'93As I was saying, take you, for instance, Harry. I understand you have the Parseltongue gene turned on, so that you can speak to snakes and understand what they say. However, Albus believes that you weren\rquote 
t born that way, that it occurred after you were attacked, as a baby. In fact, he and I both believe that attack caus
ed a number of your dormant magical genes to be switched on. This Jeffries fellow may have had more magic genes turned on than most muggles--although still not enough to manifest magic--and somehow, his experience in the tube station activated more of his
 magic genes. I believe he then caused the same thing to happen to Petunia when she came into contact with him.\'94 She turned to Harry\rquote s aunt. \'93
You, my dear, may not have had as many magic genes turned on as your sister when you were born, and so you were not
 identified as a witch and did not receive a Hogwarts letter; however, you very likely had a good number turned on, more than most people, I should think, as you are the sister of a witch, and then your experience with Jeffries--like his experience with V
oldemort--seems to have put you over the top, and you now have enough genes that are no longer dormant, and you are manifesting magic.\'94
\par 
\par \'93But even though you say Aunt Petunia didn\rquote t have enough magic genes turned on when she was born to manifest magic, most magical children don\rquote t start to manifest magic right away, do they?\'94
\par 
\par \'93That is true, Harry. But think about this: I knew your father, and you seem to have inherited your father\rquote s problem with rapidly-growing facial hair, which would not have manifested it
self until you were actually old enough to grow facial hair. Some magic comes earlier, some later. This is why witches and wizards don\rquote t go to Hogwarts until they are around eleven.\'94
\par 
\par \'93And why we\rquote re not allowed to do magic outside of school until we\rquote re seventeen?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes. Dormant magical genes can \lquote Wake up\rquote  at unpredictable times, making a young witch or wizard\rquote 
s magic unexpectedly stronger with absolutely no warning. And since our emotions have a great deal to do with our execution of magic, and adolescents\rquote 
 emotions are all over the place, thanks to their hormones, the rule against magic outside of school helps deal with that problem as well.\'94
\par 
\par Draco smiled smugly. \'93Of course, I don\rquote t have to worry about that any more,\'94 he said pointedly to Harry. Mrs. Figg
 hit him with the back of her hand before continuing. Harry was disappointed. He had rather hoped she would make his mouth disappear.
\par 
\par \'93Although we wizards understand a great deal about genetics, we haven\rquote t attempted to turn on dormant magic genes. At least, most people haven\rquote 
t. I suspect that one thing Voldemort was doing all those years was working on potions and spells to turn on every one of his magic genes, in order to become the most powerful wizard in the world.
\par 
\par \'93In our world, such a thing is
 looked on as Dark Magic, largely because of the nefarious use to which it could be put. Muggles are just now discovering that dormant genes can be activated or that they can be substituted by an infusion, if you will, of genes from an outside source. The
y call this process \lquote Gene therapy.\rquote  I do not pretend to understand how it works--even most muggles doing it don\rquote 
t really understand it yet, either, and it has proved fatal to some people--but I do understand that the ultimate goal is to cure genetic diseases.
\par 
\par \'93Muggles are unaware, of course, that there are magic genes that could accidentally activate. There are many genes which we all carry but which remain dormant in most people. Or genes that are dormant in both parents that can be activated in their chil
d. Just as two people with dwarfism may produce a child of average height, so can two muggles, who have mostly dormant magic genes, produce a child with enough active magic genes to be a witch or wizard.\'94
\par 
\par Harry sat silently, staring into his tea cup. After a minute he lifted his eyes to her. \'93So Jeffries isn\rquote t really curing anyone, is he?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I think he is doing exactly what he says he\rquote s doing--helping to augment people\rquote s ability to believe. I think the ability to believe in things we cannot see, or that wh
ich is not necessarily supported by empirical evidence, is a gene in and of itself. Some people like to call this a \lquote Religion\rquote 
 gene. However, it is also very important in magic, where believing that you can perform a spell is as important as knowing the in
cantation. He is probably helping people a great deal by augmenting their ability to believe that they can do certain things. Sometimes belief is all that\rquote s necessary for a person to accomplish what seems impossible.\'94
\par 
\par \'93But isn\rquote t that--isn\rquote t that a little like the Imperius Curse?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Not quite, Harry. A wizard putting someone else under Imperius is trying to control that person. Jeffries seems to be helping people to control themselves. He does not seem to be imposing his will on them--that is a significant 
difference. He is helping them to reach their own goals. Presumably. A person\rquote s inherent disbelief can still stymie the process. They can blame him and say he is a charlatan, all because they did not believe strongly enough. Actually, I\rquote 
m quite impressed with muggles. Jeffries could have used his ability for great evil. muggles who are working on gene therapy are trying to cure disease. I know my brother tends to go on about how much more dangerous muggles are than wizards, but I\rquote 
ve also seen that muggles can go farther in the other direction than we have, as well. The muggle capacity to work for the greater good is something I\rquote ve always admired. Don\rquote 
t tell Alastor, but as dreadful as some muggles can be, I also quite admire them for many reasons.\'94
\par 
\par Harry\rquote s aunt was frowning. \'93That\rquote s all very well and good,\'94 she said. \'93But now what do I do? Now that he\rquote s--he\rquote s switched more of--of these genes on--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, you might start by making yourself well, Petunia.\'94
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par \'93You heard me. You can do this. Think about converting the cancerous cells to normal cells. Believe. Picture it very clearly. Get a medical journal if it will help, so you can see photos of normal cells and cancer cells, so you really know what you
\rquote re doing. There\rquote s a reason, you know, why witches and wizards live longer than muggles, and it isn\rquote t all fancy potions.\'94
\par 
\par \'93But-but--\'94
\par 
\par \'93But she asked my mum to cure my grandmother of cancer,\'94 Harry interrupted, \'93And my mum said she was afraid she would kill her if she tried.\'94
\par 
\par \'93How do you know that?\'94 his aunt demanded.
\par 
\par \'93Yes, well, she could have,\'94 Mrs. Figg said, ignoring Petunia Dursley\rquote s interjection. \'93Your grandmother wasn\rquote t the witch, Harry. It\rquote s far more effective when the subject is also the magical person. That core of belief in one
\rquote s own abilities is the most important element of success. When were you diagnosed, dear?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Dr. Forbes referred me to a specialist in London two months ago.\'94
\par 
\par \'93And what did the specialist say?\'94
\par 
\par She looked down at the plate she\rquote d repaired, smoothing her skirt with her hands and turning pink. \'93I--I never went to see him--\'94
\par 
\par To Harry\rquote s surprise, Mrs. Figg nodded. \'93You were terribly frightened. I understand. Well, do you still have the information he gave you?\'94 She nodded. \'93Good. Go
 to see him. You want to find out exactly where the cancer is and how far along. You need to know exactly what you\rquote re dealing with if you\rquote re going to beat this. Unless you\rquote d rather use the muggle methods of coping--?\'94
\par 
\par Unexpectedly, his aunt began to cry, slow tears trickling down her cheeks. \'93No! My mum--she lost all of her hair, and weighed six stone when she died, if that. The end of her life was a misery....That\rquote s why I didn\rquote 
t go to the specialist in London....\'94
\par 
\par Mrs. Figg nodded again. \'93Just going to see him for diagnosis doesn\rquote t mean you\rquote re agreeing to any treatment. Think of it as a fact-finding mission. Take notes--he\rquote 
ll like that. As for literature, try to get anything with very good pictures of cells. You need to know what you\rquote re doing. I\rquote ve heard 
of some very strong-minded muggles managing to alter their health through imagery exercises, and they probably only have a handful of active magic genes compared to you. I can come with you if you\rquote d rather not take Vernon.\'94
\par 
\par Petunia Dursley looked very grateful. Harry tried not to show his surprise. \'93Would you, Arabella? Th-thank you.\'94
\par 
\par They rose to go, but Mrs. Figg detained Harry. \'93Can I keep Harry for a little bit, Petunia? As he\rquote s Head Boy and I\rquote m going to be one of his professors in September, there are a few things we need to discuss.\'94
\par 
\par Harry frowned, but his aunt left without questioning this and he returned to the living room, sipping his tepid tea, wondering what she really wanted to talk about. Mrs. Figg checked her watch, then said, \'93Any minute.\'94 
Harry looked at Draco Malfoy, to see whether he had any idea what she was talking about. He raised his eyebrows and shrugged. He soon found out why they were waiting, however, when a spinning head suddenly popped into the firebox. Harry jumped, then settl
ed back into his chair when it stopped.
\par 
\par \'93Hello, Harry! I\rquote m so glad you\rquote re there.\'94 Hermione grinned at him.
\par 
\par \'93Hermione! When--?\'94 And then he remembered something. She\rquote s ahead. She\rquote s. A. Head.
\par 
\par \'93Very funny,\'94 he whispered to Sandy. Hermione didn\rquote t notice.
\par 
\par \'93Minerva added my dad\rquote s office fireplace to the network. It doesn\rquote t allow travel, though, so people can\rquote t just intrude on Dad whenever they please. She\rquote 
s accustomed to talking to Professor Dumbledore this way, you understand, and she wanted to be able to check in with him without having to wait for an owl to reach him or having to arrange for him to be at a muggle telephone or something. I\rquote 
ve never done this before. It\rquote s much more convenient than using the phone; I have both hands free for taking notes...\'94
\par 
\par Harry laughed, and so did Draco Malfoy, but his wasn\rquote t a friendly laugh. \'93You don\rquote t even take the summer off, do you Granger?\'94 he said derisively.
\par 
\par She looked at him, her mouth twisting. \'93Hello to you, too, Malfoy. I didn\rquote t know you\rquote d be here.\'94
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote ll remind you that I live here. At least for the summer. Did I--did I hear you say the name Minerva? Professor McGonagall is staying with you, and you\rquote re calling her Minerva?\'94
\par 
\par Hermione looked distinctly smug now, Harry thought. \'93Yes, she is and I am, not that it\rquote s any of your business. At any rate, I\rquote ve called to talk to Mrs. Figg and Harry, so you--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Can just sit here and enjoy my tea and make snarky comments about how anal-retentive you are--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Malfoy!\'94 Harry cried, standing and glaring at him, clenching his fists.
\par 
\par \'93Sit down, Harry,\'94 Hermione said authoritatively. \'93I am perfectly capable of ignoring him. Did Mrs. Figg tell you why I\rquote m calling?\'94
\par 
\par Harry looked at the old woman suspiciously. \'93No, she didn\rquote t.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, I called over there--using the telephone--after I rang off with you last night. I told her what you\rquote d told me about everything that happened in the tent, when you went to hear Jeffries.\'94
\par 
\par He glared at Mrs. Figg. \'93So you already knew, and you let me sit here repeating all that to you!\'94
\par 
\par She shrugged. \'93I wanted to hear it from you. And I wanted to see whether Petunia had a difference of opinion about what had occurred.\'94
\par 
\par Harry turned to the fireplace, to Hermione\rquote s head. He was having a hard time getting used to seeing it there. \'93Why did you call her?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Because I\rquote ve also been doing some research about the muggle milkman. I think there\rquote s a connection. I don\rquote 
t know whether Jeffries is responsible for him, but I think the muggle milkman is another person who had a few more magic genes turned on and that\rquote s why he\rquote s now able to do magic.\'94
\par 
\par Mrs. Figg sat back in her chair and spoke now. \'93I haven\rquote t had a chance to call you about this yet, Hermione, but this morning I received a message about it. Our people in London have figured out who he is. His name 
is Alphonse Nichols. Technically, he isn\rquote t a muggle. His mother is a witch and his father is a wizard.\'94
\par 
\par \'93He\rquote s a squib!\'94 Harry exclaimed. She nodded.
\par 
\par \'93Precisely. Which is why his name isn\rquote t on old lists of Hogwarts students and there\rquote s no trace of him in 
the wizarding world. However, with parents who are magical, unlike a muggle who has had just a few more magic genes turned on, he already knows about the wizarding world. We still don\rquote 
t know who enabled him to do magic, but whoever did it also put him under Imperius, and gave him Polyjuice Potion to take on the appearance of your milkman. And Harry--why didn\rquote t you tell me about the milk van?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I thought I had. What about it?\'94
\par 
\par \'93
Oh, I suppose you did. Well, what you failed to notice was that it was a van, a vehicle that would accommodate a person being hidden in the back. Milkmen usually use open milk floats for their deliveries. No hiding places in there. That should have tipped
 you off right away that something was not right.\'94
\par 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93I go out running early, but not usually so early that I see these milk floats. I didn\rquote t know.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Whoever put him under Imperius must have been worried about someone catching him and interrogating him, because he made sure Nichols didn\rquote t see him. So all we know is that it wasn\rquote 
t a muggle who was using a wand to break into your neighbors\rquote  house.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, that\rquote s more than we knew before, isn\rquote t it?\'94 Harry said.
\par 
\par \'93I assume Mrs. Figg told you about magic genes?\'94 Hermione said now.
\par 
\par Harry looked at her suspiciously now. \'93Was that your doing?\'94
\par 
\par Hermione looked very pleased with herself. \'93We talked for a long time about it last night, and I told her about gene therapy. It explains so much! My mum\rquote s r
eally interested, too. She almost decided to be a doctor, you know, instead of a dentist. At any rate, I thought of something else after I rang off. Something to do with the music you said Jeffries was using, and I looked up--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Did you sleep at all last night, Hermione?\'94 he asked, starting to feel tired just from contemplating what her night must have been like.
\par 
\par \'93I was too excited to sleep. I can take a nap this afternoon. Listen to me! Impossible Dream is from the musical The Man of LaMancha. It\rquote s about Don Quixote. I pulled out my copy of Cervantes and reread it--\'94
\par 
\par \'93All of it?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Of course. Anyway, I\rquote m wondering whether it\rquote s really a coincidence that he chose that music. Reading Cervantes got me thinking....What if he was writing about someone whom eve
ryone thought was mad, someone everyone thought was tilting at windmills, because that\rquote 
s all they could see? What if Don Quixote really saw dragons, actual dragons, which we know are real, after all. But no one else could see them. Maybe he was a little li
ke a border-line squib. Filch is a squib and he has no problem seeing Hogwarts. Or Quixote might have been a muggle-born wizard who hadn\rquote 
t been educated about the wizarding world, so he could see magical things that muggles convinced themselves weren\rquote t there, but he didn\rquote 
t know the magical solutions to dealing with things like dragons. I think even a very frightened wizard would be hard-pressed to perform spontaneous magic that would have any effect on a dragon. Think of the way the four of you coped during
 the Tournament, Harry.\'94
\par 
\par He frowned. \'93Yeah, I coped by being spiked by a Hungarian Horntail and Cedric and Fleur \lquote Coped\rquote  by getting themselves set on fire. So you think Don Quixote was a real person?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Not necessarily. But I think Cervantes could have been writing about someone he knew, or someone he\rquote d heard of. I think he wrote about someone who could really see things others couldn\rquote 
t, and as a result, the rest of the world thought he was mad. Do you see why it makes perfect sense that Jeffries likes the Don Quixote story, or at least the Impossible Dream song from the musical?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I do have a concern, about Jeffries, though, Harry,\'94 Mrs. Figg said now, \'93
And Hermione shares my concern. Helping muggles to believe in themselves is one thing, but if he causes any more people like your aunt to evince magical abilities, the Ministry is going to be in an uproar....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Why?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Why?\'94 Hermione repeated. \'93Because Yo
u-Know-Who and his followers are already going after muggle-born witches and wizards. It will be very difficult to keep track of a whole slew of new magical people and protect them at the same time. We have to find a way to turn people like your aunt back
 into muggles.\'94
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94 he cried out, getting to his feet again. \'93I can\rquote t believe you, of all people, are saying that, Hermione!\'94
\par 
\par \'93What do you mean, me of all people? Don\rquote t you think every day I worry about my mum and dad being attacked because of me? Do you think I want more people going through that? It\rquote s for their own protection.\'94
\par 
\par Harry thought of the ban on muggle-borns that had existed in his other life, and the same reasoning being used to support it. He didn\rquote t sit down. \'93I will not let someone stan
d by and take away her chance to cure herself, or to finally understand what my life is like and what my mother\rquote 
s life was like. It may not have been intentional for her or Jeffries to turn magical, but how can we take that away from them now that they are? You know what will happen next, if that\rquote s successful, Hermione.\'94 He paused, hoping he didn\rquote 
t have to say it, but she had raised her chin at him defiantly. \'93You\rquote ll be next,\'94 he said, hurtling on when she hadn\rquote t answered him. \'93That will be just one step away from turning the muggle-born witches and wizards into muggles. We
\rquote ll be doing Voldemort\rquote s bloody work for him, ridding the wizarding world of anyone who isn\rquote t a pureblood! Is that what you want?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Maybe it\rquote s what he wants,\'94 Draco Malfoy said quietly. They all looked at him in surprise.
\par 
\par \'93What did you say, Draco?\'94 Mrs. Figg said, examining him carefully.
\par 
\par \'93Well, I\rquote ve been sitting here listening to the two of them rant at each other, and I thought--it\rquote s perfect. The Dark Lord gives this Jeffries some extra power--and for my money, I think he might have been a squib, like the milkman. That
\rquote s why he\rquote d heard of Harry. Then this Jeffries starts to go around giving other people more power. Before you know it, of course, the Ministry will be involved and all worked up about people who don\rquote t know what they\rquote 
re doing having magical abilities. You know that the step after that is to work out a way to take those abilities away again. And once someone has done that for muggles who\rquote ve acquired magical powers--well, I ha
te to say it, but I agree with Harry. The knowledge of how to do it won\rquote 
t manage to stay in the hands of those who mean well. We all know that. It will leak out, and soon any non-pure-bloods will be purged from the wizarding world. When you think about it, it\rquote s pure genius, really....\'94
\par 
\par \'93You hear that?\'94 Harry said to Hermione and Mrs. Figg. \'93Even Malfoy understands what I\rquote m talking about! We can\rquote t allow--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, I didn\rquote t say that would be a bad thing, especially if it gets Granger far, far away from me,\'94 Malfoy said, settling back comfortably and chewing on a biscuit. \'93I just said it\rquote s inevitable. And genius. I wouldn\rquote 
t be surprised if my dad came up with the idea before he went to prison. He\rquote s an old bastard, but he can be damn brilliant when he wants.\'94
\par 
\par Mrs. Figg shook her head. \'93We don\rquote t know. But I\rquote m afraid I agree with Hermione, Harry. The Ministry needs to crack down on unauthorized magic.\'94
\par 
\par \'93You\rquote re the one who had my aunt repair that plate!\'94 Harry spat at her, outraged. \'93And you were telling her how to try to cure herself!\'94
\par 
\par She shrugged. \'93A test. I needed to see a demonstration of her power. And I don\rquote t want her to die, Harry. I\rquote d like to see her do it, to cure herself. But if she kept on doing magic after that....It would be very bad, Harry. She can\rquote 
t be allowed to just go about doing magic where muggles can see her.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Too right,\'94 Hermione agreed from the fireplace. \'93I think your prediction about the Ministry getting interested may come true sooner than you think, Mrs. Figg. Have you seen this morning\rquote s Daily Prophet?\'94
 When the old woman shook her head, Hermione handed her a folded-up newspaper through the flames. She scanned the front page, blanching as she did so. Draco looked over her arm at it, then whistled.
\par 
\par \'93That Furuncle witch definitely has it in for you,\'94 he said to Harry, who was itching to snatch the paper from Mrs. Figg\rquote s hands. When she handed it to him, he felt the colour leave his face too as he read the story.

\par 
\par by Daisy Furuncle
\par 
\par LITTLE WHINGING, SURREY--Last evening, Harry Potter, current Head Boy of Hogwarts, may or may not have performed illegal magic before a large gathering of muggles. Potter, who is about three weeks shy of his seventeenth birthday and 
evidently rather impatient to be of-age, attended a performance by infamous inspirational speaker Rodney Jeffries, also currently under investigation by the Ministry of Magic for performing magic before muggles (Although it is still unclear whether Jeffri
es is a wizard--some suspect he has a behind-the-scenes wizard working for him). Potter was attending the event with his maternal aunt, one Petunia Dursley, and two other muggles who live in the village. When Potter\rquote s aunt went forward for \lquote 
Healing\rquote  from Je
ffries, it is unclear what occurred, but soon after, Potter was at her side and Jeffries was being thrown back against a stage that had been erected in the tent that has been the regular venue for his traveling show. Descriptions from witnesses make it cl
ear that a banishing charm was performed.
\par 
\par Potter and his other muggle companions quickly removed his aunt from the tent and disappeared into the night. Later in the evening, all of Jeffries\rquote  staff and Jeffries himself checked out of the village pub where t
hey had been staying and the current whereabouts of Jeffries and his entourage are unknown. Rumours have been flying to the effect that Potter\rquote 
s aunt, not Potter, performed the banishing charm, but as she is a muggle, Potter is being considered the most li
kely culprit. He received a reprimand five years ago for performing a levitation charm in his home which caused a commotion witnessed by two muggles. He also blew up another aunt a year after he was reprimanded for the levitation charm, and this time the 
Accidental Magic Reversal Squad needed to be called out and memory charms performed. No charges were brought against Potter at that time, as the Ministry was preoccupied searching for the fugitive Sirius Black, who is Potter\rquote s godfather.
\par 
\par According to the Ministry, they do not have sufficient evidence at this time to charge Potter with violating the International Wizarding Secrecy Act, but there are whispers that Potter\rquote s connections in the Ministry (His best friend\rquote 
s father is a highly-placed Ministry official) have hushed up last evening\rquote s activities and that he will likely not be charged--again.
\par 
\par Potter is no stranger to subverting long-standing magical traditions. He caused a house-elf to be freed by trickery four years ago and during the previous three t
erms he was training the house-elves at Hogwarts to fight humans, despite current laws against wand-use by elves. He is clearly out of control, and this reporter shudders to think what sort of chaos would ensue if all underage Hogwarts students received t
he same sort of special treatment as Harry Potter.
\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par His jaw dropped. \'93But--but--completely twisted--And--and was she there Friday night? And--and did I mention twisted--?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes, it has virtually no relationship to reality,\'94 Mrs. Figg said wryly. \'93Connections at the Ministry, indeed! As though you\rquote 
d paid someone to pull strings for you! And as though Arthur Weasley could protect you, if you really broke the law. They know perfectly well what happened, that\rquote s why they\rquote re not going to charge you. But they do n
ot wish to panic witches and wizards by telling them that your muggle aunt performed magic.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Panic? Why should that make them panic?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Because muggles who acquire magical abilities won\rquote t care about magical law, Harry, about the boundaries we\rquote ve established to protect ourselves. They\rquote ll just think it\rquote s a lark.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Aha!\'94 he cried, pointing an accusing finger at her. \'93That\rquote s it, isn\rquote t it? It isn\rquote t really to protect them, as you claim, it\rquote s to protect us, to keep us walled off from an entire world of people we\rquote 
re afraid will start demanding magical help to solve all their problems. Even Hagrid said that to me when I first met him, and it never occurred to me until now how incredibly selfish that is! You were just talking about how you admire muggles who take t
hings they\rquote ve learned and use their knowledge for the greater good. But what about all of the problems in the world that could be solved if magic were used to tackle them? And yet we pass laws against doing this and say, Oh, well, they\rquote 
d be pestering us co
nstantly for help if we did just a little. And now it seems there might be a way for some more of them to be like us, so we might not have to worry about their asking us for help all of the time, and you want to take that away from them?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Harry--\'94 Hermione said imploringly from the fireplace. \'93You don\rquote t understand--\'94
\par 
\par \'93You\rquote re right,\'94 he said, looking at her sadly. \'93I don\rquote t understand how you can be a muggle-born witch saying these things. I have one living relative left: my Aunt Petunia. And no, we\rquote ve nev
er gotten on, but if her being magical could change that, not to mention save her life, I don\rquote t want anyone taking that away from her. She\rquote s--she\rquote s all I\rquote ve got left,\'94
 he said softly. None of them answered him, and he turned and left the room, then the house. He leaned against the closed front door of Mrs. Figg\rquote s house, breathing heavily, as though he\rquote 
d just gone for another run. And then he heard Sandy hissing at him.
\par 
\par \'93I was afraid of this.\'94
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par Harry was waiting to go out with Katie the next evening when the phone rang and his aunt answered. He was sitting in the living room, idly switching channels on the television while his uncle read the newspaper.
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m--I\rquote m fine,\'94 he heard his aunt say shakily into the telephone. She was in the front hall. \'93Well--I--I did repair a plate yesterday. Arabella told you? It--it felt so strange--\'94
\par 
\par Harry frowned and strode into the hall. \'93Who are you talking to?\'94 he demanded of his aunt. She looked a little frightened as she handed him the telephone.
\par 
\par \'93It\rquote s Hermione Granger,\'94 she said shakily. \'93Calling for you.\'94
\par 
\par He grabbed the phone irritably. \'93Er, good,\'94 he said. He dropped his voice to a whisper and covered the handset\rquote s speaker. \'93You can\rquote t just go talking about what you did yesterday to anybody. Uncle Vernon probably shouldn\rquote 
t even know. You have to be very, very careful.\'94
\par 
\par She lifted her chin defiantly. \'93Don\rquote t take long. I don\rquote t want it tied up,\'94 she said, not acknowledging his greater experience in having to keep magical abilities secret.
\par 
\par Harry put the phone to his ear and said, \'93Hermione? What are you doing talking to my aunt?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I was just asking her how she was feeling. She\rquote s going through quite a lot, after all. And it\rquote s not as though we\rquote re strangers; I did live with you for a while, and she wasn\rquote 
t really horrid to me the whole time, you know. I think most of the time she was able to forget that I\rquote m a witch.\'94
\par 
\par \'93She and Uncle Vernon also didn\rquote t mind the check your parents gave them....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Stop it, Harry, or I think I\rquote d rather talk to your aunt again.\'94
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m being that insufferable, am I?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I just said so, didn\rquote t I?\'94 She sighed. \'93Listen, I didn\rquote t call to fight with you. Quite the opposite--I wanted to make up. I\rquote m sorry about yesterday. I understand what you 
were saying, and because of your mum and your aunt you\rquote re very touchy about the idea of muggle-born magical people--\'94
\par 
\par \'93And you,\'94 he reminded her. \'93Why aren\rquote t you more touchy about muggle-born magical people?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I am, Harry. I think--well, I think right now I\rquote m torn. On the one hand, I want to protect myself in the usual way by not telling the entire muggle world I\rquote m a witch. On the other hand, I don\rquote 
t want anyone to take my magic away from me. I think the second thing is rather unlikely, though, don\rquote t you? I mean, we\rquote ve only encountered instances so far of people having their magical genes turned on, not off. We don\rquote 
t even know if the opposite is true. I don\rquote t care what Draco Malfoy said--\'94
\par 
\par But suddenly, mentioning his name gave Harry an idea. \'93That\rquote s not true,\'94 he interrupted her. \'93Think of Malfoy--the Obedience Charm. Voldemort used that to wake up some of Malfoy\rquote 
s dormant magical genes, and he turned off some of his own, giving up some of his power. It was voluntary on his part, and got something for it--a slave, basically.\'94 Harry swallowed, trying not to think too much about this. \'93
Getting someone to cast that spell on another person in order to reduce their magical abilities wouldn\rquote t do much good because then 
the person with the increased power would have to do whatever they say. But--if Voldemort could find a way to separate out the power transference part of the spell from the obedience part of the spell--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--He\rquote d become the most wizard in the world,\'94 she breathed, frightened.
\par 
\par \'93Exactly. He already knows a spell that does some of this power transfer. He\rquote s not only capable of taking as much time as he needs to research this, he has all of his Death Eaters to help him work out the problem--and he\rquote s in the habi
t of recruiting the smartest people he can find--plus, if Mrs. Figg is right that the Ministry will want to crack down on unauthorized magical activity, he might have the Ministry working to find the solution as well. That\rquote 
s what I was talking about yesterday, Hermione. We can\rquote t let the Ministry become Voldemort\rquote s tool. There\rquote s got to be a Death Eater or two who\rquote ve infiltrated it. If they find the solution before Voldemort--he\rquote 
ll have the answer about five minutes later, if that. I know it and you know it.\'94
\par 
\par She was very quiet. Harry swallowed. \'93Hermione, you have no idea how dangerous this could be. The next thing you know, the Board of Governors could institute a ban on muggle-borns at Hogwarts, saying it\rquote s for their own protection, so they won
\rquote t enter the wizarding world when it\rquote s particularly dangerous...\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, they wouldn\rquote t do that--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes they would. And people who mean well would push hardest for it, not understanding what a mistake it would be! And that\rquote s not all. What about Ron?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Ron?\'94
\par 
\par \'93He\rquote s a werewolf,\'94 he said quietly, glancing around furtively, to make sure his aunt and uncle weren\rquote t nearby.
\par 
\par \'93What\rquote s your point, Harry?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Once they\rquote ve convinced people it\rquote s better to keep muggle-borns out of Hogwarts, how long do you think it would take for the Ministry to decide to lock up all of the werewolves in prison camps?\'94
\par 
\par \'93You\rquote re mad, Harry. They wouldn\rquote t do that.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Wouldn\rquote t they? Just because they\rquote ve finally accepted that Sirius is innocent--which was only possible because Wormtail confessed--don\rquote t give them too much credit, Hermione. I need you to be with me on this. We\rquote 
re Head Boy and Head Girl. We need to be very vocal about anything the Ministry or Board does which would take the wizarding world in this direction.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes, well, don\rquote t you think we\rquote re just a bit lacking in credibility, thanks to Daisy Furuncle?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I think that was the purpose of those articles. Attacking credibility. We can\rquote t let that stop us. We have to ignore the press. If th
e Board of Governors or the Ministry show any signs of doing any of these things, we have to be leaders. If we need to we--we can call a general strike at Hogwarts--\'94
\par 
\par She started laughing uproariously. \'93Harry! It\rquote s finally happened!\'94
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote ve completely radicalized you.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, maybe I can pull you back from the establishment now...\'94
\par 
\par She sighed noisily. \'93All right, Harry, all right. I\rquote ll trust you on this. I don\rquote t want to lose my magic and I don\rquote t want Ron to go to a prison camp. Oh--Ron says hello, by the way. I just used Dad\rquote 
s fireplace to talk to him last night.\'94
\par 
\par \'93How is he?\'94
\par 
\par \'93A little nervous about going down to London.\'94
\par 
\par \'93When is he going?\'94
\par 
\par \'93The full moon is Wednesday to Friday. We\rquote ve actually been talking almost every day since Draco\rquote s party. When we\rquote re not in the same room, it seems like we\rquote re fine, we can talk normally...\'94
\par 
\par \'93Give him time, Hermione.\'94
\par 
\par Another sigh. \'93I know, I know. And yet, there are still some things he won\rquote t tell me. He said he can\rquote t talk to me on Tuesday, for instance, because he\rquote s going to be locked in his room all day. Then he looked like he wished he hadn
\rquote t said anything and he wouldn\rquote t tell me why he\rquote s going to be locked up. I mean, the full moon starts on Wednesday. I don\rquote t understand...\'94
\par 
\par Harry swallowed, glad that they were talking using the telephone, instead of her being able to see his face. Ron hadn\rquote t told her about a werewolf\rquote s uncontrollable urges right before the full moon. Harry both wasn\rquote 
t surprised and wished that Ron had told her.
\par 
\par \'93Do you know anything about it Harry?\'94 she pressed, correctly guessing from his silence that he knew. Harry, however, didn\rquote t think it was his place to tell her about this.
\par 
\par \'93How\rquote s your training?\'94 he said croakily, changing the subject.
\par 
\par She paused. \'93Real smooth, Harry. Okay, don\rquote t tell me. The training is fine. In fact, I\rquote ve taken up another kind of training, too. It\rquote s really helping me with my physical control. I think Ron will be pleasantly surprised....\'94

\par 
\par Harry cleared his throat. \'93Er, I don\rquote t think--maybe we shouldn\rquote t be discussing this, Hermione...\'94
\par 
\par \'93Harry! Get your mind out of the gutter! It\rquote s nothing dirty!\'94
\par 
\par He smirked. \'93You never used to object when my mind was in the gutter...\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, then there were--um--certain more tangible benefits--\'94
\par 
\par Harry laughed, then stopped when the doorbell rang. \'93Oh--I have to go. Um--Katie and I are going out.\'94 He saw his aunt walk to the door to answer it. \'93She\rquote s just been to Hogsmeade, and I\rquote m worried about her....\'94
\par 
\par Hermione sighed again. \'93Katie\rquote s a lucky girl, Harry,\'94 she said softly. He heard a click as she hung up.
\par 
\par He looked up and saw Katie standing in the doorway, smiling sunnily at him. Actually, he thought, I think I\rquote m the lucky one. He smiled back at her.
\par 
\par \'93We\rquote re just driving up to London for dinner, Mrs. Dursley,\'94 Katie told his aunt, who was examining her shrewdly.
\par 
\par \'93Is this where you keep your--\'94 his aunt started to say, patting Katie\rquote s shoulder bag.
\par 
\par \'93We really should be going!\'94 Harry said quickly, grabbing Katie\rquote s hand and dragging her to the car. \'93Good night, Aunt Petunia!\'94 He did not want her getting into a conversation with Katie about wands. Katie didn\rquote 
t even know about the Rodney Jeffries thing yet. Then he thought of the Prophet article. Maybe she did know.
\par 
\par She stumbled down the path after him. \'93Harry!\'94 she cried as he continued to pull her along. She was laughing. \'93What\rquote s going on?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote ll tell you in the car,\'94 he said, looking back at the house, where his aunt was standing in the doorway with her arms crossed. When they pulled onto the moto
rway to London, he checked first to make sure she was calm and in control of the car.
\par 
\par \'93Yes, Harry, I\rquote m fine. Why are you being like this?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Because I have some things to tell you which might surprise you,\'94 he explained. As they continued toward London, he told her about Rodney Jeffries and his aunt, then their visit to Mrs. Figg\rquote 
s and the two conversations with Hermione--and the Prophet article. Which she\rquote d read. She frowned as she drove.
\par 
\par \'93I hate to say it,\'94 she said, pulling up in front of the building where she and Sam lived. \'93But it sounds like Dad was right.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Sam? Right about what?\'94
\par 
\par She grimaced as she closed and locked her car door. \'93About the Ministry.\'94 She looked back and forth. \'93Let\rquote s talk at the restaurant. I drove us here because there\rquote s a nice Indian place nearby. No wizarding press,\'94 she grinned. 
\'93Come on.\'94 They walked close to each other, and then their swinging hands collided, and Harry reached out to grasp her hand, remembering when he and Hermione had done this once. She smiled shyly up at him, but she didn\rquote 
t remove her hand, and he smiled back at her, enjoying the simple closeness.
\par 
\par When they were seated at the restaurant, she explained that her father had suspected for years that the Ministry of Magic was just a heartbeat away from deciding they needed to work out a quick way to take away people\rquote s magical abilities. \'93
He reckons it would be a far more effective punishment for magical criminals than putting them in Azkaban. Permanent exile from the magical world, you know.\'94
\par 
\par Harry nodded. \'93I hadn\rquote t thought of that. They could use the argument that they\rquote re developing it to make Azkaban obsolete.\'94 He thought of Sirius. And what if you\rquote re unjustly accused? What if you\rquote re an innocent man who
\rquote s been sent to prison?
\par 
\par She drank a sip of her water. \'93Which could make it even harder for me to tell him I\rquote m going into Auror training in September....\'94
\par 
\par He grinned at her. \'93You did it! You signed up!\'94
\par 
\par She shook her head. \'93You don\rquote t just \lquote sign up,\rquote  Harry. I had to take a whole battery of tests. But I passed every one of them.\'94
 She smiled, looking very pleased with herself, and Harry was surprised to find that he felt quite proud of her.
\par 
\par \'93We did it Saturday morning, then Apparated back to Hogsmeade. That\rquote s why I picked this weekend to visit, so my dad wouldn\rquote t ask where I was going early on a Saturday morning...\'94
\par 
\par \'93We?\'94
\par 
\par She stopped. \'93Oh, er, I mean--well, there was someone else I ran into at the tests who lives in Hogsmeade. I didn\rquote t know he wanted to be an Auror. He did rather well, too. Don\rquote t look like that--it\rquote 
s not Lee, although I probably shouldn\rquote t tell you who it is. And I\rquote m going to kill Angelina. She lied to me again. Lee does not have a new girlfriend. She was just trying to get me all wound up. I act
ually had quite a nice time this weekend. I spent most of it with--with the other Auror applicant. So I haven\rquote t returned to you a broken woman, pining after my former love--\'94 she said melodramatically, her hand on her brow. Harry laughed.
\par 
\par \'93No, but you\rquote re being very secretive about this other Auror applicant.\'94
\par 
\par She shrugged. \'93Hazard of the Auror\rquote s life. Keeping identities a secret. He\rquote s going to start his training in September, too. We probably won\rquote t be working together, though, since I didn\rquote t put myself do
wn for undercover work and he did. On the other hand, I do think we\rquote ll be in the same training class.\'94
\par 
\par He leaned closer to her, smiling slyly. \'93Should I be jealous?\'94
\par 
\par She looked startled, as though this hadn\rquote t occurred to her. \'93Do you want to be?\'94 she asked softly; their faces were very close together.
\par 
\par Suddenly, the waiter came with their food, and they backed up, both colouring, starting to eat. Harry watched her as she ate, trying to figure out how he felt about her.
\par 
\par When they had paid for their meal, they walked back to Sam and Katie\rquote s flat, which turned out to be empty. \'93Dad said he was going out with the lads. There\rquote s a darts tournament or something.\'94
\par 
\par He nodded; his pulse felt quicker, somehow, being in the empty flat with her. They sat on the couch and she turned on the television. \'93We could just hang about here and watch the telly, if you like.\'94
\par 
\par He nodded again, looking at her profile. They ended up watching a costume drama; he wasn\rquote t clear whether it was a film of a Jane Austen novel or j
ust something very similar. At length, he put his arm across the back of the couch behind her head, and she leaned against his chest, still watching the flickering screen.
\par 
\par Somehow, he just didn\rquote t find the film compelling enough to watch, and found himself
 watching her instead. After a while, she seemed aware that he was watching her, but she continued to keep her eyes on the television. Suddenly, without warning, she turned and looked him in the eye, and Harry was never sure whether he moved toward her or
 
she toward him, but once they were holding each other tightly and kissing deeply, it hardly mattered. He felt pulled down, and then they were lying next to each other on the couch, mouths connected still, hands drifting tentatively over arms and shoulders
. She shivered when he stroked her neck, and then he brought his lips where his fingers had been, remembering her responses in the tent, when they\rquote d been putting on a show for Rodney Jeffries\rquote 
 people. She laced her fingers through his hair, sighing, and he moved his mouth further down, caressing the soft skin on her upper arms as her sighs grew louder....
\par 
\par \'93Company is coming,\'94 Sandy said simply. Harry swore, then covered his mouth when he realized he\rquote d spoken aloud.
\par 
\par She looked up at him from where she lay on the couch. \'93Harry Potter,\'94 she said in mock-horror, her eyes merry. \'93Do you eat with that mouth?\'94
\par 
\par He laughed. \'93Sorry. It\rquote s just that--we\rquote re not going to be alone much longer. I think your dad\rquote s coming back.\'94
\par 
\par Katie sat up. \'93Oh, really?\'94 she said skeptically. \'93And what makes you say that?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well--er--do you remember when I was in second year? When Gilderoy Lockhart tried to start a Dueling Club?\'94
\par 
\par She actually blushed. \'93Why?\'94 she asked, and Harry wondered whether she had been yet another girl who had bee
n crushing on Lockhart. He could tease her about that later. He reminded her of when Snape had given Malfoy instructions for conjuring the serpent.
\par 
\par \'93Do you remember when I spoke to it?\'94 She nodded; she had been there, along with most of the school. \'93Didn\rquote t you ever wonder how?\'94
\par 
\par She raised one eyebrow. \'93All right, then. How did you do it? And what does this have to do with--\'94 He opened a few buttons on his shirt (Trying not to notice where her eyes had gone) and carefully removed Sandy from inside his shir
t; her eyes widened and he saw her swallow. She was no longer ogling his chest.
\par 
\par \'93Sandy,\'94 he hissed at her, \'93This is Katie Bell.\'94 He saw her eyes widen further as she listened to the hissing. \'93Katie,\'94 he said to her in English. \'93This is my snake, Cassandra. Sandy for short.\'94
\par 
\par Katie nodded and gave a feeble smile, then tentatively put out her hand and stroked Sandy\rquote s vivid green skin. Her smile grew a little. \'93She feels nice,\'94 she said softly.
\par 
\par \'93An astute girl,\'94 Sandy hissed at Harry.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, and you\rquote re not the least bit biased,\'94 he hissed at her, laughing.
\par 
\par Katie looked at him quizzically. \'93So, you\rquote re a Parselmouth,\'94 she said slowly. \'93But that doesn\rquote t explain how--\'94
\par 
\par Suddenly they heard a key on the lock. Katie furrowed her brow, and Harry said quickly, \'93Snakes have the Sight. A few minutes ago Sandy said, \lquote Company is coming.\rquote  I assumed that meant your dad. I was right, wasn\rquote t I?\'94
\par 
\par Katie was staring at the small snake, flabbergasted, when the door to the flat opened and Sam Bell entered. He wasn\rquote t alone; Nigel and Trevor were with him. Harry groaned inwardly. Just what he needed, those two saying things like--
\par 
\par \'93Oi! Look \lquote oo\rquote s \lquote ere, Nige! Kate \lquote n\rquote  \lquote Arry. \lquote N\rquote  look! \lquote Arry\rquote s showin\rquote  \lquote er \lquote is snake!\'94
\par 
\par Sam whirled. \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par Harry\rquote s inward groaning was threatening to break out into the open. Nigel, Trevor and Sam had all seen him wearing Sandy on his arm soon after he\rquote d found her two summers earlier, but he hadn\rquote 
t had her during the previous summer. Harry held up Sandy for Sam to see, his eyebrows raised, and Sam started laughing. Given his reaction, Harry wondered what he would have done if he\rquote d walked in when they\rquote 
d been engaged in other activities.
\par 
\par \'93An actual snake,\'94 said Sam, shaking his head and hitting Trevor with the back of his hand. Sam turned to Harry again, looking pointedly at his unbuttoned shirt. Harry hastily put Sandy back inside his shirt and buttoned up.
\par 
\par \'93What are you all doing here?\'94 Katie asked, smoothing down her clothes; her voice seemed higher than usual.
\par 
\par \'93The darts tournament was brilliant,\'94 Trevor told them. \'93Your dad is a darts genius, little Kate,\'94
 he said, pointing, as though she might have forgotten which one of them was her dad. It seemed to Harry that the three of them had had quite a lot to drink. It was probably a good thing they were done handling darts for the night.
\par 
\par \'93We thought we\rquote d play some poker now,\'94 Sam told them, looking glad that Harry\rquote s shirt was buttoned again.
\par 
\par Katie made a face. \'93I think I\rquote ll just drive Harry home. It\rquote s getting rather late, and we all have to work tomorrow,\'94 she said pointedly, looking at Nigel and Trevor.
\par 
\par \'93Aw, c\rquote mon, Kate,\'94 Nigel said thickly. \'93C\rquote mon \lquote Arry. Play a round. I know!\'94 he said, with a lopsided grin at Katie\rquote s nicely tanned legs protruding from her skirt. \'93We could play strip poker!\'94
\par 
\par Harry was glad to see that Sam\rquote s hostility toward him was now directed toward Nigel. \'93Not with my daughter you don\rquote t!\'94 he informed Nigel in a growl, putting his face very close to his co-worker\rquote s. Katie quickly pulled him away 
and kissed her father on the cheek.
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote ll be back in a little while, yeah? Try not to hurt each other while I\rquote m gone?\'94 She looked pointedly at her father, who was starting to calm down. As a former Azkaban prisoner, he certainly didn\rquote t want to risk runnin
g afoul of the law by performing even accidental magic in front of muggles. He backed off and his breathing slowed. Harry nodded at him.
\par 
\par \'93Good night, Sam. See you in the morning. G\rquote night Nigel, Trevor.\'94
\par 
\par \'93You \lquote ave y\rquote self a good night, \lquote Arry,\'94 Trevor said to him, winking broadly. Sam was starting to get angry again and Katie was rolling her eyes. No wonder she wants to leave, Harry thought.
\par 
\par They reached Little Whinging quickly and parked behind Vernon Dursley\rquote s company car. Inside the house, they discovered that his aunt and uncle had already retired, even though it was only ten-thirty. \'93Do you want to come in for a bit?\'94
 Harry asked her. \'93We could try watching some more television if you like.\'94 The moment he said it, he realized that she would probably tak
e it to mean, We can do some more snogging, if you like, and as soon as he thought this, he was unsure whether that was actually what he\rquote d meant.
\par 
\par She smiled, with a mischievous glint in her eye. \'93All right. Or we could just do without the television....\'94 
Once they were inside, she led him to the couch in the darkened living room. Harry let himself be led, and when he felt her hands around his neck pulling him down, he willingly went.
\par 
\par They soon found themselves in a similar position to the one they\rquote d been in at the London flat, when Harry heard a step on the stairs his uncle\rquote s voice saying, \'93Who\rquote s there?\'94
 with trepidation. His first instinct was to hiss at Sandy, \'93A warning this time would have been nice,\'94 but he knew that she couldn\rquote t control the things sh
e Saw. Harry swallowed, scrambled to turn on a lamp and the television, which immediately started blaring very loudly, as it was showing an old James Bond film, and cars and helicopters and large parts of the Soviet Union were busily exploding.
\par 
\par \'93It\rquote s just me, Uncle Vernon,\'94 Harry explained, going to the living room door and opening it. His uncle looked suspiciously at him from half-way down the stairs.
\par 
\par \'93When did you get home?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Just a few minutes ago. I was, um, just going to finish watching this film and then go to bed.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes, well, keep it down! Your aunt doesn\rquote t feel well...\'94
\par 
\par He watched his uncle pad back up the stairs in his pajamas and dressing gown before he returned to the living room. Katie was actually watching the film now, it seemed. \'93I\rquote ve never seen all of this one!\'94 she said. He was surprised; she hadn
\rquote t liked the everything-exploding- all-the-time film they\rquote d gone to see on their first date. Of course, this was more of a spy film, and she was going to start training to be an Auror soon, so maybe she regarded James Bond differently.

\par 
\par Soon she was leaning against him again with his arm on the back of the couch behind her, and soon after that they turned to each other and began kissing again (In spite of her supposed desire to see the film). Th
en she was once more reclining on the couch and he had moved his mouth down to her neck. After kissing her neck for a little while, he suddenly realized that something was wrong. Her hands were no longer moving over his back. He sat up and looked carefull
y at her. Her mouth was open slightly and her eyes were closed; her breathing was deep and regular. He fought the urge to laugh at himself. She\rquote d fallen asleep.
\par 
\par He sat up and looked at her again. I\rquote m so stimulating I\rquote ve put her to sleep. Brillia
nt. He turned off the television and looked at her fondly for a few minutes, then he carried her up the stairs to his bedroom. He put her gently on the bed and carefully removed her blouse and skirt, telling himself to regard her underwear as something li
ke a bikini and nothing more (If her underwear had been a bikini it would have been far more modest than Hermione\rquote 
s, he thought). He pulled the sheet up over her and folded her clothes neatly, putting them on the desk chair. Then he looked around the room; 
the window was open, as Hedwig was out hunting, and he picked up some dirty clothes and organized some papers and books on the desk into slightly neater piles. Finally, he retrieved some running clothes from his dresser for the morning and started to leav
e, but then he returned to the bed and kissed her lightly on the forehead. She rolled over on her side and put her cheek on her hand, making him smile as he quietly closed the door.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par Harry\rquote s eyes snapped open and he checked his watch; it was exactly six o\rquote 
clock, when he usually rose to go running. His inner clock had brought him out of sleep at exactly the right time. He sat up on the living room couch, yawning and stretching. It only took him a minute to put on the running clothes he\rquote d retrieved 
from his room before he left to meet Draco Malfoy.
\par 
\par When he and Malfoy were warming down after their run, Harry said casually, \'93Well, I\rquote d better be getting back so I can wake up Katie- -\'94
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94 the blond boy squeaked. \'93You--you and Katie--\'94
\par 
\par Harry scowled at him. \'93No, don\rquote t be stupid. We were watching a film on television at my house and she fell asleep. I put her in my bed and slept on the couch.\'94
\par 
\par Malfoy shook his head. \'93The couch? And you\rquote re calling me stupid?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Grow up, Malfoy.\'94
\par 
\par Draco Malfoy shook his head. \'93I can\rquote t believe you\rquote re getting so self-righteous about me and Felice when you and--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, no you don\rquote t. First of all, I\rquote m actually dating Katie. I\rquote m not seeing someone else and cheating on her with Katie. Second of all, we\rquote re not sleeping together. So don\rquote t think for a second that there\rquote 
s any similarity between what you did and what we\rquote re doing.\'94
\par 
\par Harry stalked off toward Privet Drive, having finished warming down. Soon he was under the spray of the upstairs shower, feeling like he had to wash o
ff the stench of conversing with Draco Malfoy. He wrapped a towel around his waist and wrapped Sandy around his arm again and left the bathroom, going to his bedroom to retrieve some clean drawers from his dresser. He dropped the towel and started to step
 
into his underwear when suddenly he heard a long, low whistle behind him. Harry turned and looked behind him, where Katie was sitting up in his bed, the sheet around her waist, and he hastily turned his back to her again and pulled up his drawers before f
acing her once more.
\par 
\par \'93Katie! I--I forgot--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, nice. You\rquote ve got a girl in your bed wearing nothing but her underwear and you forgot?\'94
\par 
\par He felt defensive. \'93I\rquote ve a lot on my mind. And you\rquote re the one who fell asleep while we were snogging. And--and I just wanted you to be comfortable while you were sleeping.\'94
\par 
\par She yawned and stretched. Harry swallowed, trying not to look at her bra. \'93I was knackered,\'94 she said, still in the middle of a yawn. \'94I\rquote d stayed up late the night before, talking into the wee hours. You know, at Hog\rquote s End. I didn
\rquote t mean to be rude.\'94
\par 
\par He smiled at her. \'93That\rquote s all right. You should probably call your dad, though, and get him to bring some work clothes for you to use today--\'94 Just then, Sandy hissed at him.
\par 
\par \'93Pigs will fly.\'94
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94 he hissed back at her. Katie didn\rquote t notice this exchange. Her eyes were wild.
\par 
\par \'93Dad! Oh, no. He\rquote ll--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--Kill me? Or you? Or both? None of those are options I particularly like.\'94 Harry forced his attention back to Katie. Pigs will fly?
\par 
\par She grimaced. \'93Just be glad he doesn\rquote t Apparate any more. He\rquote d be here right now.\'94
\par 
\par \'93On the other hand--he does remember you\rquote re eighteen, right? And you\rquote re not--I mean--I\rquote m assuming that you and Lee--um--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes, Lee and I \lquote ummed.\rquote  Which he does not know, or Lee would be eating all of his food through a straw. And he\rquote d have to put the straw in his ear. And don\rquote t ask me where his ear would actually be located. As far as Dad
\rquote s concerned, my age is beside the point. If I\rquote m still not married when I\rquote m forty, he\rquote ll be the same way, I expect.\'94
\par 
\par \'93But--but we haven\rquote t done anything! I carried you upstairs and I went down and slept on the couch. You couldn\rquote t very well drive back home last night; you\rquote d have been killed! You--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Harry! Who are you talking to--?\'94 his aunt started to say, opening the bedroom door with a bang. It was unclear to Harry whether she\rquote d had to touch it. Her eyes opened very wide when she saw Katie sitting up in Harry\rquote 
s bed looking like she was only wearing her bra, and then she noticed Harry standing across the room in just his boxers and a snake--but the snake was the least of her concerns. \'93What is going on here?\'94
 she demanded. Harry felt a static electricity making his hair stand on end. Damn! he thought. Don\rquote t do spontaneous magic, he thought desperately. Don\rquote t do spontaneous magic...
\par 
\par \'93It\rquote s my fault, Mrs. Dursley,\'94 Katie said quickly, pulling up the sheet and hugging it to her. \'93I fell asleep while we were watching television, so Harry let me use his room. He slept on the couch.\'94
\par 
\par She looked suspiciously at both of them, back and forth. \'93And I\rquote m just supposed to believe that? Then why are you both in the same room in--in just--just--\'94
 she sputtered, staring around the room, as if looking for something that would calm her. She fixated suddenly on a broken bank that had been Dudley\rquote 
s, which Harry had never bothered throwing away. The pieces had sat for years on the top shelf of the bookcase, acting as an ad hoc bookend. Harry and Katie ducked the flying ceramic pig parts; it wasn\rquote t as bad as a Bludger, he thought,
 but it would hurt a bit.
\par 
\par Harry tried to reply to his aunt while keeping an eye on the flying bank bits, but the phone rang and his aunt grumped off to answer it. The pieces of pink ceramic pig fell to the floor. When she was gone, Katie scrambled out of Harry\rquote 
s bed and hastily put on her blouse and skirt. Harry suddenly became very aware that he was still wearing only one garment, plus a snake wrapped around his left upper arm. (He would talk to Sandy later about her \'93prediction.\'94) He quickly pulled on a
 T-shirt and shorts and found some socks and his work boots.
\par 
\par \'93Harry!\'94 his aunt bellowed. \'93It\rquote s that girl\rquote s father calling! Get down here!\'94
\par 
\par Harry and Katie looked at each other with trepidation and went down the stairs. Everything in the front hall--including the telephone--was floating in the air, and his aunt had a look of power in her eye that Harry did not like.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par \'93Spanner.\'94
\par 
\par Harry handed the spanner to Sam, who was repairing the tiller. Pieces of it were scattered about the drive behind Aberforth\rquote s van, and Sam\rquote 
s hands were covered in dirt and grease. It had been a week since The Sleeping Incident, as Harry had taken to calling it in his mind. Sam didn\rquote 
t let Harry out of his sight all day every day at work. Harry was dimly aware of Katie trimming a hedge about thirty feet away. She\rquote d been giving her father the silent treatment; she was very angry with him for treating her like a c
hild, so instead of hovering over her, he\rquote d taken to hovering over Harry.
\par 
\par Sam looked at the tool Harry had handed him and frowned. \'93Other spanner,\'94 he said with an edge to his voice. Harry handed him the other spanner and took back the first one he\rquote d offe
red, trying not to sigh. He watched Aberforth, Nigel, Trevor and Draco Malfoy far away, past the hedge maze, building a Greek-temple-like folly in a small stand of trees at the edge of the broad green lawn. He would have liked to be helping them, even if 
it meant withstanding ribbing from Nigel and Trevor (When \'93Dick\'94 wasn\rquote t around, as he didn\rquote t stand for it) but Sam had insisted he needed Harry\rquote s help repairing the tiller and he hadn\rquote t been able to get out of it. I
\rquote m not mechanical Harry thought grumpily. He looked at Katie again. How was she going to tell her father about the Auror training now that they were barely speaking?
\par 
\par When he returned home, however, he had a different problem to worry about. A middle-aged bottle-blonde woman was standing at his kitchen window looking in, her jaw dropped as she gazed into number 4 Privet Drive. Harry recognized her as his aunt\rquote 
s comrade in gossip, Yvonne Martin. His heart beating quickly, he strode up to her, saying loudly, \'93Mrs. Martin! How are you?\'94 He didn\rquote t look
 in the window, fearing what he might see. Unfortunately, Yvonne Martin did not tear her eyes away from the window when she responded to him.
\par 
\par \'93L-look at what Petunia is doing!\'94 she gasped.
\par 
\par Bracing himself, Harry looked in the kitchen window. His aunt was
 standing in the middle of the room, smiling and waving her arms while plates and glasses washed themselves and then flew into cabinets whose doors opened themselves. The mop was mopping the floor, hopping into a bucket of soapy water and then out again, 
d
ancing across the linoleum, the breakfast table and chairs moving smoothly out of its way and then back into position again. A rag was busily cleaning the work surfaces. Harry swallowed. His aunt was completely out of control. He was reminded strongly of 
trying to keep the house-elves from cleaning, on that first Boxing Day....
\par 
\par Trying to keep his voice even and calm, he stood next to the older woman, looking into his kitchen, and said, \'93What do you mean, Mrs. Martin?\'94 He hoped he could continue to keep his voice from shaking.
\par 
\par \'93What do I mean?\'94 her voice rose on a shriek. \'93She\rquote s--the mop--the dishes--just look!\'94 she spat, her eyes big as saucers. Harry continued to look at the same sight, but very, very calmly.
\par 
\par \'93Yes. Aunt Petunia likes a clean kitchen. She\rquote s mopping the floor. I should make sure I don\rquote t track dirt in, or she\rquote ll be very cross with me.\'94
\par 
\par \'93But--but--\'94 she faltered, now starting to doubt herself. \'93Flying dishes! The table and chairs--moving by themselves--\'94
\par 
\par Harry looked at her with one eyebrow raised, and now she turned to look back at him. Good, he thought. Take her attention away from it. He put his arm around her shoulders solicitously.
\par 
\par \'93Perhaps you had better go home and have a lie-down, Mrs. Martin. Have you been under a great deal of stress lately?\'94
\par 
\par He steered her away from the window and began walking her to the front garden. \'93I--I--\'94 she stammered feebly.
\par 
\par \'93A nice hot towel on your brow and a cup of tea would probably make you right as rain again. You\rquote ve got your niece\rquote s wedding coming up, haven\rquote t you? Aunt Petunia was saying. You don\rquote 
t want to be under the weather for that, now do you?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I suppose not...\'94 Harry took his arm from around her. She looked back uncertainly. \'93I could have sworn--\'94
\par 
\par \'93You just need some rest,\'94 Harry said firmly, but still keeping his voice smooth and calming. \'93I\rquote ll tell Aunt Petunia you dropped by. She\rquote ll be sorry she missed you.\'94
\par 
\par Yvonne Martin wandered off down Privet Lane, shaking her head with bewilderment. Counting to ten in his head before he moved, Harry bolted for the kitchen door and threw it open. He held out his hand and bellowed, \'93Finite Incantatem!\'94
\par 
\par Plates and glasses on their way to a cupboard fell to the floor and shattered. The mop fell over and spattered soapy water on the frid
ge door. The scrubbing rag flopped limply onto the counter. And his aunt glared at him angrily, making him wonder whether he was up for a wandless duel with a completely inexperienced witch operating on pure rage.
\par 
\par \'93You can\rquote t do that!\'94 he yelled at her. \'93Yvonne Martin was standing right there, looking in the window at everything you were doing. What were you thinking?\'94
\par 
\par She lifted her chin defiantly and crossed her arms. \'93I am over the age of seventeen, unlike you...\'94
\par 
\par \'93But you\rquote re letting muggles see you do magic! It doesn\rquote t matter what your age is--you\rquote re not supposed to do that! Plus, you don\rquote t know what you\rquote re doing. You haven\rquote t studied any of the theory...you don\rquote 
t even have a wand. Please, please stop doing magic until Mrs. Figg looks into your situation a little further....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, pooh to that. I\rquote m having more fun than I ever thought possible, and you want me to exercise restraint?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes!\'94 he screamed back at her. \'93Or at least--do some reading first. I--I can give you some of my old spell books. You should sit down and try to understand that magic is about balance, and when you throw the balance off--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Read? I can do this and you want me to sit around reading?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes,\'94 he said firmly. \'93Look--I may not be seventeen yet, but I am Head Boy of Hogwarts. I\rquote 
ve had six years of magical education, I won the Triwizard Tournament, I dueled with Lord Voldemort, survived the Killing Curse and learned to overcome the other two Unforgivable Curses. I killed a basilisk when I was twelve and I\rquote 
ve flown on a Hippogriff, besides a slew of other things I can\rquote t tell you. So for once can you bloody well admit that I know more about something than you do?\'94 His voice had become very loud.
\par 
\par She was suddenly silent and looked a bit sulky. \'93All right,\'94 she finally said, as petulant as a small child. \'93Get me these books.\'94 She moved toward the broken plates and glasses. \'93But can I just--\'94
\par 
\par \'93No,\'94 he said quickly. \'93I\rquote ll clean them up. I\rquote ll buy you new ones. Just--just stop doing magic!\'94
\par 
\par He brought his first-and second-year 
spellbooks to her in the living room, where she was sitting watching the television with her arms crossed. Sighing, he cleaned up the mess in the kitchen and then returned to his room. He wanted nothing more than to collapse on the bed in exhaustion, but 
he noticed a letter on his desk from Hermione. All other thoughts left his head.
\par 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Dear Harry,
\par 
\par I\rquote ve found her! Margaret Dougherty lives in the village of Appleby Magna, in Leicestershire. I\rquote ve spoken on the telephone with her. She goes by Maggie, by the way
, not Peggy. I pretended to be a reporter writing about her village, and why people came to live there and what life is like for the villagers. I don\rquote 
t think she suspected a thing. She teaches at St. John Moore School, in Appleby Magna. Both of her parents were also teachers. They\rquote 
re retired. They moved to Leicestershire in 1973, after their daughter Valerie died from leukemia. Evidently, when they were in London at St. Michael\rquote s hospital, they met a family from Appleby Magna--the mother also had cancer, so
 they were in the same unit rather a lot--and they wanted to move to London so she\rquote d be closer to St. Michael\rquote 
s. The Doughertys wanted to move away from London, to try to put the loss of their daughter behind them, so they moved into the Leicestershire house and paid the other family rent. They also taught at St. John\rquote s.
\par 
\par The Doughertys tried to adopt for a number of years, but most agencies thought they were too old. They adopted Maggie in 1979, through an agency that specialized in placing older children 
for adoption, instead of babies, which is what most people want. Maybe you can find out more about that when you go see her. (We might be able to find Annie if we can learn more about the agency). Her parents are out of the country on holiday for the rest
 of the month, so it would be best to do it before they get back.
\par 
\par Call me when you\rquote ve received this. I\rquote m so excited!
\par 
\par Love from Hermione
\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par He went back downstairs to ring Hermione, checking on his aunt first, who was starting to read The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 1. He was glad his uncle wasn\rquote 
t home yet. When Hermione answered, Harry tried not to laugh at the way she was talking a mile a minute. He was feeling a little more cheerful. She said all of the same things she\rquote d said in the letter, but delivere
d breathlessly, and Harry waited patiently while she ran out of things to say. After a moment\rquote s pause, she asked, \'93Don\rquote t you have anything to say, Harry?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, you seemed to be saying enough for both of us,\'94 he answered, still trying not to laugh. \'93One thing I don\rquote t understand--why am I going to see her instead of you?\'94
\par 
\par \'93You\rquote re Ron\rquote s best friend, too, so why not you?\'94 She sighed. \'93Unfortunately, since Minerva and my parents don\rquote t know about this, I can\rquote t go. What would I tell them? What excuse would I give? I don\rquote 
t even know for certain whether Minerva would think telling Maggie Dougherty she\rquote s a witch would be a good idea.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, I\rquote m sure she has an inkling that she has some unusual abilities.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes, but--with everything that\rquote s happened--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Right,\'94 he said quietly. Jeffries had evidently disappeared without a trace after he\rquote d recognized Harry, and after his aunt had thrown him backwards with a gesture. The muggle press had been full of speculation that he\rquote 
d really been a fake (Many of the same reporters had been gushing about \'93The miracle worker\'94) who\rquote 
d evidently taken the money and scrambled off to the Caymans or some other place with numbered bank accounts. The Ministry had also been looking for him, and Dumbledore\rquote s operatives as well. Suddenly, th
e biggest news story was that there appeared to be no Rodney Jeffries\'94.
\par 
\par Harry wondered whether the Ministry had \lquote Taken care of\rquote  Jeffries and were just pretending to look for him. He also wondered whether Voldemort and the Death Eaters had done something to him.
\par 
\par \'93At any rate, I can\rquote t very well say, \lquote Oh, I\rquote m going off to Leicestershire to find Ron\rquote s long-lost sister who thinks she\rquote s a muggle,\rquote  so I\rquote ve got to stay here.\'94
 She sounded very grumpy about this; Harry could tell she was thinking that there was a definite downside to having Professor McGonagall stay with her.
\par 
\par \'93Well how do you expect me to be able to go see her?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote ve got it all worked out,\'94
 she said quickly, and Harry realized he should have known. Evidently, he was to tell Ron and Ginny about it and get Draco Malfoy to drive them all up to Leicestershire on the pretext that they were on their way to Scotland, to celebrate Harry\rquote 
s birthday at the end of the month. \'93Does that mean you\rquote re not going to be coming to Ascog for my birthday?\'94 he asked, unable to keep the hurt out of his voice.
\par 
\par \'93No, but Minerva already arranged ages ago for me to have a Portkey to take me. That\rquote s why I can\rquote t give the excuse that I need to go on this trip to get to Bute also. I already have a way. If I change her plans, I\rquote 
ll have to give her a reason. Oh, I am so jealous that the four of you will be meeting her and I won\rquote t!\'94
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m sure you will eventually. I can\rquote t believe you did all this! The whole Weasley family will be in your debt forever....\'94
\par 
\par \'93What about you? I wouldn\rquote t have been able to find her if you hadn\rquote t given me a name.\'94
\par 
\par He wished he could hug her suddenly. It was so amazing! Ron and Ginny would be meeting their older sister!
\par 
\par After he rang off, he dialed Mrs. Figg\rquote s number and when she answered he asked for Draco. The other boy answered the phone with an irritated edge to his voice.
\par 
\par \'93What do you want?\'94
\par 
\par Harry hesitated. \'93I need your help. Actually, Ginny needs your help.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Ginny?\'94 He sounded a little less hostile.
\par 
\par \'93Yes. Has she ever--has she ever mentioned to you something that happened in 1979? During the Easter hols?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Um, Harry, Ginny wasn\rquote t even born in 1979. And neither was I. Why would she mention anything of the sort?\'94
\par 
\par Harry hesitated, then plunged in and told Draco Malfoy about the Weasley sisters and their abduction, and that he and Hermione had found the younger sister.
\par 
\par \'93You\rquote re not serious!\'94 he said, unable to keep the awe out of his voice. \'93Ginny will be--\'94 He stopped. \'93She\rquote ll be very grateful to you,\'94
 he said flatly. Harry could tell he was itching to accuse Harry of doing it just to get on Ginny\rquote s good side.
\par 
\par \'93Yeah, well she\rquote ll be grateful to you too, if you drive us up to Leicestershire n
ext week to see her. After driving to Devon to get Ginny and Ron first, of course. We have to go up to Scotland anyway later in the week; we can just leave a few days early. Monday suit you?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Hold on, hold on--you want me to be the driver? You\rquote re just telling me this because I can drive you?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Erm--it was Hermione\rquote s idea--\'94 he floundered.
\par 
\par \'93And did it occur to her that I don\rquote t actually own a car? That Figg isn\rquote t bloody likely to let me just make off with her car and go to Devon or Leicestershire, let alone Scotland?\'94
\par 
\par Harry drew his mouth into a line. \'93Oh. Well--could you ask her?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I don\rquote t know how much good that will do. What about Katie?\'94
\par 
\par \'93What about her?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Find out if she can borrow her dad\rquote s car. Then you can have your new girlfriend with you for your birthday. And I can help with the driving still, so it\rquote s not one person all the time. It\rquote 
ll be a bleeding all-day trip, going to Devon and then Leicestershire from Surrey.\'94
\par 
\par Harry swallowed. Was Draco Malfoy perhaps a little too eager to have Katie come? Did he want Ginny to see Harry and Katie together?
\par 
\par \'93I can try. The worst thing that can happen is Sam says no. Or Katie does.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, even though you\rquote re obviously not Sam\rquote s favourite person right now, it still seems more likely than my chances of getting Figg\rquote s car for more than a week.\'94 He didn\rquote t tell Draco Malfoy, but when he\rquote 
d hung up he had to admit to himself that Draco was probably right about Mrs. Figg and her car. At lunch the next day, he told Katie everything that was going on and proposed Draco\rquote s idea.
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote d be nice--a week off and a trip to Scotland, stopping in the country in Leicestershire first. And I\rquote d like to be on hand to help you celebrate your birthday,\'94 she added, looking a little shy for a moment. They hadn\rquote 
t gone out that weekend, but had talked on the phone a little when she was confident that her father wasn\rquote t around eavesdropping.
\par 
\par \'93Well, it would be Ron, Ginny and Draco Malfoy besides you and me, and Draco could split the driving with you, as he has a license. You\rquote re sure you\rquote d like to do this?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes. I had no idea about the Weasleys....\'94
\par 
\par Harry had a sudden thought. \'93I\rquote ll bet your dad knew, though. When did he finish Hogwarts?\'94
\par 
\par \'93In 1976.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Two years before my mum and dad, then. And he became an Auror right away?\'94 She nodded. \'93
Right. Then he was probably one of the many people searching all over for the Weasley girls. He might be very interested in letting you go along to find out if Maggie Dougherty is really Peggy Weasley.\'94
\par 
\par \'93He might, he might....\'94 she mused, looking in her father\rquote s direction. Sam was lying back in the sun with his shirt off, his many tattoos showing through the reddish hair on his chest.
\par 
\par \'93So you\rquote ll ask him? While we have the car, I\rquote m sure Aber--I mean--Dick won\rquote t mind picking him up in the mornings. Or Nigel could.\'94
\par 
\par \'93All right. I\rquote ll ask over tea tonight. I\rquote ll let you know tomorrow; if I call you right after, he\rquote ll think it\rquote s a very big deal.\'94
\par 
\par \'93It is.\'94
\par 
\par \'93I know. I just don\rquote t want him to balk, so I\rquote m going to be careful. We\rquote ve almost started behaving normally around each other again.\'94
\par 
\par Harry agreed, then turned to look at Sam himself.
\par 
\par Everything hinged on him.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par To Harry\rquote s and Katie\rquote s amazement, Sam agreed to let them borrow the car. Katie drove down to Surrey Monday morning to pick up Harry and Draco. Since Harry was actually moving out of the Dursley\rquote 
s house now, he had to pack all of his belongings in his trunk, plus he had cartons with the books he\rquote d used in his first six years at Hogwarts (Minus what he\rquote 
d loaned his aunt), loads of rolls of parchment, and Hedwig (He still needed to buy a new broomstick). Katie discreetly put an enlargement charm on the interior of the car\rquote s boot, so everything (But Hedwig) wou
ld fit. His uncle had already left for work, but his aunt came to the door to see him off.
\par 
\par \'93Er--goodbye, Aunt Petunia. Read those books I gave you, all right? And talk to Mrs. Figg if you have questions. I\rquote ll--I\rquote ll send you an owl when I\rquote ve reached Scotland.\'94
\par 
\par She nodded tersely, then unexpectedly gave him a quick hug and a peck on the cheek, her eyes glittering, before disappearing into the house. Harry looked at the closed door for a moment before turning to walk to the car.
\par 
\par When they reached Mrs. Figg\rquote s, Draco was standing out in front with his hands deep in his pockets, looking impatient. \'93About time you got here,\'94 he grumbled as he let himself into the back seat. Then he groaned. \'93Oh, bloody hell--I\rquote 
ve got to ride with your owl? I want to sit up front.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Sorry--I\rquote m already sitting here. You\rquote ll sit up front when you\rquote re driving. I wanted to keep Hedwig with us so we could contact the Weasleys if there are any delays. We can\rquote 
t just call them on the telephone. Once we actually reach the Burrow, Mrs. Weasley is going to be taking care of Hedwig for me for a few days. Then she\rquote ll be sending her on to Ascog.\'94
\par 
\par Draco made some more indistinct grumbling noises as Katie started the car again. \'93Where\rquote s your bag?\'94 Harry asked him.
\par 
\par Now Draco Malfoy looked very smug. He pulled what appeared to be a small snuff box out of his jacket pocket. \'93Shrinking charm. How to travel light. Oh, the joys of being of age,\'94 he emphasized, for Harry\rquote s benefit. \'93
Being able to do magic whenever and wherever....\'94
\par 
\par \'93...As long as muggles don\rquote t see it,\'94 Katie reminded him with a slight growl in her voice as she turned onto the High Street. \'93Listen--there\rquote s a lot of driving to be done today. You haven\rquote 
t had your license for very long. Are you sure you\rquote re up to it?\'94
\par 
\par Draco shrugged. \'93How hard can it be? And anyway, when we came back from Swansea, I drove the entire time. That\rquote s farther than Devon.\'94
\par 
\par \'93If you\rquote re sure....Why don\rquote t you give him the details, Harry?\'94 Harry pulled out the notebook where he and Katie had worked out the route.
\par 
\par \'93Right. So, now we\rquote re on the High Street. In a minute we\rquote ll be on the Guildford Road, and then we\rquote ll take the Givens Grove Roundabout to the Leatherhead Bypass Road. Then we take the Knoll Roundabout, get back on the Leatherhead 
Bypass Road--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Why in the hell do we get off the Leatherpants Bypass--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Leatherhead Bypass.\'94
\par 
\par \'93--Just to get on it again?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Obviously in order to induce you to ask stupid questions. We worked out that it\rquote s the best way. Now pay attention--\'94
\par 
\par Draco groaned. Harry continued to explain their route to Devon, finishing with, \'93You\rquote ll be driving for about an hour and a half, I reckon.\'94
\par 
\par \'93An hour and a half!\'94
\par 
\par \'93I thought you drove all the way to Little Whinging from Swansea?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well--with plenty of stops...\'94
\par 
\par \'93Katie will be driving for almost that long before you switch. She\rquote d switch a little later, but we can\rquote 
t very well pull over on a busy motorway. After the two of you switch back, Katie will complete the drive to Exeter, about another half hour. We should a
rrive there by twelve-thirty. We can find a nice pub for lunch, and then Katie will drive on to Ottery St. Catchpole and the Burrow, which is roughly another hour. We\rquote 
ll leave the Burrow after collecting Ginny and Ron--hopefully no later than three-thirty--and then it\rquote ll be your turn to drive again, so you can take us back to Exeter--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Where we\rquote ll arrive just in time for tea. Good.\'94
\par 
\par \'93--And then you\rquote ll keep driving for another half-hour after we have tea,\'94 Harry went on. \'93
Katie will drive for about an hour-and-a-half, and then you can do the last hour, getting us to the Four Friars pub on Stoney Lane in Appleby Magna at around eight-thirty. We\rquote ve already called ahead for rooms.\'94
\par 
\par Draco slapped his hands together. \'93Which is about the right time for another little something before turning in for the night....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Time for \lquote a little something,\rquote  eh?\'94 Harry teased with a grin. \'93Who are you, really? Winnie-the-Pooh?\'94
\par 
\par \'93You expect me to drive all day--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Less than half the time,\'94 Katie reminded him, with gritted teeth, as she gripped the steering wheel.
\par 
\par \'93--Without proper sustenance?\'94
\par 
\par Harry rolled his eyes. \'93No one is trying to starve you. I\rquote d like to see us try to get away from the Burrow without a huge picnic basket of food from Mrs. Weasley. You know she won\rquote 
t let us go without enough provisions to take us all the way up to the Orkneys.\'94
\par 
\par Katie spoke while looking ahead at the road. \'93Does she know where Ginny and Ron are going, and why?\'94
\par 
\par \'93No. She just thinks we\rquote re all driving up to Ascog. She knows we\rquote re stopping in Leicestershire, but she thinks it\rquote s just because we need to turn in for the night.\'94
\par 
\par Katie nodded. \'93I just hope you don\rquote t get your hopes up, Harry. This could go badly wrong....\'94
\par 
\par He sighed and leaned back. \'93I know. But Ron--Ron\rquote s so excited! He didn\rquote t even know he had older sisters until I told him. And Ginny- -\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes?\'94 Draco said, leaning forward suspiciously. Katie made a sudden turn and he fell into Hedwig\rquote s cage, swearing colourfully. The snowy owl made some very indignant noises and flapped her wings.
\par 
\par \'93Oh. Sorry, Draco,\'94 Katie said with an air of mock innocence. \'93Aren\rquote t you wearing your seat belt?\'94 She looked sideways at Harry, a mischievous smile pulling at the corner of her mouth. He grinned, looking straight ahead.
\par 
\par \'93What does Ginny know about this?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I told her the truth,\'94 Harry said. \'93That if it wasn\rquote t for you I wouldn\rquote t have been able to get into Dudley\rquote s room to use his computer and look for her sister.\'94 He heard a stunned silence behind him.
\par 
\par \'93You told her that? So--so she thinks I have something to do with finding her sister?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, I wasn\rquote t lying about that, was I? And you are helping with the driving. We\rquote d have to do the trip in two days if Katie were going to drive the whole time. She\rquote d be completely done in.\'94
\par 
\par Katie sighed. \'93I still might be.\'94
\par 
\par Harry tried to give her a reassuring smile as they zoomed off toward Exeter.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par They managed to leave the Burrow with only two picnic hampers, which they placed in the magically enlarged bo
ot. Molly Weasley hugged and kissed Ron and Harry and Ginny repeatedly. She hugged and kissed Draco once only, still looking a little unsure about whether he would accept this, and she nodded somewhat coolly at Katie.
\par 
\par \'93So--what are the sleeping arrangements to be?\'94 she asked in crisp tones.
\par 
\par \'93Girls in one room, boys in the other,\'94 Katie answered promptly; she\rquote d had this from her dad already. Molly sniffed.
\par 
\par \'93You\rquote re the eldest, but I can\rquote t say I know you very well, except that you\rquote re friends with the twins. How do I know I can trust my children with you? After all, your father--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--}{\f1\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 W}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 as my mother\rquote s friend and by all accounts a good Auror, up to and including the day he stopped his wife from putting Cruciatus on Katie.\'94
 Harry had never spoken to Ron\rquote s and Ginny\rquote s mother this way, but he couldn\rquote t stay silent. He stepped between the two of them. \'93
Sam Bell had the chance to be the same sort of traitor to my parents that Peter Pettigrew was, but he wouldn\rquote t do it. And because he had that kind of integrity, he acc
identally killed the woman he loved and had to be apart from his daughter for ten years. He had dementors absorbing every happy thought and memory he\rquote d ever had for an entire decade.\'94 He shook, remembering his time in Azkaban in his other life. 
\'93And he\rquote s my friend now, too. I won\rquote t hear anyone saying anything against Sam Bell.\'94
\par 
\par Molly Weasley\rquote s mouth was open in shock. When he was done, she closed her mouth, and surprisingly, smiled at him. \'93Harry. Every day you\rquote re more like your parents. I know Ron couldn\rquote t have a more loyal friend, and it\rquote 
s clear that Sam Bell has a good friend in you, also. I was simply going to say that your father,\'94 and she nodded at Katie, \'93Was an Auror, but you\rquote re not. And neither are Draco and Ron. Granted, the three of you are of ag
e and that might make up for the fact that Harry and Ginny are not, but still--a mother can\rquote t help but worry. If--if you all were attacked--\'94 She stopped, reluctant to go further in describing what could happen to them on the road.
\par 
\par Katie put her hand on Mrs. Weasley\rquote s arm. \'93No, I\rquote m not an Auror, Mrs. Weasley. But,\'94 she lowered her voice, \'93I\rquote ll tell you a secret. I\rquote ve passed the entrance exams, and I\rquote 
m going to start training as an Auror in September. Following in my dad\rquote s footsteps.\'94 She was smiling shyly, and yet also with pride. Harry couldn\rquote t help smiling at her also. Mrs. Weasley looked very relieved.
\par 
\par \'93Oh! I had no idea, dear! Well, well--aren\rquote t you just the dark horse and all...\'94
\par 
\par Katie shook her hair into her face shyly. \'93I\rquote ve wanted this all my life. I still haven\rquote t told my dad, though, so if you could--\'94
\par 
\par Molly put her finger to her lips. \'93I\rquote m the very soul of discretion. Don\rquote t you worry. Well! If you passed those tests I daresay you\rquote re at least on your way to being an Auror.\'94 She sighed. \'93I\rquote 
ll try to stop worrying. You say you\rquote re stopping in Leicestershire tonight?\'94
\par 
\par \'93We\rquote re having tea in Exeter first. Then we\rquote ll be at the Four Friars in Appleby Magna for the night.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Send Hedwig if there\rquote s an emergency,\'94 Harry told her. \'93She\rquote s rather large for us to have her in the car with us right now, with three people in the back seat. Ron\rquote 
s bringing Pigwidgeon so we can owl you when we get to the Four Friars, but he has a much smaller cage than Hedwig, so that\rquote s not so bad.\'94
\par 
\par With some
 more hugging and kissing--for which even Katie qualified this time--they were off to Exeter. Ron had insisted upon sitting up front alongside Draco Malfoy while he was driving, because there was more leg room in front, and because he was holding Pigwidge
on\rquote 
s cage on his lap and the very small owl became very agitated when Ron tried getting into the back seat. So Harry ended up sitting in the middle with Katie to his left and Ginny to his right. He did his best to just look straight ahead, but once he happe
ned to notice Ginny looking daggers at Katie, who was trying to ignore this, although Harry could tell she\rquote d seen Ginny\rquote s glare. Harry felt somewhat irritated with Ginny; she\rquote d chosen Malfoy, why\rquote 
d she have to go and be shirty with Katie?
\par 
\par After they had tea in a small pub in Exeter, Katie took over the driving again, and now Ginny was sitting in the back with Draco to her left and Harry to her right. Harry wasn\rquote 
t any more comfortable about this. It seemed a very long drive to the village where Maggie Dougherty lived.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par \'93What do you mean, it\rquote s flooded?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I mean it\rquote s flooded. That rain we had two nights ago overflowed the gutters and the water found a space between the shingles and seeped down into the ceiling. The room next to it\rquote s all right, and we\rquote 
re trying to keep the smell of mildew from spreading, but--\'94
\par 
\par \'93But you only have two rooms to let and only one of them isn\rquote t under water,\'94 Harry finished tiredly. He turned to Katie and Ron, standing on either side of him at the pub\rquote s bar while he talke
d to the publican. He turned around, peering cautiously at the man, then whispered to the two of them, \'93What do you reckon? Could one of you cast a drying charm on it to clean it up?\'94
\par 
\par Katie shook her head. \'93Not a good idea, Harry. He knows the room is ruined.\'94
\par 
\par \'93How about a memory charm, too?\'94
\par 
\par She sighed. \'93I can\rquote t justify it. I did that one on Adam Justice because he might have remembered the magical signatures otherwise. But we can\rquote t just go ahead and do magic and then memory charm someone to cover it up
. Besides, if I make him forget that the roof needs to be repaired, the next time it rains, he\rquote ll have flooding again. It\rquote s not fair to him.\'94
\par 
\par She turned to the publican. \'93Can we see the room that is available?\'94 He nodded and led them up the stairs at the end of the bar, then down a short corridor. Harry wrinkled his nose; he could smell the damp already.
\par 
\par \'93Here we are,\'94
 he said grandly, as though showing them a suite at the Ritz. There were two beds, each large enough for two (Thin) people. A narrow couch stood against the wall between a white wall-mounted sink with separate hot and cold taps and rust stains in the basi
n, and a door which led to a cramped room with a shower and nothing else, including towel bars and towels.
\par 
\par \'93The W.C. is the door to your left when you come upstairs. The hot water tap on the sink doesn\rquote t work. Trust me; if you turn it on, you won\rquote t like what comes out.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Erm--what about the shower? Both hot and cold working there?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yeah, that\rquote s all right. So. What\rquote s the plan?\'94 He clapped his hands together while the three of them looked around uncertainly at the room. One of the beds had a blood-colored 
coverlet while the other had a dun-colored one with a black footprint stain right in the middle. The lighting was too dim to see very clearly (Harry had a feeling that was deliberate) and the clock on the table between the beds was flashing \'9312.00\'94
 over and over; no one had ever bothered to set it.
\par 
\par Ron frowned, looking around. \'93What, no television? I thought I\rquote d at least finally get to see television, staying in a muggl--\'94
\par 
\par Harry trod on his foot suddenly, making him yell in pain. Katie hastily said, \'93We\rquote ll take it. It\rquote s fine, really. I\rquote m sorry you\rquote ve had trouble with your roof.\'94
 She smiled charmingly at him (At least, Harry hoped the publican would think it was charming, and that he\rquote d forgotten what Ron had said) and took the key from him. When he\rquote d gone, she turned to glare at Ron.
\par 
\par \'93You know, I might expect something like that from Fred and George. But I thought you had a little more sense, Ron Weasley.\'94 She sounded very grown-up. Ron set his jaw stubbornly.
\par 
\par \'93I was only saying--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--}{\f1\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 T}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 he word muggle. What were you thinking? Now,\'94 she said purposefully, and she opened her shoulderbag and withdrew her wand. \'93I\rquote 
ll set about making this place a little more comfortable--and vermin-free--while you two and Draco and Ginny get all of the luggage from the car. And you,\'94 she said, nodding at Ron. \'93
Make yourself useful. Put a good locking charm on the car, including the boot. We can\rquote t have someone breaking into it and discovering Harry\rquote s trunk and boxes of magic books. Understand?\'94
\par 
\par Ron grumbled an assent and left with Harry. \'93Who put her in charge?\'94 he muttered as they returned to the bar.
\par 
\par \'93Your mum, actually, if you want to know. If you want to take it up with her--\'94
\par 
\par \'93No, thanks,\'94 he said quickly. \'93I\rquote m tired and I\rquote m still not going to get to see television, but I\rquote m not stupid. I need to send her Pigwidgeon, so she knows we\rquote re here. Thank goodness we don\rquote 
t have a telephone, or she\rquote d do something like call and find out we\rquote re all staying in one room.\'94
\par 
\par They explained their predicament to Draco and Ginny, who had been sitting at a corner table in the bar, drinking Cokes and eating crisps. They all went to the car and retrieved their belongings, and Katie\rquote 
s as well. Once they were in the room again, Harry\rquote s jaw dropped. Katie had been very careful about not letting them in until she was certain the publican wasn\rquote 
t with them. When they entered, all the four of them could do was stare around at the transformation Katie had wrought.
\par 
\par \'93This is our bed, Ginny,\'94 Katie told her, indicating a far more generously-proportioned bed 
than Harry remembered from his first viewing of the room. The other bed had been similarly enlarged, and the couch was as well. Everything also looked much cleaner, and there was much more illumination. Harry checked his watch; the clock was even set corr
ectly.
\par 
\par \'93The three of you will have to figure out who\rquote s on the bed and who gets the couch,\'94 she said to Harry, Ron and Draco. \'93I\rquote m knackered. I\rquote 
m going to change for bed in the shower room. You three can figure out what you want to do.\'94
\par 
\par As soon as she was gone, Ron said, \'93I\rquote ll kip on the couch. It\rquote s a hardship, but--\'94
\par 
\par \'93A hardship! I\rquote m taking the couch,\'94 Draco Malfoy declared.
\par 
\par Ron protested, even more loudly, Draco Malfoy fired another volley, and finally, Ginny yelled, \'93Quiet! The pair of you! You two--\'94 she pointed at Ron and Harry, \'93
Take the bed tonight. Draco did a lot of driving. And if either of you has to share with him, I know the rest of us will never get to sleep for your bickering, so since the two of you are best friends, why don\rquote 
t you share with each other instead of forcing one of you to be with someone we all know you hate!\'94
\par 
\par Ron and Harry looked a bit awkward. \'93I wouldn\rquote t say hate,\'94 Ron countered feebly. \'93I mean, yeah, I don\rquote t want to sleep in the same bed with him--\'94
\par 
\par \'93What, afraid you won\rquote t be able to resist the urge to rip my clothes off?\'94 Malfoy smirked, his arms crossed. Ron\rquote s ears turned very red.
\par 
\par \'93I don\rquote t--\'94 Ron started to say.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, sod off, the pair of you,\'94 Harry said suddenly, to cover up Ron\rquote s awkwardness. \'93I wasn\rquote t even claiming the couch for myself. We don\rquote t have any problem with you getting it, Malfoy. Thanks for driving,\'94 he added wryly.

\par 
\par Now the blond boy was smirking at Harry. \'93Oh, I see. You\rquote ve been wanting to get into bed with Weasley--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Ron to you. I\rquote m so sorry to deprive you of his company, Malfoy. Jealous are we?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Hey!\'94 Ron exclaimed. \'93Cut that out!\'94
\par 
\par Harry and Ginny erupted into laughter while Ron and Draco, in disgust, went to unpack their bags (After Draco enlarged his again). He looked her in th
e eye while they both laughed. It felt so good to laugh with her. She looked at him as well, and his heart turned over.
\par 
\par \'93Hullo, you,\'94 he said suddenly.
\par 
\par \'93Hullo yourself,\'94 she said quietly.
\par 
\par \'93So--tomorrow we\rquote re going to go get you a sister.\'94
\par 
\par She gave him a small smile. \'93Looks that way.\'94
\par 
\par Katie emerged from the shower room and Ginny quickly gathered up her things and took a turn changing her clothes. Harry\rquote s throat went dry when he saw Katie, even though he\rquote d undressed her down to her underwear
. She was wearing a red chemise with very thin straps which came to mid-thigh, and no dressing gown. He noticed that Ron and Draco had also come to a screeching halt in their bedtime preparations when she appeared. As she climbed into bed she looked at th
e three of them, still in their traveling clothes.
\par 
\par \'93Don\rquote t let me stop you. You can\rquote t faze me. At Hog\rquote s End your brothers,\'94 she nodded at Ron, \'93Are always walking about in their underwear, and I\rquote ve already seen Harry\rquote s bare bum. Quite a nice one it is, too.
 Well, good night.\'94 She punched her pillow a few times and curled up under the coverlet, closing her eyes.
\par 
\par Ron\rquote s and Draco\rquote s jaws had dropped as they swiveled their heads to look at Harry, who was finding it hard not to smirk. \'93You know,\'94 he said, nodding at Draco. \'93The Sleeping Incident.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yeah, but you said--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Sssh! She\rquote s trying to sleep!\'94
\par 
\par \'93But--but--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Just finish getting changed and climb into your couch before Ginny gets back out here,\'94 Harry ordered him.
\par 
\par Soon the five of them were breathing peacefully in the dark. Harry stared up at the moonlight on the ceiling, thinking about laughing with Ginny and seeing Katie in her chemise.
\par 
\par \'93What am I going to do, Sandy?\'94 he groaned to her.
\par 
\par \'93Go to sleep, Harry Potter.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, that\rquote s helpful,\'94 he started to say, when four other voices, echoing the small green snake, but in English, said:
\par 
\par \'93Go to sleep, Harry!\'94
\par 
\par He laughed in the darkness before rolling over and closing his eyes.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par They pulled up in front of No. 10 Highgrove Street at ten o\rquote 
clock. Ron and Ginny stared nervously at the front door of the stately Georgian home, set back from the road in a formal garden. The banks of windows stared back at them blankly. They all emerged from the car and started to walk toward the door, but then 
Harry had a thought.
\par 
\par \'93Wait--we can\rquote t all just go barging into her life like this. The moment she sees Ginny, she\rquote ll wonder what the hell is going on, for one thing.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Why?\'94 Ginny asked, her brow furrowed.
\par 
\par \'93Don\rquote t you remember how much your sisters looked like you in those old pictures, before they disappeared? You think she won\rquote t notice? You should wait in the car. And Ron--\'94 He bit his lip. \'93You should wait, too.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Why? She\rquote s not likely to connect me with--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Not because of that. Because--well--she\rquote s a Seeress. Hermione found her web site. That\rquote s how we figured out she was the right Margaret Dougherty. Your sister seems to be the real thing. She\rquote 
d leave Trelawney in the dust. But the thing is--on the web site she talks about seeing people\rquote s auras. She\rquote ll definitely be able to tell that you\rquote re different.\'94
\par 
\par Ron turned with bewilderment to Ginny. \'93What\rquote s a web site? Because if it has something to do with spiders, I want no part of it.\'94
\par 
\par Harry rolled his eyes and ignored this. \'93Now, here\rquote s what we should do--Draco and Katie should go to the door first and try to convince her to let them in...\'94
\par 
\par \'93So you\rquote re waiting, too? Why?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well--you\rquote re likely to have a slightly scary aura because of the werewolf thing, but with Voldemort after me, mine\rquote s not likely to be much better. We don\rquote t want to frighten her.\'94 He couldn\rquote 
t tell him that his sister would immediately be able to see two auras around him. That would require far too much explanation.
\par 
\par \'93So. The three of us will wait in the car, while you--\'94
\par 
\par \'93But--but what do we tell her?\'94 Katie said, clearly uncomfortable at being given this responsibility.
\par 
\par \'93Just tell her--well, okay, she knows she\rquote s adopted. So tell her that you\rquote re friends with some people from her birth family who\rquote ve been looking for her, and would she be 
interested in meeting them. Just be honest about it. We can get to the whole oh-by-the-way-you\rquote re-a- magical-person-just-like-us thing later.\'94
\par 
\par Now Draco Malfoy was the one who appeared nervous. \'93Who do we say we are again?\'94
\par 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93Tell her. Say you\rquote re her little sister\rquote s boyfriend. You helped drive her here from Devon. How hard is that?\'94
\par 
\par The two of them still looked uncertain as Harry, Ron and Ginny returned to the car and they walked toward the door. Harry saw Katie use the large brass knocker, and after a minute, the door opened.
\par 
\par \'93Is that her?\'94 Ginny whispered hoarsely, gripping Harry\rquote s arm as she peered around him toward the house. He nodded.
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s her.\'94
\par 
\par They waited while an exchange occurred that they couldn\rquote t hear, and then they saw her disappear into the house, Draco Malfoy following. Katie turned around and gave a signal for them to come.
\par 
\par \'93Windows will be opened.\'94
\par 
\par Harry stopped short, letting Ginny and Ron walk ahead of him into the large front hall of the house, with a grand staircase sweeping up to a landing with a large arched window. He didn\rquote 
t have time to ask Sandy what she meant. (Not that that ever did much good.) He followed the others through an open archway to a large sunny room furnished with oversized, comfor
table white-slipcovered couches and chairs and lots of green plants and Persian rugs.
\par 
\par The moment Maggie Dougherty saw Ginny she swallowed and said, \'93Is that her? That\rquote s my little sister?\'94
\par 
\par Katie nodded, looking like she was trying not to cry, as Maggie stepped forward and enveloped Ginny in a sisterly hug. Ginny hugged her back, crying freely.
\par 
\par \'93Oh--I can\rquote t believe we\rquote ve found you!\'94 she exclaimed. They held each other tightly, rocking back and forth, both crying now, and Harry was amazed how similar they l
ooked, except for the eye color. The older sister had also cut her hair quite short. It roved over her head in orange curls, even shorter than Hermione\rquote s hair. Harry thought Ginny would look quite nice with her hair that way.
\par 
\par Finally, they all sat down. She was shaking her head, looking at her five visitors. \'93I can\rquote t believe this. It\rquote s all just out of the blue....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Mum will be so excited!\'94 Ginny exclaimed, before seeing Harry\rquote s scowling face.
\par 
\par \'93Mum?\'94 Maggie Dougherty frowned. \'93What--?\'94
\par 
\par \'93The thing is,\'94 Harry said quickly. \'93There\rquote s something we have to tell you, or the rest, about how you came to be adopted, won\rquote t make any sense...\'94
\par 
\par She looked at him with her eyes narrowed. \'93You have two--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Right. I know.\'94 He stopped her before she could finish. \'93But we\rquote re not talking about me right now. There\rquote s no way to build up to this, so I\rquote m just going to say it. Margaret Dougherty, you\rquote re a witch.\'94
\par 
\par She looked at him blankly. \'93I know. And call me Maggie.\'94
\par 
\par Ron\rquote s jaw dropped. \'93You know?\'94
\par 
\par She frowned. \'93Of course I know. You don\rquote t just make things happen with your mind and See the future without figuring out something like this. The question, is--how do you lot know?\'94 She squinted at Ron. \'93And what\rquote 
s wrong with your aura--?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well,\'94 Ginny said quickly, \'93I\rquote m a witch too. And Ron--our brother--\'94 she gestured, \'93He\rquote s a wizard. Katie\rquote s also a witch, and Harry and Draco are also wizards. Our whole family are magical, as a matter of fact.\'94

\par 
\par She sat back, her arms crossed. \'93Indeed? The whole family?\'94 She looked somewhat skeptical.
\par 
\par \'93Yes,\'94 Harry said, ignoring her unbelief. \'93You may be aware that you have abilities that other humans around you don\rquote t--as least, as far as you know, as we tend to be somewhat secretive--but what I don\rquote 
t think you realize is that there\rquote s an entire British wizarding society that lives side-by-side with British muggles--\'94
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Non-magic people. I didn\rquote t find out about it myself until I was eleven and received my letter of acceptance to Hogwarts. That\rquote s a school of witchcraft and wizardry. I\rquote m goi
ng to be starting my seventh and final year in September. I\rquote m Head Boy. Draco here is a prefect, and so\rquote 
s Ginny. Katie just finished school there; she was a prefect too. Ron is captain of our house Quidditch team, and Draco is captain of his house team--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Captain of what? I\rquote m afraid you\rquote ve lost me. And none of this explains--\'94
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par She sighed. \'93None of this explains why I can\rquote t remember anything from before the age of seven, and why I didn\rquote t grow up with my true family.\'94 She looked disgruntled.
\par 
\par Harry drew his lips into a line. \'93That\rquote s actually something of a mystery for us still, as well, although I have a theory about what probably happened.\'94
\par 
\par He explained to her what Molly Weasley had told him and Hermione about Bill and Charlie taking their sisters off to play in the park in Ottery St. Catchpole, and the two girls disappearing. \'93
I think whoever took the pair of you was a wizard--or maybe more than one-- using a spell called Tempus fugit.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Time flies?\'94 she said, mystified.
\par 
\par \'93So you know Latin?\'94
\par 
\par She sniffed. \'93I should think so. Greek as well. I\rquote m the Classics Mistress at the school.\'94
\par 
\par Ginny smiled. \'93Our mum used to be a teacher, too.\'94
\par 
\par \'93But--but what is this spell? And I didn\rquote t know there were really such things as spells. I just know that sometimes I want something to happen and if I think very, very hard about it, I can sometimes make it happen. It doesn\rquote 
t always work. I didn\rquote t manage to send my last boyfriend to a South Sea Island surrounded by sharks, for instance. He\rquote s still a solicitor in the village.\'94 She smirked and so did Ginny, and Harry could tell that she liked her sister.

\par 
\par \'93You\rquote d need a wand and knowledge of a pretty powerful traveling charm to pull that one off,\'94 Katie told her, also smiling.
\par 
\par \'93Wand? As in--magic wand?\'94 She sat back, looking skeptical again. \'93You\rquote re not serious.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Completely,\'94 Katie informed her. She pulled her wand from her shoulder bag, Ron pulled his out of a long pocket on the side of his jeans, just above his knee, and Draco Malfoy pulled his from a holster under 
his shirt, strapped to his left arm. Maggie still shook her head.
\par 
\par \'93What about you?\'94 she said to Harry and Ginny.
\par 
\par \'93We\rquote re not of-age yet. You have to be seventeen to legally do magic outside of school--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Legally?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yeah,\'94 he told her. \'93We have laws, and law enforcement, and then there\rquote s the Minister--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Minister?\'94
\par 
\par \'93--And a prison, and wizarding money--\'94
\par 
\par She stood and paced. \'93I don\rquote t know how gullible you all think I am, but--\'94
\par 
\par Ginny followed her. \'93It\rquote s true. All of it. There\rquote s an entire magical world out there, and you should have been part of it. You should have gone to Hogwarts, like the rest of us. You--\'94
\par 
\par Harry suddenly grabbed Ron\rquote s wand from his grasp and strode over to Maggie, putting his hand on her shoulder and, touching each of them with the wand in turn and thinking the fastest thoughts he could, he said, \'93Tempus fugit!\'94
\par 
\par Everything stopped but them. Maggie and Harry looked at Ginny, whose mouth was open, in mid-sentence. Ron was looking startled at no longer having 
his wand in his hand, his eyes wide and unblinking, and Draco Malfoy had evidently found a spot on his jaw to worry with his fingers, which did not move. Katie was caught in mid-blink, her eyes closed. Maggie looked at the four of them, who did not even a
ppear to be drawing breath, and then she looked at Harry, swallowing.
\par 
\par \'93I thought you said you weren\rquote t allowed to do that!\'94 she said, her voice shaking.
\par 
\par \'93I know, but I had to get you to see, to understand. This is what I was trying to tell you. I think whoever abducted you and your sister put both of you under the Tempus fugit spell and had you far, far away before anyone even knew you were gone....
\'94
\par 
\par But she again didn\rquote t seem to be listening to Harry. \'93I\rquote ve never done anything like this,\'94 she breathed, waving her hand before Ginny\rquote s face, getting no response.
\par 
\par \'93You\rquote ve never had a magic wand. Wands help focus our magic. It\rquote s best to have your own wand, though. Since this is Ron\rquote s, I wasn\rquote t sure it was going to work.\'94
\par 
\par She walked around Ron and then Draco, then back to Ginny, before moving on to Katie. \'93
I--I think--I think I remember now. There was a man in a long cloak....taking me and another girl--she was older than me, and she also had red hair--through a dream world where everyone was frozen like this--\'94
\par 
\par Suddenly she collapsed on the floor, shuddering, and Harry went to her. She seemed almost to be having a seizure, and Harry realized that if she was remembering her abduction, her mind was breaking through some very powerful memory charms. Could that caus
e her brain-damage? he wondered. He decided not to compound the problem and took the spell off the two of them, and everyone else started moving again. Unfortunately, that seemed to throw her even more, and she clutched at Harry desperately, the most frig
htened look on her face that he had ever seen on anyone.
\par 
\par \'93Oh God!\'94 she cried, gripping his shirt in her hands. \'93I--I remember now!\'94
\par 
\par Harry was dragged down onto his knees, beside her. He looked at the others, at a loss, as Maggie Dougherty huddled on the floor, sobbing and shaking. She had gone very white and sweat had broken out on her brow.
\par 
\par Ron\rquote s and Ginny\rquote s long-lost sister held onto him fiercely, quivering madly, her eyes black with pain as she choked out the words, \'93I remember everything....\'94

\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Castles, broadly defined, can probably be traced back to
\par prehistory. The word castle is derived from the Latin
\par castrum, a fortified military camp usually surrounded by a
\par palisade and a ditch. However, a castle is most often associated
\par with the western Middle Ages and is more strictly defined as a large
\par fortified stronghold inhabited by a lord. A castle, if very elaborate,
\par can be what is ordinarily called a palace; at the other end of the
\par scale, a castle can be simply a fortified manor house. The castle is
\par essentially a combination of military and domestic architecture--
\par a place where the owner can find security from his enemies.

\par 
\par Ginny went on her knees next to Harry and put her arms around her sister. Maggie continued to shiver and perspire. Finally, Ron went down next to her, too, and placed his hand on her head, closing his eyes.
\par 
\par \'93Ssshhh--\'94 he told her softly. Slowly, a calm seemed to flow into her from Ron, and he spoke quietly to her now, although Harry couldn\rquote t hear what he was saying. Ron\rquote 
s voice was a soothing murmur in her ear. Her eyes were closed and she was clearly paying close attention to him, to her youngest brother.
 Soon she stopped shaking, and her brother and sister helped her to move to a large comfortable armchair, where they perched on the arms. Katie summoned a glass of cold water with a wave of her hand and brought it to Maggie.
\par 
\par Ginny took it from Katie with a hostile look, then handed it to her sister, who drank it thirstily. Harry looked down and saw that he was still holding Ron\rquote 
s wand, and he handed it back to him, getting a nod in return. Harry felt terrible; Ron had every right to be upset with him, yet he was calmly stroking his sister\rquote s hair, still speaking in low, gentle tones, like a mother soothing a colicky baby.

\par 
\par Finally, Maggie looked Harry in the eye. \'93Thank you,\'94 she said shakily. \'93You--you made me remember--\'94
\par 
\par Harry swallowed. \'93That\rquote s--that\rquote s what I hoped. But I didn\rquote t expect you to--to have that reaction. Stupid really--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Stupid!\'94 Katie exploded at him unexpectedly. \'93That\rquote s the least of it. How in the hell do you even know about the existence of that spell, Harry? That\rquote s Dark Magic! I know about it because of some independent research I\rquote 
ve done, but that\rquote s not even covered in seventh- year Defense Against the Dark Arts!\'94 She looked slightly frightened of him for a moment.
\par 
\par Harry swallowed. \'93I know about it because--because someone put that spell on me. Last year, when I was about to go through the barrier to platform nine and three-quarters--\'94
\par 
\par Ron opened his eyes wide now. \'93So that\rquote s why you were being so queer when you got on the train!\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well--that\rquote s just a part of it. It\rquote s neither here nor there now. I\rquote m just saying--I know it\rquote s Dark Magic, but I took the spell off quickly. It was just a theory that that was how the kidnapper operated, anyway--\'94
\par 
\par \'93No!\'94 Maggie exclaimed suddenly. \'93No,\'94 she said again, more calmly. \'93I\rquote m--I\rquote m glad you did it. That\rquote s exactly what happened. As I said; we were moving through a dream world where no one moved, where there wasn\rquote 
t a breath of wind even....\'94
\par 
\par Harry was alarmed. \'93How long did he have you under the spell?\'94
\par 
\par She shook her head. \'93I don\rquote t know. Why?\'94
\par 
\par He swallowed; she was frightened enough. Better not to tell her the downside of the spell just now. \'93Just--go on.\'94
\par 
\par \'93He made us walk. Me and my sister,\'94 she said quietly. \'93My sister--\'94 She looked like she was struggling.
\par 
\par \'93Annie,\'94 Ginny said gently.
\par 
\par \'93Annie! Yes. Her name was Annie, and she was nine, and her favorite sweet was Drooble\rquote s Best Blowing Gum! I remember!\'94 She smiled round at them, and Ginny looked down at her sister so sweetly that Harry forgave her for every hostile glare she
\rquote d sent in Katie\rquote s direction.
\par 
\par \'93And--and our brothers Bill and Charlie took us to the village park to play. The village of--of--of Ottery St. Catchpole! Mum was--she was taking care of our little brothers...\'94
\par 
\par \'93Percy and the twins, Fred and George,\'94 Ron said.
\par 
\par \'93Right! Right....\'94 she trailed off, looking like she was concentrating again. \'93We walked for ever so long, and when we were tired and hungry and thirsty, he went into stores and took fruit and gave it to us to eat. Things 
like oranges and grapes, so they were juicy.\'94 Her eyes opened wide. \'93We walked--to Exeter. He took us to a hospital...and then he led us to a room with two beds in it and--and--\'94
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94 Harry breathed.
\par 
\par \'93Then everything was new after that. My old life ju
st slipped away. Until today, I felt like the first thing in my life I remembered ever was waking up in a hospital bed with a curtain pulled round it, and a matron came to take my temperature and give me food. She told me I was a lucky girl; that everyone
 else in my family had been killed in the car crash. She said that they knew my name was Margaret, but I didn\rquote t appear to have any family that weren\rquote 
t killed in the crash, and when I recovered I would go to live in an orphanage or into a foster home, unless someone wanted to adopt me.
\par 
\par \'93I went to sleep every night crying. Day in and day out I never remembered more of my earlier life. The doctors didn\rquote t know what to make of it. They claimed it was a psychological problem, that there was nothing physically wrong with me.
\par 
\par \'93After I\rquote d been in hospital for a fortnight, an older couple came to see me. She had red hair, a little darker than mine, and he had light brown hair and a nice smile. When she saw me, she said right away, \lquote She looks so much like Valerie!
\rquote  and he told me that was their daughter, who had died. I asked them about their daughter, and they seemed very glad to be able to talk about her. We talked for some time. Finally, I asked them why they\rquote d come, and they said they\rquote 
d heard that there was a little girl who\rquote d lost her family and needed a new one. I asked them whether I could be their daughter; they were frightfully nice, and I was so very sca
red. I was only seven. Having a mum to tuck me in at night again was all I wanted. If I\rquote 
d remembered my family, I might have wanted them, specifically, but I just had this enormous void where memories of my family should be. Nothing. Nothing at all.
\par 
\par \'93The doctors had already given up on me. No one could make me remember where I\rquote d lived or gone to school or any of it. A week later, I went home with the nice couple who\rquote 
d come to see me. Some time after that I officially became Maggie Dougherty, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Sean Dougherty of Appleby Magna.\'94
\par 
\par Harry swallowed again. \'93And--and when did you discover that you\rquote re a witch?\'94
\par 
\par She looked thoughtful. \'93I started doing odd things not long after I came home with my new mum and dad, actually. Well, actually it started in hospital, with seeing people\rquote s auras. The doctors were sure I was brain-damaged...\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, wait!\'94 Harry exclaimed. \'93Back up--who kidnapped you? What did he look like?\'94
\par 
\par She furrowed her brow. \'93He had a very confusing aura. Dull, muddy green. He had conflicting emotions. I didn't know then that's what his aura meant. I didn't know anything about that. He wasn\rquote 
t very big. Or very tall, I should say. He had a slightly round belly. He wore a long cloak. He didn\rquote t seem very old though. Grown-up, but not thirty or forty or anything like that....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Maybe--nineteen or twenty?\'94 Harry was anxious; he felt a suspicion starting to form in his mind.
\par 
\par She looked thoughtful. \'93Hard to say. I was only seven; I wasn\rquote t a very good judge of that sort of thing. Anyone 
who looked old enough to be at Hogwarts seemed grown-up to me--Oh! Wait! I remember Hogwarts! I mean--I remember that Bill and Charlie went there, and I was so looking forward to it...And I--I remember going to school! On a green bus that appeared and dis
appeared....\'94
\par 
\par Harry smiled. \'93Right! You went to the village school in Hogsmeade--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--Where I learned Latin and maths and--maybe that\rquote s why Latin seemed to come so naturally to me when I came to live here--\'94
\par 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93It must have leaked through the Memory Charm, or something like that. Perhaps \lquote leaked\rquote  isn\rquote t quite the right word...\'94
\par 
\par \'93No, Harry,\'94 Katie said. \'93I think it is. Think about it--people who are memory charmed don\rquote t forget how to speak English, do they? It doesn\rquote t affect their language ce
nters. Latin would be in the language centers as well, and she still remembered what she\rquote d learnt because of that.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Mum and Dad reckoned I must have been the daughter of a pair of Classics Masters to know so much Latin at the age of seven. They always told me that. I think that\rquote s why--that\rquote 
s why I grew up to do the same thing. Because I was trying somehow to be close to my real parents. Of course, my mum and dad--I mean the ones I\rquote ve known--were also teachers, so they didn\rquote t mind my being a teacher a bit.\'94
\par 
\par Ginny and Ron began to explain about their home now, about the Burrow\rquote s odd clocks and about calling people using the fireplace and traveling by Floo and tossing garden gnomes over the hedge into the field; and playing Quidditch in the paddock--

\par 
\par \'93Someone said that word before: Quidditch. I said I remembered everything, but I meant about the kidnapping. Some details of my early life are still rather fuzzy. What on earth is Quidditch?\'94
\par 
\par Which gave Ron the perfect excuse to launch into a detailed description of the game, and his favourite strategies as a Chaser....
\par 
\par \'93You mean,\'94 Maggie interrupted him, \'93You people really ride on brooms? You\rquote re not joking? I mean--if I brought the broom in here from the kitchen, you\rquote d be able to fly around the room on it?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, hell no,\'94 Draco Malfoy broke in--brooms being one of his favourite topics. \'93
A proper broom for flying has to have spells put on it first. The basic flying spell; a braking spell, of course, so you can stop; spells for changing direction, hovering, accelerating, decelerating-- none of which will respond to a muggle. And then there
\rquote s the problem of cushioning.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, yes, I should think that brooms would be rather, um, uncomfortable for anyone male--\'94
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s what the cushioning charm is for. And then there\rquote 
s the shape of the handle. The old things they had us learning on in first year were just straight-handled brooms--if you can call those straight, with all those knots--but a proper racing broom these days will have a slight jog in the handle so
 that you don\rquote t kill your back bending over to hold on.\'94
\par 
\par She shook her head, looking baffled. \'93I had no idea!\'94 She drank some more of her water, looking a bit overwhelmed.
\par 
\par They talked all morning, then went into the large sunny kitchen to make sandwiches, which they ate out on the terrace after passing through the conservatory.
\par 
\par After chewing a bite of sandwich thoughtfully, Maggie looked up. \'93I remember something else. I--I was actually at Hogwarts. We went for a visit, for a--a Quidditch match. My brother--our brother--Charlie was playing.\'94
\par 
\par \'93He was the greatest Seeker Hogwarts had seen in years, until Harry showed up!\'94 Ron bragged, making Harry turn red. Draco Malfoy grumbled a bit. \'93Come on, Malfoy. Harry was the youngest player in a century, and you wouldn\rquote 
t have even shared the Quidditch cup with Gryffindor last year if Harry hadn\rquote t made it a draw on purpose.\'94 The blond boy still looked slightly disgruntled.
\par 
\par Later, they were having tea in the living room when Maggie asked about Ron again. \'93I\rquote ve never seen anyone with an aura like yours. It looks--it looks more like the emanations I see from animals, rather than from humans. Except that it\rquote 
s edged in black. What aren\rquote t you telling me?\'94 She turned to Harry. \'93And why do you have two auras?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh,\'94 Ginny volunteered. \'93That must be because Harry\rquote s an Animagus.\'94 Harry knew this wasn\rquote t the case, but he didn\rquote t argue. However, he did forget that not everyone in the room already knew about this.
\par 
\par Katie dropped her plate. \'93What?\'94 She whirled on Harry. \'93I know we\rquote ve only been going out a short time, but suddenly I feel like I don\rquote 
t know you at all, Harry. How could you do that? I mean, a spell here and there is one thing; everyone does a little of that before they\rquote re of-age. But how could you disregard the law so utterly and become an illegal Animagus?\'94
\par 
\par \'93He\rquote s not illegal,\'94 Ginny informed her archly. \'93He\rquote s trained up properly with McGonagall herself, and he has permission to wait until after his seventh year to register with the Ministry.\'94
\par 
\par "It\rquote s true," he told Katie. "I have permission to wait."
\par 
\par Maggie shook her head. \'93Hold on, everyone. I\rquote m afraid I\rquote m still a bit at sea. What on earth is an Animagus?\'94
\par 
\par Ron nodded at him casually. \'93Harry can change from his human form into an animal. Specifically, a golden griffin.\'94
\par 
\par \'93A what?\'94
\par 
\par \'93A golden griffin,\'94 Harry said, watching both Maggie\rquote s and Katie\rquote s amazement. \'93Well, you know what a griffin is, don\rquote t you?\'94
\par 
\par \'93A cross between a lion and an eagle.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Right. And you know a hippogriff is a cross between a horse and a griffin, right?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Right. But what--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, a golden griffin is a cross between a griffin and yet another lion, so it\rquote s three-quarters lion. In fact it looks like a plain old lion most of the time, until it spreads its wings--\'94
\par 
\par \'93A winged lion!\'94 she cried, her eyes wide. \'93So, if you\rquote re one of these people who can change into animals, you can even change into mythical animals, things that don\rquote t exist?\'94
\par 
\par They all looked calmly at her. \'93Oh, they exist,\'94 Katie said evenly.
\par 
\par Maggie raised one eyebrow. \'93Yeah, right. There are real griffins and hippogriffs and winged lions--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--And don\rquote t forget dragons,\'94 Draco Malfoy said archly, sitting up straight.
\par 
\par She stopped and stared. \'93You\rquote re serious. You\rquote re completely serious.\'94
\par 
\par \'93There are loads of magical creatures,\'94 Ron told her. \'93Charlie studies dragons in Romania. Bill used to work for the wizarding bank, Gringott\rquote 
s, at the Cairo branch, and his bosses were all Goblins. We use post owls to deliver the mail, and--and Harry has a snake with the Sight.\'94
\par 
\par She turned abruptly back to Harry. \'93You have a what?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well,\'94 he began, \'93Actually, all snakes have the Sight. A given snake can cover more or less time and space depending on size. But most people don\rquote t know that because they\rquote re not Parselmouths...\'94
\par 
\par \'93They\rquote re not what?\'94
\par 
\par He unbuttoned his shirt slightly and removed Sandy. \'93People who can speak and understand snake-language.\'94 He held up Sandy for Maggie to see. \'93Say hello to a fellow Seer, Sandy,\'94 he hissed at her. He smiled, watching Maggie\rquote s reaction.

\par 
\par \'93Hello, fellow Seer,\'94 Sandy hissed obligingly.
\par 
\par \'93She says hello,\'94 Harry informed them all.
\par 
\par \'93And--and we\rquote re just supposed to believe that all of that hissing--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Trust me,\'94 Katie cut in. \'93She\rquote s the genuine article. She told Harry when my dad was going to walk in on us.\'94
 Then, as soon as she said this, she blushed deeply. Malfoy raised an eyebrow and looked meaningfully at Harry, who frowned at him. He turned to Ron, whose jaw had dropped.
\par 
\par \'93Well then,\'94 Maggie said, sitting back with her arms crossed. Over the hours they\rquote d spent with her she\rquote d become increasingly comfortable with the whole idea of the magical world. \'93Let\rquote s see it, then.\'94
\par 
\par Harry was confused. \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par \'93This Animagus thing. Come on. How am I supposed to believe it if I don\rquote t see--\'94
\par 
\par Harry\rquote s paws touched down gently on the Persian carpet. Maggie\rquote 
s voice rose on a scream at the sight of the tawny, green-eyed lion now standing before her. He slowly unfolded his wings, backing up slightly to avoid knocking over some knick-kna
cks to which the Doughertys had probably become rather attached over the years.
\par 
\par \'93He\rquote s--he\rquote s--\'94 she stuttered, when Harry abruptly changed back and calmly sat down. She needed to gulp some more water. \'93Can all witches and wizards do that?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, most people can\rquote t do the Animagus Transfiguration,\'94 Katie explained. \'93For one thing, that\rquote s a wandless spell. But there are temporary Transfiguration spells you can do with a wand, once you\rquote re very advanced.\'94
\par 
\par Ron snorted. \'93Remember how Krum botched that spell during the second task of the tournament?\'94 he said to Harry.
\par 
\par Maggie frowned. \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par \'93There was a wizarding contest called the Triwizard Tournament. I was a champion in the Tournament. One of the other champions half-transfigured himself into a shark to go into the lake at school--\'94 Harry swallowed, seeing Krum in his mind\rquote 
s eye again, Cho kneeling over his body, distraught....
\par 
\par \'93It\rquote s not quite as bad as splinching yourself while Apparating,\'94 Katie explained, \'93but it\rquote s really not a good idea to transfigure yourself only half-way into an animal. It can be hard to put right again.\'94
\par 
\par Which meant that then they needed to explain Apparating and splinching, accompanied by demonstrations from Katie and Draco Malfoy, who moved themselves across the room and back several times.
\par 
\par Then Maggie asked again about Ron\rquote s aura, still not having received an answer. He hemmed and hawed, but finally he just blurted out:
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m a werewolf.\'94
\par 
\par She stared.
\par 
\par "A werewolf."
\par 
\par Ron nodded.
\par 
\par "Full moon, howling, changing into a furry beast werewolf."
\par 
\par She looked round at them all; Harry tried to keep his face as composed as possible. He noticed that the others did, too.
\par 
\par "I suppose it's too much to ask that you're all going to start laughing and pointing at me in a minute, that I could be so gullible as to believe my brother is a werewolf?" she said hopefully. They looked at each other. She swallowed. \'93
Um--does this run in our family too?\'94 she asked nervously.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, no,\'94 Ginny assured her. \'93It\rquote s just Ron. He was bitten recently.\'94
\par 
\par Ron looked down, unwilling to meet his older sister\rquote s eyes. She put her hand on his chin and forced him to anyway. \'93Are you all right?\'94 she asked with genuine concern.
\par 
\par He nodded. \'93I could have been killed. Loads of us could have been, actually. But Harry changed into his griffin form and chased the other wolf through the forest. We were in the Forbidden Forest, at school.\'94
\par 
\par She furrowed her brow. \'93I remember now that Bill told me he was in there once...he spoke to--to--\'94 She looked up, her eyes wide. \'93A centaur?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Right,\'94 Harry said. \'93There are a number of centaurs in the forest. They don\rquote t tend to mix with humans much. And there are unicorns, too. And possibly still a Lethifold, although hopefully the cold weather this winter will kill it. They
\rquote re tropical, normally.\'94 He looked toward Ginny, and saw that she went deep red at the mention of the Lethifold.
\par 
\par \'93I don\rquote t think I even want to know what a Lethifold is....So--my little brother is a werewolf. It\rquote s a good thing there\rquote s no full moon tonight, isn\rquote t it?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, well, I also take Wolfsbane Potion during the week before the full moon. Our Potions Master from school makes it for me and for Professor Lupin. I mean, Remus. He\rquote s not actually our professor any more.\'94
\par 
\par \'93So he\rquote s a werewolf also?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well,\'94 Ron hesitated. \'93He\rquote s actually the one who bit me.\'94
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par \'93It\rquote s a long story...\'94 which Ron proceeded to tell in part, leaving out large bits that his newly-found sister would probably have found confusing.
\par 
\par They continued to talk and talk; the sky outside darkened and crickets were heard in the summer garden, through the open windows. Finally, Ginny yawned hugely, followed by Ron and Harry.
\par 
\par \'93We\rquote d better turn in for the night,\'94 Harry said, rising. \'93We can all come again in the morning....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, no!\'94 Ginny cried, throwing her arms around her sister. \'93I don\rquote t want to go yet!\'94
\par 
\par Maggie hugged her back. \'93Why don\rquote t you stay the night, then? I have a big bed; we two sisters can share and sit up all night chatting,\'94 she smiled at Ginny, and Harry remembered how Ginny had
 wished for just that thing in his other life, where her sister had been married.
\par 
\par \'93Well,\'94 Ron said slowly. \'93But--is there enough room for us all?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Hmm...my parents\rquote  room is actually in quite a state of disarray right now. I\rquote ve been painting it while they\rquote 
re on holiday, as a surprise for when they get home. I was going to work on it some more today, but obviously you all gave me something far more interesting to do.\'94 She smiled at them. \'93The furniture is all moved about, the m
attress is leaning against the upstairs hall, and there are drop cloths everywhere. And we don\rquote t have a guest room; the spare bedroom is my office. There are two couches down here though.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Except that there are four of us,\'94 Ron pointed out. Then he looked up at Katie. \'93Couldn\rquote t you do something, Katie? The way you did at the pub?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well,\'94 Harry said, \'93I don\rquote t have to stay the night. I can go back to the pub. Why don\rquote t you and Ginny stay, Ron, and Katie and Draco and I will come back in the morning.\'94
\par 
\par \'93If Ginny is staying, I\rquote m staying,\'94 Draco Malfoy drawled. \'93Sleeping on one couch is much the same as another.\'94
\par 
\par Ron growled at him, \'93Ginny\rquote s sleeping in the same room with our sister, Malfoy--\'94
\par 
\par To forestall another fight, Katie said, \'93Well, that\rquote s both couches claimed, then. And Harry will need someone to drive him back to the pub, so I suppose that\rquote s what we\rquote ll do.\'94 She seemed rather anxious, suddenly, to leave.

\par 
\par Maggie wouldn\rquote t let Harry go without hugging him soundly and kissing him on the cheek. \'93Come early--for breakfast. You don\rquote t want to eat that pub food, trust me. Worst food in Leicestershire.\'94
\par 
\par He laughed. \'93All right. We will.\'94
\par 
\par He and Katie drove back to the pub and walked up to their room. When they were alone in the room, Harry suddenly felt a little awkward.
\par 
\par \'93Er,\'94 he said, \'93Why don\rquote t you change first?\'94 he asked pointedly, so she\rquote 
d go into the small shower room to undress. She nodded in a businesslike way and took a small bundle of clothes in with her. Harry quickly stripped down to his drawers and climbed into the bed he\rquote 
d shared with Ron the previous night, rolling over and feigning sleep.
\par 
\par When Katie emerged from the bathroom, she was wearing a night dress similar to the one from the night before, not very long, with thin straps, but turquoise b
lue this time. Harry squinted through his eyelashes at her, then quickly squeezed his eyes shut when she began to turn around.
\par 
\par \'93Harry?\'94
\par 
\par He debated whether to pretend to snore.
\par 
\par \'93Harry, you faker. I just wanted to say good night.\'94 He felt her draw nearer,
 and when he opened his eyes she was right above him, leaning over, brushing her lips against his briefly before drawing back and going to her own bed. He swallowed, following the way the fabric of the night dress moved over her body.
\par 
\par \'93G\rquote night,\'94 he choked out as she extinguished the light.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par There was a familiar warmth pressed against him, from chest to knees. He had his arm around the warmth; his left hand was pressed against soft, slightly slippery material covering firm, warm flesh t
hat was rising and falling in a slow, steady rhythm. Opening his eyes, he saw a tangle of glossy brown hair and a bare shoulder with a thin turquoise strap on it. When did Katie get into bed with me?
\par 
\par He wasn\rquote t certain how long he had stared at that should
er when suddenly he yielded to the impulse to press his lips against the smooth tanned skin there, licking and nipping it. He felt her tense, then she leaned back into his body with a slight shudder, and a soft sigh escaped her. After he had been paying a
ttention to her shoulder for some time, she couldn\rquote 
t take being passive any longer, his lips and tongue on her skin making her breathing ragged. She rolled over in his arms and on top of him, like a horizontal pas de deux, her mouth on his, her body pressin
g him down urgently, and he wrapped his arms around her, welcoming her, welcoming this unexpected heat and light. They moved as if they\rquote d already discussed this, as though they had an understanding. He didn\rquote 
t remember the details of how their clothes came 
to be removed, and thought that perhaps she had done it with magic. He rolled her onto her back, admiring her and seeing that she needed to be admired, demonstrating his admiration with hands and mouth, caress and kiss, experimenting with her, finding out
 what activities made her produce the most interesting noises....
\par 
\par Then they were finally joined and she was holding him to her for dear life, and she spoke at last: \'93It\rquote s been so long....\'94 escaped softly from her lips, unbidden, as he strove to fill the emptiness in them both. It hadn\rquote 
t been as long for him, because of Hermione, but in a way it had been forever, because it seemed forever ago that he was in the Quidditch changing rooms with Ginny....
\par 
\par When they were lying together afterward, sated and sweaty
, he felt more peaceful than he had in a long time, running one gentle hand up and down her thigh repeatedly, knowing exactly where they stood, no illusions between them. They seemed to have a mutual understanding about why they\rquote 
d just done what they\rquote d don
e and no one was hurt or had the upper hand or was using it for a weapon or instrument of emotional blackmail. Each of them knew the other was thinking, at least a little, about someone else, and that was all right. Once they\rquote 
ve moved beyond the first part
ner, Harry thought, are two people ever really alone in bed? There would always be ghosts, and sometimes, he imagined, poltergeists. Then that made him think of Peeves and he had to laugh. Katie smiled at him; this had quickly become one of his favourite 
sights.
\par 
\par \'93What are you laughing about?\'94 she asked him quietly, running a finger down his chest. She was resting on her back and he reclined beside her, his head on his right arm.
\par 
\par \'93I was thinking of Peeves.\'94
\par 
\par Now she laughed too. \'93Oh, that\rquote s what every woman wants to hear after a man\rquote s made love to her!\'94
\par 
\par He laughed again. \'93It\rquote s just that--I was thinking that most people probably have ghosts alongside them when they\rquote re in bed. Most people probably have more than us. Then ghosts made me think of poltergeists....\'94
\par 
\par She smiled and put a finger on his lips to stop him. \'93I get it.\'94 She rolled onto her side and faced him, nose to nose. \'93Our pasts make us who we are. We\rquote 
re the sum of our history. And while there are some things everyone might want to change about their pasts--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Not me,\'94 Harry said quickly, thinking of the nightmarish world he had created by changing the past. He missed his mother and Jamie, and even his brothers, but he knew it was all for the best. There were obstacles and challenges in this life,
 but at least it had unfolded naturally and without interference from people traveling through time, thinking they knew best--much. (He would never regret using the Time Turner to save Sirius).
\par 
\par \'93You wouldn\rquote t change anything?\'94
\par 
\par Then he thought of Cedric, and Dudley. It was harder to say this time, but he still did it. \'93Not a thing.\'94 Having saved his mother, he knew now that a single person\rquote s death can change the world. And so could undoing that death. \'93
Not a thing,\'94 he said again \'93Even when I said stupid things or was embarrassed--it\rquote s uncomfortable at the time, but it\rquote s all worked out in the end. And you learn. You don\rquote 
t say those stupid things again, or you learn how to handle yourself better in certain kinds of situations. It\rquote s all a learning process. We aren\rquote 
t getting marked on how we performed in the past, but right now, and in five minutes, and the five minutes after that. That\rquote s what counts. The past is the past and what\rquote s done is done.\'94
\par 
\par She grimaced. \'93Sometimes I forget you\rquote re younger than me, Harry. You seem to have learned so much more in your lifetime than most people your age.\'94
\par 
\par Well, he thought ruefully, I lived from fifteen months to the age of sixteen twice, so I\rquote m actually over thirty when you think about it.... But he couldn\rquote 
t say that. Was that why he was feeling so old these days? he wondered. He had the memories of two lifetimes in his head, and partly, in his Pensieve. He had twice as many experiences to learn from as most people his age. That had to be having some effect
 upon him....
\par 
\par \'93I lived in a cupboard under a stair for ten years,\'94 he said, trying not to seem like he was fishing for sympathy. \'93I had a lot of time to imagine things, to imagine another life, so I did.\'94 It wasn\rquote 
t completely a lie. He had imagined many times what life might have been like if his parents had lived, all those years in his cupboard. But that wasn\rquote t what he described to her now. \'93
I imagined a life with my mum and dad, and a sister and younger twin brothers, and we all lived in a big house and went to the seaside in the summer and to parks and circuses....\'94
 he said, picturing his family from his other life running down the beach and splashing into the water. He remembered all of them going to a wizarding circus when he was six, getting sick on t
oo many sweets, and his mum tucking him into bed later with a hot towel on his head, singing to him and checking to make sure he hadn\rquote t had too terrible a time, and telling her No, it was the best day of my life....
\par 
\par She continued to smile at him. \'93You\rquote re rather amazing, do you know that, Harry Potter?\'94
\par 
\par He gazed into her eyes for half a minute, seeing himself reflected there, and then he closed the very small distance between their mouths and kissed her softly, slowly falling onto his back again and pulling her with him. He\rquote 
d forgotten about that amazing sensation of another unclothed body pressed full-length against his...
\par 
\par Then he broke their kiss and looked up at her, tucking her hair behind her ears gently so it didn\rquote t fall into her face. \'93You\rquote re pretty amazing yourself, Katie Bell.\'94 She didn\rquote 
t answer him with words but kissed him again, then moved her mouth down to his neck, and down his chest...
\par 
\par Afterward, they rolled back into their spooning position again, the position that had started it all, and H
arry pulled the sheet up over both of them as Katie pressed her head more firmly into the pillow, making small contented noises as he wrapped his arm around her waist again, this time with his hand pressed against her smooth belly instead of the fabric of
 her night dress. He closed his eyes as he breathed in the scent of her hair and skin, giving a mental prayer of thanks for whatever twist of fate had given him this temporary respite from chaos and uncertainty.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par \'93There was only one key.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, why didn\rquote t they leave it with us?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Because they needed it to get back into the room.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Why didn\rquote t one of you or Katie make a copy of it? You\rquote re all of age. It\rquote s not like Harry or I could do it.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, right, it\rquote s all very well to point fingers now, but I didn\rquote t hear you making that suggestion yesterday before they came back here.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Lay off her, Weasley. You didn\rquote t think of it either. None of us did. Including Potter, your hero.\'94
\par 
\par \'93If I recall, Malfoy, he saved your sorry arse in the forest when you were stupid enough to go by yourself. Or have you forgotten that you owe your life to him?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Stop it, the pair of you! Of course Draco is grateful to Harry for saving his life.\'94 Stark silence. \'93Leave him alone!\'94 she added with an awkward shake in her voice.
\par 
\par Ron sighed noisily. \'93Come on. Maggie\rquote s waiting in the car. We said we\rquote d get some clean clothes and wake up Harry and Katie and be out quickly. She\rquote ll think we\rquote ve been swallowed up by a great hole.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Black hole,\'94 Ginny corrected him. \'93You never did do very well in Astronomy, did you?\'94
\par 
\par \'93All right, bloody black hole. Are you happy?\'94
\par 
\par Katie turned over and grinned up at Harry, who had been sitting up in bed, listening to the conversation taking place in the corridor outside their room. \'93They woke us up all right,\'94 she whispered to him. \'93We\rquote 
d better get moving before one of them decides to--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Alohomora!\'94
\par 
\par The door swung open just as Katie very wisely pulled the sheet further up, so she was fully covered. Draco Malfoy stood in the doorway with his wand out; h
e quickly sheathed it under his shirt sleeve (Harry realized suddenly that the holster would be right over his Dark Mark) and he strode into the room and over to his bag, which was still sitting on the couch.
\par 
\par He didn\rquote t look at them as he pawed through his clothes, selecting something to wear. \'93Morning, Potter. Morning, Bell. Had a good shag?\'94 he said casually while he closed his bag again.
\par 
\par Ginny and Ron still stood in the doorway. Ron\rquote s mouth was hanging open stupidly and Ginny....
\par 
\par Harry wanted to crawl under a rock, or into Ron\rquote s \'93Great hole.\'94 He wanted to be anywhere other than where he was, with Ginny looking at him as though he\rquote d killed her. She thinks I\rquote m no better than Draco Malfoy, I\rquote 
ll bet. And suddenly, he didn\rquote t feel particularly morally superio
r to her morally-bankrupt boyfriend. He felt dreadful. He remembered the letter Ginny had written after the first Daisy Furuncle story had appeared. She thought he and Katie were just friends....
\par 
\par Friends who\rquote d just spent the hour before dawn shagging.
\par 
\par Twice.
\par 
\par \'93Could the three of you get what you\rquote ve come for and go? I\rquote d like to go take a shower,\'94 Katie said, with, Harry thought, a hint of laughter in her voice. She thinks this is funny, he realized.
\par 
\par Malfoy stood at the foot of their bed holding his clean clothes and smirking. \'93Don\rquote t let me stop you.\'94
 Harry assumed he was waiting to get another eyeful, as when Hermione had inadvertently sat up without the sheet covering her in the Leaky Cauldron.
\par 
\par Ginny\rquote s face was closed up. She wouldn\rquote t look at Harry and Katie. In stark contrast to the nasty looks she\rquote 
d been giving to Katie the day before, now she went to her own bag and removed some clothes with a blank, almost vacant expression on her face, as though her emotions had shut down entirely and she had no abil
ity to move her face to show her feelings. She seemed to be trying very hard not to have feelings.
\par 
\par Ginny rushed out into the corridor as soon as she had what she wanted. Harry thought Draco and Ron seemed to be dawdling a little. \'93Clear off!\'94 he said testily. \'93We\rquote ll get dressed and meet you over at Maggie\rquote s house.\'94
\par 
\par Draco finally left after looking suggestively at Katie\rquote s sheet-shrouded form. Ron lingered in the doorway. \'93Making a habit of this, aren\rquote t you?\'94 he said with a raised eyebrow befor
e closing the door. Harry threw himself back on the bed and put the pillow over his head, groaning.
\par 
\par \'93What did he mean by that?\'94 Katie wanted to know, prying the pillow off his face.
\par 
\par Harry looked up at the cracked plaster on the ceiling and explained to her what had happened near the end of his fifth year when Ginny, Draco and Ron had entered his room at the Leaky Cauldron and found him and Hermione in bed together.
\par 
\par Katie threw herself back onto the bed next to Harry, laughing hysterically. \'93You\rquote re kidding! The same three people found you in a room in a pub with a naked girl before?\'94
\par 
\par Harry closed his eyes and shook his head. \'93I\rquote m not kidding.\'94
\par 
\par Still laughing, Katie rolled over and pressed her chest against his, her face very close to his. \'93You think they\rquote re still right outside the door? Want to give them something to listen to?\'94 She smiled impishly.
\par 
\par He sat up reluctantly, trying not to look at her body and failing. \'93No! I do not want to give them something to listen to--\'94
\par 
\par She laughed again and threw back the sheet, finally getting out of bed. \'93Aw, you\rquote re no fun.\'94 He gave up on not looking at her compact little body.
\par 
\par \'93I thought you thought I was quite a lot of fun only a little while ago...\'94
\par 
\par She gave him a wicked grin and disappeared into the bathroom. He looked up at the ceiling again, remembering Ginny\rquote s closed-up face, trying to force himself not to care about this. But at the same time--
\par 
\par He knew that wasn\rquote t going to happen.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par They drove over to Highgrove Street after showering and dressing
. When they arrived, they heard voices in the garden, so they walked on the path leading round the house and found Ron and his sisters and Draco Malfoy on the terrace, eating breakfast. Maggie sprang to her feet when she saw them.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, there you are! Sorry we didn\rquote t wait, but there\rquote s still plenty. Eggs, anyone? Fried tomatoes? And these are some lovely sausages I picked up a couple of days ago...\'94
\par 
\par They sat at the round table with the others, not meeting anyone\rquote s gaze. Maggie seemed quite chipper, he thought. Perhaps they hadn\rquote t told her. But then she looked slyly at the two of them, her blue eyes twinkling.
\par 
\par \'93I understand the two of you have worked up quite an appetite...\'94
\par 
\par Harry felt his face grow warm. Next to him, Katie was trying not to laugh; under the table, she banged his knee with hers on purpose, he was sure. She was much bolder than Hermione, he realized (Which explained how it was they\rquote 
d already slept together). Of course she was older, and she\rquote d been in a serious relations
hip before. He remembered her laughing when he told her about the Leaky Cauldron debacle. He felt a smile pull at the corner of his mouth now; in retrospect, it had been funny. Oh, Hermione had been mortified. And Malfoy had given her plenty of grief abou
t it for some time. (As if he hadn\rquote t already been overusing the rack-of-lamb jokes). But with time and distance....
\par 
\par \'93Butter wouldn\rquote t melt in your mouth, Potter,\'94 Draco drawled as he helped himself to more orange juice. He looked at Katie with one eyebrow r
aised. He saw that Katie looked boldly back with a bit of a scowl. She was not going to be stared down by Draco Malfoy. Harry realized that the Slytherin had no idea that he was trying to get the better of an Auror-in-training. Keep it up, Malfoy, he thou
ght.  See what kind of hex that gets you.
\par 
\par \'93What are we going to do today?\'94 Maggie asked with anticipation after they\rquote d cleared up the breakfast things. Katie, Draco and Ron had entertained her in the kitchen by making the breakfast dishes fly around and wa
sh themselves up. Draco had less practice at this than the others and had to repair several glasses, but Maggie was just as impressed by this.
\par 
\par \'93Could I do that?\'94 she asked in awe, watching the pieces of the glass fly back together.
\par 
\par \'93Well--\'94 Harry said reluctantly, thinking of his aunt. \'93You haven\rquote t been properly trained. And there are laws about not letting muggles see you do things....\'94
\par 
\par She nodded. \'93That makes sense. After about the age of ten I learned to control myself a bit better. I really didn\rquote t like the funny looks and complicated questions after some of the things I did when I was first adopted. I didn\rquote 
t want any more of that than absolutely necessary.\'94
\par 
\par \'93But you could be trained up,\'94 Ginny told her, putting some food in the fridge. \'93And we have to get Mum and Dad here to see you! Ron\rquote s waiting for his owl, Pigwidgeon to come back. He wrote to them. Hopefully--\'94
\par 
\par As if on cue, the small excited owl began banging himself against the window over the sink. \'93Pig!\'94 Ron cried, running through the conserv
atory and onto the terrace, returning with the small bird, wings fluttering as madly as if it was a grey, fuzzy Snitch.
\par 
\par \'93Oh!\'94 Maggie exclaimed. \'93Isn\rquote t it the most darling thing?\'94 Ron showed Pigwidgeon to her as Ginny extricated the letter from his tiny foot. She unrolled the parchment and read it, grinning, then looked up at her sister.
\par 
\par \'93They should be here at about eleven!\'94
\par 
\par \'93Eleven? How will they get here so fast?\'94
\par 
\par Ginny shrugged. \'93They can Apparate. It\rquote s almost instantaneous. You saw Draco and Katie do it.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes, but--that was just across the room and back. They can Apparate to Appleby Magna from--from--\'94
\par 
\par \'93The Burrow. It\rquote s outside Ottery St. Catchpole.\'94
\par 
\par Maggie sat at her kitchen table, shaking her head. \'93It\rquote s all just--\'94
\par 
\par Suddenly, with two abrupt pops! Arthur and Molly Weasley appeared in the conservatory, each with their feet stuck in a potted palm. Ginny stared through the French doors leading into the conservatory from the kitchen.
\par 
\par \'93Mum! Dad! You\rquote re early! And you\rquote re, um--is that the same as being splinched?\'94
\par 
\par Molly Weasley looked distinctly uncomfortable. \'93Not precisely dear, but it is somewhat scratchy. Just a moment--\'94
\par 
\par She suddenly disappeared and then reappeared on the tiled floor next to the palm. She had what app
eared to be a great deal of dirt in her shoes, which she removed, dumping the dirt into the pot. While she did this, her husband also Disapparated from the pot in which he\rquote d originally landed, reappearing on the floor. He smiled round at them all.

\par 
\par \'93Well! Here we are! Now--Ron. Why did you want us to come to--?\'94
\par 
\par He stopped abruptly when he saw Maggie, who slowly stood, staring at her father with tears in her eyes for the first time in seventeen years.
\par 
\par \'93Daddy?\'94 she said in a very small voice, suddenly sounding rather like a seven-year-old. They both moved to close the distance between them and Harry\rquote 
s nose started to itch and his eyes to sting as they held each other and rocked back and forth. Molly Weasley was standing where she had landed, staring with disbelief at her husband and long-lost daughter.
\par 
\par \'93Is it--?\'94 she whispered, looking almost frightened.
\par 
\par Her father looked at her. "Annie?" he whispered with tears in his voice. "Or is it Peggy?"
\par 
\par Maggie turned from her father, who was crying opening for the first time since Harry had known him. \'93Mummy,\'94 she murmured, leaning down to hug her diminutive mother tenderly. She straightened up again and looked down at her lovingly. \'93
Actually, it\rquote s Maggie. I\rquote ve gone by Maggie for quite a long time now.\'94
\par 
\par Her mother nodded, tearing up and taking out a handkerchief to manage. \'93That\rquote s one thing I considered,\'94 she choked out. \'93
You--you were named after my sister, Meg. I suppose I thought it was a little close to that. When she was small we called her Meggie...\'94
\par 
\par Maggie smiled through her tears. \'93My friends call me Mags sometimes, if that helps. But my parents never liked it.\'94 She put her hand over her mouth in horror. \'93I mean--\'94
\par 
\par Molly Weasley put her hand over her daughter\rquote s. \'93Don\rquote t worry about that dear. I\rquote m very grateful to them for bringing you up so well.\'94
 She beamed up at her daughter, tears still in her eyes, and Ginny and Ron came to stand on either side of her, looking at their parents.
\par 
\par \'93Surprise!\'94 Ron said, grinning.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, you--\'94 his mother began. \'93You couldn\rquote t have said--\'94
\par 
\par \'93You didn\rquote t even know that I knew,\'94 Ron said, not sounding the least bit put-out now that his parents hadn\rquote t been the ones to tell him about his sisters. \'93If I\rquote d said anything, you\rquote d have wondered how I knew--\'94

\par 
\par \'93Yes, yes. Well!\'94 his father said. \'93I\rquote m rather curious to know how you tracked her down.\'94
\par 
\par \'93The short story is that Harry and Draco and Hermione did it,\'94 said Ginny. \'93We can get to the long story--\'94
\par 
\par Suddenly, Molly had thrown herself on Harry and then Draco in quick succession, while Arthur was shaking hands and slapping their backs. Draco went quite pink, and Harry also felt his face grow warm again. \'93Where\rquote s Hermione?\'94
 Molly asked suddenly, looking around with confusion.
\par 
\par Ron\rquote s ears went unexpectedly red. \'93She couldn\rquote t come,\'94 he said suddenly. \'93Other obligations.\'94 Harry frowned. Was Hermione being completely truthful to him about why she couldn\rquote 
t come along? Ron seemed to know something he didn\rquote t. On the other hand--she and Ron were possibly on their way to being a couple. If they wanted to have some secrets, he shouldn\rquote 
t begrudge them. He and Hermione had certainly had their share of secrets from Ron when they were seeing each other.
\par 
\par They moved into the living room and spent the day going over how they\rquote d found Maggie and how she\rquote d recovered her memories. When Arthur Weasley heard about the Tempus fugit spell, however, his reaction made Katie\rquote s seem mild.
\par 
\par \'93Harry!\'94 he cried angrily--the first time Harry every remembered Ron\rquote s and Ginny\rquote s father ever directing his ire at him. He was always unfailingly kind toward Harry. \'93
How could you do that? I never thought you, of all people, would do Dark Magic--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Will people stop saying that?\'94 Ginny suddenly demanded. Everyone was silent, staring at her. \'93Harry jolted her memory back. And he had a theory about how she was kidnapped that seems to be spot-on. And if he hadn\rquote 
t come up with her name, we never would have found Maggie to begin with. He said it was Voldemort who put that spell on him back in September. That\rquote s how he knew it. He would never use it for doing anything bad. This is Harry.\'94
 She paused, catching her breath. Harry met her eyes across the room, quite shocked. He had thought that she hated him. She wouldn\rquote t look at him back at the pub, after finding him in bed with Katie. She had rejected him, even after he\rquote 
d saved her from the Lethifold and she\rquote d temporarily given in to temptation and kissed him passionately. She\rquote d also kissed him back when he\rquote d fixed the timelines and was relieved to find her alive. Now he didn\rquote t know what
 to think. Suddenly, it was as though they were the only two people in the room.
\par 
\par \'93Er--yeah.\'94 Draco\rquote s feeble agreement with his girlfriend sounded strange and awkward. \'93I mean--I know Dark Magic. My dad--well, let\rquote s just say I\rquote ve seen things I probably shouldn\rquote t have. I won\rquote 
t go into detail. That\rquote s at least got to be the best motive for using Dark Magic I\rquote ve ever seen. Using it to set right something else that was done by Dark Magic, I mean. You\rquote 
re not seriously going to jump on him because he helped your daughter get her memory back, are you?\'94
\par 
\par Harry had to admit--he was impressed. Not only was Draco Malfoy standing up to his girlfriend\rquote s father, whom he was always worried about displeasing, he was defending Harry at the same time. Harry almost felt like pi
nching himself to see whether he was awake, but suddenly Molly came and sat next to him and put her arm around his shoulder, hugging him to her.
\par 
\par \'93Leave him alone, Arthur. He had good intentions, didn\rquote t you, Harry?\'94
\par 
\par Harry winced at the phrase, remembering the Tempus bonae voluntatis spell. \'93Er--yeah. I--I just wanted to--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Bill and Charlie!\'94 Molly exclaimed suddenly, springing to her feet.
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94 Ron asked, perplexed.
\par 
\par \'93We need to tell them! Oh, they\rquote ll be so overcome....\'94
\par 
\par Maggie frowned. \'93I wish I hadn\rquote t started that painting project. I\rquote ve no good way to put up more than a few visitors, and at the pub--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh!\'94 Harry said suddenly, to stop her revealing that the five of them had shared the same room for one night, and just him and Katie the other. \'93Er, I mean--today\rquote s the thirtieth, isn\rquote 
t it? We were supposed to be traveling today, if we\rquote re to get up to Ascog by tomorrow!\'94
\par 
\par \'93Ascog?\'94 Maggie asked, perplexed. Harry and Ron took turns explaining to her that the next day was Harry\rquote s birthday, and his godfather was planning a big party at Ascog Castle for him.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, drat!\'94 Maggie said disappointedly. \'93I don\rquote t want to say goodbye to my brother and sister yet! But--I don\rquote t want to make you miss a party--\'94
\par 
\par \'93You can all come!\'94 Harry said suddenly. He hesitated for a moment--Ascog was going to be his home, but it wasn\rquote t yet. Did he have a right to invite additional people? \'93I mean--I\rquote m sure Sirius wouldn\rquote t mind. You\rquote 
re Ginny\rquote s and Ron\rquote s sister,\'94 he nodded at Maggie, \'93And you\rquote re their parents,\'94 he added, nodded at the Weasleys. \'93He\rquote 
s not going to turn you away. And then you can use one of the fireplaces at the castle to call Bill and Charlie, and the twins and Percy--\'94
\par 
\par As they joked and laughed and make plans to go to Ascog Castle, Harry looked at Ginny again and she looked back at him. She was sitting next to Draco, who put a protective arm around her and nodded at Harry. He nodded back. They\rquote 
d both defended him. What was he to make of that? Ginny\rquote s behavior on this trip had been a complete mystery to him so far. He decided that he needed to talk to her when they reached Scotland. If not sooner.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par It was decided that Maggie would drive her parents and Ron in her car, while Ginny stayed with Draco and Katie and Harry in the Bells\rquote 
 car. Since Katie and Harry had already worked out the route before leaving Surrey, Maggie would be following behind them.
\par 
\par This time, Draco Malfoy had no argument with sitting in the back seat when he wasn\rquote t driving; he wasn\rquote t about to have H
arry sitting back there with his girlfriend. Harry stared out at the road, trying to ignore the sounds from the back seat. Draco and Ginny were whispering to each other.
\par 
\par \'93Draco! Watch your hands. We\rquote re not really alone here....\'94
\par 
\par \'93All right, all right...I suppose we shouldn\rquote t be like them...\'94
\par 
\par Harry wanted to turn around and demand, Now what\rquote s that supposed to mean? but then he\rquote d have to admit to eavesdropping, something Draco Malfoy thought he was far too good at already. They had left at about two o\rquote 
clock, after eating lunch, turning onto Measham Road from Stoney Lane and getting on the M42 just a few minutes later. A mere fifteen minutes later they were on the M6, where the had to remain, unfortunately, for two-hundred miles. More
 than three hours later, Katie finally pulled over, groaning, before getting on the A74. She\rquote d been driving twice as long as either she or Draco had done on the way to Leicestershire, and when she\rquote 
d brought the car to a full stop, she started moving her head in circles on her neck and flexing her arms.
\par 
\par Harry reached out and put his hands on her shoulders, clucking at her. \'93I\rquote m surprised you made it this long,\'94 he said, starting to knead her knotted muscles.
\par 
\par \'93When I\rquote ve been driving for three hours, will I get a massage from you, too?\'94 Draco drawled from the back seat.
\par 
\par \'93If you like,\'94 Harry told him, batting his eyelashes. Katie started whooping with laughter, Harry joining her, and then he saw that neither Ginny nor Draco was joining in. Harry looked at Ginny again, but she wasn\rquote 
t looking at him; she was once more glaring at Katie.
\par 
\par They switched so that Draco was in the driver\rquote s seat and Ginny next to him, with Katie and Harry in the back seat. They pulled onto the road again, Maggie\rquote s car following them once more. Harry wondered how she was holding up, since she didn
\rquote t have someone to share the driving, as neither her parents nor Ron had licenses. He did a double take when he saw Arthur Weasley behind the wheel of his daughter\rquote s car. He didn\rquote t have a licens
e--did he? Then Harry remembered the Ford Anglia. Well, he\rquote d driven in that to London to take them to the school train....He just hoped no one stopped them and asked to see his license.
\par 
\par It was already five-thirty. Harry was starting to feel hungry for his tea. But Katie was broadly hinting that he could continue to massage her neck and shoulders, so he did that instead, to take his mind off his empty stomach. At one point he met Ginny
\rquote s eyes in the rear-view mirror. He couldn\rquote t tear his eyes away; he continued to knead Katie\rquote s shoulders, looking into Ginny\rquote s eyes....until suddenly, Katie yelled, \'93Ow!\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh--I\rquote m sorry. What\rquote s the matter?\'94
\par 
\par \'93It\rquote s just--I think that spot\rquote s done already. You\rquote re starting to make me more sore than I was before you started.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Sorry--\'94
\par 
\par Suddenly Draco Malfoy guffawed from the driver\rquote s seat. \'93Oh, I\rquote m glad you think my pain is so funny,\'94 Katie said archly.
\par 
\par \'93It\rquote s not that. I was just imagining you saying that to Potter when you were in bed--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Sod off!\'94 Harry told him automatically; then he was chagrined to see that Katie was laughing, too. She looked at him merrily.
\par 
\par \'93Sorry,\'94 she whispered. Then she leaned very close to his ear and said quietly, \'93I would never say that to you in bed. And you do have excellent hands, you know....\'94
\par 
\par Her breath was warm in his ear, and he met Ginny\rquote s eyes in the mirror again, making him flush guiltily. Katie relaxed now, reclining in the back seat and putting her head on Harry\rquote 
s thigh. Harry had moved so that he was sitting behind Ginny, instead of Draco, so he could not longer see her eyes in the mirror.
\par 
\par An hour after they\rquote d switched to the A74 they had to change to the M74. Sandy hissed to Harry, and he groaned. Great, he thought. I have to spend even more time in this bleeding car....
\par 
\par \'93Traffic jam up ahead,\'94 he informed the others dully.
\par 
\par \'93How the hell do you know?\'94 Draco Malfoy demanded.
\par 
\par \'93Sandy.\'94
\par 
\par That was all he had to say. And sure enough, soon after they\rquote d changed to the M74, everything came to a grinding halt. Instead of staying on this road for about half-an-hour, it was more like twice that long. Katie was sleeping peacefully on Harry
\rquote s leg, and Draco Malfoy was drumming impatiently on the steering wheel of the car.
\par 
\par \'93Damn! If only I could just jump the car ahead of this mess....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, you can\rquote t. Muggles would see. What\rquote s wrong anyway?\'94 Harry asked him. Sandy hadn\rquote t been forthcoming about the cause of the traffic problem.
\par 
\par \'93Dunno. Maybe an accident. I can\rquote t see a damn thing. And I haven\rquote t a bloody snake with the Sight.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Show some respect. A snake is the emblem of your house, after all. She doesn\rquote t insult you.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Although I could, quite thoroughly\'94 Sandy responded silkily from under Harry\rquote s sleeve. He started laughing at that, and Draco Malfoy turned around to glare at him, clearly fighting the urge to ask what Sandy had said to Harry.
\par 
\par Harry checked out the back window to make sure Maggie and Ron and the Weasleys were still behind them; they seemed to be taking the traffic situation in stride, talking animatedly to each other and gesturing, laughing....
\par 
\par He turned around, sighing. He\rquote d never get to his new home at this rate....
\par 
\par Finally, they were able to switch to the M73, and then, soon after, the M8. They pulled onto the High Street in Skelmorlie just after seven o\rquote clock, to s
witch drivers again. There was just one more leg of the trip, to Wemyss Bay, where they would get the ferry to the Isle of Bute.
\par 
\par When they reached the quay in Wemyss, it was seven-forty, and the bar was lowered, so that no more cars could drive onto the ferry. Katie pounded the steering wheel angrily. \'93Damn! That\rquote s the last ferry! We\rquote 
ll have to wait until tomorrow morning now!\'94
\par 
\par Harry couldn\rquote t believe it. \'93No we won\rquote t,\'94 he said briefly, getting out of the car and striding to Maggie\rquote s car behind them. He rapped on Arthur Weasley\rquote s window, and he rolled it down, looking concerned.
\par 
\par \'93What is it, Harry?\'94 he smiled at him.
\par 
\par \'93We\rquote re about the miss the last ferry of the day unless you do something,\'94 he told him urgently. He nodded briskly, then discreetly pulled out his wand. Harry returned to Katie\rquote 
s car and a minute later, the barrier rose and both cars were permitted to pull onto the ferry. They paid their passage and after the cars were taken care of, the eight of them went up on deck, to
 look at the scenery and breath the sea air. Harry gave Mr. Weasley a conspiratorial smile.
\par 
\par \'93Thanks. I\rquote m sorry I did that, but--well, I\rquote m not really. I just couldn\rquote t wait one more day to--\'94
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s all right, Harry,\'94 he said, clapping him on the shoulder. \'93I understand completely. Glad to help.\'94
\par 
\par It only took about half-an-hour to reach the port of Rothesay, and soon they were trundling the cars off the ferry and onto dry land again. Harry took out the directions Sirius had sent him to the castle and showed Maggie.
\par 
\par \'93Oh! That\rquote s where we\rquote re going?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Right. My godfather--\'94
\par 
\par \'93But--but it\rquote s a ruin! I have this book: Picturesque Ruined Castles of Scotland. And no one could possibly live there. It\rquote s just a pile of rubble. It used to be a fortified tower house. 
It was sacked sometime in the mid-seventeenth century, and then--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--}{\f1\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 A}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 nd then they killed the survivors in Dunoon,\'94 he finished, knowing the story full well, since it was Lucius Malfoy\rquote s favourite \lquote Bloody\rquote 
 clan story. Literally.
\par 
\par \'93Right. So how could your godfather possibly--\'94
\par 
\par He grinned mischievously at the woman who, forty-eight hours earlier hadn\rquote t known that anyone in the world other than her had the sort of abilities she had.
\par 
\par \'93One word,\'94 he said, continuing to smile. \'93Magic.\'94
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par There was a bit of confusion when they were getting back into the cars to drive off the ferry, and Harry wound up in Maggie\rquote s car while Mrs. Weasley found it most convenient to just climb into Katie\rquote 
s. After they were back on land, they drove along Battery Place before turning onto the High Street. It was a short drive down to Minister\rquote 
s Brae, and soon they were on Roslin Road, which went right down to the northeast edge of the loch. Harry hadn\rquote t expected that; the castle was right on the edge of the loch. It looked 
beautiful and still in the twilight, standing straight and tall, five stories plus what looked like a roof garden. It didn\rquote t have a large footprint; it looked like the only way to expand was to build up, so that\rquote s what they\rquote 
d done, as though they were in a
 city without a lot of empty land around to annex. It seemed strange for this tall, lonely stone building to be sitting by itself at the edge of the still water, nothing but wilderness around it in all directions, except for the road that briefly passed t
he edge of the loch.
\par 
\par They drove along a dirt track near the shore, Maggie shaking her head more and more as they drew closer to Ascog Castle. \'93See!\'94 she said triumphantly, when they were about twenty feet away from it. \'93Nothing but a
 moldering ruin! Just like in the book!\'94
\par 
\par Ron turned and looked at Harry in panic, then his father, then Maggie. \'93But--but I can see it. Can\rquote t you see it Harry?\'94 Harry nodded, confused. \'93Can\rquote t you, Dad? I thought you said you knew you were a witch!\'94 he sai
d to his sister. Then he turned to Harry. \'93Come to think of it--we didn\rquote t actually see her perform magic, did we?\'94
\par 
\par His father turned to him. \'93Even witches and wizards can fall prey to the same blindness that afflicts muggles if their minds are closed, if they decide what they are going to see before they see it.\'94 He put a gentle hand on Maggie\rquote s arm. \'93
Are you sure you\rquote re really seeing it, love? Or is your mind clouded by what you were told, what you read? Look again, and believe.\'94
\par 
\par Harry shuddered, remembering Rodney Jeffries.
\par 
\par Looking up, he saw Sirius wave to them out of one of the upper windows. \'93Look at the fourth floor window on the left!\'94 he told her. \'93It\rquote s my godfather. He\rquote s waving to us.\'94
\par 
\par She frowned still. \'93There\rquote s no fourth fl--\'94
\par 
\par Suddenly Sirius appeared in front of the car, Apparating with a pop! He was grinning ear to ear. Maggie gasped, unprepared for this. Then she looked up at the house again.
\par 
\par \'93I--I can see it now! It\rquote s--it\rquote s--\'94 She couldn\rquote t speak. It must seem to her like the building Apparated out of nowhere as well, Harry thought.
\par 
\par Sirius strode over to the car and leaned in Arthur Weasley\rquote s window, oblivious to the driver\rquote s confusion. \'93Hullo! Looks like you forgot to tell me about a few more guests, Harry. But it doesn\rquote t matter. We can m
ake room for everyone. Follow me.\'94
 He directed both cars to a small rundown cottage that was about thirty yards away through some overgrown brush, away from the lake, and the entire side of the cottage magically opened like an electronic garage door, allow
ing them to drive both cars inside. The cottage closed again and lights sprung up around them. As they emerged from the cars, Sirius hugged Harry and Ron and Ginny and even Draco Malfoy, who was somewhat abashed. He was introduced to Katie, raising his ey
ebrows at Harry, and he was reacquainted with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley.
\par 
\par Then he saw Maggie. He looked back and forth between her and Ginny, confused. \'93But--but--\'94 he stammered to the Weasleys. \'93You only have one daughter.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Actually,\'94 Molly Weasley said, \'93We have two other daughters in addition to Ginny, but we didn\rquote t know where they were for a very long time.\'94 She put her arm around Maggie lovingly. \'93
Now, thanks to Harry and Draco--and Hermione, as well--we have one of them back again.\'94
\par 
\par Sirius looked like his mind was working furiously; then he seemed to have an epiphany. \'93Oh!\'94 he exclaimed. \'93I remember now! You-- you\rquote re one of the little girls who disappeared....\'94
\par 
\par Maggie was looking at Sirius very strangely. \'93Well, I\rquote m not really a little girl any more--\'94 she stammered out. Harry frowned; why did she suddenly seem so nervous?
\par 
\par \'93No; I can see that you\rquote re not,\'94 Sirius said levelly, gazing at her very gravely. Harry was jolted; he\rquote d never seen Sirius look like this before. It was very odd.
\par 
\par Suddenly, as though he\rquote d just woken up, Sirius clapped his hands. \'93Well, everyone, follow me! It\rquote s not far, but the steps down and up are a little steep, so mind your step.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Mind the gap!\'94 Maggie sang merrily, pulling her suitcase from the boot of her car. Harry and Sirius laughed, but everyone else just looked at her as though she was mad.
\par 
\par \'93Er--there are these signs. In the Underground--\'94 She sighed and decided to give up. \'93Never mind,\'94 she said softly, following her parents down the steps to the access
 tunnel. Sirius walked beside her and gently took her bag from her hand to carry it for her. Walking behind them, Harry heard him say quietly, \'93I thought it was funny...\'94
\par 
\par \'93So you know, then? What I meant?\'94
\par 
\par He nodded, smiling at her with that look again. She smiled back, then obligingly looked down, so she wouldn\rquote t trip down the steep stairs. Sirius put his hand on her elbow and she smiled at him again.
\par 
\par When they reached the castle dungeons, Harry saw Ron looking at the empty, spartan cells they passed, h
is face apprehensive in the flickering torchlight. Soon they were climbing steep, winding stone stairs again, lit by more torches in brackets on the curving walls, and then they found themselves in the smallish entrance hall to Ascog Castle.
\par 
\par To Harry, it looked more like a shed for storing raincoats and other foul-weather gear than a grand entrance hall. Although the ceiling had to be at least twelve feet high, the space couldn\rquote 
t have been more than ten feet square, and now nine people and their luggage we
re crushing into this space. The circular stone stairs continued up to the next floor, while the curving walls in the hall where they stood were lined with hooks for outdoor gear of all types. Harry thought it was a good thing it was summer, and none of t
hem needed cloaks, for every hook was being used already for raincoats, umbrellas, overcoats and wizard\rquote 
s cloaks, mufflers, an enormous variety of hats--Harry saw a deer-stalker and top hat, besides the usual wizard hats--as well as rucksacks, walking stick
s, several woven creels, fishing rods lain horizontally across the upper tier of hooks (There were five levels of hooks, the highest about nine feet off the floor, Harry reckoned) and, hanging from a beautifully tooled tanned leather strap, an elaborately
-carved animal horn with what looked like a solid gold cap on the end. On the stone walls above the rows of hooks were numerous enormous stuffed and mounted fish. Some of them looked prehistoric.
\par 
\par Through the doorways that opened off the entrance hall, Harr
y could see a large kitchen with a long refectory table flanked by benches, where two boys and a little girl were sitting, eating biscuits and drinking something steaming out of mugs. On the wall at the far end of the kitchen was a tapestry with a silver 
r
ampant lion on deep blue. Through the other, larger doorway there was a cozy sitting room with two squashy couches and some padded benches arranged around a large hearth in the corner. A French door in a curved wall in the corner of the hall led to a cour
tyard, which the leaded windows in the kitchen and sitting room also looked upon. When Harry opened a door in the corner of the hall, he found a small lavatory, and he closed the door quickly, hoping no one had noticed him being nosy.
\par 
\par However, there was so much chaos and noise in the hall, he didn\rquote 
t feel like anyone was taking much notice of him, and he took the opportunity to look around some more. A narrow bench was pushed against one wall, under which was stored a great quantity of Wellington boots, and 
the top of the bench had a number of Wellies, too, in addition to some hip boots for fishing. Hanging on a hook above the bench was a basket with a diverse collection of gloves and mittens--none of them matching, as far as Harry could tell from just a qui
c
k glance. Some of the cloaks and boots in the entrance hall looked child-sized to Harry, as did some of the small gloves he saw in the basket. He stood in the kitchen doorway and smiled at the children, and this time they noticed him and smiled back. He r
emembered that Sirius had only recently met his nephews and niece. Harry couldn\rquote t remember the names Remus Lupin had told him....
\par 
\par \'93Orion! Leo! Mercy!\'94 Sirius cried gleefully, striding over to the kitchen doorway and putting his arm around Harry\rquote s shoulders. \'93Come meet your new housemate!\'94
\par 
\par The children were already in their pajamas and dressing gowns, just having a snack before having to go up to bed. The eldest boy stood and walked purposefully over to Harry. He had dark hair and eyes, and, he thought, Sirius\rquote 
 smile. He put out his hand and Harry shook it.
\par 
\par \'93Orion Pierson. What\rquote s your--\'94 he started to say, but then Harry could tell that he\rquote d noticed his scar. His mouth dropped open. \'93You\rquote re- -you\rquote re--\'94
\par 
\par Harry laughed, turning to Sirius. \'93You didn\rquote t tell them?\'94
\par 
\par Sirius shrugged. \'93I assumed they knew. I\rquote ve been saying, \lquote At the end of July, my godson is coming to live here.\rquote  It\rquote s been in the Prophet recently, for pete\rquote s sake. Don\rquote t you read the paper, Rion?\'94
\par 
\par Harry stared at him in disbelief. \'93You never said my name?\'94
\par 
\par Sirius\rquote  eldest nephew shook his head dumbly, then finally recovered himself. \'93I\rquote m going to Hogwarts in September. Got my letter last month.\'94 His voice was still no lower than an alto.
\par 
\par Harry nodded at him. \'93So--we won\rquote t have to say goodbye on September first. I\rquote m Head Boy this year.\'94 Then he winced; did he sound like Percy? he wondered. But the boy was shaking his head in wonder and looking dazed again.
\par 
\par \'93Harry Potter...living in my house...\'94
\par 
\par Now the second nephew had come over. \'93Hullo! Don\rquote t forget about me! Not that everyone else doesn\rquote t do that. I\rquote m used to it by now. I\rquote m Leo Pierson. No, it\rquote s not short for Leonard or Leonardo or anything. It\rquote 
s just Leo. I don\rquote t even qualify for a proper name....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Leo!\'94 Sirius said sharply, but after a moment, Harry could see that he was smiling behind his eyes. This was clearly Leo\rquote 
s routine; the Lament of the Forgotten Middle Child. Like Orion, he had dark hair and eyes, but his face still had some baby fat that Orion had lost now
 that he was eleven. He was several inches shorter than his brother and Harry guessed he was around nine years old.
\par 
\par Finally, from behind her brothers, the little sister emerged. She looked up at him with the strangest eyes Harry had ever seen; instead of being dark, like her brothers\rquote 
, they were so pale the irises almost blended into the whites. She had the same dark hair as her brothers, though, and dimples in her heart-shaped face when she smiled. He guessed she was around seven years old.
\par 
\par \'93Mercedes Pierson,\'94 she said simply, extending her hand. Harry shook it solemnly; he\rquote d never seen such a grave little girl. \'93Are you going to be my new big brother? Or a cousin?\'94
\par 
\par Harry looked at Sirius, his eyebrows raised. \'93Harry\rquote s neither, Mercy. He\rquote s my godson and a member of this household now, and he\rquote ll always be an honourary member of the Black family and of Clan Lamont, but no, he\rquote 
s not your brother or cousin.\'94
\par 
\par Her mouth twisted and she looked at Harry appraisingly; he fought not to squirm. It was very odd to be looked at so by such a small child. Even being the big brother in his other life hadn\rquote t prepared him for this. \'93So then; you can\rquote 
t boss us around?\'94 she said, crossing her arms.
\par 
\par \'93Ah, is that it?\'94 Sirius said, smiling and mussing her hair with his hand. \'93Don\rquote t get any ideas,\'94 he said more sternly now. \'93Harry counts as one of the grownups, and you have to listen to him just as you listen to any of us.\'94
 Somehow, by the look on Sirius\rquote  face, Harry was doubting that she paid much heed to anyone. \'93Your parents have ultimate authority over you, of course, but you\rquote 
ll mind Harry just as you mind your Nana or Granddad or me or Aunt Cass; you don\rquote t give any adult reason to speak to your parents about your behavior, understand?\'94
\par 
\par She looked meek and abashed now as she said quietly, \'93Yes, Uncle Sirius.\'94 Yet Harry thought he saw a twinkle in those odd, pale eyes. Was it an act, this meekness? He knew she\rquote 
d be one to watch. Or rather, he thought, he should watch his back.
\par 
\par It took some doing, figuring out who was going to
 sleep where. Sirius gave the guest room to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Ron and Draco were going to kip on the couches in the sitting room, Sirius gave his room to Maggie and Ginny, so he would be bunking with Harry, and Katie was going to share with Mercy. Exc
ept for Ron and Draco, everyone carried their luggage up the winding stairs, groaning with exhaustion. They weren\rquote t able to stop on the first floor up from the ground floor, as the bedrooms there belonged to Sirius\rquote 
 eldest sister and her husband (Who were childless) and his mother and father.
\par 
\par The infamous Cassiopeia stood in her bedroom doorway, surveying the ragtag collection of visitors that had invaded her home. She was wearing wizarding robes, deep purple ones that shimmered with a hint of sapphire blue
. Her hair and eyes were as dark as Sirius\rquote 
, but her look was very sharp and critical, her bearing regal as any Italian Countess. After some very brief and disturbing eye-contact, Harry avoided her gaze as Sirius introduced him on the way past. She nodded,
 her judgmental expression never wavering. Harry allowed himself to shiver when he was well away from her.
\par 
\par Sirius\rquote  parents, on the other hand, were warm and kind. His father was an amazing repeat of Sirius, but with a shock of perfectly white hair and eye
s that crinkled when he smiled--which seemed to be all the time. Harry had trouble retrieving his hand, it seemed Mr. Black wanted to shake it all night, he was so pleased Harry had come.
\par 
\par Mrs. Black made him think of the grandmother he\rquote d always wanted. That was one thing he hadn\rquote t had in his other life, either: grandparents. She wasn\rquote t much shorter than him, and hadn\rquote 
t shrunken with age. She was a handsome woman with dark hair touched by just a bit of silver, beautiful smile lines that a
ccentuated her high cheekbones, and sparkling blue eyes that reminded Harry of Dumbledore. She hugged him warmly, whispering in his ear, \'93Thank you so much for helping our lad come home!\'94
 There were tears in her voice, and Harry could not reply; he smiled bashfully at her before trudging upward.
\par 
\par Katie was able to stop on the second floor, which was where the children had their rooms. When Katie was being led to her room by Mercy, Harry heard Mercy saying to her, \'93I read the paper, even if my brothers don\rquote t. You said your name\rquote 
s Katie Bell? You\rquote re Harry Potter\rquote s girlfriend, aren\rquote t you?\'94 Katie looked over her shoulder and mouthed HELP at Harry, who grinned at her as he continued up the stairs with his trunk. Clearly, Mercy wasn\rquote t going to show any.

\par 
\par Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were finally able to stop on the third floor, where the guest room was. Sirius\rquote 
 sister Ursula and her husband also had a bedroom on this floor. She immediately started dashing about helping the Weasleys feel at home, and Harry could see what Cass could have been if she\rquote d ever bothered to smile. Ursula had the same dimples she
\rquote d given her daughter, the same heart-shaped face. She gave Harry a warm hug, like her mother, and he knew she didn\rquote t resent his coming to live in their home. Her husband wa
s very nice as well, and Harry saw now where Mercy had gotten her strange light eyes. He squeezed past them down the stairs, to see that his children were tucked in, even as the travelers continued upward.
\par 
\par Harry\rquote s and Sirius\rquote  rooms were on the top floor. Sirius retrieved some clothes from his room and then left to give the Weasley sisters some privacy; when he returned to Harry\rquote 
s room, he had that expression on his face Harry had seen earlier.
\par 
\par \'93Are you all right?\'94 Harry asked him, his brow furrowed. Sirius looked up, startled.
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94 He shook himself for a moment, then continued bustling around the room. \'93Oh. I\rquote m fine. Fine.\'94
\par 
\par Harry looked around the room appreciatively. The whitewashed walls smelled of fresh paint, there was an enormous four-poster hung
 with blue velvet curtains with a matching blue coverlet, a massive Persian carpet in shades of blue and gold and cream softening the hard stone floor, and across from the bed was a large semi-circular bay window with a blue-velvet-upholstered window seat
 
looking down into the courtyard. Harry also had a massive carved oak wardrobe, a dresser with a mirror and two built-in candle holders, a desk and some bookshelves. In the corner near the bed was a small fireplace; large enough for conversations, too smal
l for transport. Harry had seen, however, that the sitting room fire was big enough to use for getting around on the Floo network. That\rquote s good, he thought; someone couldn\rquote 
t just come walking into his bedroom from the fire. On the other hand, someone\rquote s head could just pop into the fire and start talking to him....He didn\rquote 
t know for certain that this fireplace was on the network, though. Perhaps he would ask for it to be taken off if it was.
\par 
\par After Sirius showed him his en suite bathroom, they went back down to the kitchen for a late supper. Before going down, Harry stopped in the doorway of the room Maggie and Ginny were sharing. They were sitting on the bed, talking excitedly. He couldn
\rquote t remember when he\rquote d seen Ginny looking happier, and he couldn\rquote t help the
 smile that crept across his face as he looked at her. Then Ginny looked up and met his gaze; she smiled at him with such a mix of gratitude and just plain being glad to see him that his heart turned over, and he wanted to freeze that moment in time, just
 seeing her look at him like that forever.
\par 
\par Without warning, she sprang across the room and launched herself at him. He held her to him convulsively, as she cried, \'93Oh, Harry, thank you so much! If it weren\rquote t for you--\'94
\par 
\par Harry met Maggie\rquote s eye then; she looked back at him knowingly and gave him a small sympathetic smile. She could tell how he felt about Ginny--maybe it showed in one of his auras?--but she knew, of course, that Draco was Ginny\rquote 
s boyfriend. There was a touch of sadness in her eyes.
\par 
\par Sirius tou
ched him on the shoulder and he jumped away from Ginny guiltily, half-expecting to see Draco Malfoy. They followed him down the stairs, picking up the others on the way. Draco and Ron were already in the kitchen, eating cold chicken, sliced tomatoes and b
read and butter. Sirius put out plates and utensils and everyone else helped themselves to the food, which included fresh strawberries to finish. It was a merry late-summer-evening feast, and when they\rquote 
d picked the two chicken carcasses clean and gone through two loaves of bread and polished off all of the tomatoes and strawberries, the yawning starting to become an epidemic, and they went back up to their rooms again.
\par 
\par Harry looked longingly after Ginny, disappearing into the other room on the top floor with her sister, before turning to his own. Sirius looked at him with one eyebrow raised. \'93I thought you had a new girlfriend. Anything you\rquote d like to tell me?
\'94
\par 
\par Harry grimaced. \'93Not right now, thanks,\'94 he said. It was strange; once he thought he could tell Si
rius anything. Now he wanted to see Severus Snape to talk to him; he was so used to going to his stepfather, in his other life. It seemed odd to turn to anyone else. \'93I\rquote m knackered; maybe tomorrow?\'94
 he said to Sirius. He needed to start thinking of Sirius as the one he could talk to, he realized. He needed to make an effort; Sirius had opened his home to him, had done so much for him. \'93And you can tell me about Wormtail\rquote s confession.\'94

\par 
\par Sirius nodded. \'93Fair enough.\'94
\par 
\par Suddenly, there was a light rapping on the door and Harry went to answer it. It was Katie. \'93Well, don\rquote t look so glad to see me or anything,\'94 she said shrewdly, noticing the way his expression of anticipation changed when he saw who it was.

\par 
\par \'93It\rquote s not--I mean, I was--I\rquote m surprised to see you up here....\'94
\par 
\par \'93After last night? Or this morning, I should say....\'94
\par 
\par Harry looked around nervously. \'93I can\rquote t--I mean, we can\rquote t--Sirius is--\'94 he whispered awkwardly.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, I\rquote m not here to crawl into bed with you. I mean, having ghosts in bed with you is one thing; your godfather is quite another.\'94 Her eyes twinkled at him and he laughed. \'93I just came upstairs to say goodnight properly.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well,\'94 Sirius said suddenly at Harry\rquote s elbow, making him jump. \'93That\rquote s my cue to disappear for a few minutes, I believe.\'94 He winked at Harry and moved toward the bathroom.
\par 
\par \'93Oh! Sirius--you don\rquote t have to--\'94
\par 
\par But the door to the bathroom had already closed and they were suddenly standing alone in his new room. Katie walked to the large window seat, then sat down. \'93This is fantastic, isn\rquote t it? Practically another bed...\'94
\par 
\par She smiled mischievously at Harry and he sat next to her, looking out at the summer night. One of the narrow leaded casement windows was open slightly, and a cool breeze touched Harry\rquote s 
face as he looked out at the stars. My new home, he thought, the idea still very odd to him. He\rquote d had a new home the moment he\rquote d arrived in his other life, the previous September, but it was actually a home where he\rquote 
d lived for over ten years, so technically it wasn\rquote t. He was beginning a new life.
\par 
\par He looked down at the girl sitting next to him, the girl with whom he\rquote d shared a bed just that morning. He idly pushed her hair behind one ear, looking at her fondly, then leaned in to kiss her goodnight. After a few moments, she pushed him away.

\par 
\par \'93Don\rquote t do that, Harry.\'94
\par 
\par He looked at her, bewildered. \'93Don\rquote t do what?\'94
\par 
\par She looked at him grimly. \'93Kiss me out of obligation, or guilt. I mean--\'94 She looked frustrated at not being able to communicate her thoughts adequately. \'93Don\rquote 
t attach more meaning to this morning than--than just two people who like each other and like spending time together having--fun. All right?\'94
\par 
\par Harry swallowed. Was she trying to keep from being hurt? The truth was he did feel obliged to kiss her, and considering that she\rquote d come up two flights just for the purpose, he was feeling a little cross now.
\par 
\par \'93Well, you did come up here for this, didn\rquote t you?\'94 he said irritably.
\par 
\par \'93For a simple we\rquote re-still-having-fun-aren\rquote t-we kiss. Not an oh-god-here-comes-the-ball-and-chain-kiss. Or are you trying to make me feel about forty?\'94
\par 
\par \'93No, I--\'94 But suddenly, she\rquote d leaned in and captured his lips with hers again, her soft mouth opening gently under his, the taste of her minty toothpaste on his hard palate....
\par 
\par He slid his hand into her soft hair now, pulling her head closer, forgetting his trepidation. When they both pulled back from the kiss, Katie smiled gently at him. \'93There now. That\rquote s why I came upstairs.\'94
\par 
\par He was holding her against him now, her small body wrapped in a lightweight dressing gown over a thin T-shirt. Harry\rquote s mouth grew dry as he remembered being with her that morning....
\par 
\par After a few minutes, she forced herself to stand and kissed him on the forehead, next to his scar. \'93Now I can go to sleep. Good night, Harry,\'94 she smiled at him.
\par 
\par As she walked toward the door, he couldn\rquote t help look at her legs beneath the hem of the rather short dressing gown. \'93Good night, Katie,\'94 he said absently, watching those legs disappear.
\par 
\par Sirius emerged from the bathroom; he had a glimpse of Katie in the hall, before she started going down the stairs again. He closed the door, smiling. He was wearing pajama bottoms and drying his face with small towel.
\par 
\par \'93I was starting to think I was going to wind up on the floor in the sitting room, with Draco and Ron....\'94
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94 Harry said at first; when Sirius raised his eyebrows at him, he understood. \'93Oh; someone must have told you about this morning.\'94
\par 
\par His godfather nodded. \'93Ron. He called it \lquote Harry\rquote s habit.\rquote  I suppose you don\rquote t want to talk about that yet, either.\'94
\par 
\par Harry rolled his eyes. Ron. \'93Not even remotely.\'94
\par 
\par Sirius grinned at him. \'93That\rquote s all right; neither do I. Your turn in the bathroom.\'94
\par 
\par Harry washed up and changed into pajama pants, finding Sirius fast asleep and snoring when he returned. He climbed into the enormous bed, which could have slept four small or three large people, and he was asleep before his head hit the pillow.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par After all of the anticipation, Harry\rquote s seventeenth birthday passed in a whirl of activity. When it was all over, he felt almost as though he\rquote 
d hallucinated it all. Although Ascog Castle had five floors of living space above the ground, and two levels of dungeons below, it wasn\rquote t very spacious, since the large square courtyard took up a good deal of room in the corner of the property
\rquote s footprint. Sirius explained to him in the morning that it was more properly called a tower house, but many mere tower houses had long gone by the title \lquote Castle.\rquote  Ascog was
 tiny at a mere forty-two feet on a side. And yet, it seemed to Harry, it must have been magically enlarged to hold so many people for his birthday party.
\par 
\par There was a constant stream of guests coming and going in the kitchen, sitting room, courtyard, up and down the stairs, on the roof patio, and even in the dungeons (The lower dungeon level had a magically heated swimming pool). More and more people seemed
 
to be arriving as the day progressed; walking out of the fireplace in the sitting room, coming up the stairs from the dungeon after Apparating. (Sirius had appointed one of the empty cells down there as the approved Apparition point--and you had to leave 
the cell very quickly in case of others arriving right after you).}{\f1\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par Hermione surprised him by arriving on the roof by Portkey and then walking down the stairs to the landing outside his room just as he was leaving to get breakfast. \'93Harry!\'94 she cried, throw
ing her arms around him. He held her closely; she was deeply tanned and her short curls were touched by the sun. After hugging her he backed up and looked at her.
\par 
\par \'93Hermione--you look fabulous! How\rquote s--all the training going?\'94
\par 
\par Then he practically fell over in shock when Professor McGonagall walked down the stairs from the roof as well. \'93I suppose I shouldn\rquote t be surprised that Potter knows about that?\'94
 she said sharply, looking as stern as she did at school, until Harry noticed a smile twisting the corner of her mouth. She turned to Harry. \'93She\rquote s doing very well. I\rquote 
ve been looking forward to teaching her this ever since her first year....I just had a feeling about her...\'94
\par 
\par Harry tried not to sound too upset, but it was difficult. \'93You never said that about me.\'94
\par 
\par McGonagall actually displayed a full, rare smile now. \'93When you perform beyond anyone\rquote s expectations, Harry,\'94 she said, using his first name now, \'93You have the advantage. When everyone has high expectations, there\rquote 
s far more to live up to.\'94
\par 
\par Hermione a
nd Professor McGonagall joined them for breakfast, which had to be eaten in installments, as there were so many people in the house now. When they entered the kitchen, the Weasleys were still sitting at the table, and Mrs. Weasley said, "Oh, hello Minerva
! I didn't know we'd be seeing you. And hello, Hermione, dear. How are you?"
\par 
\par But Hermione never had a chance to answer, because Maggie rose and walked around the table slowly. "You're Hermione?" she whispered. Hermione looked at her, swallowing.
\par 
\par "I don't have to ask who you are," she said softly, as the older woman enfolded her in a hug. Then Molly put her hand over her mouth.
\par 
\par "Oh, my stars, that's right--you also--you--you--"
\par 
\par Hermione saved her the trouble of getting up and came to her to give her a hug.
\par 
\par "I can't thank you enough," Mrs. Weasley started to say, dabbing at her eyes.
\par 
\par Then Ron entered the kitchen from the entrance hall and Hermione looked at him lovingly. "You don't have to," she told his mother quietly.
\par 
\par When Ron saw her, he hesitated for
 a moment, but then ran to him and threw her arms around him, and he held her carefully, trying not to hurt her, and Harry could see his heart on his face. He suddenly felt very protective of them both. Nothing must happen to them, he thought. Nothing mus
t tear them apart.
\par 
\par But soon Ron was joking around again, his arm lightly around Hermione, and they were all laughing, laughing, for so much of the day, Harry\rquote s face started hurting. He couldn\rquote 
t help grinning as each new friend or teacher appeared. Hagrid had some difficulty emerging from the fireplace, and Harry thought he would break the mantle. More school friends began to appear: Neville, Parvati and Padma, Seamus, Dean (Who\rquote 
d been staying with Seamus\rquote  family, and used the Finnigan fireplace for transport, as Seamus had), the crowd from Hog\rquote 
s End (Including Lee, whom Katie greeted quite naturally), other Gryffindors, including Will Flitwick, who looked around for Jamaica Thomas, disappointed when he didn\rquote 
t see her. His great uncle, little Professor Flitwick came, as well as Professor Sprout. Alastor Moody came right after his sister, Arabella. She looked annoyed by the noise in the rather full house, but that was nothing new to Harry. In his e
xperience, the only noise Mrs. Figg didn\rquote t mind was the sound of her own bellowing voice.
\par 
\par Then when he emerged from the fireplace, Harry wanted to run and hug him, but he forced himself instead to extend his hand, grinning at the normally stern Potions Ma
ster, who had undergone some sort of transformation in the month since Harry had last seen him. He looked as though he\rquote 
d decided to model himself on the Severus Snape Harry had shown him in the Pensieve. His hair was shorter and pulled back into a ponytail
, he had a closely-trimmed beard and mustache defining the planes of his gaunt face, and he was wearing what looked like new robes, in a strangely shimmering material that sometimes looked grey and sometimes silver, and where the light hit the fabric, the
re was a slight rainbow effect.
\par 
\par Severus Snape gave him a lopsided grin as he took his hand; then Harry looked down in shock. \'93Your hands! They\rquote re all right!\'94
\par 
\par He held up his large hands and waggled his ten perfect fingers. \'93The miracle of magical medicine. Rather painful to grow back, but fingers are at least possible. They\rquote re small. Larger limbs are another story of course. And I don\rquote 
t have full feeling in these yet,\'94 he said, indicating the smallest fingers on each hand. \'93That\rquote s supposed to improve over time.\'94 He stopped abruptly and stared, a perplexed look on his face.
\par 
\par \'93How--who--?\'94
\par 
\par Harry turned. Maggie was standing in the sitting room doorway, looking at Severus Snape with a dumbstruck expression on her face. It reminded Harry of how shocked Hermione had been by the sight of young Snape in the Pensieve.
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s one of Ginny\rquote s long-lost sisters. Do you remember hearing about it? In 1979--\'94
\par 
\par \'93I remember,\'94 he said quickly, stopping Harry, never taking his eyes from her. \'93I remember it well.\'94 Harry didn\rquote t ask him to elaborate; clearly, everyone who was around then remembered the case of the missing Weasley sisters.
\par 
\par Maggie walked unsteadily over to Harry and said, looking at Severus Snape the entire time, \'93Aren\rquote t you going to introduce me, Harry?\'94
\par 
\par Harry did, but he wasn\rquote t entirely certain she or his professor had heard anything he said; their eyes seemed to be locked by a beam of light. They wandered out of the room together and Harry wondered where Sirius was.
\par 
\par Then Remus Lupin emerged from the fire, brushing off his usual shabby robes, and Harry greeted him with a hug. \'93Happy birthday, Harry!\'94 he said, grinning.
\par 
\par Harry grinned back. \'93So far it is,\'94 he said cautiously; he almost felt like things were going too well, like something had to go wrong soon or he\rquote 
d think he was dreaming. People were filling every room in the house, it seemed, walking around with bottles of butterbeer and plates of finger food, chatting and laughing. Someone had turned on the wireless, the sound wafting out of the windows, and peo
ple were dancing in the courtyard. The children ran around the adults\rquote  legs, playing games, and Harry stood back, watching it all happily, enjoying the chaos of his birthday party.
\par 
\par Finally, just before they were attempting to get everyone together to sing
, Professor Dumbledore arrived. He walked calmly up the dungeon stairs from the Apparition point. Harry was passing from the sitting room into the kitchen, getting some more butterbeer, and he stopped in shock when he saw him.
\par 
\par \'93Professor!\'94
\par 
\par The old man smiled broadly at Harry. \'93Happy birthday, Harry. Ah, I see the festivities are in full swing. Good, good. It\rquote s not every day you turn seventeen, after all.\'94
\par 
\par Harry felt their number was complete now. Soon he was standing in the middle of the throng in the courtyard, the cake on a small table before him as they all sang, \'93For he\rquote s a jolly good fellow, for he\rquote s a jolly good fellow, for he
\rquote s a jolly good feh-eh-LO! And so say all of us!\'94
\par 
\par And then there was cheering and backslapping and too many girls kissing him for him to keep track, and slices of cake being passed around....As the whirl continued, Harry became dimly aware that the crowd was becoming smaller and 
smaller, until finally, as the sun was going down, and torches flared to life on the walls of the courtyard and also inside the house, they were almost reduced again to the people who\rquote 
d slept at Ascog the night before. The only others who remained were Snape, Lupin, Hermione and the Weasleys.
\par 
\par Once the crowd had thinned, Harry became aware of the pile of presents in the corner of the courtyard. He waved his hand at them. \'93These can\rquote t be--are these--\'94
\par 
\par Ron grinned at him, his arm draped casually around Hermione\rquote s shoulders now and her arm around his waist. She looked happier than Harry had ever seen her. \'93That\rquote s right, mate. They\rquote re for you. Thought you\rquote 
d never notice. Ever planning to open them?\'94
\par 
\par Ginny and Draco and Katie had come over, plus Snape and Sirius and Lupin. through the kitchen windows, Harry could see Maggie sitting at the kitchen table, talking to her parents, Bill and Charlie (Who had arrived when Harry wasn\rquote 
t looking), the twins (Plus Angelina) and Percy, all of whom had been completely shocked to see her. Bill and Charlie had been completely overwhelmed and had gone through the house hunting Harry down. For a few minutes, they wouldn\rquote 
t stop hugging him and shaking his hand. The Weasleys had stayed together in small clumps all during the party, talking non-stop, repairing their family and starting to make up for the seventeen years of Maggie\rquote s absence.
\par 
\par Harry strode over to the pile of gifts, not knowing where to begin, but suddenly Sandy was hissing to him.
\par 
\par \'93News comes on the wing,\'94 she said softly. Harry had to strain to hear her over the voices of the others; he squinted in concentration and tilted his head to one side. Then he happened to look up and meet Ron\rquote s and Hermione\rquote s eyes.

\par 
\par They came closer to him, and Ron whispered to him, \'93What is it, Harry?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Nothing, really. I think an owl will be coming soon. Sandy said.\'94
\par 
\par \'93An owl for whom?\'94 Hermione whispered. Harry shrugged, then gestured with his head at the others. The three of them broke up their little conference, trying to look natural a
bout this, and Harry looked again at the presents. He noticed an oblong package, and extracted it from the pile. Most of it was very thin, but it widened at one end. He looked up, smiling at everyone. \'93I think I can guess what this is,\'94
 he said, opening it, and finding a beautiful, gleaming new Firebolt 2.
\par 
\par \'93Now, I expect you to take care of this one, Harry,\'94 Sirius said, breaking down into a smile, unable to maintain his stern facade. Next to him, Snape bristled.
\par 
\par \'93The last one was destroyed in a good cause,\'94 he said archly. Yes, thought Harry, it was.
\par 
\par Sirius laughed. \'93I thought that\rquote s why you wouldn\rquote t mind contributing a bit toward it.\'94
\par 
\par "Well, actually," Harry reminded him, "I shouldn't have had you get that Firebolt Excelsior for me at the end of last t
erm. It was always going off half-cocked, and then when I gave Ron a chance to ride it, before he could even get on, it went flying up into the clouds and was gone."
\par 
\par Sirius frowned. "That model was experimental. This one has the kinks worked out."
\par 
\par Harry looked round, frowning. \'93So--who is this one from, really?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, you know how I said your first Firebolt was something like thirteen years\rquote  worth of birthdays and Christmases? I couldn\rquote t very well do that again so soon--I\rquote d be cleaned out of all m
y savings. But Severus here generously contributed, as you were saving his arse when your last one was ruined, and Remus did too, as well as Arabella, Alastor, Fletcher, your other professors--including Dumbledore--Aberforth, and Katie\rquote s dad.\'94

\par 
\par Harry\rquote s jaw dropped. \'93You\rquote re joking,\'94
 he said weakly, staring again at the beautiful deep brown mahogany handle, gleaming in the bright torchlight with its iron-hard finish, the name emblazoned on the broad part near the end in gold paint edged in red, also protected under the finish. He
\rquote d never seen a more beautiful broom in his entire life.
\par 
\par \'93So,\'94 Sirius said, watching his rapture happily, \'93The next time you have to go rescue some excuse for a Potions Master, you take a school broom and save that one for winning the Quidditch World Cup--\'94
\par 
\par Even Snape laughed at that; Harry thought it was wonderful to see him do it, something he remembered well from his other life. He said, \'93At the rate I\rquote ve gone through brooms, maybe I should go to work for a broom company after I\rquote m 
done school; then I\rquote ll be guaranteed a steady supply.\'94
 He suddenly stopped. Hey, he thought. That was actually not a bad idea. Apply to work at a broom company. Develop new brooms. It definitely had appeal for him, as much as he loved flying. He wasn\rquote t so 
sure about the World Cup, though, especially after finding out his father had played for England; he remembered what McGonagall had said about expectations.
\par 
\par Before he could get to another present, though, a sudden flurry of owls crowding the bit of twilit
 sky above them caused them all to look up. The birds began to drop squares of parchment into the hands of the people in the courtyard, and a few flew through the windows into the kitchen, bringing their burdens to the twins, Percy, and Angelina, who was 
also sitting with them. When the owls had flown off again, Harry looked at his, perplexed; it was a large creamy square with his name written on the front in a loopy script he didn\rquote 
t recognize. He looked up and saw the others opening theirs. All of the envelopes looked the same except for the different names on the fronts. Sirius didn\rquote t have one, he noticed. Neither did Hermione.
\par 
\par Katie was first to get hers open. Her eyes went wide. Then she opened another envelope that had been inside the larger one. This 
one was smaller and lighter. As she read the letter in this envelope, her face went rigid with anger. She looked up now, waving her letter indignantly.
\par

\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par Harry stared at Katie with his mouth open. \'93Katie!\'94 he finally said in shock. Realizing that everyone was staring at her, she reddened and looked up.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, um--did I say that out loud?\'94 she replied, her voice suddenly taking on a much meeker tone as she looked around, more than a little embarrassed.
\par 
\par Harry moved quickly to put his arm around her shoulder. \'93What\rquote s wrong?\'94 he wanted to know. By now the twins and Angelina had emerged from the house, waving their envelopes in agitation.
\par 
\par \'93Can you believe her?\'94 Angelina was saying to Katie, her voice squeaking. Angelina never squeaked.
\par 
\par \'93I am not standing up with that bugger,\'94 said Fred.
\par 
\par \'93No way,\'94 George agreed.
\par 
\par Harry was still holding his envelope. He took his arm from around Katie and quickly tore the envelope open, finding a slightly smaller interior envelope with a stiff card inside. He couldn\rquote t believe what was printed on the card:

\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par Then he saw that, like Katie, he had another smaller envelope. In this one there was a hand-written note from Alicia.
\par 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Dear Harry,
\par 
\par I know this is dreadfully short notice, but as you can see from the invitation, I\rquote 
m getting married. I wanted to have my old classmates and Quidditch teammates stand up with me, and Roger wanted his mates. That started to seem like quite a lot of attendants, so we agre
ed I would ask the women and he would ask the men. Well, none of the Ravenclaw men he asked would do it. They all made excuses of one sort or another. His dad\rquote 
s standing up with him as his best man, in place of his brother, so that would leave him with no other groomsmen and me with a passel of bridesmaids and no one to escort them.
\par 
\par So I convinced Roger to let me get the groomsmen too, and he asked some of his female teammates to be bridesmaids as a compromise. One of them actually said she would do it. Also, I had to agree to a female relative of his being my maid-of-honour, even th
ough I won\rquote t be meeting her until the day before the ceremony! I\rquote ve been pulling my hair out over this--I can\rquote t believe how difficult it\rquote s been. That\rquote s why I\rquote 
m so late in sending this to you. It was about time to send the invitations, so I thought I\rquote d send this request along too.
\par 
\par Please, please, PLEASE say you\rquote ll be a groomsman, Harry. I know Roger probably isn\rquote t your favourite person, but I always thought you and I were friends. (It was so good of you to come to read to my class last term). I do hope you w
ill respond by saying \lquote yes.\rquote 
\par 
\par Hopefully,
\par 
\par Alicia
\par 
\par P.S. The party after will be at my parents\rquote  estate in Sywell, which isn\rquote t far off Kettering. You--along with the rest of the wedding party--are invited to stay for the week before the ceremony. It\rquote s the least I can do since I\rquote 
ve asked you to help me and Roger so late in the game. Do say you\rquote ll come?
\par 
\par --A.
\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par Harry looked up at the others in shock. \'93She wants me to be a groomsman,\'94 he said, knowing that the others would know what he meant, as they were all reading the invitations too. Katie waved hers around some more.
\par 
\par \'93Not one word,\'94 Katie said now, sounding very irritated again. \'93I was just in Hogsmeade, and I saw her! We had dinner together, and for two hours she never said a thing. I thought they hated each
 other. He was seeing that French girl! Now she wants me to be a bridesmaid and watch her marry that--that--\'94
\par 
\par \'93And me,\'94 Angelina added. \'93Plus she wants Fred and George to be groomsmen as well. And she wants me to run around and do all of the things the maid-of-honour would do, since Roger\rquote s aunt or cousin or whoever she is can\rquote 
t do it, but I\rquote m still not going to actually be the maid-of-honour!\'94 Angelina was livid; Harry had never seen her so angry.
\par 
\par Ginny frowned; she had a personal note from Alicia, too. \'93Did you see the list of attendants?\'94 she asked no one in particular. Harry turned his letter over; it was written on the back.
\par 
\par Best man: Ambrose Davies
\par Maid-of-honor: Bronwen Davies

\par 
\par Harry\rquote s jaw dropped. No. He could not walk down the aisle of a church with Cho Chang on his arm, not after being responsible for two of her boyfriends being dead. Well, that solved the mystery of the identity of the female Ravenclaw player who
\rquote d agreed to be in the wedding party. And then there was the not-so-small matter of his part in the death of Roger\rquote s brother Evan.... \'93I--I can\rquote t be paired with Cho--\'94 he said slowly, incredulous.
\par 
\par \'93Well, she\rquote s paired me with Lee!\'94 Katie exclaimed.
\par 
\par \'93And she\rquote s put my girlfriend with my brother!\'94 George cried indignantly. \'93No offense, Fred, but--\'94
\par 
\par Fred looked at his copy of the list, his mouth twisting. \'93Perhaps she thought it would be funny to pair up former boyfriends and girlfriends?\'94 he guessed; he actually did sound a bit amused to Harry. \'93I\rquote m glad she put me with you, though,
\'94 he said lightly to Angelina. \'93We\rquote ve always got on well, before and after dating. It could have been really bad for me; Yarrow and I broke up after a dreadful row.\'94
\par 
\par George rolled his eyes. \'93Brilliant. And as your double, I\rquote ll be right next to her, reminding her that she\rquote s still hacked off at you. C\rquote mon, Fred, no one will know if we swap. Angelina\rquote 
s the only one who can ever tell us apart. You take your lumps from Yarrow and let me be with my girl...\'94
 Somewhere along the line, the twins seemed to have changed their minds and were now planning to be in the wedding party. Harry wondered who had turned Roger down. How do you turn away a friend who asks you to stand up with him at his wedding? Evidently, 
a number of Ravenclaws had found a way.
\par 
\par Katie looked up at Harry hopefully. \'93Maybe it wouldn\rquote t be so bad if we could convince her to redo the pairings. I don\rquote t see how I could possibly do this otherwise...\'94 Harry didn\rquote t say so, but he heartily agreed. Exc
ept--he looked down at the list and saw that Ginny was a bridesmaid too. If there was a particular bridesmaid I\rquote d like to be paired with...
\par 
\par \'93Ow!\'94 Hermione cried suddenly, staggering as a rather large package struck her on the head. Ron caught her arm to s
teady her and check to see that she was all right. Another owl had unexpectedly flown into the courtyard with the package that had fallen on her. It lay at her feet now, and Harry could see that her name was written on the brown paper covering the flat re
ctangular box. He looked up; as it flew off, the owl appeared to be very relieved to be rid of its burden. It resembled the other owls that had delivered the invitations. If it also came from Alicia, he reasoned, the heavy load must have caused the delay.

\par 
\par Rubbing her head, Hermione knelt on the ground to rip the paper off the box and open it. Lying on top of a stack of papers in the box was another wedding invitation. Under that was a smaller envelope with Hermione\rquote s name in Alicia\rquote 
s flowing handwriting. Hermione withdrew the letter from this envelope and read, her jaw dropping as Katie\rquote s had done.
\par 
\par \'93She--she wants me to play the cello at the wedding. Listen to this, \lquote I know it\rquote s dreadfully short notice, but I\rquote ve heard from Katie how wonderfully you play and
 hope you will do this favour for a fellow Gryffindor, one Head Girl to another.\rquote \'94
\par 
\par Hermione bent over the box again. \'93I don\rquote t believe it. She\rquote s sent music. She just assumed...\'94
\par 
\par "What?" Ron exclaimed, indignant on her behalf.
\par 
\par "The nerve," Angelina breathed incredulously.
\par 
\par They were all positively reeling; Alicia couldn\rquote t have jolted them all more if she\rquote d sent wedding invitations that were also howlers. Katie looked at Harry now.
\par 
\par \'93So--are you going to do it?\'94
\par 
\par He looked at her seriously, aware of Ginny out of the corner of his eye. \'93I--I suppose. I\rquote m still a bit shocked, of course. I never thought when I saw her and Roger in her classroom last spring that--\'94
\par 
\par He froze. Everyone was dead silent, staring at him. Damn, he thought. Know when to keep your mouth shut, Potter.
\par 
\par "Saw them?" Angelina said suspiciously.
\par 
\par "Saw them how?" Katie wanted to know. Harry felt cornered.
\par 
\par "Erm--they were kissing and then they Disapparated," he said in a rush, half-hoping no one would be able to understand him.
\par 
\par \'93You knew?\'94 Katie cried, her voice going up.
\par 
\par \'93I thought Fleur was your friend, too,\'94 Ginny said quietly now. Harry looked at her, feeling very, very small. Right, he thought, remembering Fleur asking him in the corridor of the school whether he\rquote d seen Roger.
\par 
\par Not a person around him didn\rquote t look shocked except for Severus Snape, who actually looked slightly amused.
\par 
\par \'93Harry,\'94 Hermione said, shaking her head. \'93I\rquote m surprised at you....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well--well--\'94 he sputtered. \'93It was Alicia! I feel like she\rquote s more my friend than Fleur is, frankly. I was rather surprised they were together, but it didn\rquote t seem like it was any of my business....\'94
\par 
\par Hermione seemed to be thinking along another track now. \'93They never got on when they were Head Girl and Head Boy. Who could have seen this coming?\'94
\par 
\par Upon this everyone agreed. The party had come to a logical conclusion, and they all moved indoors to sit around the kitchen table. Mrs. Weasley, as it turned out, was rather excited about the wedding.
\par 
\par \'93Oh,\'94 Hermione said brightly, \'93Were you invited too, Mrs. Weasley?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, no dear, but do you know how rarely I\rquote ve seen my boys in formal dress robes? I want to take a picture when you get them, Fred and George, and don\rquote t try to squirm out of it. I never did ge
t a photograph of the pair of you at the Yule Ball in your sixth year.\'94
\par 
\par Hermione poured herself some cold water from a pitcher on the table before sitting. \'93Oh, I doubt they\rquote ll be wearing dress robes, Mrs. Weasley. Alicia\rquote s muggle-born, and the wedding\rquote s at a church in Kettering. They\rquote 
ll probably be in muggle formalwear.\'94
\par 
\par Fred and George looked at each other in horror. Harry fought the urge to laugh. Katie sat next to him and gave him a look.
\par 
\par \'93Hmm. Now, that doesn\rquote t sound so bad. You\rquote ll look nice all dressed up, Harry....\'94 she said, a glimmer in her eye that made him swallow.
\par 
\par \'93Meanwhile,\'94 Angelina intoned ominously, \'93We will be wearing the bridesmaid dresses from hell, no doubt. Can\rquote t have anyone in the wedding party outshining the bride on her \lquote special day.\rquote \'94
\par 
\par Ginny\rquote s face fell. \'93Oh. Do you think they\rquote ll be very bad?\'94 she asked Angelina.
\par 
\par \'93Bad?\'94 Angelina said, sounding like she was just getting started. \'93Last summer I was in the wedding of my cousin Charlotte, who married a muggle. And she had us wearing these things that made us look like giant walking bowls of trifle!\'94
\par 
\par \'93But you were such a charming giant walking bowl of trifle,\'94 George said, starting to laugh and just barely managing to stifle it. \'93Which, face it, is better than a giant walking blancma
nge, which is what the bride looked like. And then there was that thing on your head--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--Like the cherry on top of the whipped cream!\'94 Angelina told Ginny, who looked even more horrified. George couldn\rquote t take it anymore and began laughing in earnest, and Fred as well. Angelina whirled on them both. \'93And you!\'94
 she said testily to George. \'93Leave all merchandise at home. Honestly! It\rquote s a good thing Charlotte\rquote s best friend is an Obliviator--\'94
\par 
\par Mrs. Weasley looked sternly at George. \'93What did you do?\'94
\par 
\par George smiled feebly at her and shrugged. \'93I just took a few Canary Creams. I only meant them for the witches and wizards. I knew there were muggles there. I didn\rquote 
t mean for them to have any, honestly. I was just hoping to drum up more business. A social event like that is good for making contacts. It\rquote s not my fault, is it, that the groom\rquote 
s aunt was wearing a kind of caftan that looked like robes? I thought she was a witch.\'94 He smiled ingratiatingly at his mother, who was not looking at all amused.
\par 
\par \'93Well,\'94 Hermione said darkly, \'93There\rquote s bound to be loads of important muggles at Alicia\rquote s wedding. Her mother does a lot of charity work, and I think I heard her father might actually try for parliament. They don\rquote 
t much like their MP.\'94 She sniffed. \'93He\rquote s Tory, of course, more\rquote s the pity...\'94
\par 
\par Hermione\rquote s political rant fell on deaf ears as far as Ron was concerned. \'93Well, what do plain old guests wear? I\rquote m invited too--can I just wear standard-issue muggle things?\'94
\par 
\par Hermione smirked. \'93No. You\rquote ll have to be dressed up as well. You just won\rquote t be parading around on display, like the groomsmen.\'94
 Harry thought she looked like she want a private display from him of some sort (Ron looked alarmed, as though he thought this, too); he managed to keep a straight face, looking at the pair of them, and suppressing a smirk of his own.
\par 
\par \'93Are you going to play?\'94 Harry asked her. She shrugged, and started leafing through some of the music.
\par 
\par \'93A lot of these look like pieces I know. This could actually be manageable....\'94
\par 
\par Katie looked around in disbelief. \'93So--we\rquote re actually doing this?\'94
\par 
\par The twins looked far less upset now about \lquote Standing up with that bugger.\rquote  George raised his eyebrows. \'93Looks like we\rquote re being put up for a week by rich people in a country house, 
then standing around for a few minutes while a git says \lquote I do,\rquote  then going to a party,\'94 George said, looking at Fred. Fred raised his glass of pumpkin juice.
\par 
\par \'93Nice work, if you can get it.\'94
\par 
\par \'93And Oliver\rquote ll be there, too!\'94 George remembered.
\par 
\par \'93Right. He\rquote ll know the best things to do for the stag night, places to go--\'94
\par 
\par \'93A pity Roger has to be included, but as he\rquote s the groom--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Stag night!\'94 Angelina looked outraged. George raised his eyebrows and looked at her with an expression of utter innocence.
\par 
\par \'93It\rquote s a tradition, you know. You\rquote ll have to do a hen party for Alicia, if you\rquote re the acting maid-of-honour.\'94
\par 
\par Angelina looked very grumpy again at the idea of doing all of the maid-of-honour work and getting none of the glory for it. Harry reflected on how odd i
t was that Roger had approved his being named as a groomsman, after both Roger and his father accused him of practically murdering Evan in cold blood. They must have gotten past that, or decided he wasn\rquote t to blame, he thought.
\par 
\par Perhaps Alicia asking him to be a groomsman was meant to be their way of extending an olive branch. He didn\rquote 
t much like the idea of formalwear on the last Saturday in August, let alone being paired with Cho (Of all people!). But if the Davies family was trying to make peace with him, it wouldn\rquote 
t be very good form to throw it in their faces and refuse to participate in the wedding.
\par 
\par \'93You\rquote re really doing it?\'94 Katie said quietly to him, sitting at his side, looking utterly shocked. He shrugged.
\par 
\par \'93How can I not? If it\rquote s Roger\rquote s way of making peace....\'94
\par 
\par She nodded. \'93I suppose I\rquote m stuck as well. I can\rquote t believe she wants me to walk with Lee. I\rquote ll bet she\rquote s just laughing and laughing about this...\'94
\par 
\par He patted her hand. \'93It will all work out, I\rquote m sure.\'94 He sounded surer than he felt. He\rquote d rather face Roger than Cho any day. He didn\rquote 
t really feel all that guilty about Evan, frankly, given that the Ravenclaw had attacked him and others in the forest. Cedric was quite another story, and Viktor....
\par 
\par As it was getting late, Snape and Lu
pin made their farewells. Snape was very formal, nodding at Harry before stepping into the fireplace. Lupin grinned at him, eyes crinkling up, as he too disappeared into the flames, going back to his flat in Manchester. He would be returning tomorrow, how
ever, to do some training with Ron.
\par 
\par The Weasleys were going by Floo as well, taking Maggie with them. They would return with her in a few days to retrieve her car. The boys were going with them to the Burrow, all but Ron, for a continuation of the family r
eunion. Ginny was also staying; Hermione would be sharing a room with her instead of Maggie now. McGonagall had already Apparated back to the Granger house in Greenwich, to which Hermione would return in a few days, after enjoying a brief holiday at Ascog
.
\par 
\par With the Weasleys gone, Ron and Draco were able to move up to the guestroom. After seeing off the Weasley family through the fireplace in the sitting room (Angelina went by herself to Hog\rquote 
s End, still fuming about the wedding), they all moved off to bed in a daze. Harry felt as though he was under a bit of a cloud, remembering how shocked everyone had looked when they realized he\rquote d known about Roger and Alicia....
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par \'93Harry! Call for you!\'94 Sirius\rquote  voice came through the thick bathroom door, just a bit muffled. \'93And it\rquote s my turn in the bloody bath!\rquote 
\par 
\par Harry finished drying himself after his shower; as he scrambled into his clothes he called, \'93Just a minute!\'94 trying not to fall over while putting on his khaki shorts.
\par 
\par \'93Why are you rushing, Harry Potter?\'94 Sandy asked him placidly from her comfortable position on a fluffy white towel by the side of the sink. She watched him stumble about. \'93Did I not tell you--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yeah, yeah,\'94 he muttered. Sometimes people with the Sight--human or snake--could be very tr
ying. He left her in the bathroom; she liked being in there with the steam and humidity, and he would collect her later. He was still pulling down his T-shirt, his hair dripping, as he walked to the small fireplace in his bedroom, stopping at the desk to 
p
ick up his glasses first. Sirius went into the bath and closed the door. The moment Harry put his glasses on and looked at the fireplace he almost fell over in shock. Sitting in the firebox was a head, and it was the last head he ever expected to see in a
 fireplace anywhere.
\par 
\par \'93Hello, Harry.\'94
\par 
\par \'93H--hullo, Aunt Petunia.\'94 He was at a loss for words, just staring. Then his aunt\rquote s head disappeared and Mrs. Figg\rquote s took her place.
\par 
\par She had opened her mouth to speak, but oddly enough it was Sirius\rquote  voice that came out. \'93Harry!\'94 his godfather bellowed from the bath. \'93You left your sodding snake in here!\'94
\par 
\par He turned toward the closed door. \'93She likes the damp!\'94 he called. \'93Just ignore her! I\rquote ll get her later!\'94 He turned back to the fireplace. Mrs. Figg was looking distinctly miffed.
\par 
\par \'93Good morning, Harry. I didn\rquote t really get a chance to speak with you at the party yesterday, but then you are rather easily distracted at times.\'94 She pursed her lips and looked so much like Professor McGonagall he had to stifle a laugh. \'93
I wanted to contact you to tell you how everything is here.\'94 Judging from the pinched expression on her face, Harry had a suspicious feeling that things were not going dreadfully well.
\par 
\par \'93Is--is Aunt Petunia doing a great deal of magic?\'94 he asked softly. Suddenly, his aunt\rquote s head was in the firebox again.
\par 
\par \'93I can\rquote t believe how rigid Arabella is being, Harry! I mean, she modified the vicar\rquote s memory, he\rquote ll never realize--\'94
\par 
\par Harry stood up, his eyes widening. \'93What did you do?\'94
\par 
\par Mrs. Figg\rquote s head reappeared, frowning deeply. Her face had been heavily lined before; now its fissures vied with her brother\rquote s for cragginess, and she didn\rquote t look as though she\rquote d had a good night\rquote s sleep recently. \'93
This isn\rquote t the time, Harry. This is meant to be good news. Earlier this week, Petunia and I went to that specialist in London, and she\rquote s been doing visualization exercises designed to affect her cells....We\rquote 
re going to go back later this month to see whether there\rquote s been any change. The doctor thought she was some kind of New Age nutter. Told her to go to California if she\rquote 
s so convinced crystals will cure her of cancer instead of the most advanced modern medicine.\'94 She sniffed disdainfully. \'93I almost told him, \lquote Yes, we might very well go to California.\rquote 
 I happen to know a shaman who lives in the desert on the way from Los Angeles to Vegas....he\rquote s dealt with this sort of thing before....\'94
\par 
\par Harry\rquote s eyes were practically falling out of his head. \'93Er, well. That\rquote s good news, then, right?\'94 The idea of his aunt doing magic in front of Mr. Babcock was still rather alarming to him. He didn\rquote t dare ask again what she
\rquote d done. \'93Any news about that phony milkman, by the way? Any sign of Rodney Jeffries?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Funny you should ask. Sirius will tell you more about it, but it seems the milkman was going to provide a base of operations--unbeknownst to him--for that Daisy Furuncle person. She wanted a close place from which to observe you, and because of Albus
\rquote  protective charms on your house, that was the nearest she could get.\'94
\par 
\par He furrowed his brow. \'93You know, I never did understand the way the protective charms worked...\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, you may have noticed that someone who doesn\rquote t intend to harm you and who is magical can come to your aunt and uncle\rquote s house with no problem.\'94 That was true. Fred, George and Ron were able to rescue him with their father\rquote 
s flying car during the summer before his second year. And Dobby, who had actually meant well, had no problem penetrating the charms either. Sirius a
nd Snape had also just walked up to number four, Privet Drive and gained admittance when they were bringing Hermione and her parents there. \'93Someone with less than friendly impulses, however....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Right. And Jeffries?\'94
\par 
\par \'93We don\rquote t actually have him in our 
sights, but there have been reports of people being healed of injuries by a stranger who mysteriously disappears again. His entourage is still missing as well. The families of the muggles who were working with him are starting to raise a stink with the go
vernment, especially the American families. Some of them are evidently threatening Whitehall with an international incident if their people don\rquote 
t turn up soon. Something about Britain being a haven for charlatan cult-leaders; an American embassy employee who was working in Paris going missing...her father is in the President\rquote s cabinet or some such thing....I can\rquote 
t keep track of it all....\'94
\par 
\par That was Grace. Harry\rquote s breath caught. All because his aunt threw Jeffries against the dais!
\par 
\par Sirius opened the bathroom door and emerged, his hair still damp from his shower, although he was busily rubbing his head with a towel. \'93Coming to breakfast, Harry?\'94
\par 
\par Harry turned for a moment, then looked uncertainly at Mrs. Figg.
\par 
\par \'93Go on, don\rquote t let me keep you. I just thought you might like to know about Petunia. There\rquote s nothing you can do about Jeffries...\'94
\par 
\par He drew his lips into a line. \'93Right. Well, goodbye, Aunt Petunia,\'94 he called. Her head appeared beside Mrs. Figg\rquote s. \'93Be good,\'94 he added sternly. She grimaced.
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote ll try. But sometimes I just--\'94
\par 
\par He laughed at the expression on her face. \'93I know just what you mean.\'94 But then he realized, No, I don\rquote t. I\rquote m of age now. I can do magic any time I want.
\par 
\par \'93Goodbye, Harry,\'94 Mrs. Figg said briskly. \'93Go have your breakfast now.\'94 And with a pop! her head and his aunt\rquote 
s head disappeared from the fireplace and the fire went with them. Which was just as well; on the top floor of the castle, on the first day of August, it was already starting to feel quite warm.
\par 
\par Harry collected Sandy from the bath and wrapped her around his left arm. He and Sirius were the last ones downstairs to eat; Ron and Draco Malfoy were still sitting at the table, but their breakfast dishes had been pushed to the side. A chessboard
 was between them now and they were deeply involved in a game while Hermione and Ginny watched. Katie was rolling her eyes at this, even as she read the morning edition of the Daily Prophet.
\par 
\par \'93They\rquote re both proving their manhood,\'94 she cracked to Harry and Sirius, turning the page of the paper. \'93Grunt a little more, you two,\'94 she instructed them. \'93Scratch something you shouldn\rquote t scratch in public.\'94
\par 
\par Malfoy scowled at her. \'93We\rquote re not Neanderthals. Or at least I\rquote m not,\'94 he added, looking pointedly at Ron, who grinned back at him.
\par 
\par \'93Is a Neanderthal likely to say \lquote Checkmate?\rquote \'94 He moved his queen into position; Malfoy\rquote 
s king was in her sights. If he moved the king out of danger from the queen, Ron would get him with either his knight or bishop. Malfoy stared at the board for a while before he threw up his hands in frustration. Ron wasn\rquote 
t trying very hard at all not to look smug.
\par 
\par \'93Good game, Malfoy,\'94 he said, his eyes twinkling at Hermione, who had a small smile. She actually seemed to notice Harry now.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, good morning, Harry. There are still some eggs warming in the oven. Want some?\'94
\par 
\par He accepted her offer and sat down, while the others rearranged themselves. He and Sirius ate quickly, and when they were done, Sirius looked very gravely at them and said, \'93We need to discuss Peter and his confession, Harry.\'94
 Sirius was at the end of the kitchen table, the tapestry with the silver lion on the blue field behind him. Ron was now opposite Harry, to Sirius\rquote  left, Ginny and Hermione on either side of him. Katie was on o
ne side of Harry and Draco Malfoy on the other.
\par 
\par \'93Should we all stay?\'94 Katie asked, putting down her newspaper. Harry could tell she felt a little like she was intruding. Sirius nodded at her.
\par 
\par \'93There\rquote s no reason you can\rquote t stay. In fact, your history is involved as well, so you might as well stay and hear everything.\'94 He leaned close to her and Harry heard him say quietly, \'93I hear you\rquote 
re going to begin Auror training in September?\'94 She nodded. \'93Well, you\rquote ll be hearing a number of top-secret things that aren\rquote t general knowledge. You understand you\rquote re to keep this information to yourself?\'94
 She nodded again, already looking a little numb.
\par 
\par Your history. Harry assumed that meant Sam killing her mum. Because of him. Katie looked very pale and stared down at her empty plate, looking like she wished she had more eggs or sausages or something to push around with her fork, to have something to do
.
\par 
\par There was silence. \'93Well?\'94 Harry said. \'93What are we waiting for?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Actually, it\rquote s not what but who. I asked Bill and Charlie to come and bring your sister,\'94 he said, nodding at Ginny and Ron.
\par 
\par \'93But she was going to be coming back in a few days anyway, to get her car. And why do you need her, or Charlie or Bill?\'94 Ginny asked, perplexed. But Harry had a growing suspicion that he now felt was completely supported by what Sirius had said....

\par 
\par \'93It was him, wasn\rquote t it?\'94 he said abruptly to Sirius. \'93Wormtail. Pettigrew. He kidnapped their sisters, didn\rquote t he?\'94
\par 
\par Sirius nodded slowly and Ginny put her hand over her mouth in horror, tears in her eyes. Ron put his arm around her and pulled her to him, his face grim and angry.
\par 
\par \'93How could he do that and then live with our family for twelve years?\'94 she said through her tears. Ron was shaking his head.
\par 
\par \'93There\rquote s not much I would put beyond him at this point. When I think of what I did for him when he was my pet....\'94
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94 Katie said suddenly. Harry turned to her.
\par 
\par \'93Er--that\rquote s what happened to Ron\rquote s rat, Scabbers. The one that used to be Percy\rquote s. It turns out he wasn\rquote t a rat at all, but Peter Pettigrew. Wormtail. He was an illegal Animagus.\'94
 Her jaw hung open in disbelief, but she snapped it shut again when Sirius drummed the table impatiently. Sirius looked like he wished he hadn\rquote t said anything yet.
\par 
\par \'93We\rquote re also waiting for Severus and Remus. This concerns quite a lot. It all goes back to--a Prophecy.\'94 He looked uneasily at Harry.
\par 
\par Harry turned his head and looked at Draco Malfoy; they knew which Prophecy. The one they were in. Malfoy\rquote s eyes were very opaque, revealing no emotion. He looked away from Harry.
\par 
\par Suddenly, they heard someone moving about in the sitting room, evidently emerging from the fireplace. A moment later, Remus Lupin walked in the kitchen door.
\par 
\par \'93Ah! Here you all are.\'94 He sat beside Hermione. \'93Still waiting for the others, eh?\'94 Before Sirius could answer, they heard someone else in the sitting room, then several someone elses. Charlie came bouncing into
 the kitchen next, followed by Bill with his long stride.
\par 
\par \'93Hullo again, everyone,\'94 Charlie said, grinning. \'93Ripping to see you all. It\rquote s been absolutely ages.\'94 He sat next to Draco Malfoy, while Ginny rolled her eyes at him.
\par 
\par \'93Ha ha,\'94 she intoned unenthusiastically. Her brother, being a mature thirty-one years old, stuck his tongue out at her.
\par 
\par Bill sat next to Charlie and propped his elbows on the table. Harry leaned forward to see him better; he\rquote d never seen Bill look more serious. He\rquote d been grinning a great deal when he\rquote d been thumping Harry\rquote 
s back the day before, after his role in finding Maggie had been revealed. He seemed very subdued now, in contrast.
\par 
\par Harry looked around. \'93Well--where\rquote s Maggie?\'94
\par 
\par Charlie looked toward the doorway. \'93She\rquote s coming. She stopped to talk--\'94
\par 
\par Harry frowned. Talk? But then he realized that he\rquote d heard a number of people in the sitting room; now Maggie walked in, arm-in-arm with Severus Snape, making Ron\rquote s jaw drop. Hermione looked at Harry, raising her ey
ebrows. He thought he knew why; even at the party, the day before, he\rquote d never seen Snape look so much like his younger self, the boy they\rquote d originally seen in the Pensive, working in the potions dungeon with Harry\rquote 
s mother. He wore simple black robes, as when he was teaching, over black trousers and a simple crisp white shirt.
\par 
\par And he was smiling, which seemed to shock Draco Malfoy so much Harry wondered if he could at this moment get him to say, \'93All Gryffindors are Gods,\'94 without batting an eye. Maggie an
d Severus Snape sat opposite her older brothers and next to Remus Lupin, whose face was utterly placid, as though he wasn\rquote t the least bit surprised about this development. Harry looked at Sirius, who frowned.
\par 
\par \'93Right,\'94 Sirius said briskly. He took a sip from a glass of pumpkin juice, then put it down and laid his hands on the table before him. \'93At the risk of going backwards, the first thing I\rquote d like to address is Severus\rquote  abduction,\'94
 he said, nodding at Snape. Maggie was now looking at him in alarm.
\par 
\par \'93You were abducted?\'94 she said in shock.
\par 
\par He grimaced. \'93I don\rquote t know how he was doing it. The first time, I was supposed to be meeting another operative in Diagon Alley--that\rquote s in London--\'94 he added for Maggie\rquote s benefit, \'93--and then suddenly I was in a cottage f
ar out in the country....\'94
 Harry wondered whether Pettigrew had again used the Tempus fugit spell. Snape told about the details of his imprisonment, which Harry had already heard from Dumbledore. The others, however, were listening with varying degrees of 
disbelief on their faces. Harry swallowed, thinking again of what Severus Snape had been enduring while they'd all been safely ensconced in the castle, learning potions from his uncle....
\par 
\par \'93Yes, well, Peter has finally explained why he imprisoned you,\'94 Sirius told him. \'93
You see, during the first year after the Tournament, as Voldemort was gathering his old followers around him, Peter was carefully positioning himself so that no one would raise doubts about him and his loyalty, as he knew Voldemort doubting 
him would lead to his instant disposal. He reckoned that his assisting Voldemort in getting his body back would be very helpful to his being in the inner circle, but it wasn\rquote t a guarantee.
\par 
\par "Your dad was a major problem, for instance,\'94 he said to Draco Malfoy. \'93
Competition. Turns out Peter was helping you to put him in prison, and you had no idea. There were evidently a number of times when your dad wondered whether he should trust you, and Peter talked him into continuing the plan you\rquote 
d lain out. He said he came to Hogwarts in his Animagus form and overheard you having conversations with Ginny at the edge of the forest, where you thought no one was paying attention to you. So he\rquote 
d figured out from the start what you were up to, and the only thing that worried him was whether you were trying to get rid of your father to take his place yourself. But he also reckoned he could dispose of you when the time came, if that was the case.

\par 
\par \'93Naturally, he couldn\rquote t be in all places at once, and while he was busying himself helping you get your dad out of the way, others began to plant seeds of doubt in Voldemort\rquote 
s mind concerning Peter. It was especially easy after that debacle on Christmas night, when we were trying to rescue poor stupid Karkaroff and prevent you,\'94 a nod at Draco, \'93
From having to get the Dark Mark. If anyone in the organization was going to be suspected, we had hoped it would be Lucius Malfoy, but he evidently had an airtight alibi. Peter was watched very, very carefully after that, even though we\rquote re fai
rly certain he knew nothing about our botched operation. In addition to these new suspicions, the rumour-mongers were able to bring up all of the old ones: about how he had managed to get himself appointed Secret Keeper on purpose, knowing that if he reve
aled the whereabouts of your parents,\'94 now he nodded at Harry, \'93
Voldemort would be defeated. Now, it is true that he managed to get me to doubt myself and the next thing I knew, I was urging James and Lily to make him the Secret Keeper. Not knowing his invo
lvement in the Death Eaters, it really did seem like the safest thing."
\par 
\par Sirius paused and rubbed his hand over his face for a moment, his facade of businesslike behavior threatening to crumble. He was still clearly very torn-up about this; Harry reckoned 
he always would be, just as he would never forgive himself for Cedric. Sirius cleared his throat and continued.
\par 
\par \'93However, I don\rquote t believe for a moment that Peter really knew what would happen when Voldemort went to Godric\rquote s Hollow that night. I believe he expected the entire family to be dead the next day. Well, James and Harry, anyway.
\par 
\par \'93He said he begged his Master to spare Lily. He told Voldemort that James was the \lquote First lion\rquote  and Harry the second, and once they were both destroyed, there was no need to bother with any of the other people in the Prophecy....\'94

\par 
\par Charlie's eyes widened. \'93Prophecy?\'94 And yet, to Harry, it looked like he knew about this and was merely surprised that others knew, too.
\par 
\par Sirius sighed. \'93We\rquote ll get to that.\'94 Harry thought he saw him sending significant looks to Bill and Maggie. Why? Harry wondered. What do they have to do with it?
\par 
\par \'93Anyway, Peter\rquote s position in the organization had been growing more tenuous during the year after the Triwizard Tournament. He decided he needed to do something to sort of \lquote Look busy\rquote 
 and loyal at the same time, while simultaneously protecting himself from Ministry reprisals, if he was caught by our side. Playing both sides against the middle has been Peter\rquote s modus operandi for years," Sirius added bitterly.
\par 
\par \'93He pretended to try to extract information from you,\'94 he said to Snape now, \'93But he said he didn\rquote t try very hard.\'94 Snape nodded.
\par 
\par \'93The most incompetent idiot I have ever seen,\'94 he growled; Harry would have laughed if it wasn\rquote t such a serious situation. The abductee criticizing his abductor\rquote s prowess. It was rather ridiculous. \'93Which,\'94 Snape went on, \'93
Was why it was so excruciating to continue to be held by him...\'94
\par 
\par \'93Right. He managed to seem useful by holding you for months on end, until finally Voldemort grew impatient and assigned his heir to help Peter get some truly useful information from Severus.
\par 
\par "The heir was, of course, Viktor Krum." Harry saw the stricken look on Her
mione's face, perhaps remembering being in Bulgaria, kissing him, letting him get close to her; she was right to have been afraid of him, he thought. But they were certainly not right to have foisted him off on Cho Chang. She looked up at Ron now, who app
eared to be feeling somewhat guilty--perhaps because of his own Krum hero-worship. "Krum had been initiated by his grandfather and was being trained by him and some of the most ruthless Death Eaters before arriving on Peter\rquote s doorstep. He wasn
\rquote t interested in wasting time. He began torturing Severus in earnest.\'94
\par 
\par He looked up at his old nemesis now, meeting his eyes. \'93But he didn\rquote t give up any information willingly. He\rquote d developed an immunity against even the strongest Veritaserum by dosing himself with it o
ver the years, so that he was able to convince them that the misinformation he was giving them while evidently under the potion\rquote 
s influence was true. We actually started racking up some successes in catching Death Eaters, since they believed his tales. That was short-lived. Unfortunately, it only took a few routs before they realized what he was doing.
\par 
\par \'93Finally, Krum resorted to torture that muggles have long found successful....\'94 He didn\rquote t finish, but looked down. Snape held up his hands.
\par 
\par \'93No lasting harm done,\'94 he reported, his deep voice smooth and calm. \'93I\rquote ll have full feeling again in the new fingers before long.\'94
 Maggie went very white upon hearing this; whether it was because of the torture or the cure, Harry couldn't tell.
\par 
\par He still couldn\rquote t bear to think of what Snape had gone through when they\rquote d been cut off. He shuddered and looked at his Potions Master, his erstwhile stepfather, unable to fully conceive of what he\rquote d endured during his imprisonment.

\par 
\par \'93And, of course, the time Severus escaped, Pet
er engineered that, unbeknownst to both Severus and Krum. Then he had to put on a great show of trying to catch Severus again, as he felt that Krum was getting far too close to figuring out what he was really up to, so he captured Snape as he had before.
\'94 Harry wondered if this meant he used Tempus fugit again. Pettigrew seemed far too fond of the spell; did he know the downside? Harry wondered. \'93He really hadn\rquote t been keen on letting Krum torture Severus, but he\rquote 
d felt he had no choice, or he\rquote d be reported to his Master.
\par 
\par \'93At last, when Harry contacted him and asked for a trade, offering himself in Severus\rquote  place, Peter saw a chance for himself. He would make it possible for Harry to capture him while making it look like he was trying to ambush Harry. The re
ason it may have seemed just a little too easy for you to get Peter--\'94 he started saying to his godson.
\par 
\par \'93Easy!\'94 Harry spat, remembering the giant spiders, and the fire.
\par 
\par "--Was because he fully intended you to capture him the entire time. He was feeling increasingly unsafe, with Voldemort\rquote s heir hanging over his shoulder all the time watching his every move, and the information he\rquote 
d extracted from Snape resulting in a number of Death Eaters being hauled in. Peter knew that the whispers that he intentionally sent Voldemort to Godric\rquote s Hollow so he\rquote 
d lose his powers were growing louder and louder. Finally, he reckoned that the only safe place for him was in the Ministry\rquote s custody. But if he just turned himself in, he\rquote d still be in a great deal of danger. Voldemort\rquote 
s reach is not inconsiderable. Peter had to make it look like he\rquote d been loyal to Voldemort all along, like his capture had occurred simply because he\rquote d been out-maneuvered."
\par 
\par Harry felt deflated. All that effort in the forest, and it had been to capture someone who wanted to be taken in. He felt irrationally angry, thinking about the injuries the members of the Dueling Club had sustained, how many of them could have died....

\par 
\par \'93He should have done the right thing and just turned himself in,\'94 he said between his teeth. \'93If we hadn\rquote t been in the forest--\'94 Suddenly, his eyes met Ron\rquote s across the table. Damn! If they hadn\rquote 
t been in the forest, if Pettigrew hadn\rquote t been tryin
g to make his capture look so good, Ron never would have been bitten by Lupin. Any of them could have been killed by Lupin in his werewolf form, as well. Unless...Harry remembered that Pettigrew knew about his golden griffin Animagus form. No--Pettigrew p
robably thought Harry\rquote s form was a lion. Perhaps he thought a lion would be an adequate match for a werewolf? That turned out to be right, but Harry still felt incredibly manipulated.
\par 
\par \'93And I played right into his hands,\'94 Draco Malfoy said now, his voice morose, \'93When I went into the forest by myself....\'94
\par 
\par Sirius shrugged. \'93When we were in school, James and I were the ones who did well in most of our purely magical studies, except Charms. That was Lily\rquote s forte, in addition to Potions and Defense Against the Dark Arts. Remus,\'94
 he nodded at his friend, sitting between Hermione and Maggie, \'93Had his strengths as well. Professor McGonagall was often rather hard on Peter, and even Flitwick became exasperated with him from time to time. But he came up with some sche
mes that were frankly quite ingenious. He always received very good marks in Defense Against the Dark Arts, and he concocted a number of plans for sneaking around the castle and Hogsmeade which made our school years far more interesting than they would ha
ve been otherwise, exploiting information James had found in the Restricted Section of the Library. I admit I didn\rquote t give him credit at the time; none of us did..."
\par 
\par Sirius looked like he might have been wondering whether being better friends with Peter, instead of merely taking advantage of his craftiness, might have saved Harry's parents. Harry eyed Draco Malfoy, whom he was both afraid to trust and afraid not to.

\par 
\par \'93He wasn\rquote t a wizard to set the world on fire, was Peter, but he was clever in his way," Sirius went on. "Scheming. And let\rquote 
s not forget that he also mastered the Animagus Transfiguration, although it took him rather longer than James and I....\'94
\par 
\par Katie frowned. \'93What do you mean also?\'94
\par 
\par Sirius raised his eyebrows at her, then looked at Harry. \'93Well, thank you for keeping my secret, Harry, but everyone might as well know now that I am an Animagus.\'94
\par 
\par \'93You too!\'94 Maggie exclaimed from the far end of the table. Katie was frowning. He turned to her again.
\par 
\par \'93Don\rquote t worry, my dear, I\rquote m quite legal. Just aft
er my name was cleared I registered properly with the Ministry and I can transfigure myself without breaking the law now. I had to pay a minor fine for doing it without supervision or permission, but now it\rquote s all squared away.\'94
\par 
\par Harry looked at Katie uncomfortably; sometimes she almost seemed like she already was an Auror. \'93
Just so you know--my dad was an illegal Animagus, too. His form was a stag. The three of them learned it when they were in school, so they could be with Professor Lupin during the full moon,\'94
 he said, nodding at Lupin, who looked somewhat uncomfortable.
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote ve told you Harry,\'94 he said now. \'93I\rquote m not your professor any more. You should call me Remus.\'94
\par 
\par Harry acknowledged this with a small bob of his head, but inside he felt that it should accompany the title Uncle, which was what he\rquote d called Lupin in his other life, before he\rquote d been hauled away by the Longbottoms....
\par 
\par Katie was starting to remind him uncomfortably of Gemma Longbottom, Neville\rquote 
s mother, whom he had seen more than once in his other life. He remembered the grim determination on her face on the train platform in Huntly, before he had sent her and her husband off on a wild goose chase in Inverness, and earlier, in Banff, when she a
nd her husband had told the football team with whom he was traveling that they were Detective Chief Inspector and Detective Inspector Longbottom, muggle titles that usually commanded a certain respect.
\par 
\par D.C.I. Katie Bell, he thought. He could see it in his mind\rquote s eye, he really could. She looked at him uncertainly, as if wondering whether his entire family and all of his parents\rquote 
 friends were hopeless lawbreakers. Her father had gone to prison, but what he did certainly wasn\rquote t premeditated or an illegal activity he\rquote d been covering up for years.
\par 
\par \'93At any rate, he was able to clear up something else for us. We\rquote d suspected it for some time, especially since Severus\rquote  abduction occurred when he was supposed to be meeting her in Diagon Alley....but Rita Skeeter was
 acting as a double agent during the entire year before that. Dumbledore asked her to work for him as an operative, but there\rquote 
s no love lost between him and Rita, and after he asked her, she lost no time in finding someone to put her in touch with Voldemor
t. Actually, she usually gave her information to Peter. He evidently filtered out some of it. For instance, he already knew what Draco was up to in trapping his father, so when she informed him of Draco\rquote s plan--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Hey!\'94 Draco Malfoy said now, bristling wi
th indignation that Rita Skeeter had been evidently been buzzing around him, spoiling his careful trap, in addition to Peter Pettigrew having figured it out. Harry remembered that Malfoy had been one of the first to know that Rita was an illegal Animagus;
 he'd been giving her information about Harry. Serves you right, Harry thought, even though he was lucky Pettigrew had been intercepting the information about the Lucius Malfoy plan. It was a miracle that the plan had worked at all.
\par 
\par \'93--Peter sat on the information, as he wanted Lucius out of the way as well. You know how it is: no honour among thieves. He pretended to work with Lucius, of course, and he never told Rita he hadn\rquote 
t passed on her information. Everything she learned with her snooping went right 
to Peter. That was why so many operations were going south that year; we had a mole. I think Rita had realized that all of the suspicion was starting to fall on her when she decided to disappear. Then Peter had her contact Severus, concocting a story abou
t having been abducted, and the next thing we knew he had been abducted. We think she continued to do her spying in her Animagus form--\'94
\par 
\par \'93A beetle,\'94 Harry whispered to Katie, who widened her eyes and shook her head again. He saw that Hermione was looking very tight- lipped, probably regretting that she'd ever let the reporter out of that glass jar.
\par 
\par \'93But with more strenuous security precautions we managed to thwart her; and with some well-planted false information, we also managed to send Death Eaters on a number of wild goose chases.\'94
\par 
\par Hermione sat up now. \'93So--is she Daisy Furuncle?\'94
\par 
\par Sirius\rquote  eyes narrowed. \'93I believe she is one of the Daisy Furuncles.\'94
\par 
\par Harry\rquote s jaw dropped. \'93One of?\'94
\par 
\par \'93You think we haven't been looking into this? The Prophet claims they h
ave no knowledge of how it happened, but we managed to speak to a couple of Prophet employees using some, er, persuasive techniques, and they said that someone acting on behalf of Daisy Furuncle has been to their offices three times. Each time it was a wo
m
an wearing a cloak with a hood pulled up, making it difficult to see her face. The first person we talked to said it was a very tall woman with pale, freckly skin and a husky voice, and the next person said that they spoke to a very short woman with olive
 
skin. The third person we spoke to said they talked to a medium-height woman with a high voice and pale, clear skin--no freckles--and he reckons he saw some long blond hair escaping from her hood. Given that the writing style is alarmingly familiar, I thi
nk our Daisy Furuncle is possibly an amalgam of more than one person. Or else \lquote Daisy\rquote  has some assistants. She was also planning to have an observation post a mere two houses away from Harry in Surrey, but Harry stopped it.\'94
\par 
\par Now Ginny frowned. \'93That third woman sounds a bit like Fleur Delacour. Why would she go out of her way to smear Harry? After all, in the first article, Harry was accused of killing Roger Davies\rquote  brother, and now he\rquote 
s jilted Fleur for Alicia. Why would she go on the offensive for someone who\rquote d been cheating on her like that?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Perhaps she didn\rquote t know yet. She may have thought she was supporting her boyfriend and his family in their time of grief, pointing a finger at Evan\rquote s murderer. If, that is, the woman was Fleur. I\rquote m not ruling her out. We haven
\rquote t a clue who the other women might be, unless it was actually Rita each time, and she\rquote d taken potion to make herself to look like someone else. And, for that matter, we don\rquote 
t actually have any proof that Rita is involved with the articles--just a very, very strong suspicion.\'94 Harry tried to think of three women besides Rita who had it in for him, and came up dry.
\par 
\par \'93Well,\'94 Hermione reasoned, \'93Even if Fleur was involved, she probably couldn\rquote t have written the articles herself. The last time I ran
 into her during a Hogsmeade weekend, her English was only a little better than when she first arrived here for the Tournament.\'94
\par 
\par Sirius nodded. \'93Right. However, as much as I\rquote d like to go on speculating about this, we have to move on. Needless to say, we a
ll need to be very, very careful of what we say at all times. Do as much communication as possible in writing, with the parchment charmed so that only you and the person who is to receive it can read it. I went round the entire castle last night and early
 this morning casting revealing spells, looking for any beetles or magical listening devices. I turned up these.\'94
\par 
\par He put his hand in his pocket and then withdrew it, his fist closed. When he opened it, they could all see three innocuous-looking black marbles. Then Harry remembered the marble that Pettigrew sent in the letter about Malfoy being in the forest; he was a
ble to hold it and see what was going on in the depths of the Forbidden Forest, where there was another marble, its mate. \'93I took all of the magics off them and painted them black for good measure,\'94 Sirius said gravely, \'93
But I want to make another sweep through the castle today, to catch any others. There were a lot of people here yesterday; it was inevitable, I suppose, that someone would try to use the party to infiltrate the castle. What infuriates me,\'94
 and Harry had only seen him angrier on rare occasions, \'93Is that one of these was in my niece\rquote s bedroom. When these people--and I use the term loosely--start invading the privacy of a seven-year-old I just can\rquote t--\'94
 He sputtered into silence, furious.
\par 
\par Harry looked at Katie, next to him. She swallowed.
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m staying in Mercy\rquote s room,\'94 she said quietly. \'93It was probably planted there to spy on me.\'94
\par 
\par Sirius put the marbles away again. \'93Nevertheless. I took the precaution of thoroughly combing through this room before breakfast this morning, and while I am fairly 
certain it is safe in here, I advise all of you to watch what you say in the rest of the castle.\'94 He nodded at Lupin and Snape. \'93Remus, Severus--can you help me make another sweep after we\rquote re done here?\'94
 They both agreed, and Sirius moved on.
\par 
\par \'93Now--Peter didn\rquote t just discuss his recent activities. He talked about why he became a Death Eater in the first place. He wanted me to understand, he said. He also begged us not to give him Veritaserum.\'94
 He sighed, looked conflicted about this. \'93He said there were still some things that he didn\rquote 
t want to reveal, in case of Death Eaters infiltrating the Ministry. He said that everything he was planning to tell us was the truth, but there were some bits of the truth he didn\rquote t feel comfortable telling yet. If he was under the potion\rquote 
s influence, he wouldn\rquote t be able to help himself; if we asked him a question, he would be compelled to answer truthfully. So help me, I agreed to it and he told us this of his own free will. I do hope it is the truth.
\par 
\par \'93He said that he went to Hogwarts for a Quidditch match in November, after our seventh year. Remus was going as well; they were going to meet in Hogsmeade and then walk to the castle together for the match. Do you remember this, Remus?\'94
\par 
\par Remus Lupin looked more uncomfortable than Harry had ever seen him. \'93Yes. Yes I do,\'94 he said quietly, and for some reason he glanced at Maggie, with a distinctly guilty look on his face. When he looked at Charlie, he brightened. \'93We\rquote 
d heard that Gryffindor had a brilliant new Seeker who would make up for the fact that James wasn\rquote t playing Chaser any more,\'94 he said slyly. While Charlie turned pink under his freckles, Sirius continued.
\par 
\par \'93Peter said that Arthur Weasley was there as well, that he\rquote d brought his daughters to see their brother Charlie play. Is that right?\'94
 he asked, nodding now at Bill and Charlie. Oddly, Bill and Charlie responded as Remus had, with guilt clearly written on both of their faces. They looked at each other briefly, then at Sirius.
\par 
\par \'93Yeah, that\rquote s right,\'94 Bill said, answering for both of them. \'93I was a fourth year and Charlie was a second year. He had just made the team. Mum and Dad--Dad especially--were both over the moon that he was the new Seeker. Mum didn\rquote 
t come, though. She was rather busy with Percy and the twins and couldn\rquote t get a baby-sitter. Perce was two and the twins were six months old.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes. So your father traveled by Floo to Hogsmeade with the girls and went up to the castle with them, right?\'94 Bill and Charlie both nodded. Harry frowned, wondering where this was going. They weren\rquote 
t kidnapped until the following spring. Did Pettigrew start planning the kidnapping the previous November?
\par 
\par \'93Can you tell us what happened that day, after the match?\'94 Sirius said to the oldest Weasley brothers. Charlie looked at Bill and nodded; Bill looked round at them all--except, it seemed, for Maggie--and launched into the story.
\par 
\par \'93Dad and Peggy and Annie were going to stay for lunch. The match had started soon after breakfast, but Charlie caught the Snitch so quickly it didn\rquote t last long.\'94 He elbowed his brother; Charlie gave them all a lop-sided smile. \'93
We showed the girls around the grounds a bit, then went back up to the castle for lunch. When we were in the entrance hall--\'94 He paused, and finally looked at his long-lost sister. Nobody said a word, not even What? They waited for Bill to continue.

\par 
\par \'93Trelawney was there,\'94 he choked out at last. \'93When Peggy came in the doors she crouched down to talk to her. We couldn\rquote t hear what she was saying too well....\'94
\par 
\par \'93She said,\'94 Maggie spoke up suddenly, staring into space, as though that was helping her remember, \'93I could feel that you were here.\'94
\par 
\par Harry shivered and felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up. He could feel something coming, something important.
\par 
\par \'93And then--\'94 Charlie started to say, but Bill jumped in.
\par 
\par \'93Trelawney, um started talking in this strange, deep voice,\'94 he said, with a nervous glance at Charlie, Maggie and Remus. They were all frowning at Bill.
\par 
\par Sirius nodded. \'93She gave the Prophecy.\'94
\par 
\par Bill looked at him, the shock clear on his face. Maggie, Charlie and Remus looked suprised as well, and Charlie started to say, \'93No, it was--\'94 but his brother had put an elbow in his ribs--and not in a friendly way, as before.
\par 
\par \'93Is that what Pettigrew told you?\'94 Bill asked Sirius, looking very white.
\par 
\par \'93Yes,\'94 Sirius said; it seemed to Harry that he was trying his best to look calm and unruffled, while he was actually waiting very tensely.
\par 
\par \'93Yes,\'94 Bill echoed him, his voice shaking. \'93Trelawney gave the Prophecy.\'94
\par 
\par What was wrong with them? Harry wondered. All of them. In the back of his mind, he had always assumed that it was Trelawney. Dumbledore had said she\rquote 
d given one correct prophecy before predicting that Peter would return to Voldemort, at the end of Harry\rquote s third year.
\par 
\par \'93I tried to remember it and write it down later,\'94 Bill went on, his voice more stable now. \'93I didn\rquote t get it all, though, and I had to use some memory-enhancing potion to remember the rest.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Who else was present when she did this?\'94 Sirius wanted to know.
\par 
\par \'93Let\rquote s see--Annie was there. And Peggy--I mean, Maggie. Then Charlie, Lupin and Pettigrew.\'94
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s all?\'94 Sirius said, his eyebrows raised.
\par 
\par \'93It--it was early for lunch; there weren\rquote t a lot of people around yet. I was surprised to see Trelawney out of her tower at all. It seemed she\rquote d come down just to look for Peggy.\'94 Large drops of sweat stood out on Bill\rquote 
s forehead, and he wiped them off with a handkerchief.
\par 
\par Sirius had put the tips of his fingers together and was staring over them. \'93What did you do later, Bill? With the words of the Prophecy you\rquote d written down?\'94
\par 
\par He looked guilty again. \'93I--I tried to figure out what they might mean, but I couldn\rquote t make head or tail of it. So I--I decided to go into the forest, to ask a Centaur I\rquote d heard about who wasn\rquote 
t as bad as the others about hating humans. I hoped he might help me.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Did you tell anyone you were going to do this?\'94
\par 
\par Bill frowned. \'93I--I don\rquote t think so--\'94
\par 
\par Charlie sat up. \'93Yeah, you did. You said to me, \lquote I\rquote ll bet one of the Centaurs could tell me what all this means.\rquote \'94
\par 
\par Bill squinted, as though that would help him to better see the past. It was almost twenty years earlier. \'93I said that out loud?\'94 he said wonderingly.
\par 
\par \'93Where were you?\'94 Sirius asked him.
\par 
\par \'93We were in the entrance hall; it was just after--after we all heard the Prophecy,\'94 Charlie said, with a conspiratorial glance at his older brother.
\par 
\par \'93Was Peter still there, or had he already left?\'94
\par 
\par Bill opened his eyes wide. \'93Yeah, I think he might have been there still--\'94
\par 
\par Sirius nodded. \'93That\rquote s what he told us.\'94 He looked at Remus Lupin. \'93Did he return to Hogsmeade with you?\'94
\par 
\par Lupin looked thoughtful; he was surveying the Weasley brothers and their sister Maggie as though trying to decide something. \'93No--he said he wanted to stay and visit with McGonagall. I found that unlikely, as she\rquote 
d been pretty hard on him in school, but I had to go, as the moon would be rising full that night just as the sun set, and I didn\rquote t want to risk being stuck in the midst of traveling when that happened...\'94
\par 
\par \'93Peter said that he stayed at the castle in his rat form. He managed to infiltrate Gryffindor Tower, finding a way into the dorms that only a small rodent could. He hung about the fourth-year dorm that entire winter, listening for any sign from
 Bill that he would be going into the forest to consult the Centaur.\'94
\par 
\par Lupin\rquote s eyes lit up. \'93That\rquote s when Peter disappeared for months! We thought something terrible had happened to him!\'94
\par 
\par \'93No, nothing terrible. He was just hanging about Bill here, waiting. He also managed to get a copy of the Prophecy for himself; he copied it out of the notebook where Bill had written it. He said he didn\rquote 
t fancy being the one to ask the Centaurs to interpret it, but if the summer term ended without Bill going into the forest, he would take it upon himself.\'94
\par 
\par Bill looked thoughtful again. \'93I remember now...Booth had noticed the rat. One of the other lads in my year. Peregrin Booth. It was hiding in his wardrobe. He made a sor
t of pet out of it, bringing it scraps of food from the Great Hall and letting it sleep on an old pair of corduroy trousers. Did Pettigrew say why he was so interested in the Prophecy in the first place?\'94
 This jolted Harry. Another question was, why was Bill so interested in the Prophecy?
\par 
\par \'93That,\'94 Sirius said, \'93Is one of the things he said he wasn\rquote t ready to reveal.\'94 He sighed deeply and went on. \'93Peter said you finally went to the forest in the spring.\'94
\par 
\par Bill nodded, looking around guiltily. \'93Yeah. The Centaur wasn\rquote t really all that helpful. I don\rquote 
t even remember much of the Prophecy now. I lost the notebook where I wrote it down. Then when Peggy and Annie disappeared--nothing else seemed particularly important.\'94 His voice had gone very soft.
\par 
\par \'93I couldn\rquote t figure out the first part of the Prophecy at all, and when I finally found Firenze, what he had to say didn\rquote t make it any clearer. He said he\rquote 
d seen things in the stars, and in the sky. All I remember is that the Dark Lord was going to fall twice, and both times he\rquote 
d be defeated by a triangle made up of a Lion, a Moonchild and a Daughter of War. And the Lion and the Moonchild both loved the Daughter of War. Oh, and she was called \lquote Flame-haired,\rquote 
 too. Then he was throwing numbers around, something about what he\rquote d seen in the stars. He said the Lion\rquote s number was eleven. The Moonchild\rquote s number was five. And one of the Lions wasn\rquote t born yet. One of the Moonchildren wasn
\rquote t born yet either. I asked him what the number of the Daughter of War was, and he said the two
 have different numbers. The first triangle makes only half of a whole, but the second triangle makes one. And he said the number of the six people together is six. That seemed kind of obvious to me--six people make six. It was like he was just repeating 
himself.
\par 
\par \'93I didn\rquote t know what to think, and I\rquote 
d just about given up, when he looked right at me and told me that there would be a lot of people from my family who would fight the Dark Lord. He said my youngest brother would march by the side of the Lion, an
d that his number was also eleven. At the time I thought he meant Fred.\'94 He looked at Ron now, and Ron met his eyes for a second before looking at Harry. March at the side of the Lion....
\par 
\par \'93Then,\'94 Bill went on, \'93He told me that a Daughter of War would come from my family. I asked him to tell me who it was, but he became distracted, staring at the stars again, and then he left. I didn\rquote 
t understand whether he was saying it was Peggy or Annie or one of each of them--\'94 He took a deep breath, and now he put one large hand up to his face, and Harry could see tears seeping through his fingers. \'93I didn\rquote t tell anyone about what he
\rquote d said,\'94 his voice came through his hand, \'93And then, a week later--\'94
\par 
\par Harry saw Hermione cover her mouth with her hand; a week later the girls were abducted and disappeared, seemingly forever. Then he looked at Ginny; she was weeping silently, her head on Ron\rquote 
s shoulder while he had his arm around her; Harry saw that Ron\rquote s eyes were wet now too. Suddenly, Maggie rose and walked around the table and sat down next to Bill. She put her arms around him and pulled him close and he wept into his sister
\rquote s neck. Harry felt more than a little uncomfortable at seeing a man in his thirties crying openly, a man almost as old as his parents would have bee
n, had they lived. Watching Snape in the Pensieve weeping over his mother (And doing the same thing when Harry had traveled through time) was different. Snape hadn't known he had an audience, and Harry had felt both experiences were a little unreal. This 
was all too real.
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m so sorry--\'94 he sobbed as he held his sister. \'93I didn\rquote t know--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Bill,\'94 Sirius said quietly, but he managed to get his attention. \'93What you didn\rquote t know was--Peter was in the forest, listening to your meeting with Firenze. He heard ev
erything. After that, your friend found that his pet rat had gone missing, didn\rquote t he?\'94
\par 
\par Bill dried his tears and turned to face Sirius again. \'93Right. Booth just reckoned someone\rquote s cat had gotten it. Actually, he got into a great row with one of my best friends about it. Orville Simpson. He had a large grey cat.\'94
\par 
\par Ron and Hermione exchanged a glance, both looking guilty, and Harry remembered the Scabbers Controversy. Pettigrew had done this before.
\par 
\par \'93Right,\'94 Sirius said, echoing Bill. \'93Pettigrew had his information--or, at least as much as you--and he ran off. Now, I\rquote 
m not entirely sure the next part is strictly true, but what he told us is that he was in a wizarding pub in Norfolk when it was attacked by Death Eaters, who just started putting Cruciatus on people for sport.\'94
 They were all focused on Sirius again, giving Bill and Maggie a modicum of privacy.
\par 
\par \'93Peter was always the most squeamish one about the pain that comes with the Animagus Transfiguration--even though he eventually became used to it--and he wasn\rquote t really interested in finding out what Cruciatus was like. He couldn\rquote 
t just transform into a rat and run off--someone would see him. So he told one of the Death Eaters that he had some information about a Prophecy predicting the Dark Lord\rquote s fall, but
 he would only give the information to Voldemort directly. He was just interested in saving himself from a bit of pain, and the next thing he knew he was being initiated as a Death Eater.\'94
 Harry winced and he saw that Draco Malfoy did too; they both knew that being initiated involved a great deal of pain (Slthough Malfoy didn\rquote t know that Harry knew from first-hand experience).}{\f1\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par \'93He didn\rquote t realize what would happen once he started trying to negotiate with Voldemort or his underlings. You don\rquote t just offer up 
information to Voldemort or a Death Eater to save your skin and then walk away. He was stuck. He gave what information he had. He had heard the Centaur tell Bill that a Daughter of War would come from his family. It was the most concrete thing he had. The
y asked him what he knew about the Weasleys, whether they had any daughters, and he confirmed that they had two. But he said he didn\rquote t know which one was the Daughter of War. It turned out Voldemort didn\rquote 
t care. He gave him his first assignment as a Death Eater: dispose of the Weasley sisters.\'94
\par 
\par Harry was horrified, then remembered that Voldemort himself had tried to kill him when he was a baby, far younger than seven and nine. He knew he should stop being surprised by anything he or his Death Eaters would do.
\par 
\par \'93Peter wasn\rquote t really hardened yet by the life of a dark wizard. He was scared. The idea of killing two little girls sickened him. Some of Voldemort\rquote 
s top people taught him the spell he used to abduct them; the Tempus fugit spell. It was meant to be a way for him to kill them and then disappear quickly. Peter didn\rquote 
t have his Apparition test yet. Instead, he took the girls away to the nearest city, turned them over to muggles, erased their memories, and he made them owl-proof.\'94
\par 
\par Harry thought he must have let his mind wander until he heard the last two words. \'93Owl-proof?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes. He put a spell on them so that they would be undetectable to owls. Sort of like making a building unplottable. But in this case, it means the person can\rquote 
t be sent post-owls. They tried finding the girls using owls, but they always kept coming back. That\rquote s what usually happens when you try to send owl post to someone who\rquote s dead.\'94
\par 
\par They were all silent now. Bill and Maggie leaned on one another silently, and Harry saw how Snape\rquote s eyes followed her, looking haunted.
\par 
\par \'93His story of having disposed of the girls wasn\rquote t trusted by his new Master until they tried sending owl post and it ca
me back. Then they believed him. But just in case disposing of the Weasley girls had only removed one Daughter of War and not two, Voldemort set Peter to work trying to figure out the rest of the Prophecy.\'94
\par 
\par Harry sat up, hopeful. Did Pettigrew actually understand the Prophecy? \'93However--Peter was afraid that if he identified any more people in the Prophecy, he\rquote 
d be sent on more assignments to kill those involved. He dawdled for months, pretending to be traveling around doing research. Months stretched into a year, and Peter still hadn\rquote 
t produced anything. Voldemort was getting impatient. Peter went into hiding; the only place he could think of to go, he said, was the Burrow. He said he remembered how cozy and homely it was when he\rquote d been hanging about there
, trying to work out what to do about the girls. Also, he said he felt terrible about what he\rquote d done to the Weasleys and wanted to make sure they were all right.\'94 Harry saw Ron\rquote s mouth twisting unpleasantly, clearly doubting this.
\par 
\par \'93He started living in their garden in his rat form, using the tunnels that the gnomes had built. In the spring of 1980, Percy found him. How old was he then?\'94
\par 
\par \'93He would have been about three-and-a-half,\'94 Charlie said. \'93I was fourteen.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, Percy made a pet of him, in a way. 
Rather like your old dorm mate, Bill. In his rat form, Peter seemed to have a talent for making friends with little boys who were a bit on the fringes. But then he noticed that your mum was expecting another baby soon and panicked. What if it was a girl? 
That would mean he might have taken the wrong Daughter of War. But then Ron was born, and he breathed easy again.
\par 
\par \'93Peter felt the Weasleys were safe, since they hadn\rquote t had another daughter, and he\rquote d grown tired of living as a rat, so he left the Burrow. He turned up at Lily\rquote s and James\rquote 
 place in Cardiff and found that Lily was also expecting a baby. He hadn\rquote t realized she was pregnant. He stayed with them for over two months and he was there when she went into labour. He helped James get her to a muggle hos
pital--Lily was never completely comfortable with wizarding medicine--and Harry was born. She later told me how helpful Peter had been during her labour, how he\rquote d held her hand when James had gone to get her ice chips, how he\rquote 
d talked to her to keep her mind off the pain. She refused to take anything to be more comfortable, of course. That was Lily.
\par 
\par \'93We all turned up the next day to see the baby, of course.\'94 Sirius smiled at Harry. \'93He was the spitting image of James. His eyes still looked blue, though, so we couldn\rquote 
t see yet that he had some of Lily in him, too. We had a good time visiting, and got a bit raucous. I think the matron was about to kick us out, when Lily said something that made Peter turn white as a sheet.
\par 
\par \'93When Peter told me--I remembered. But at the time, it didn\rquote t seem significant at all.\'94 He paused, glancing again at Harry. \'93She\rquote d taken Arithmancy in school and she said she\rquote 
d worked out your Arithmancy numbers. Said they were good ones. She said your birth number was eleven--and when she did, Peter clutched at the bed. He said that then he realized that you\rquote d been born under the sign of Leo,\'94 he nodded at Harry, 
\'93And that made you a Lion whose number was eleven. And you hadn\rquote t been born when the Prophecy was given.
\par 
\par \'93After he left the hospital, he went back to James\rquote  and Lily\rquote s flat. He said he hadn\rquote t taken Arithmancy and didn\rquote 
t understand what Lily had done to get the number eleven, but at the flat he found her old Arithmancy text and quickly worked it out. It\rquote s just about the first thing you learn in Arithmancy: add up the numbers in the person\rquote 
s birthday to get their birth number. The numbers in Harry\rquote s birthday are three, one, seven, another one, nine and eight. That totals twenty-nine. After that you\rquote re supposed to add the digits of the
 total, and adding two and nine gets you eleven. Simple, really.
\par 
\par \'93He worried now that someone would find out that Harry fit the description in the Prophecy. But on the other hand, he decided that he had some information he could offer Voldemort if he was 
run to ground again by Death Eaters. He had his Apparition test by now and his Dark Mark had hurt him more than once, but he hadn\rquote 
t gone when summoned. He was afraid it was just a matter of time before he was found and chastised for not being a faithful servant. He\rquote 
d never intended to be a servant to begin with, he said. And now he had to keep running in place just to keep Voldemort from deciding to kill him.
\par 
\par \'93He worked out the other dates in 1979 and 1980 that would give a birth number of eleven to someone born under the sign of Leo. In 1979 the dates included--\'94 Sirius took a piece of parchment out of his robe pocket and consulted it. \'93
July 23, and August 4 and 13. He checked old copies of the Daily Prophet for birth announcements, and only one of those days had a wizarding birth--August 4, a girl. She didn\rquote 
t quality--it was clear from the Prophecy that the Lions were boys. He did the work for 1980 then. In addition to July 31-- Harry\rquote 
s birthdate--other dates that worked out were August 3 and 12. But no wizards were born on those days. At least not in the wizarding world; if the Lion was going to be a muggle-born wizard, Peter had no way of knowing. That informa
tion was kept under lock and key at Hogwarts, waiting for the day when those students needed to receive their school acceptance letters.
\par 
\par \'93Then it occurred to him to try to work out the Moonchild--if that meant someone born under the sign of Cancer, as he 
thought it did. It would give him more to hand over if the Death Eaters caught up with him. It could be, of course, that the Moonchild still hadn\rquote 
t been born, but he worked out that if the Moonchild was born in 1979, and his number was five, possible birthdates were--\'94 he looked at the parchment again, \'93--June 27 and July 8 and 17. If the Moonchild\rquote 
s birthyear was 1980, the dates were June 2,6  and July 7 and 16. He also worked out possible dates for 1981 and the next ten years.\'94 Harry turned and looked at Draco, who swallowed. \'93
Of the dates that had already passed, only July 7, 1980 coincided with the date of a wizard\rquote s birth,\'94 Sirius said, looking hard at Draco. \'93Peter didn\rquote t know your parents at all. He had no compunctions about selling you to Voldemort t
o save his skin, if he found himself in a tight spot. In fact, you were his back-up plan. Should any Death Eaters corner him, his strategy was going to be to send them to Lucius Malfoy\rquote s house.\'94
\par 
\par Harry looked to see what Draco Malfoy\rquote s reaction to this was; oddly enough, he was glaring at Ron. \'93I always knew I didn\rquote t like that damn rat of yours,\'94 he said through his teeth.
\par 
\par \'93And I always knew he had some good points,\'94 Ron said back testily. \'93Turns out his biting Goyle that time wasn\rquote t the only good taste he showed. He was willing to give up you.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Ron!\'94 Ginny said now, sitting up and pulling away from her brother. \'93Draco was just a baby! And Pettigrew was willing to have him killed just to save his own skin!\'94
\par 
\par \'93And mine,\'94 Harry said quietly. He looked up at her. She bit her lip and looked back at him uncertainly, her eyes wide. Draco was sitting to his right and she looked across at the two of them, her eyes going back and forth; he\rquote 
d never seen anyone who looked so conflicted.
\par 
\par \'93Right,\'94 Sirius said yet again, clearly intent on moving on. \'93Anyway, soon after Harry was born, James started playing Quidditch again. He was away a lot, and Peter stayed with Lily to keep her company while he was gone.
\par 
\par \'93Peter actually lived a pretty peaceful life for a while; he fo
und a flat in Cardiff near Lily and James and Harry, and he continued to help Lily with the shopping and sometimes baby-sitting Harry--until the following summer, when some Death Eaters found him doing the shopping in Cardiff Market. They hauled him off a
nd did some--things--to punish him for not paying attention to his duties. That\rquote s when he gave up Draco\rquote s name. Said he was the Moonchild in the Prophecy. Voldemort didn\rquote 
t trust Peter completely, though, so he had a reading done on the child, and sure enough--everything pointed to his contributing to Voldemort\rquote s fall. It seemed clear that that was his destiny. Presumably, that\rquote 
s when Lucius Malfoy made the deal to protect his son.
\par 
\par \'93Even though he\rquote d been right about the Moonchild, Peter was kept under close watch after that, however, and when it seemed he wasn\rquote t making an effort to continue to interpret the Prophecy, he was \lquote Persuaded\rquote 
 to again give up some information. He found out what Malfoy had done, and thought that maybe it wouldn\rquote t be so bad if James a
nd Lily did the same, to save Harry. When he told Voldemort that Harry was the Lion, he also claimed that he was close to Lily and James and could convince them to raise Harry as Voldemort\rquote s servant.
\par 
\par \'93Of course, it didn\rquote t work out that way.\'94
\par 
\par "Lily and James would never agree to such a thing!" Remus Lupin exclaimed indignantly, breaking his silence. Harry swallowed, shrinking inside, remembering how he'd induced his mother to do something so against her nature....
\par 
\par Severus Snape nodded in agreement. \'93When he was holding me prisoner, he told me some of this. He said that the Dark Lord didn\rquote t want them knowing that he was a Death Eater. He didn\rquote 
t want anyone knowing--he was more useful that way. I certainly didn\rquote t know. I always thought you--\'94 he nodded at Sirius \'93--had betrayed Lily and James.\'94
 He had a small, rueful smile, and Harry realized that he and Sirius had buried the hatchet for good; they were inarguably fighting on the same side now, comrades. He remembered the way Sirius had been joking about Harr
y ruining his broom saving Snape; it had been entirely good-natured, and Snape hadn\rquote t really seemed to mind.
\par 
\par \'93I received instructions to go speak to her,\'94 Snape continued, \'93Because of a--prior relationship we\rquote d had--\'94 His voice had grown soft, and Harry saw that both Katie and Ginny looked shocked. \'93But that\rquote 
s when--when I knew I could no longer do his bidding. I hadn\rquote t been asked to do much since Lucius Malfoy recruited me...\'94 he nodded at Draco, who went whiter than usual. \'93All I\rquote d really done was to cul
tivate Barty Crouch, Jr., who was just one year out of school. I didn't think much of that; he was young and rebellious, hated his father with a passion. I thought he was simply trying to find a way to get under his father's skin. But now--now I was suppo
sed to convince Lily--of all people--to raise her son to be a loyal Death Eater. I--\'94 He paused, looking very grim. \'93I went to Albus Dumbledore and threw myself on his mercy. I didn\rquote t tell him about Crouch. Now I wish I had, of course.\'94
 He met Harry\rquote s eyes for a moment; Harry tried to show that he forgave him this, but he wasn\rquote t certain whether Snape understood. Snape\rquote s voice grew stronger again.
\par 
\par \'93I went to the place in the country where they had moved--James\rquote  parents had owned it. I tried to talk to Lily, I went through the motions of asking her to agree to raise Harry as the Dark Lord\rquote 
s servant, save his life, as well as her life and James\rquote  life. She refused, of course. I was half-relieved and half frustrated as hell that she was so stubbornly brave. We had a bit of a row and she kicked me out.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Right,\'94 Sirius said, going on, \'93So then Lucius Malfoy approached your dad,\'94 he said to Katie, \'93Since he worked with her as an Auror. He refused to try to convince her to raise Harry as Voldemort\rquote s servant. Malfoy 
started to get desperate; he felt that it was important to save all of the children in the Prophecy, or Voldemort might think they were all expendable. Lucius put Sam under Imperius. He resisted it. So he put your mum under Imperius,\'94
 he said to Katie; \'93Tried to get her to convince your dad to talk to Lily--\'94
\par 
\par He stopped. Harry looked at Katie, who broke down now, tears streaming down her face. Harry gathered her to him as she cried into his shoulder; she clutched at him and his heart ached. So many lives cut short or ruined....
\par 
\par While he held her, Harry saw that Ron, Ginny and Hermione looked somewhat embarrassed. Sirius waited until the noise from Katie\rquote 
s sobs subsided somewhat. Draco Malfoy was looking rather uncomfortable, hearing what his father had done to safeguard his son. Sam had told him, but it was pos
sible he'd only thought about this in terms of how it had affected Sam, who'd gone to prison, rather than how it had affected Katie, who'd grown up without her parents.
\par 
\par \'93While she was under the Imperius Curse,\'94 Sirius went on, \'93Katie\rquote s mother tried to convince Katie\rquote s father to speak to Lily, but he still refused. So she put Cruciatus on Katie to try to coerce him--\'94
\par 
\par Hermione gasped. \'93How old were you?\'94
\par 
\par Katie lifted her head from Harry\rquote s shoulder; her eyes were red and swollen. \'93I was two-and-a-half,\'94 she said softly.
\par 
\par Sirius drew his lips into a line. \'93So Sam disarmed his wife, but the Disarming Charm made her fly out a window and down four or five flights onto a solid brick terrace. Sam didn\rquote t contest the charges--he went to prison for ten years for cas
ting a spell that resulted in another person\rquote s death.\'94
\par 
\par Katie took the handkerchief that Harry offered her and wiped her face. When she had collected herself again she leaned on his shoulder once more and he wrapped his arms around her protectively. He roc
ked her slightly, kissing her brow, not caring that they were in a room full of people.
\par 
\par Sirius cleared his throat. \'93Erm. Well. There\rquote s really not much more to add. Once Voldemort realized that nothing was going to change James and Lily\rquote s minds, he decided the safest thing to do would be to eliminate Harry."
\par 
\par "I told Albus that Harry was marked for death," Snape said. Harry looked at him, no longer seeing his Potions Master, who rarely used his first name, but his stepfather, who had rarely called him by hi
s last name (Only in Defense Against the Dark Arts). "Albus met with them and convinced them to use the Fidelius Charm to hide."
\par 
\par "Voldemort learned that Dumbledore knew he was targeting Harry," Sirius said quietly. "He had a number of people watching his movements. As you all know, Dumbledore was the only wizard he really feared. Needless to say, Voldemort wasn\rquote 
t completely convinced that Peter was a sincere servant. He knew Peter had once been Lily's and James' close friend. So Voldemort had Lucius Malfoy
 spread the rumour that the Potters had a friend who was a traitor, to sow dissent in the ranks. Malfoy was evidently the only one who knew Peter was that traitor.
\par 
\par \'93James and Lily called me and Peter to Godric\rquote s Hollow to discuss the plan. They didn\rquote t contact Remus...\'94 He paused, looking at his friend uncomfortably.
\par 
\par \'93Because they assumed I was the traitor,\'94 Remus Lupin said quietly. \'93As a werewolf, I was highly suspect already. A large number of werewolves were throwing in their lot with Voldemort. That w
as well known. To throw suspicion off him--not that I think it was ever on him--Peter suggested I was the traitor, and Sirius believed I was the traitor as well.\'94
\par 
\par Sirius\rquote  mouth was a straight line again. \'93Remus was in contact with the four of us only sporadically, and when he was, he behaved in a rather dodgy way; he seemed to be hiding something...\'94
\par 
\par At that point, Remus Lupin blushed deeply. \'93Yes. Well, I was hiding something.\'94 He took a deep breath; he had a now-or-never look on his face. \'93I hadn\rquote t told anyone yet that I--I was seeing a young man from Dublin....I didn\rquote 
t know how anyone would respond to that. So I hedged about who I\rquote d been spending time with and I\rquote m sure it just wound up sounding like I was covering up my Death Eater activities.\'94
\par 
\par Harry noticed that Snape, while he looked surprised, did not look very surprised. Harry also remembered that Lupin had said he only started coming to terms with being bisexual after he was out of school. Of course, his friends--knowing there was a traitor
 in their midst-- would all distrust him if he seemed to be lying every time he was asked who he\rquote d been with....And so many other werewolves were followers of Voldemort....
\par 
\par Sirius went on: \'93Peter claimed that he really did think Lily and James would be safest if he was the Secret Keeper. He maintains that he didn\rquote t do it to give them up to Voldemort; he assumed that everyone would think it was me and that they
\rquote d come after me. If I really had been the Secret Keeper, I might have cracked under the pressure of torture. Or so Peter claimed. However, he hadn\rquote t thought it out very well; he hadn\rquote 
t figured out that the reason for there being a rumour that one of James and Lily\rquote s friends was a traitor was that Lucius Malfoy had started it, on orders from Voldemort himself, since he didn\rquote 
t fully trust Peter. On a hunch, he had some Death Eaters haul in Peter and started torturing him. Peter very soon gave up the information about where Lily and James were. That\rquote s when he begged Voldemort to spare Lily.
\par 
\par \'93Yes,\'94 Harry said softly, \'93Voldemort told her to step aside when he was trying to kill me. I--I heard it when I was in third year, when the dementors were too close to me....\'94
 He was still holding Katie, but suddenly, it seemed more like she was holding him. She had her head on his shoulder and she lifted it for a second and kissed him gently on the cheek.
\par 
\par Sirius looked like he was remembering living with the dementors, his eyes wide and dark. Then he shook himself, coming back to the present. \'93Interesting. He must have
 thought there was some use to which she could be put. She was an Auror, after all. I doubt he would have spared her merely to please Peter.\'94 Harry thought there was still a haunted look about him, despite his matter-of-fact words.
\par 
\par They were all silent. Harry looked up and saw Hermione staring into space, frowning. He could practically see the wheels spinning in her head. \'93What are you thinking about, Hermione?\'94 he asked her quietly.
\par 
\par Her frown deepened. \'93I was trying to work out the numbers for the Triangles. I don\rquote t understand it at all, and I got 170% on my last Arithmancy examination at the end of the term!\'94 She sounded very frustrated. \'93
One thing I do understand--if the second triangle makes a whole, that means its number totals nine. That\rquote s the number of wholeness and completion in Arithmancy. If you take eleven and five, which are your numbers,\'94 she said to Harry and Draco, 
\'93That makes sixteen. Adding the one and six gets you seven. So that means the Daughter of War has to have a number of two or eleven for the total to be nine.\'94
\par 
\par Harry frowned. \'93I know I\rquote ll regret asking this, but why is my number eleven instead of two if you\rquote re supposed to reduce everything to one-digit numbers?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, you never reduce eleven or twenty-two. They\rquote re very special numbers. You see--\'94
\par 
\par Sirius cleared his throat. \'93Perhaps you can continue this at another time, Harry and Hermione. I think that\rquote s all that needs to be discussed right now. Remus and Severus were going to help me comb the house for more Third Eyes,\'94 he said, re
ferring to the black-painted marbles he\rquote d shown them earlier.
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote ll help,\'94 Katie said shakily, still calming down after her cry. \'93Good practice.\'94
\par 
\par They all looked baffled, so Harry nudged her and whispered, \'93Tell them.\'94
\par 
\par Blushing prettily, she confessed, \'93I\rquote ve passed the screening tests and I\rquote m going to start Auror training in September.\'94
\par 
\par \'93That explains it,\'94 Draco Malfoy said, visibly moving away from her.
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94 she wanted to know, bristling.
\par 
\par \'93It explains why you already sound like a cop.\'94
\par 
\par Sirius laughed; Harry forgot how handsome he looked when he laughed. It seemed that Katie was noticing, too. \'93Don\rquote t try to change,\'94 he said to Katie. \'93If you\rquote re anything like your dad, I know you\rquote 
ll be good at it. Congratulations.\'94
\par 
\par \'93I can help with the sweep, too,\'94 Ron said. \'93And then we need to do our training,\'94 he added, to Lupin.
\par 
\par \'93We can help as well,\'94 Bill said, including Charlie in this.
\par 
\par \'93Can I try?\'94 Maggie asked uncertainly. \'93Or--can I at least watch?\'94
\par 
\par Snape looked at Sirius. \'93It would be educational, Sirius,\'94 he said evenly. Somehow Harry thought that wasn\rquote t the only reason he wanted to include Maggie. Sirius nodded.
\par 
\par \'93My parents have gone out visiting friends for the day and Cass, Floyd and Alan are at their jobs; Ursula has taken the children to Diagon Alley to get the things Orion will need for Hogwarts in September. I\rquote ll handle Cass and Floyd\rquote 
s room; they\rquote re very particular about their personal things not being disturbed. Whoever takes Orion\rquote s and Leo\rquote s room--watch out for traps.\'94
\par 
\par \'93We can take that,\'94 Bill said, referring to him and Charlie. \'93We\rquote re used to that, from the twins.\'94
\par 
\par Harry looked at Draco. \'93What do you reckon--a good time to catch up on some running?\'94 He turned to Ginny and Hermione. \'93The four of us could use the track around the loch.\'94
\par 
\par Malfoy and the girls agreed, and after they all changed clothes, they went down to the dungeons and walked through the tunnel to reach the cottage where the cars were parked. Sirius had given him the password for the door (Which had to be used coming
 and going) and soon they were all running by the shores of Loch Ascog, the mid-day sun overhead. They\rquote d brought small bottles of water, and when they paused at the half-way point around the loch to drink, Harry looked back at the \lquote castle.
\rquote  He hoped the others were making it safe; he hated to think of the Blacks\rquote  home being less private because of him.
\par 
\par As they relaxed on the shore, Sandy hissed to Harry, \'93The Daughter is three.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Hmm?\'94 he answered her sleepily. She repeated herself. He sat bolt upright.
\par 
\par \'93What did you say?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Must I repeat it again?\'94
\par 
\par \'93No, no. Sorry, Sandy. How do you--is something going to happen that--?\'94 He stopped, unsure whether he even wanted to know. He tensed up though, his time of relaxation evidently at an end.
\par 
\par He stared with trepidation at the loch. Some fishermen had driven a Range Rover up to the shore and were wearing tall boots like the ones in the castle\rquote 
s entrance hall, standing in the water, fly-fishing, speaking laconically to one another. Harry heard on
e of them talking about the castle ruins. He tried not to smile too much; if only they knew that it was a rather tall tower house with ten people living in it. Wait, he thought: eleven. I\rquote m the eleventh.
\par 
\par He was about to point out to Hermione that this was another eleven and tell her what Sandy had said about the Daughter, but Hermione said suddenly to Ginny, \'93Ginny, do you remember your oldest sister\rquote s birthday?\'94
\par 
\par Ginny immediately answered, \'93The first of September, nineteen-sev--\'94
\par 
\par "Right, right," Hermione said impatiently, staring into space again.
\par 
\par Harry watched her face as she thought about this. Suddenly her eyes went wide and she sprang to her feet. Harry pulled himself up next to her.
\par 
\par \'93What\rquote s wrong, Hermione?\'94
\par 
\par She whirled on him, grabbing his arms. \'93Harry!\'94 she said, her eyes very bright. \'93Would you say you love the Weasleys?\'94
\par 
\par Harry looked back at her awkwardly, then saw Ginny looking at him. \'93What--what do you mean?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I mean--would you say you love the Weasley family? The whole thing. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Ron, Maggie--\'94
\par 
\par He pulled his eyes away from Ginny again and frowned at Hermione. \'93Well--sure. I guess you could say that. Fine. I love the Weasleys. They\rquote re great.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Right!\'94 she said excitedly, then turned to Draco. \'93Draco--you love Ginny, right?\'94
\par 
\par He looked at his girlfriend. \'93Right. Granger, what are you--\'94
\par 
\par \'93And by extension, would you say that you love her family? You know, for her sake?\'94
\par 
\par He frowned now. \'93Some of her brothers I could do without--\'94
\par 
\par \'93But what about Maggie? Would you say you love her? You know, like a sister, as she\rquote s Ginny\rquote s sister and all?\'94
\par 
\par He looked completely baffled by her manic questions. \'93Sure. I reckon.\'94 He backed up from her a little. \'93Perhaps we should get you inside, Granger. I think you\rquote ve been out in the sun too long.\'94
\par 
\par Secretly, Harry agreed, although he didn\rquote t dare say anything. \'93So--if we manage to find Ginny\rquote s oldest sister, you\rquote ll love her too? As another one of Ginny\rquote s sisters?\'94
\par 
\par He shrugged. \'93Why not?\'94
\par 
\par She turned to Harry, who said, \'93Of course. But first we have to--\'94
\par 
\par \'93We have to find Annie Weasley!\'94 Hermione declared, interrupting him. He and Draco and Ginny all stared at each other, fearing for Hermione\rquote s sanity.
\par 
\par \'93Yeah, only I don\rquote t think you can actually make a living stating the obvious, Granger, so maybe during your seventh year you might want to focus on something a little more useful...\'94
\par 
\par \'93No, no, no!\'94 she practically crowed with delight now. \'93You don\rquote t understand. Annie is the Daughter of War! She\rquote s flame-haired. She comes from the Weasley family. You\rquote 
re both supposed to love her. And she was born at the beginning of Voldemort\rquote s reign of terror, making her a Daughter of War! Plus--\'94 She paused for effect, watching their faces.
\par 
\par \'93Well?\'94 Harry finally said. He couldn\rquote t take waiting anymore.
\par 
\par \'93Her number is eleven. Adding that to your eleven makes twenty-two, and adding Draco\rquote s five makes twenty-seven. That reduces to nine. Nine! To defeat Voldemort, you need Annie Weasley!\'94
\par 
\par She was practically dancing with glee. She started running along the shore again, calling over her shoulder, \'93Let\rquote s tell the others!\'94
 Since she had a head start, Harry, Ginny and Draco had to work to catch her up. As Malfoy ran next Harry, he muttered out of the corner of his mouth, \'93No wonder you broke up with her, Potter. She\rquote s mental.\'94
 Harry turned his head briefly and glared at him.
\par 
\par \'93Sod off, Malfoy,\'94 he said between gritted teeth, mentally saying something far worse. Then he put on a burst of speed and caught up with Hermione, running by her side the rest of the way back to the cottage. Was Hermione right? Was the Daughter
\rquote s number eleven, like his? Why had Sandy said three? Then, as they reached the cottage, Mercy came out to greet them, grinning.
\par 
\par Oh, Harry thought. I should have known. Trust Sandy. That\rquote s what she was talking about. Mercy\rquote s the daughter in her family, and the third child. And here she is....
\par 
\par So. That meant--
\par 
\par Annie Weasley was the Daughter of War.
\par 
\par He greeted Mercy and they listened to her chatter for a few minutes about what she and her mother and brothers had done in Diagon Alley that morning, but her words didn\rquote t really register in Harry\rquote 
s head. Instead, he found himself surreptitiously eyeing Draco Malfoy, who was laughing with the rest of them over Mercy\rquote s exaggerations and convoluted stories.
\par 
\par Now if only I can stand one more minute of being in Draco Malfoy\rquote s company, he thought. If he\rquote s necessary for Voldmort to be defeated--I just need to make sure I don\rquote t kill him first.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par When they were back in the castle proper, Hermione raced into the sitting room ahead of the other three and breathlessly told Sirius what she\rquote d already told Harry, Ginny and Draco. He sat up, looking very interested; he\rquote 
d been lounging by the cold fireplace in the sitting room, reading the Daily Prophet. Harry assumed that the search for Third Eyes was over. Snape, Maggie, Bill and Charlie seemed to have left. Ron and Lupin were nowhere in sight; probably doing were
wolf things, Harry assumed. Mercy had gone into the kitchen to have lunch with her mother and brothers.
\par 
\par \'93That does sound like she\rquote s the one....I suppose Bill\rquote s instincts were right on. We don\rquote t have to discuss all of this now. I understand that when Maggie\rquote s adoptive parents return, she\rquote 
s going to talk to them about whatever agency they used to adopt her, and hopefully we can start tracing what happened to her sister. A pity Peter made them owl-proof....\'94
\par 
\par Harry started to leave, then stopped. \'93Wait--Pigwidgeon came to the house in Appleby Magna. Maybe she\rquote s not owl-proof any more.\'94
\par 
\par \'93The owl didn\rquote t come to her, Harry,\'94 Hermione reminded him. \'93Pig came to Ron.\'94
\par 
\par His face fell. \'93Oh. Right.\'94
\par 
\par Sirius waved them off. \'93Don\rquote t worry about it now. We have plenty of other things to worry about. As it is, we found fourteen Third Eyes in various hiding places around the house. I\rquote ve destroyed them all, but it\rquote 
s damned frustrating. I wish I could feel confident that we\rquote ve gotten them all...\'94
\par 
\par Harry nodded to him, having no response for this. At this point, he was simply bracing himself for another frontal assault from Daisy Furuncle. This was the pleasant thought going through his brain as he started going up the four flights to his room.

\par 
\par \'93You take your shower first, Hermione,\'94
 Ginny was saying magnanimously as they trudged up the stairs. Draco was sharing with Ron (They were getting along surprisingly well, aside from Ron beating Draco at chess and telling him he thought highly of Wormtail for selling Draco out as a baby
) and Harry with Sirius, so neither of them had to wait while someone else used the shower. Draco stopped in front of Ginny and moved his face very close to hers.
\par 
\par \'93If you\rquote d like to join me, you won\rquote t have to wait to shower...\'94 he said softly, as he put hi
s arms on either side of her and started licking her earlobe. Harry and Hermione looked at each other; he saw that Hermione was rolling her eyes.
\par 
\par \'93Subtle, Malfoy. Very subtle.\'94
\par 
\par He looked up at her; he had removed his shirt upon returning to the castle, and the run had given his work-hardened muscles a sheen of perspiration. His grey eyes narrowed. \'93Is that how Potter got you into bed, Granger? By being subtle?\'94
\par 
\par Harry started to move toward him, and Hermione put out her arm to stop him, although she needn\rquote t have; Harry had frozen, staring at Malfoy\rquote s sternum, where the basilisk amulet was resting. \'93Don\rquote t bother Harry,\'94
 Hermione said, not noticing the amulet or Harry\rquote s reaction to it. \'93He\rquote s not worth it.\'94 However, he wondered whether she was thinking about the Prophecy, and how they couldn\rquote 
t afford for anything to happen to Malfoy. He also wondered when Malfoy had started wearing the basilisk. \'93You take the shower in our room, Ginny,\'94 Hermione went on, climbing the stairs wearily, oblivious to the fact that Harry\rquote 
s attention had been caught by the bright silver snake Malfoy was wearing. \'93I can ask Katie if she minds my using the one in Mercy\rquote s room.\'94
\par 
\par Ginny wormed her way past Malfoy, looking a little alarmed by him. Harry watched him watch her go, his eyes still narrowed. When she was out of earshot, Harry felt he just couldn\rquote t help what he said next.
\par 
\par \'93Well, she\rquote s still managing to resist your charms, I see.\'94
\par 
\par Malfoy turned, murder in his gaze. \'93It\rquote s all your fault,\'94 he spat, his fists clenched.
\par 
\par Harry\rquote s eyebrows flew up. \'93Oh really? How do you reckon that?\'94
\par 
\par Draco Malfoy opened his mouth to answer, then closed it again and went striding past Harry up the stairs to the third floor. \'93None of your business.\'94
\par 
\par What? Harry thought. He\rquote s going to say it\rquote s my fault and then not tell me? He watched the other boy go, then, shaking his head, he continued up the stairs to the top floor. Ginny had disappeared into
 the room she was now sharing with Hermione. Harry was soon under the warm spray of his own shower, pondering Draco Malfoy\rquote s accusation.
\par 
\par When he was dressed again, he started going down the spiral stairs to the ground floor, but he was sidetracked by finding both Katie and Hermione on the second floor landing, looking out of the window into the courtyard. He walked over to them.
\par 
\par \'93What\rquote s going on?\'94 he asked casually. Hermione and Katie both turned to him with slightly glazed expressions, then Hermione turned back to the window. Katie smirked.
\par 
\par \'93Just Ron,\'94 Katie said. \'93And Prof--I mean, Remus. Training.\'94
\par 
\par She let Harry move close enough to the window to see. Ron and Lupin were in the courtyard, wearing only loose-fitting black trousers, rather like pajamas. 
They were moving slowly in unison, as though fighting unseen opponents. They moved forward, their fists punching the air, then to the side; swinging around, they kicked and yelled simultaneously. Ron\rquote 
s freckles had become dense enough that they almost resembled a tan, like Charlie\rquote 
s, and his muscles rippled as he moved. He was definitely hairier than before he was bitten, but he was taking pains to trim his beard and mustache very closely every morning, so that they were like dark red lines on his skin rath
er than adding any discernible size to his thin face. Harry could see Lupin\rquote 
s muscles more clearly as well, and the scars he carried from years of transformation. Those marks, evidently, did not heal as quickly as other wounds sustained by a werewolf. Ron 
was relatively unmarked except for a pale line of skin on his left shoulder that was the legacy of his life-changing bite from Lupin. He\rquote d had the advantage of only having transformed once without the Wolfsbane Potion; he hadn\rquote 
t been doing himself damage every month for over thirty years.
\par 
\par Now Harry noticed that Hermione was wearing a different running bra than she\rquote d worn for their trek around Loch Ascog, and matching loose blue trousers. He frowned. \'93What are you up to, then?\'94 She smiled at him mischievously.
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m going to go down and join them. This isn\rquote t my gi obviously,\'94 she said, gesturing to her clothes. Her ghee? Harry thought, mystified. \'93But it\rquote s a bit hot for that. I think Ron and Remus have the right idea. I\rquote 
ve been training since the beginning of the holiday. I found a dojo only about half an hour from home. My dad\rquote s been taking me. I was saving it as a surprise for Ron.\'94
\par 
\par \'93You found a--a what?\'94 Harry said, no less mystified, but she didn\rquote t bother to answer him, instead skipping cheerfully down t
he spiral stairs to the ground floor and out the door into the courtyard. Ron stopped cold when he saw her. She walked to Lupin, bowed deeply, then took her place at Ron\rquote 
s side. Lupin nodded at them both, and they began again, Hermione moving in perfect unison with the other two, every gesture and kick done with complete precision and forethought.
\par 
\par \'93She knows it,\'94 Harry said, softly marvelling. Katie nodded.
\par 
\par \'93Right. She says she just learned that kata. That\rquote s what she called it. Actually, she gave it another Japanese name I can\rquote t remember just now. A title, rather. It is a kata. She learned it at that dojo. That\rquote 
s a kind of karate studio. She looks good, doesn\rquote t she?\'94
\par 
\par He watched the three of them continue their odd dance, intense concentration etched on each face. \'93They all do. I hope this helps Ron. I hope he\rquote ll be all right.\'94
\par 
\par Katie nodded, lacing her fingers through his. \'93I think he will be. He has her--she wants to be right by his side, every step of the way. And with Remus for a mentor, I don\rquote t see how he can go wrong. Plus, isn\rquote 
t Professor Snape--I mean--oh, hell, I don\rquote t think I can ever call him anything other than Professor Snape. Anyway--isn\rquote t he making that potion for both of them? That should help too.\'94
\par 
\par Harry looked into the courtyard again. \'93Yes. Without the potion, the full moon is really rough on them. I was with Ron when he transformed the first time. In my golden griffin form I was safe. I can\rquote t believe he\rquote 
s like this all because of Pettigrew....\'94
\par 
\par She shook her head. \'93He\rquote s in custody now, he\rquote s confessed, and your godfather is a free man. Think about that.\'94
\par 
\par He looked down at her; her eyes were very bright and she seemed a bit flushed. Was it from watching Ron and Lupin? he wondered. He cupped her cheek in his hand. His voice was barely a whisper. \'93If you insist. But I think, just maybe, right now--I
\rquote d rather think about you.\'94
\par 
\par She looked up at him, an expression of both hope and surrender lurking behind her eyes; when he leaned over and brushed his lips against hers she didn\rquote 
t pull back. She slid her arm up behind his neck slowly, to hold him in place, before gently parting her lips. Harry had quickly grown to like kissing Katie very much, and he moved his right arm around her waist, pulling her
 to him, closing the gap between them.
\par 
\par After a minute, he moved his lips down to her neck, gratified to hear a startled little gasp from her at the sensations he was sending through her. But he was perplexed when, a few moments later, she pushed him gently away and said, \'93
We need to talk, Harry.\'94
\par 
\par That doesn\rquote t sound good, he thought. She turned and went into Mercy\rquote s room, sitting on the window seat, identical to the one in Harry\rquote s room. She looked at him very earnestly.
\par 
\par \'93I wanted to talk to you about this first, because I wanted you to know I plan to do it now no matter what you think, so you might as well be all right with it instead of fighting me.\'94
\par 
\par He furrowed his brow. \'93Fighting you about what?\'94
\par 
\par She sighed. \'93I\rquote ve been thinking about this for a while, but I\rquote 
ve really been unable to get it out of my head since those damn invitations showed up last night. I mean--Alicia is my friend, and I never particularly like Fleur Delacour, but--oh, Harry, I just can\rquote t not tell Ginny about what that bastard did in 
the hedge maze! I couldn\rquote t live with myself. I\rquote ve felt awful. I feel guilty every time I see Ginny, and she\rquote s been so cold toward me I could almost believe that she knew I was keeping it from her if it weren\rquote 
t for the fact that she\rquote s still very cozy with Draco Malfoy....I have to do this. It\rquote s the right thing to do, and nothing you can say will change my mind.\'94
\par 
\par Harry looked at her. \'93I see.\'94 He swallowed. He tried to remember whether this would violate a promise he\rquote d made to Malfoy; after thinking about their talk in the scullery, he realized it didn\rquote t. \'93Well, I only told Malfoy she wouldn
\rquote t hear it from me. I even warned him I couldn\rquote t control you, that if you wanted to tell Ginny, you would. It isn\rquote t as though he hasn\rquote t been warned. I just--well--if you could, just keep me out of it. Don\rquote 
t say anything about me if you can help it.\'94 She nodded and he put his finger under her chin, lifting it up. \'93You\rquote re not worried, then?\'94
\par 
\par Her voice shook as she said, \'93About what?\'94
\par 
\par \'93About me running off to her when she dumps Malfoy.\'94
\par 
\par Katie turned her head away from him, and her eyes looked wet. \'93I can\rquote t let that rule me. I can\rquote t let that keep me from doing what\rquote s right.\'94
\par 
\par Harry turned her face back toward him, his hand gentle on her cheek. \'93Have I told you lately how amazing you are?\'94
 he said softly, leaning toward her to kiss her gently again, still cupping her cheek in his hand. It was a small, brief kiss, but he saw that it made her smile.
\par 
\par Then they heard a step on the stone stairs; the door to Mercy\rquote s room was still ajar. \'93In here!\'94 Katie said abruptly, yanking on Harry\rquote 
s arm and thrusting him into the en suite bathroom. She slammed the door on him, fortunately not amputating any fingers in the process, and he heard her open the door to the room wider (The hinges squeaked) and call, \'93
Ginny! Can you come in here? I need to talk to you.\'94
\par 
\par As he heard both girls\rquote  footsteps pass the bathroom, Sandy hissed to him, \'93She will not believe.\'94 His heart thudding, he very gently turned the doorknob an
d pulled the door back a fraction of an inch, so he could put his eye to the crack and see the two girls. Damn! Was there any way for him to tell Katie not to do it? How would it look for him to come rushing out of the bath? He was stuck now, and he felt 
like watching and listening to this would be like witnessing a train wreck he hadn\rquote 
t been able to prevent. It was worse than watching events unfolding in a Pensieve; you knew you truly had no way to change those. This was more like the time he and Hermione 
had used the Time Turner, and she had to prevent him from trying to get at the Invisibility Cloak....
\par 
\par Katie dove right in. \'93Ginny, there\rquote s something that\rquote s been on my mind about you and Draco...I wouldn\rquote t feel right if I didn\rquote t say something...\'94
\par 
\par They were both sitting on the window seat. Rather than seeming merely curious, Ginny looked downright hostile now. Harry frowned. Is she still going to be jealous of Katie, even through she\rquote 
s basically told me to sod off? he thought. This sentiment was fighting a 
war inside him to leap for joy that she evidently still cared, that she had been displaying classic symptoms of being jealous of Katie Bell since she got in the car at the Burrow....
\par 
\par If she left Draco Malfoy, would I still pursue her? he wondered. I don\rquote t want to be using Katie just to make Ginny jealous. He remembered his kiss with Katie mere moments before.
\par 
\par \'93What is it?\'94 Ginny said testily, her arms crossed.
\par 
\par Katie looked both grim and nervous. \'93Well, it\rquote s about something Draco did when we were on the job...\'94
\par 
\par Ginny widened her eyes. \'93Oh, is that how it is? It\rquote s just Draco, now? You had nothing to do with it?\'94
\par 
\par Katie stopped cold. \'93Me? What on earth are you talking about?\'94
\par 
\par Ginny rolled her eyes. \'93Draco\rquote s told me.\'94
\par 
\par Harry had never seen Katie look more shocked. \'93He told you? And--and you\rquote re all right with it?\'94
\par 
\par Ginny shrugged. \'93It was a joke. I\rquote m not going to get hacked off at him for that. Evidently you have no sense of humour. You have to face facts; he\rquote s my boyfriend.\'94
\par 
\par Katie looked flabbergasted. \'93A--a joke? You can\rquote t be serious. How can you call that a joke? And I know he\rquote s your boyfriend. My condolences.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Nice try. Yes, it was a joke. What? Did you think Draco really wanted to kiss you?\'94 Harry\rquote s eyes widened; so did Katie\rquote s, but she was speechless. \'93He wrote to me and told me everything that happened. I can go get it.\'94
 She disappeared and was heard going up the stairs again; in a minute she had returned with a folded parchment. Katie\rquote s eyes narrowed.
\par 
\par \'93Would you mind if I read that?\'94 she asked, her voice suspicious. Ginny shrugged again and handed it to her. Harry hoped she would read it aloud, which she did.
\par 
\par \'93Dear Ginny, I hope you won\rquote t be cross at me and take something I did the wrong way. It was all in fun, to teach Harry and Katie a lesson, but in case they twisted it when they told you about it, I wanted to make sure you knew the truth.\'94
 The truth! Harry fought the urge to hit something as Katie continued. \'93The two of them have been snogging so much when they\rquote re supposed to be working it\rquote s put me off my lunches. I think it\rquote 
s very unprofessional. At any rate, yesterday I wasn\rquote t two feet away from them when they started in again, and when they finally came up for air, I pulled Katie to me and said, \lquote Well, as long as this seems to be one of the 
perks of the job now, don\rquote t forget me,\rquote  and I kissed her.
\par 
\par \'93Harry was pretty hacked off. Katie pretended to be, but I had a hell of a time getting her off my face for someone who supposedly didn\rquote t want to be kissing me. They both said they\rquote d tell you about it. They also said they\rquote 
d tell you I\rquote d done worse, just to get me back. So be forewarned; anything they say, take it with a grain of salt. They\rquote re not very happy with me right now, to put it lightly. Those two have NO sense of humour.
\par 
\par \'93I miss you so much
, and they know that, and yet they have the nerve to throw their randy new relationship in my face. They even did it in the hedge maze on the property, and we could all hear them yelling and moaning. Unbelievable. I was bloody embarrassed to admit we went
 to the same school (Even if the muggles think it\rquote s some ruddy public school).
\par 
\par \'93Anyway, even though I thought what I did was damn funny at the time, I was afraid they would find a way to use it against me. Knowing how sweet and trusting you are, I was afraid you\rquote 
d assume the worst and so I wanted to write to you as soon as possible to confess my little prank. Please forgive me. It was all in fun (And because they were REALLY getting on my nerves). Did I mention that I miss you dreadfully? I\rquote m glad I
\rquote ll be seeing you soon, even if it is to celebrate Harry\rquote s birthday. All my love, Draco.\'94
\par 
\par Harry had no words to describe what he was feeling. Outrage didn\rquote t do it. Betrayal wasn\rquote t terrible enough. He was almost willing to think that if Draco Malfoy could write a letter like that, he could possibly be using the pen name \lquote 
Daisy Furuncle\rquote  to drag his name through the mud. After all, he knew how to Apparate, he could do magic whenever he wanted, and he could easily have gone down to the park to see Jeffries\rquote  show when
 his aunt went for healing. Maybe Mrs. Figg had the ingredients for Polyjuice Potion in her house, or he\rquote d managed to coerce a number of different witches to go to the Prophet offices for him....
\par 
\par Harry had been momentarily distracted by these thoughts, but now he focused his attention again on the two girls. Katie was as bowled over as Harry, it seemed.
\par 
\par \'93I don\rquote t believe this!\'94 Katie\rquote s voice rose in pitch. \'93He never kissed me! And Harry and I certainly have done no snogging on the job or shagging in a hedg
e maze! It was your precious boyfriend who was doing the shagging. We heard him, clear as day, with our employer\rquote s daughter.\'94
\par 
\par Ginny\rquote s arms were still crossed and she looked at Katie with one eyebrow raised. \'93Mmm. He said you or Harry would say something like that....\'94
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m not just saying it!\'94 Katie was very near hysteria now. \'93It\rquote s true!\'94 Her colour had risen and Harry could see she was very frustrated at not being believed.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, and I\rquote m supposed to believe that after finding the two of you in bed together at the pub?\'94 Harry knew he shouldn't have felt hopeful at the slightly jealous tone in her voice, but he couldn't help it.
\par 
\par \'93That--that was the first time! That has nothing to do with anything. I\rquote m telling you the truth, Ginny. And you should have heard his rationalizations about why he slept with her! He\rquote 
d been pressuring you because he was going mad, and he reckoned now he had an outlet, he could let you wait as long as you needed to. Harry and I both heard them! Ask him if you like!\'94
\par 
\par Ginny shook her head. \'93I wouldn\rquote t have believed it of you Katie, but now--\'94
\par 
\par Katie smiled. \'93You believe me?\'94
\par 
\par \'93--I believe Draco when he told me you were trying to break up the two of us so you could go after him and so Harry could go after me. He hadn\rquote t figured that out yet when he wrote me the letter. He told me in Leicestershire that that\rquote 
s what he suspected. But it\rquote s not going to work. You\rquote re not going to get my boyfriend, Katie Bell. And I can\rquote t believe you\rquote re using Harry this way. He deserves far better.\'94
\par 
\par Now Katie had the appearance of someone about to do some long-distance spewing. \'93Me! And Draco Malfoy! I told you--he didn\rquote t kiss me. Trust me, he wouldn\rquote t be alive if he\rquote d tried that on me.\'94 Harry believed this. \'93I wouldn
\rquote t take him if he was the last male mammal on the planet! I\rquote d sooner go in for bestiality and take my chances with cross-species breeding before I\rquote d go for him. Although actually, as he\rquote 
s not human, that would also qualify for cross-species breeding. You must be mad if you think I want to be with Draco Malfoy!\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well--Harry was rather carrying a torch for me for a while. Don\rquote t get me wrong--I was crushing on him when I was younger, and he had every right to think--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--I think he still is--\'94 Katie said quietly, looking down; then she looked like she wanted to bite her tongue, as this partially supported Ginny\rquote s accusation.
\par 
\par \'93Then why would you tell me something that--if I believed it--would be the sort of thing designed to break up me and Draco if you really wanted to be with Harry? And if you think Harry still has feelings for me? If I didn\rquote 
t have a boyfriend, and if--as you yourself say-- Harry\rquote s still carrying a torch for me, don\rquote t you think he\rquote d come after me? If you really wanted to be with him you wouldn\rquote t want to break us up.\'94
\par 
\par Katie lifted her chin. \'93I don\rquote 
t know where--if anywhere--my relationship with Harry is going, but I do know that when I see a cheating bastard I feel it my duty to point it out! If that means you two break up and Harry decides to pursue you, so be it, but at least I know I\rquote 
ve done the right thing!\'94 Her colour had risen, and suddenly Harry felt even more conflicted about his feelings for both of them.
\par 
\par Ginny looked at the date on the letter. \'93Draco wrote this weeks ago. In the letter he says it happened \lquote Yesterday.\rquote  Is that correct?\'94
\par 
\par \'93The things that happened \lquote Yesterday\rquote  when that letter was written are the things I said happened, not what he said happened. But otherwise, the date is correct, yes.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Hmmm,\'94 Ginny said in a musing sort of voice. She started fingering a silver chain around her neck. \'93So--you feel so obliged to point out a cheating boyfriend to his unsuspecting girlfriend, yet you waited all this time? Why didn\rquote 
t you tell me sooner, if he really did what you said? Wouldn\rquote t that be more like covering up for a cheating boyfriend? Of course, what you\rquote re saying happened never did, so it\rquote s really neither here nor there...\'94
\par 
\par \'93But--but--\'94
\par 
\par She shook her head. \'93I feel sorry for poor Harry. He likely has no idea you were using him to try to make Draco want you. I\rquote m assuming you knew we weren\rquote t sleeping together. Harry overheard us having a little row about that on Draco
\rquote s birthday, and I suppose he told you. Oh, don\rquote t get your hopes up--we made up. But I imagine you thought your little performance in the hedge maze would tempt Draco into your arms....\'94
\par 
\par Katie looked like she really wanted to retch now. \'93Is that what he told you? And for the last time, the first and only time was in the pub and we did nothing on the job! The maze was Draco and that other girl!\'94
\par 
\par Ginny rolled her eyes, ignoring Katie. \'93And then you tried it again, knowing the three of us would be walking into the room at the pub--\'94
\par 
\par \'93We did not! If we\rquote d thought anything of the sort we\rquote d have been wearing some clothes, for one thing. What do you take me for?\'94
\par 
\par \'93You\rquote re the one who was in a bed naked with someone you\rquote d been seeing for less than a month. What do you think?\'94 Then Harry noticed that, as she was talking, she had pulled the thi
ng that was on the silver chain out of her blouse. He saw it for only a split second before she clutched it tightly in her hand.
\par 
\par The other basilisk amulet.
\par 
\par \'93I--I--\'94 Katie floundered, speechless. She looked at Ginny, helpless in the face of so much misinformation.
\par 
\par Ginny\rquote s expression changed suddenly as she clutched the amulet. She looked startled; woken up. Then she looked angrier than Harry had ever seen her. She strode over to the bathroom and abruptly pushed open the door, banging him on the knee with it.

\par 
\par \'93Ow!\'94 he yelled, even though he\rquote d half-anticipated it. She threw herself at him, pounding his chest with her fists.
\par 
\par \'93I can\rquote t believe you had her--had her force herself on him just so--just so--\'94 She weakened and stopped her assault, looking up at him, tears running down her face now. He didn\rquote 
t try to defend himself or stop her attacking him; her eyes were wild. Did she really believe Draco Malfoy? he wondered. Or did she feel that she had to?
\par 
\par He looked down at the basilisk amulet hanging against her blouse, then up at her flushed face. \'93What do you see when you touch it, Ginny?\'94
 he whispered. She looked at him for an agonizing half-minute, standing tantalizingly close to him, her eyes wide with fright. Then she turned and fled the room.
\par 
\par \'93Stay away from my boyfriend!\'94 she threw back at Katie before running up the stairs. Harry wondered whether she was truly referring to Draco Malfoy.
\par 
\par He sheepishly emerged from the bathroom. Katie sagged against the window, still trying to get her breath. Harry shook his head and sat next to her. \'93I\rquote m sorry. I should never--I had no idea the depths to which he could sink....\'94
\par 
\par Katie sighed, her breathing finally normalizing. \'93That\rquote s all right, Harry. I just need you to promise me one thing--\'94
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par She looked at him with a steely glint in her eye. \'93Get. Her. Away. From. Draco. Malfoy. Save her, Harry. He\rquote s gotten into her head. She\rquote 
s no longer sane! Whether you convince her to be with you or just not to be with him, do whatever you have to do to break them up!\'94
\par 
\par Harry smiled. \'93Yeah, only--anything I say is immediately suspect, isn\rquote t it? Even more so now than before.\'94 Then he clamped his mouth shut abruptly; he didn\rquote 
t want to make it sound like he was accusing her of making things worse. He remembered now the Draco from his other life and the many schemes they\rquote d hatched with their Slytherin cunning. He looked at her with a sly smile.
\par 
\par \'93Did I ever tell you that the Sorting Hat wanted to put me into Slytherin?\'94
\par 
\par She looked shocked. \'93No!\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, obviously it didn\rquote t, but--I can be as crafty as a Slytherin when I want to be...\'94
\par 
\par A grin pulled at the corner of her mouth. \'93Care to tell me what you have in mind? I can keep a secret.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Nothing in particular yet. But after school starts, I\rquote m going to stay on my toes. I reckon with a school full of girls, Malfoy\rquote s bound to slip up sooner or later. I\rquote 
m going to make sure I know about it when he does--and that Ginny knows soon after that. And I mean, the truth. The real truth. Not Draco Malfoy\rquote s version of the truth.\'94
\par 
\par Katie looked outraged again. \'93I can\rquote t believe he had the nerve to claim that I--I--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Believe it. Nothing\rquote s beyond him. I\rquote ve learned that the hard way. He has a way of convincing Ginny to do things that common sense should tell her she shouldn\rquote t do--like when 
the two of them pretended he was assaulting her in the potions dungeon....\'94
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par \'93It was an act, and the end result was that his dad was sent to Azkaban, but still--I thought Ron would kill him and wind up in Azkaban himself. And when I carried Ginny 
up to the hospital wing, all I could think was that it was a trauma that would haunt her for the rest of her life....\'94
\par 
\par Katie shook her head. \'93I can\rquote t believe they did that...\'94 she whispered incredulously.
\par 
\par \'93I don\rquote t blame Ginny--like I said, he gets inside her head. The same thing happened when she was in first year--\'94 he started to say, then stopped himself.
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Er, um--nothing. Never mind.\'94 He forced a yawn and stretched. \'93I\rquote m exhausted after my run. Care to join me in the kitchen?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Sounds good. Arguing with a brainwashed person has me done in. I need some good strong tea. And then maybe a nap.\'94
\par 
\par They walked down to the kitchen together, holding hands. He marvelled at her nerve; he didn\rquote t think there were many girls in her position who would have confronted Ginny with that information.
\par 
\par He thought again about the elaborate story Draco Malfoy had woven, and the fact that they were both now wearing t
he basilisk amulets.  Had she seen him or Malfoy? he wondered again. He had no idea how he was ever going to break through the spell her boyfriend seemed to have cast on Ginny Weasley. He wasn\rquote 
t sure where his relationship with Katie was going, but he felt very strongly that--Prophecy or no Prophecy--what he really needed to do was to find whatever evil diary Draco Malfoy had crawled out of and stab it very hard with a basilisk\rquote s tooth.

\par 
\par 
\par Not surprisingly, Ginny decided she\rquote d stayed at Ascog long enough. She said she wanted to be home with her parents, getting to know her sister better. Draco Malfoy didn\rquote 
t want to stay without her, and he wanted to get back to work and make more money, at any rate. He was invited to the wedding at the end of August, but as he wasn\rquote t in the wedding party he wouldn\rquote t be staying at the Spinnets\rquote 
 the week before. He was going to Apparate to Diagon Alley, and Mrs. Figg was going to pick him up outside the Leaky Cauldron. (The anti-Apparition spells on her house prevented him from traveling 
there using that method, and there were no really safe Apparition points in the village).
\par 
\par Katie was going back to her dad\rquote s as well, but Harry was worried about her driving the whole distance by herself (She could just Apparate, but Sam needed his car bac
k). On the other hand, suggesting that Katie and Draco share the car--just the two of them--all the way back to Mrs. Figg\rquote s wasn\rquote t going to go over well after the Katie-Ginny confrontation.
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote ll go with you,\'94 Harry said as they sat at the breakfast table the next morning. He and Katie were sitting with Sirius at one end of the long table, Sirius\rquote  nephews and niece at the far end. Everyone else had already eaten. \'93
I can\rquote t help with the driving, but at least you won\rquote t be alone. I can use your fire to come back here by Floo.\'94
\par 
\par Sirius insisted that they check in frequently. (Mrs. Weasley had sent Hedwig to Ascog, so they could take her along.) He also gave the two of them a map of wizarding Britain, which included how to find the wizarding quarters of the large cities they
\rquote d be passing through and a number of wizarding pubs with good accommodations. \'93Keep me abreast of where you are; I can Apparate to your location and ride with you some. I know you\rquote re going to begin Auror training soon,\'94
 he said to Katie, \'93But I still felt better when Harry was traveling with three people who were of age, not just one.\'94
\par 
\par Harry bristled. "I\rquote m of-age now, too, remember. And Lupin--er, Remus--can tell you about my Dark Arts skills.\'94
\par 
\par Sirius nodded. \'93Yes, yes, Harry, you\rquote re very impressive. I just want to make sure you don\rquote t get cocky, all right?\'94 Sirius sighed, and Harry was ashamed of having been so touchy; he wouldn\rquote 
t have objected to Severus Snape suggesting the same thing, but then, in his other life, Snape had been his father figure for more than ten years, with instincts that were usually spot-on. Sirius wasn\rquote 
t used to his new role as a surrogate father and his insecurity showed frequently.
\par 
\par Katie was frowning at Sirius. \'93That\rquote s right--you can Apparate! But--you were in Azkaban...\'94
\par 
\par Sirius raised an eyebrow at her. \'93I was cleared, remember? And why shouldn\rquote t I be able to Apparate?\'94
\par 
\par Katie looked guiltily at Harry, who immediately said to Sirius, \'93You know. Because former Azkaban prisoners aren\rquote t allowed to.\'94 He turned to Katie. \'93It didn\rquote t occur to me that would apply to Sirius, though, as he was innocent.\'94

\par 
\par Sirius shook his head. \'93There\rquote s no ban on former Azkaban prisoners Apparating,\'94 he said quietly, looking quizzically at Katie. She drew her lips into a line, looking down at the table.
\par 
\par \'93I know,\'94 she said, looking up at Harry again. \'93That was a lie, Harry. I\rquote m sorry.\'94
\par 
\par Harry was confused. \'93Why should you lie about that? So your dad is permitted to Apparate?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well--\'94 she began, her voice shaking.
\par 
\par \'93--Or didn\rquote t he ever get his Apparition test?\'94 Harry suggested.
\par 
\par Sirius shook his head. \'93All Aurors have to have their Apparition test. Can you imagine an Auror who couldn\rquote t Apparate?\'94 Harry hadn\rquote t thought about that; it was still slightly foreign to him, the idea of gentle Sam working as an Auror.

\par 
\par \'93You see,\'94 Katie started to say to them both softly, looking around. Mercy and her brothers were sitting at the other end of the kitchen table, eating their breakfasts still. \'93There\rquote s--there\rquote s not much magic Dad can do anymore. A
t all. The dementors--they sucked it out of him. All of his magic, I mean. Or almost all.\'94
\par 
\par Harry remembered that Sirius had said, in the Shrieking Shack at the end of his third year, that the reason he was able to hold onto his powers was that the dementors hadn\rquote t driven him mad; when he was a dog, his emotions didn\rquote 
t feel like human ones to them. On top of that, his overriding thought was that he was innocent. Since this wasn\rquote t a happy thought, they couldn't suck out of him. But then he frowned, remembering the lecture he\rquote 
d had from Mrs. Figg and then Hermione about magic genes. \'93Are you sure? Maybe they didn\rquote t turn off his magical genes. They might have just--just messed around with his mind so he doesn\rquote t believe in himself.\'94
 He was reminded of Rodney Jeffries. \'93That\rquote s it!\'94 he said suddenly. \'93What Sam needs to do is find Rodney Jeffries! My aunt was a muggle, and he made her believe in herself and turned on enough of her magic genes that she\rquote 
s actually a witch now! Or at least, I think she is. I\rquote m sure he could help your dad!\'94
\par 
\par Sirius shook his head. \'93No one knows where Jeffries is, Harry. And even if we did know--he\rquote s wanted by the magical as well as the muggle authorities. I don\rquote t think the Ministry of Magic wants him going around creating more magical pe
ople at this time....\'94
\par 
\par \'93But Sam\rquote s already a wizard!\'94 he said forcefully.
\par 
\par \'93Not really,\'94 Katie said softly. \'93Not any more. That\rquote s why he\rquote s been working for Aberforth since he\rquote s been out; he can\rquote t really function as a wizard any longer. The dementors--\'94
\par 
\par They were all silent. Then Harry had a horrid idea; if the dementors could do that over time to a person who\rquote 
d been with them in Azkaban, what about someone like his Aunt Petunia? Or might the Ministry--or Voldemort--use dementors to leech the magical ability out of other people? He\rquote d been afraid that the Ministry would try to turn \lquote New\rquote 
 witches and wizards back into muggles, and Voldemort would then use the technique on muggle-born magical people--or just anyone he didn\rquote t like. In retrospect, he realized t
hat perhaps no new technique needed to be invented--other than finding a way to speed it up. It had been in use by the Ministry all along, but the dementors--except during Harry\rquote 
s third year of school--had been segregated at Azkaban, where the rest of the population--wizards and muggles alike--wouldn\rquote t be exposed to them. Now Harry had an even better understanding of why that was.
\par 
\par He looked around the room again; the children had finished eating and were dutifully putting their plates in the sink. Mercy tu
rned her head suddenly and gave him one of her disturbing, penetrating gazes, with those odd pale eyes. He shivered involuntarily.
\par 
\par He also wondered whether this room was really empty of Third Eyes. Somehow, it didn\rquote t seem the time to bring up his dementor
 fears, just in case. He already knew Dumbledore worried about the dementors becoming followers of Voldemort. He remembered huddling in the corner of his cell in Azkaban....
\par 
\par \'93But,\'94 Katie went on, \'93When you were in Azkaban, it was for even longer than my dad. And he wasn\rquote t in solitary--there were others around whose minds the dementors could feed on. Why weren\rquote t you affected the same way my dad was?\'94

\par 
\par \'93Because I am an Animagus,\'94 Sirius said simply. \'93Yes, I had two dementors posted outside my cell. And whenever I was in my human form, they made me feel utterly miserable and wretched. But when I was in my Animagus form, they couldn\rquote 
t really get hold of my mind; it didn\rquote t feel like a human mind to them, and my emotions didn\rquote t feel like human emotions. Technically, they weren\rquote t. That\rquote s also how I was able to escape.\'94
\par 
\par Harry vividly remembered walking past the dementors in his griffin form, leaping from the barren rock with his wings spread, facing the coast of Scotland... Suddenly he had a thought. \'93Wormtail! He\rquote 
s an Animagus too! Did you tell them how you escaped? Do they know that they have to prevent Wormtail from doing the same thing?\'94
\par 
\par Sirius nodded. \'93Numerous precautions have been made against Peter being able to transfigure himself. They know the danger. I 
explained to the Ministry exactly how it was that I escaped, and how I prevented the dementors affecting my mind as much as the other prisoners. Although, once again--I believe Peter thinks he is safest in custody, and is unlikely to leave that safety.
\'94
\par 
\par Harry frowned. \'93Yeah, and I believed I helped bring him in against his will. Don\rquote t you think it\rquote s also possible that they won\rquote t be as vigilant about a prisoner they think is there willingly? Don\rquote t you think he knows that?
\'94
\par 
\par Sirius considered this. \'93You make a good point. I\rquote m going down to the Ministry in a few minutes to see Peter; I\rquote ll bring it up with the appropriate parties. I should be back before lunch.\'94
\par 
\par \'93To see Peter!\'94 Harry was shocked; and suddenly, he realized that all during the recitation of Wormtail\rquote s crimes, Sirius had called his old comrade \lquote Peter,\rquote 
 not Pettigrew or Wormtail. He scrutinized Sirius, who hardly seemed to be the same man willing to risk going back to Azkaban for killing Peter Pettigrew only three years earlier.
\par 
\par \'93Yes, Harry. I\rquote m going to visit him. There may be something else he can tell us before they take him off to Azkaban. They\rquote ll be stunning him before they do that, by the way; he won\rquote t be revived until he\rquote 
s safely in his new cell.\'94
\par 
\par Harry considered this; in some ways, it didn\rquote t seem fair that Wormtail wouldn\rquote 
t have that terrifying first glimpse of the stone fortress that he had had when he was taken to prison in his other life. On the other hand, if being stunned prevented him from escaping, it really did seem like the best course of action.
\par 
\par Ron was looking stunned himself when Harry told him he was driving back to London with Katie.
\par 
\par \'93Erm, just the two of you? And after all--the two of us are here to see you, and now you\rquote re running off to London.\'94 They were in the courtyard; Harry was in a chair he\rquote 
d carried out from the desk in the sitting room and Ron was on a stone bench that was built into the outer wall. Harry tilted the chair back on two legs, his feet up on the bench beside Ron. Hermione was lying down on the bench, her head on Ron\rquote 
s leg, sleeping off her exhaustion. She\rquote d been for an early run with Harry, Ron, Draco and Ginny, and then trained with Ron in the courtyard. Ron touched her shining curls tenderly as she slept.
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m not abandoning you,\'94 Harry assured him. \'93I\rquote ll be coming back by Floo. It will only take a couple of days. We can cut across the country. We don\rquote t have to go by way of Leicestershire and Exeter, since we won\rquote 
t be stopping at your place and at Maggie\rquote s. We really only brought the car coming up here because we couldn\rquote t very well Floo to Maggie\rquote s house. And maybe--this will give the two of you a chance to get closer.\'94
 He raised an eyebrow, hoping Ron would take the hint. His best friend grimaced.
\par 
\par \'93Harry, you have no idea how much I want for us to get closer.\'94 Ron\rquote s voice was even more suggestive than Harry\rquote s. \'93But--I don\rquote t want to rush things. I don\rquote t ever want to hurt her. I mean physically. It\rquote 
s a good thing I can do magic whenever I want now; I\rquote m still using Reparo all the time, it seems....\'94
\par 
\par Harry smiled. \'93I\rquote ve only seen you break two things since you\rquote ve been here. And they were easily fixed. Hermione isn\rquote t a teacup, Ron. She\rquote s tougher than you think.\'94
\par 
\par Ron looked down at her sleeping face again, his feelings plain. \'93You know what she\rquote s done, don\rquote t you, Harry?\'94 he whispered, awe in his voice as he regarded her. \'93In addition to her Animagus training, she\rquote 
s been going to the dojo, meditating--\'94 Harry nodded.
\par 
\par \'93For you. And you did it first, partly for her. I couldn\rquote t believe how you managed to calm M
aggie when I almost sent her off the deep end. You did slip a bit this morning, though. I thought you were going to kill Malfoy when he started talking about Ginny and Hermione.\'94 As usual, Malfoy had felt it necessary to comment on the girls\rquote 
 running outfits. Ron frowned deeply.
\par 
\par \'93Malfoy will probably be my ultimate test. If I can prevent him from getting me hacked off, I\rquote ll know I\rquote m completely in control of my werewolf temper...\'94
\par 
\par Harry laughed. \'93You never needed to be a werewolf to get hacked off at him before. I reckon it\rquote s a good thing Malfoy\rquote s leaving before you rip his arms off.\'94
 Ron grinned, evidently enjoying thinking about this almost as much as visualizing Draco Malfoy the Amazing Bouncing Ferret. Harry went on, \'93He did share the driving on the way
 here, though. Ah, well. I suppose even the most annoying person can sometimes be useful in spite of himself....\'94
\par 
\par Ron turned his frown into a lopsided smile. \'93Well, on this trip you and Katie won\rquote t have to worry about anyone walking in on you.\'94
\par 
\par Harry shifted his foot to the side and lightly kicked Ron\rquote s arm. \'93That\rquote s not why I\rquote m going, you prat.\'94
\par 
\par Ron\rquote s smile was broader now. \'93No, but if you\rquote re going to be on the road for a couple of days, you\rquote ll definitely have opportunity....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Are you going to continue to live vicariously through me or are you and Hermione--?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Don\rquote t, Harry. Don\rquote t say it.\'94 Ron looked angry now. Harry shrugged.
\par 
\par \'93You just seem awfully interested in my sex life.\'94 He looked at Ron\rquote s face again to see what his reaction would be to this statement.
\par 
\par \'93Well, I can\rquote t have a--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Why the hell not?\'94 Harry interrupted him impatiently.
\par 
\par Ron looked grumpier by the moment. \'93You don\rquote t have to worry about whether you\rquote re going to put Katie in hospital with broken bones, Harry. Last month, before the full moon--I can\rquote 
t describe it. There was this kind of mania running through me. I thought I would go absolutely mad. It wasn\rquote t hard for me to understand that day why people who are nutters are called \lquote Lunatics.\rquote 
 The moon was certainly making me insane. I hate to think what I could have done to another human being in the same room with me....\'94
\par 
\par \'93So don\rquote t spend that time with another person!\'94 Harry said, irritated. \'93Only do--that sort of thing--during other times of the month! How hard is that to work out?\'94 He stopped just short of calling Ron stupid, feeling this wouldn
\rquote t go over very well. But then Hermione started to stretch and yawn; she turned over so she was facing up, her eyes still closed. Ron put his finger up to his mouth.
\par 
\par \'93Don\rquote t wake her,\'94 he mouthed. Harry crossed his arms. He felt this was just an excuse to discontinue the conversation. He pulled out a Quidditch magazine he\rquote d been looking at and started leafing thr
ough the pages, every now and then showing something to Ron in silence, while Hermione slept on.
\par 
\par At some point--Harry wasn\rquote t sure how long the three of them had been sitting there--Hermione started making a sort of humming noise, and, looking over his mag
azine, Harry saw that Ron had been lightly stroking her arm. Her eyes still closed, she reached up and found Ron\rquote 
s chin, her fingers dreamily tracing his jawline. Harry tried to suppress a smile. He rose unobtrusively and crept into the house, going to the
 kitchen for a cold drink. There was a door in the corner of the kitchen which led to a large pantry. The pantry was charmed to be very cold, and functioned like a walk-in refrigerator. Harry helped himself to some ice-cold pumpkin juice, then walked back
 out into the kitchen drinking it, settling himself at the long table to read the Daily Prophet that was scattered there.
\par 
\par The windows into the courtyard were open, and when he heard a small groan, he looked up, smiling as he saw the reason for the groan. Waking, Hermione had pulled Ron\rquote s face down to hers; he had lifted her up slightly so that her head wasn\rquote 
t on his lap any more. Their mouths were locked and his hand was in her hair, holding her face up to his. It barely registered on Harry\rquote s consciousness that Draco Malfoy had entered the room; seeing the expression on Harry\rquote 
s face, he turned to look out the windows. Suddenly, too quickly for Harry to stop him, he strode to the open window and stuck his head out of it, yelling at them, \'93Get a room, already, Weasley and Granger!\'94
\par 
\par He slammed the window shut and Hermione and Ron looked up in alarm; Harry thought it was possible they\rquote d forgotten that anyone could see them in the courtyard. Would they go get a room? Harry wondered. With only each other for compa
ny for a couple of days, maybe things would progress a little, Harry thought.
\par 
\par But then Draco Malfoy turned away from the windows and met Harry\rquote s frown, returning it.
\par 
\par \'93What\rquote re you looking at, Potter?\'94 he grouched, walking to the pantry.
\par 
\par \'93What am I looking at?\'94 Harry responded, breathing heavily through his nostrils. \'93I\rquote m looking at a dirty rotten liar, that\rquote s what I\rquote m looking at.\'94
\par 
\par Malfoy emerged from the pantry with his own glass of pumpkin juice. He was grinning. \'93Oh. Right. Ginny told me that Katie tried to rat me out. Nice try, Potter, but--as usual--I was one step ahead of you.\'94
\par 
\par Harry wanted to wrap his hands around his throat; for a minute he wished he had Ron\rquote s werewolf strength. \'93I had nothing to do with it. Katie decided to tell Ginny because she didn\rquote 
t feel right keeping the information to herself. She wanted Ginny to know just what you are. Unfortunately, she still doesn\rquote t know.\'94
\par 
\par Draco Malfoy made a mock-sad face. \'93Aw. Am I supposed to be contrite and falling over myself to apologize? You\rquote ll grow old waiting for that.\'94
\par 
\par \'93I know. You haven\rquote t got a conscience, so I know better than to wait for you to behave like people who do. Listen, if Ginny isn\rquote t ready to sleep with you and that\rquote s all you\rquote 
re interested in, fine; break up with her and see any girl you like. But don\rquote t run around shagging other girls behind her back. Make a clean break.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, you\rquote d like that, wouldn\rquote t you? I don\rquote t think so, Potter. You\rquote re not my boss, you know. We aren\rquote t at school right now. You\rquote re not Head Boy of the world. You\rquote r
e Captain of the Hogwarts Dueling Club, not of Draco Malfoy. And I don\rquote t even know what the hell you are when it comes to the damn house-elves....\'94
\par 
\par \'93General of the Elven Army,\'94 Harry said between clenched teeth. Malfoy laughed.
\par 
\par \'93General of the Elven--\'94 he tried to echo, in a high-pitched voice, but he couldn\rquote t get the words out for his laughter. \'93Oh--that\rquote s just too much, Potter. I think I\rquote m going to rupture something--\'94
 He leaned against the stone wall, laughing harder.
\par 
\par Harry rose; he resisted the urge to lay hands on him, instead going to the door. \'93Good. You\rquote ll save me the trouble of rupturing something for you.\'94
 He stalked out of the kitchen, going down the stairs to the dungeons. He felt a little aimless, and decided to go for a swim in the underground pool. He had to walk down two levels below the ground floor, then let himself into the men\rquote 
s changing room where he knew Sirius had put some swimming togs for him. After changing and selecting a towel, he went through to the pool room, which had an ar
ched ceiling rather like the Great Hall at Hogwarts; it was enchanted to look like the outside sky at all times, so that instead of feeling like you were swimming in an underground grotto, it appeared that the pool was out in the open, under a blazing hot
 
summer sun (Far hotter, in fact, than the real sun that day). The walls were painted with an animated mural, as well, of a thriving garden (Birds, squirrels and even gnomes ran through the garden, but could never escape from their two-dimensional prison),
 and the interior of the pool itself was painted turquoise blue, making the clear, shimmering water take on the same colour.
\par 
\par He found that he wasn\rquote t the only one who wanted to cool off in the pool; Ginny was already there, relaxing on the steps that led down into the water. Evidently, she wasn\rquote 
t planning to leave Ascog just yet. She was leaning back with her eyes closed, as though absorbing the sun, but Harry knew that the enchantment didn\rquote t actually allow people to tan or burn. He swallowed; her long, slim
 legs extended from her simple white one-piece swimming outfit and her hair was braided and wrapped around her head, out of her way. He turned away, trying not to look at her, and placed his towel on a bench along the wall, unwinding Sandy from his arm, p
lacing her gently on the towel. Although she liked damp environments, she wasn\rquote t a water snake, and didn\rquote t want to be in the water itself.
\par 
\par \'93Should I leave, do you think, Sandy?\'94 he hissed softly at her. She raised her small head and stared at him.
\par 
\par \'93Why should you leave, Harry Potter? I thought you said you wanted to swim.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes, I do, but--but she\rquote s here.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Does she not want you to swim?\'94
\par 
\par \'93It\rquote s not that. She\rquote s hacked off at me.\'94
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par \'93She\rquote s cross with me,\'94 he explained. \'93She\rquote ll probably just storm off in a huff.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Then what is the problem? She will no longer be here.\'94
\par 
\par \'93But--\'94 Harry said, floundering. \'93She\rquote ll probably tell me off first.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Why will she tell you off?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Because she thinks I\rquote m after her.\'94
\par 
\par \'93After her?\'94
\par 
\par \'93That I want her to be my girlfriend.\'94
\par 
\par Sandy seemed to be looking at Ginny now, then back at Harry.
\par 
\par \'93Yes.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes what?\'94
\par 
\par \'93You do.\'94
\par 
\par \'93What--? No--no I don\rquote t,\'94 he sputtered.
\par 
\par \'93I do not lie to you, Harry Potter. Do not lie to me.\'94
\par 
\par \'93I--I wasn\rquote t--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Harry Potter, do you know what it means to have the Sight?\'94
\par 
\par \'93It means--you can foretell the future. In your case, only a few minutes ahead and in the vicinity where you are, but still--you can See what\rquote s going to happen.\'94
\par 
\par \'93That is not all. All who have the Sight--snake, human, centaur, or other creatures, for other creatures do have the Sight--can also see the Truth. You know that I have never lied to you, Harry Potter?\'94
\par 
\par Harry clamped his mouth shut, then barely let his words escape, hissing softly, \'93Yes, I know you would never lie to me, Sandy.\'94
\par 
\par \'93It is not that I never would lie to you. I cannot. I can speak only Truth. When I See things, I tell the Truth of what I See. There are more general things that can be Seen as well. Things that do not happen at a parti
cular time. Things that Are. That too is Truth.\'94
\par 
\par Harry looked at the small green snake, feeling his stomach turning over within him. He peered at Ginny over his shoulder, still lying back on her elbows while her legs floated in the clear water.
\par 
\par Enough of this, he thought. He couldn\rquote t bring himself to argue with Sandy any more. She\rquote 
s wrong, he thought stubbornly. He took off his watch and put it on the towel next to Sandy, then went to the shallow end of the pool and jumped in, more messily than he\rquote 
d planned. Ginny was liberally splashed by his doing this and sat up spluttering.
\par 
\par \'93What--? Harry! You\rquote re as bad as Ron!\'94 She wiped the water from her face and scowled at him. He stood in the waist-high water, feeling rather foolish.
\par 
\par Yes, he thought. Think of me as your brother. I\rquote ll think of you as my sister. Then we\rquote ll be all right.
\par 
\par \'93Um--sorry. I didn\rquote t realize it would be so bad.\'94
\par 
\par He wondered if she was going to say anything about the day before, about his being in the bathroom listening to her conv
ersation with Katie. About her accusation. He looked at her again; the basilisk amulet was hanging between her breasts, the silver flashing in the imitation sun.
\par 
\par \'93When did you start wearing the amulet?\'94 he asked her suddenly.
\par 
\par She looked jolted. \'93Yesterday morning. Draco--Draco gave it to me before breakfast.\'94
\par 
\par Harry nodded. \'93It\rquote s about time. I gave it to him over a month ago.\'94
\par 
\par Ginny seemed irritated now. \'93Are you going to swim or not?\'94
\par 
\par He turned side to side in the water and slapped the surface lightly with his hands. \'93I\rquote m just getting used to it right now. I can\rquote t really swim, anyway.\'94
\par 
\par She looked genuinely perplexed. \'93But--but you went into the lake at school. For the second task.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Right. Well--I had Gillyweed. That gave me gills on my neck, so I could breathe underwater. I didn\rquote t really need to know how to swim for that.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh. I see.\'94 She looked around, as though worried that someone would see them. \'93Do you--do you want me to teach you?\'94
\par 
\par His heart was suddenly thudding very fast. Being told off he had expected. This he had not. \'93Er--do you want to?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I wouldn\rquote t have offered.\'94 For some reason her voice shook nervously. Finally, he nodded. \'93You\rquote ll need to take off your glasses, for a start,\'94 she told him.
\par 
\par \'93They\rquote re water-proof.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Still--I think it would be a good idea. Just put them on the side.\'94
\par 
\par He walked to the edge of the pool and put his glasses down, turning back to her. She was now an orange-peach-white blur. He saw her walk down the steps into the water, then come closer to
 him. He was in a daze for the next half-hour while she helped him learn to float, and put his face in the water without flinching, and fill his lungs without gasping before going below the surface again....
\par 
\par They had moved closer to the center of the pool
; he came up above the surface of the chest-high water. She was standing very close to him. He tried to fling his hair out of his face and looked at her; at close range he could see her fairly clearly. He could see the expression in her enormous brown eye
s
 as her fingers pushed his wet hair off his brow for him, and he wanted to freeze that moment forever in time, that unguarded look she had just then. But suddenly, when her fingers came in contact with his scar, a blinding pain went crashing through his s
kull and he recoiled, opening his mouth in a scream and also losing his footing on the pool bottom. He went down in the water with his mouth open, inhaling copious amounts of water, then coming up gasping.
\par 
\par In his mind\rquote s eye, even when his eyes weren\rquote t clos
ed, he could see the images. The people screaming, dashing about like mice before a bird of prey. The dark-cloaked figures running them down, pointing their wands...He could hear the high, cold voice and the eerie laughter.... He could see crackling green
 light... Again and again and again and again....
\par 
\par The pain was the most incredible he\rquote d ever felt from his scar. It was worse than the Westminster station explosion, worse than Karkaroff being killed at Draco Malfoy\rquote s initiation, worse than Frank Bryce bei
ng killed... It felt as though a white-hot poker was branding his skin and then penetrating, going into his very skull, his brain. He cried out and went down again, taking in more water. He felt Ginny\rquote 
s hands on him, struggling to hold onto his wet, slippe
ry arms and torso. Then, while he was under the water, he gasped, and felt his lungs fill again with that alien substance which no human could live without, but which no human was supposed to breathe: water. He felt as though his lungs were exploding, and
 then--
\par 
\par Everything went black.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par A body was close to his, leaning over him. A warm, soft mouth was pressed against his mouth; he felt puffs of air come from the mouth. He coughed convulsively, then instinctively turned to the side and vomited wat
er onto the tiled floor, coughing even more afterward, feeling her soothing touch on the bare skin of his back. He rolled onto his back again, looking up at her. She was just far enough away that her features were too indistinct for him to make out her ex
pression. He could see red hair, nose, eyes, mouth; an Impressionist\rquote s rendering of a pretty girl, but no specific girl. Her braid had come unwrapped from around her head and hung down next to the basilisk amulet, which was a blob of silver.
\par 
\par He tentatively
 reached up and put his hand behind her neck, gently encouraging her to lean down again. When she did, his hand was no longer in contact with her neck; she did it of her own accord. Her mouth was on his, and she was giving him life again, life of another 
sort, then shedding soft kisses on his cheeks, his chin, his nose. With her face so close now, he could see the tracks of the tears running down it.
\par 
\par \'93I thought you were gone,\'94 she said thickly, sniffing. \'93And it was all my fault...\'94
\par 
\par He framed her face with his hands, holding it in place so that she was near enough for him to really see her. \'93You saved my life,\'94 he whispered; he hadn\rquote t enough air in his lungs yet to speak normally.
\par 
\par \'93Then,\'94 she said, swallowing, still allowing him to hold her head in place, \'93I guess we\rquote re even.\'94
\par 
\par It seemed that they stayed there like that, just looking at each other, for a long time. Eventually, Harry broke the silence.
\par 
\par \'93I never thanked you, you know, for defending me when your dad was upset about my performing that spell on Maggie....\'94 he whispered to her.
\par 
\par She reddened. \'93I believed what I said. That\rquote s all.\'94
\par 
\par He stroked her cheek gently. \'93Do you know the first thing I ever remember you saying?\'94 he asked her. She shook her head.
\par 
\par He s
miled, no longer concerned about stopping the feelings inside him from welling up and taking him over. He was too weak at this moment to worry about denying how he felt about her. She gasped for a moment and moved back from him a fraction of an inch, and 
he thought it was possible that his love showed on his face, and in his eyes.
\par 
\par \'93You were defending me,\'94 he said quietly. \'93That\rquote s what you did the first time I ever heard you speak. I don\rquote t remember the exact words, but Malfoy was accusing me of enjoying tha
t circus in Flourish and Blotts, when Gilderoy Lockhart was trying to get even more attention by having his photograph taken with me.
\par 
\par \'93You knew who he was, you knew who his father was, how wealthy and influential the Malfoys were. You didn\rquote t care. You stepped right up to Malfoy and practically screamed in his face that I didn\rquote t want all that attention....\'94
 He smiled with the memory. \'93You were such a wee thing back then. Well, not really short. Thin. Looked like a good breeze would blow you away.\'94
\par 
\par She was growing redder by the second, but she didn\rquote t move, listening attentively to him, watching his face as though it fascinated her.
\par 
\par \'93And then--well, then I did a colossally stupid thing....\'94
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94 She frowned.
\par 
\par \'93When Malfoy said--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Potter, you\rquote ve got yourself a girlfriend!\'94 Harry looked up, startled, as Draco Malfoy came striding into the room, clasping his amulet as he walked. \'93The only problem is, see, the one you\rquote ve got there happens to be mine.\'94
 Katie had come hurrying after him, a panicky set to her features. \'93I believe this one here belongs to you.\'94
\par 
\par Katie crossed her arms. \'93We\rquote re neither of us the property of you, or Harry or anyone else, Draco Malfoy.\'94 Then she shook herself, as if annoyed that he had managed to sidetrack her. She went down on her knees beside Harry. \'93
Are you all right? First Draco, now you--\'94
\par 
\par Harry tried to sit up, shaking his head to try to clear it. \'93What are you talking about?\'94
\par 
\par She looked very grim. \'93His Dark Mark. He fell down half a flight of stairs because of the pain. I read about it in the coverage of his dad\rquote s trial, but I almost forgot he had the thing. I didn\rquote 
t even know until then that the Dark Mark was anything other than that dreadful sign they used to fire into the sky. It\rquote s just about impossible to see it now for all of those stupid tattoos my father helped him get....\'94
\par 
\par Malfoy was looking at her with one eyebrow raised. \'93Why the hell do you think I wanted the tattoos? And really, now, Katie; I\rquote ve seen you looking at those \lquote Stupid tattoos,\rquote  especially when I\rquote 
ve got my shirt off. And look at your dad; he\rquote s got a lot more than I have--\'94
\par 
\par The Mark. Right, Harry thought. He remembered how the pain from the Mark had made him transform back into a human when he and Draco were flying over Northamptonshire, how they had fallen from the sky....
\par 
\par Katie behaved as though Draco Malfoy hadn\rquote t said a word, continuing to talk to Harry. \'93You-Know-Who must be summoning the Death Eaters. That\rquote s what it means, doesn\rquote t it? That\rquote s what he said,\'94
 she motioned with her head to Draco. \'93When a Death Eater\rquote 
s Dark Mark hurts like that--something important is going to happen. Then--he went from rolling around on the landing in pain to suddenly deciding he needed to come running down here. He said something about Ginny kneeling over you, although I haven
\rquote t any idea how he could have known....\'94
\par 
\par Draco Malfoy must have clutched at the amulet for comfort in the midst of pain, Harry realized, and--and he had seen Ginny.
\par 
\par Bending over him.
\par 
\par \'93Harry went under,\'94 Ginny explained shakily. \'93He breathed in a lot of water.\'94
\par 
\par Malfoy grimaced. \'93That\rquote s his excuse? That\rquote s how he got you to--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Sod off!\'94 Katie said unexpectedly, unable to ignore him any longer. Harry turned to her; he realized that she had seen the look on his face when he\rquote d been gazing at G
inny. He tried to put the mask on again, to push down his feelings once more....
\par 
\par Katie smiled gently at Harry. \'93Are you all right now, Harry? Did Ginny get you out?\'94
\par 
\par He nodded. \'93Yeah, I guess. I don\rquote t know how--\'94
\par 
\par \'93I levitated you,\'94 Ginny said simply.
\par 
\par Katie looked at her with wide eyes. \'93Without your wand? And without being of-age?\'94 she added. She was strongly reminding Harry of a cop again.
\par 
\par Ginny bristled. \'93It was an emergency. Underage witches and wizards are allowed to use magic in an emergency. And--I didn\rquote t think about it. Not having my wand. I just did it.\'94
 Now that she was thinking about it, she sounded a little frightened of what she\rquote d done.
\par 
\par \'93So,\'94 Katie said, calming down. \'93Like I said--I think something\rquote s going to happen. When you\rquote re strong enough, we\rquote ll get you upstairs and--\'94
\par 
\par \'93It already has happened,\'94 Harry interrupted her. He touched his scar tentatively; it was still tender. \'93The reason I went under was my scar; it was hurting me incredibly. I\rquote ve never felt anything quite like it before....\'94
\par 
\par Malfoy crouched down, the antagonism gone from his face. \'93What is it? Why was I being summoned?\'94 he asked softly. Harry looked at him; for a rare moment it was like having his old friend back.
\par 
\par \'93Diagon Alley,\'94 he whispered to the blond boy. \'93Voldemort has attacked Diagon Alley.\'94
 As the three of them recoiled in horror, taking this in, Harry closed his eyes again, seeing the screaming, running people, the shops aflame; he could hear the maniacal laughter and feel the cold evil like a steel blade against his throat....
\par 
\par \'93We need to get upstairs now,\'94 he said suddenly, urgently. \'93We can\rquote t wait. There\rquote s--there\rquote s a wireless in the sitting room...We need to find out what\rquote s happening....\'94
\par 
\par He found his glasses and w
ound Sandy around his arm and the towel around his waist. The four of them rushed out of the pool room and started running up the stairs to the ground floor, but Harry saw a number of small black dots dancing before his eyes which grew larger and larger u
ntil they merged together and he was out again. The next thing he knew, Draco Malfoy was slapping him in the face, yelling at him, \'93Wake up, Harry, damn you!\'94
 without actually sounding angry. For once he seemed genuinely concerned. Harry shook his woolly head and soon he was moving up the stairs again, one arm looped over Draco\rquote s shoulders, one over Ginny\rquote 
s, while Katie brought up the rear. They stumbled into the sitting room where Sirius was writing a letter at the desk. His parents sat close together on on
e of the couches, working the Daily Prophet crossword together. Sirius looked up in alarm when he saw the four of them. Harry and Ginny were still dressed for the pool, Harry white as a sheet and being supported by Ginny and Draco. Harry was feeling very 
dizzy and lightheaded and likely to pass out again at any second.
\par 
\par \'93The wireless,\'94 he gasped, feeling like an elephant was sitting on his lungs. \'93Turn--on--the--\'94
\par 
\par Ginny and Katie quickly led him to the other couch and he collapsed on it, while Callisto Bla
ck rose and turned on the wireless on the mantle. She raised her eyebrows at her son questioningly; Sirius shrugged. But none of them had to wonder what was going on for long as a crisp female voice blared from the wireless, telling them of the disaster t
hat was Diagon Alley:
\par 
\par \'93--After triage, ten of the twenty-three wounded appear to be critical, according to a spokesman from St. Mungo\rquote s. The reports are still spotty, but a contingent of Aurors are making a sweep of Diagon Alley now; some Death Eaters are 
still reportedly holed up in Gringott\rquote 
s, and rumors abound that that was the real target of this attack....We are attempting to contact the Bank Manager, but he does not seem to be taking calls at this time. Alarmists are worried that this might be the beg
inning of another Goblin rebellion, but this reporter certainly hopes we will not see that kind of carnage again in such enlightened times....\'94
\par 
\par Harry sat up. \'93The bank!\'94
\par 
\par Sirius stared at him. \'93Did you know about this, Harry?\'94
\par 
\par Harry nodded. \'93My scar started hurting while I was in the pool. I--I saw it. Diagon Alley was being attacked by Death Eaters. By Voldemort.\'94 He closed his eyes, remembering. \'93Children,\'94 he said, his eyes still closed. \'93
There were children, and teenagers--Hogwarts students--shopping with their parents, getting their school things...\'94
\par 
\par \'93--Again, that is fifteen dead, twenty-three wounded, ten critically, after a Death Eater attack on Diagon Alley which has culminated in a hostage situation at Gringott\rquote s, I am now told. The Bank Manager
 cannot be reached and no statements have been issued by Gringott\rquote s at this time. The dead and wounded are being transported to St. Mungo\rquote s. No names have been released.\'94
\par 
\par Ron and Hermione ran into the room, breathless. \'93We were up on the roof, and I heard the wireless saying--\'94 Ron began, then clamped his mouth shut as the voice continued. Harry remembered Lupin talking about a werewolf\rquote 
s hearing abilities. Harry noticed that the sitting room windows were open; the sound would have drifted up to the roof that way (For someone with superior hearing). They all gave their attention to the wireless again.
\par 
\par \'93Witches and wizards throughout the British Isles are cautioned not to try to Apparate to Diagon Alley or Knockturn Alley. Anti-Apparition wards have been pl
aced on the entire area to contain the culprits and all fireplaces in the Alleys have been temporarily removed from the Floo network. Do not, repeat, DO NOT, come to Diagon Alley or Knockturn Alley until the Ministry issues the all-clear. The Leaky Cauldr
on has also been shut to business for the duration and the public house\rquote s exit to muggle London has been sealed.\'94
\par 
\par Ursula had entered the room with her children; they had been in the courtyard, playing, but they all looked very grim now. Ursula picked up Me
rcy and held her tightly, the thin little legs wrapped around her mother, while her boys stood close against her; Orion was pale, his dark eyes very round.
\par 
\par \'93We were just there yesterday,\'94 he said quietly. \'93I--I met this other boy who was also going to be a first year. He said--he said they didn\rquote t have time to get everything he needed. He was going to be going back for the rest today--\'94
 The boy swallowed.
\par 
\par \'93...We will keep the wizarding public apprised of developments as they occur. The Minister of Magic will be making a statement later today. We now return you to the music of Screaming Haggis....\'94
\par 
\par Sirius switched off the wireless before the bagpipe music could begin blaring. They all stood staring at each other, dumbfounded. Then, as if awaking from a sleep, Sirius looked sadly at his sister.
\par 
\par \'93Perhaps you should take the children upstairs, Ursula.\'94 She nodded, still clutching Mercy tightly to her. The girl struggled in her mother\rquote s arms.
\par 
\par \'93No, mummy, I want to stay--\'94
\par 
\par But Orion put his arm across Leo\rquote s shoulders and nodded to his uncle before turning and following his mother and sister from the room.
\par 
\par Sirius strode to the fireplace where his mother was still standing, staring into space, clearly shaken by the news of the attack. Harry thought that she must be remembering Voldemort\rquote 
s first rise to power, and finding out that he son was responsible for killing a street full of muggles and betraying his best friends. He put his hands on his mother\rquote s shoulders and looked lovingly into her face. \'93Sit down, Mum,\'94
 he said gently. She looked up at her son, her youngest child, whom she hadn\rquote t seen for over a dozen years. She kissed his cheek and nodded, turning to join her husband on the couch again. It was still very 
strange to Harry to see an older version of Sirius with white hair and a lined face. Walter Black enfolded his wife in his arms and she put her head on his shoulder.
\par 
\par Sirius turned back to the fireplace; he waved his hand and flames sprang up in the cold firebox. Then he reached into a small bowl on the mantle and picked up a pinch of powder, throwing it into the fire and saying, \'93Albus Dumbledore!\'94
\par 
\par There was a slight delay, then a spinning head appeared in the firebox, and there, nestled amid the licking flames, was the bearded head of Hogwarts\rquote  headmaster.
\par 
\par \'93Sirius! I\rquote m glad you called. I was just speaking to Cornelius, and--\'94
\par 
\par \'93So you know.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes. Evidently you do as well.\'94
\par 
\par \'93I just turned off the wireless. Harry knew first, actually. His scar.\'94
\par 
\par Harry stood and walked to where Sirius was before the fire; the flames weren\rquote 
t very hot, but they were starting make the water still clinging to him evaporate. He reckoned it was safe, as Dumbledore would only be able to see his head in the fireplace at Hogwarts.
\par 
\par \'93Professor,\'94 Harry said shakily, \'93There were Hogwarts students there. Shopping.\'94
\par 
\par Dumbledore nodded. \'93Hello, Harry. Yes, I know,\'94 he said heavily. \'93That was one of the things the Minister and I were discussing. Some of the dead and wounded are young people--\'94
\par 
\par Out of the corner of his eye, Harry could see horror registering on the others\rquote  faces; Hermione buried her head on Ron\rquote s chest as he put his ar
ms around her, and Ginny clutched at Draco Malfoy, while Katie looked torn between anger and sorrow.
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m going to be visiting St. Mungo\rquote s later today, after the wounded have received whatever medical attention is necessary. I was just about to call Ascog, but you beat me to it, Sirius. And although I\rquote 
m always delighted to speak to you, I was chiefly interested in contacting Harry and Hermione....\'94
\par 
\par Hermione separated herself from Ron and stepped forward beside Harry. \'93Why, Professor?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, there you are, Hermione. I had rather hoped that you and Harry might be able to come along with me to St. Mungo\rquote s. I think it might lift the spirits of the children to have their Head Boy and Girl visit...They don\rquote 
t really care about seeing their headmaster....\'94
\par 
\par Harry disagreed with this; it had always meant a great deal to him when Dumbledore had visited him in the hospital wing. But he didn\rquote t say so. \'93Of course, Professor. We\rquote ll both come. Can we get there by Floo?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes, yes. The usual procedure. Just say, \lquote St. Mungo\rquote s Hospital,\rquote  before you get into the firebox. You will, however, need to pass through a security check after you\rquote 
ve arrived. To verify that you are who you appear to be. You understand, of course?\'94
\par 
\par They both nodded. \'93Of course,\'94 they said together.
\par 
\par \'93And you\rquote ll both be on the list of expected visitors. No unexpected visitors are being accepted for the foreseeable future. Only family members of the dead and wounded. They don\rquote t want just anyone waltzing in....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Professor,\'94 Harry said abruptly. \'93What about--what about Gringott\rquote s?\'94
\par 
\par Sirius turned to Harry, frowning. \'93Yes; why did you say the bank before, Harry?\'94 he wanted to know.
\par 
\par \'93It occurred to me that if Voldemort gets the Goblins on his side, he\rquote ll control the finances of the entire wizarding world. No
 one will be able to do anything unless merchants decide to extend credit, or unless they have a cache of gold at home. Some people probably do, but I don\rquote t think they\rquote 
re the majority. Or people will have to start using muggle money until the Ministry can take Gringott\rquote s back. I don\rquote t know whether Voldemort plans to start another Goblin rebellion; I think he wants to do more than that. Unless--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Unless what?\'94 Dumbledore\rquote s head said from the fire.
\par 
\par He stared into space, frowning. \'93Unless it\rquote s a ruse. Something to distract the Ministry while he carries out his real plan....\'94
\par 
\par Ron stepped forward, looking very concerned. \'93What do you think that is?\'94
\par 
\par Harry turned to Katie. \'93Something you said earlier about your dad and the dementors made me think of it.\'94 He turned back to the fire. \'93But you\rquote ve also said, Professor, that you think the dementors and Voldemort are natural allies....\'94

\par 
\par \'93Yes, I do,\'94 Dumbledore affirmed, nodding sadly.
\par 
\par Sirius looked at Harry, his eyes wild. \'93The dementors? What are you getting at, Harry?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Do we--do we know for certain that they can\rquote t get off Azkaban? Couldn\rquote t Voldemort just get a ship and sail to the prison and pick up the dementors and then go anywhere with them?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Fortunately, no,\'94 Dumbledore answered with a relieved sigh. \'93
Azkaban is shielded from that sort of thing. Owls can find it, naturally, but it is invisible to most people, even wizards, unless they are traveling in an enchanted boat used for prisoner transport; being in the boat makes it possible to see past the sh
ields. Of course, to the uninformed, whether wizard or muggle, the boats all appear quite normal, and in fact--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--}{\f1\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 T}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 hey have muggle motors,\'94 Harry finished, remembering his trip to Azkaban, and the boat motor being switched off once they had reached the watery caves under the fortress.

\par 
\par \'93Yes,\'94 Dumbledore said cautiously, looking at Sirius, who was staring at Harry, clearly wondering how he knew this, but not saying anything.
\par 
\par \'93All right then--what if--what if the Aurors who take Wormtail there don\rquote t come back right away? How long before someone from Banff goes looking for them?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Someone from--how do you know about Banff, Harry?\'94 Harry looked at Dumbledore when Sirius said this; he knew how Harry knew.
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s not important right now. I\rquote m just worried that if they keep sending Aurors in small bunches, they\rquote ll eventually get enough boats to leave the island in large numbers....and if they do, they won\rquote 
t go to Banff. Too many wizards there. They\rquote ll go someplace like Fraserburgh, which is closer to Azkaban, and the muggles there won\rquote t know what hit them....\'94 Harry thought of the people he\rquote 
d met in Fraserburgh, and the people he didn\rquote t meet, as well: the crowd of spectators at the football match, the fishermen and boatwrights whose livelihood was the sea, all 
of the nameless, faceless people living in the identical grey stone houses marching up the hill from the bay, those who lived in the caravan park beyond the golf club, and the cooks in the clubhouse kitchen, watching their small television and trading jok
es as they chopped vegetables and cooked meals for the wealthy club members....
\par 
\par Sirius watched his face, no longer asking him things like how he knew Fraserburgh was closer to Azkaban than Banff. Harry looked into his godfather\rquote s haunted eyes, a man who li
ved in Azkaban for twelve years out of self-imposed guilt. Someone who knew dementors well, even though he had learned how to prevent them from driving him completely insane.
\par 
\par Dumbledore sighed. \'93I will bring up your concerns with the Minister, Harry. He\rquote ll be at St. Mungo\rquote s later, and we can discuss all of this in person.\'94 Harry didn\rquote 
t have much hope of this doing any good; he knew that Fudge liked having the dementors to guard prisoners. He was silent again, then looked up at Harry. He seemed far older than Harry had ever seen him. \'93Whether Voldemort\rquote 
s goal was to control the bank or to distract us all while he recruits the dementors, or something else entirely, you know what this attack means, don\rquote t you? What all of this means?\'94 he asked quietly, looking 
very grave. Everyone seemed to be holding their breaths.
\par 
\par Harry nodded at him. His throat was dry, but when he spoke, his whisper sounded like a shout in the utterly still room.
\par 
\par \'93We\rquote re at war.\'94
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par \'93What do you mean I can\rquote t go back to Surrey?\'94 Draco Malfoy was livid. Harry was dried and dressed and prepared to go to St. Mungo\rquote 
s with Hermione. They were all still sitting around the kitchen table, having finished lunch. Harry remembered when Malfoy considered himself to be \lquote Stuck\rquote  in Surrey. Sirius looked sideways at Harry.
\par 
\par \'93It was Harry\rquote s idea, and I think he has a point. At any rate, you were going to Apparate to Diagon Alley, and you can\rquote t do that now. Diagon Alley is closed down for the time being. And Arabella\rquote s place isn\rquote 
t on the Floo network for security reasons--to protect the two of you.\'94
\par 
\par Malfoy struck the table angrily, making the dishes jump. \'93So I\rquote m stuck here? In the middle of bleeding nowhere?\'94
\par 
\par \'93You have two choices,\'94 Harry told him, remembering Malfoy saying earlier that he wasn\rquote t his boss outside of school. Think again, Malfoy. \'93
You can drive with us to London, taking turns at the wheel with Katie to help it go faster, or you can wait for us to arrive there and then Floo to her flat, and Mrs. Figg can come up from Surrey to get you in her car.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Why can\rquote t I just Floo to the flat now?\'94
\par 
\par Katie shook her head. \'93I disconnected us from the network before I left. I need to reconnect it for you to use it--Dad can\rquote t. I told Harry, dad didn\rquote t have it hooked up before I came to stay with him. He doesn\rquote 
t like the idea of people being able to just pop in.\'94
\par 
\par Draco Malfoy brightened. \'93Pop in! That\rquote s it! I\rquote ll just Apparate to your flat, call Mrs. Figg to come get me--\'94
\par 
\par Katie made a face. \'93No.\'94 she said, an alarmed look on her face.
\par 
\par \'93No? Why not?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m not telling you where I live! If I did, you could just Apparate there anytime you wanted. If you have to rely on our fire being part of the Floo network--which it isn\rquote t always--you can\rquote 
t necessarily do that. Oh, and by the way, Harry and I will have to lead you out to Mrs. Figg\rquote s car, as you\rquote ll be blindfolded. So you can\rquote t see where the flat is.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, that\rquote s nice.\'94 He glared at Harry and Katie. \'93I think I\rquote d rather drive that poky little car of yours.\'94
\par 
\par \'93No,\'94 Harry said firmly.
\par 
\par Draco snorted through his nostrils. \'93I thought you wanted help with the driving. Worried about me walking in on the pair of you again?\'94
\par 
\par \'93No,\'94 Harry stressed. \'93I changed my mind. I think you should stay here. It's not safe for you to just take off across the country, not now. We can\rquote t risk you falling into Voldemort\rquote s hands!\'94 Harry yelled at him.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, sure, I really believe you want to protect me--\'94
\par 
\par \'93I don\rquote t!\'94 Harry responded. \'93I\rquote m trying to protect the rest of the wizarding world, you prat! We can fight--if we have to--and if we die, we die. We won\rquote t be endangering other people. Voldemort\rquote 
s on the move now. The Obedience Charm keeps you from being able to hurt him, so you can\rquote t fight him off. If he gets hold of you and gives you a direct order, and you agree to do whatever he tells you--\'94
\par 
\par He stopped, swallowing.
\par 
\par Malfoy also swallowed. \'93How do you know I won\rquote t just refuse?\'94 he said, voice shaking. \'93How do you know I won\rquote t choose to just drop dead?\'94 His voice trailed off; Harry wondered how much he\rquote 
d thought about this since finding out about the Obedience Charm, and he bit back a retort about how wonderful that would be.
\par 
\par \'93I suppose that\rquote s a possibility,\'94 he said between his teeth, not sure he believed this. \'93In which case I don\rquote t see why you would want to risk that happening. Just do as your told.\'94 That\rquote s my Obedience Charm, he thought.

\par 
\par Malfoy glared at him. Harry glared right back.
\par 
\par Finally, Malfoy stood, pounding his hands on the table again. \'93Fine! Call me and let me know when you\rquote re in London so I can finally see the last of this place!\'94
\par 
\par He stormed from the room. Harry looked at Ginny. He remembered saying to her, If he died, if would have made you sad, as his dad had said to his mum. What would she do if Draco Malfoy refused an order from Voldemort and dropped down dead? He\rquote 
d be considered a hero of sorts, or at least a martyr....
\par 
\par Harry turned and looked at Katie. \'93Well. At least it should be a peaceful trip back to London,\'94 he said, trying to keep his voice from shaking. \'93My visit to St. Mungo\rquote s shouldn\rquote t take long. We can leave when I get back.\'94
\par 
\par She nodded. \'93But frankly--I don\rquote t think we should consider stopping in wizarding districts on the way back. Somehow I think we\rquote ll be safer in the muggle world. We can go as far as Carlisle on the first leg; that\rquote 
s only about two hours from Skelmorlie. We\rquote ll stay overnight in Carlisle, then in the morning we can drive to Manchester--\'94
\par 
\par Harry smiled. \'93We could drop in on Remus, if he tells us how to find his place. And Ruth Pelta lives in Manchester.\'94
\par 
\par \'93All right. We could have lunch in Manchester, then drive to Birmingham, take a break there, maybe have tea, then in the early evening we can go the rest of the way to London.\'94
\par 
\par Sirius nodded. \'93I agree with Katie; best to avoid wizarding locations. And as such, I think that when you\rquote re in Manchester, you shouldn\rquote t look up Remus. Or this other friend. You don\rquote t--\'94
 Sirius stopped suddenly, clamping his mouth shut. Harry thought he might have prevented himself from saying, You don\rquote t want to put others in danger.
\par 
\par \'93Are you sure you want me going, Sirius?\'94 Harry asked, not liking the look on his godfather\rquote s face. Sirius sighed.
\par 
\par \'93Frankly, no, I don\rquote t. But I\rquote ve got to accept you being of-age. Being able to take care of yourself, make your own decisions. Which brings me to something else--\'94
 He looked around nervously; there were still a number of other people in the kitchen. Ron and Hermione were sitting togeth
er with the remains of their lunches before them, trading different sections of the Daily Prophet. Mercy, Orion and Leo were finishing their meal, along with their mother. Sirius motioned to the doorway with his head, rising from his seat. Harry and Katie
 
followed him from the kitchen and into the now-deserted sitting room. Sirius sat on one of the couches near the cold fireplace and motioned for Harry and Katie to sit on one of the upholstered benches nearby. He looked very uncomfortable about what he wan
ted to say.
\par 
\par \'93I, er, get the impression from Ron that the two of you have, er, been--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--Intimate?\'94 Katie asked him, bold as brass, a challenging look in her eyes.
\par 
\par Sirius cleared his throat. \'93Right. That. At any rate, I just wanted to be certain that the two of you are, er, taking certain precautions....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Prophylaxis Potion,\'94 Katie said simply. Sirius nodded at her.
\par 
\par \'93Good. Good to hear. But I, ah, was also thinking of other things...\'94
\par 
\par Katie sat up straight. \'93I\rquote ve only had one other partner, and neither of us had been with anyone else before that. I believe Harry and Hermione had never been with anyone else before they were together, either. So the circle is closed,\'94
 she said with finality.
\par 
\par Sirius\rquote  eyes widened. \'93Is that what Ron meant by--\'94 Harry realized that Sirius hadn\rquote t realized the nature of his relationship with Hermione. Sirius looked at Harry. \'93I thought Katie was--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--}{\f1\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 H}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 is first?\'94 Katie said, smiling slyly. \'93No. That role will go down in the history books as having been played by Hermione Granger.\'94
\par 
\par Harry frowned. \'93That won\rquote t be in any bloody history books if I can help it. Can we stop talking about this now?\'94 He felt very uncomfortable, and Sirius didn\rquote t look much better, but he seemed determined to do his duty as a godfather.

\par 
\par \'93Right. That\rquote s done.\'94 Sirius looked very relieved. \'93I believe you and Hermione,\'94 he blushed now as he said her name, \'93Are supposed to go to St. Mungo\rquote s soon?\'94
\par 
\par Harry nodded, and, as though he\rquote d used a summoning charm, Hermione walked in, wearing lightweight warm-weather
 robes that she was buttoning over a summery yellow dress. She also wore her Head Girl badge. Harry realized, seeing her, that he should probably look very official too, instead of just showing up in jeans and a grubby T-shirt with grass stains from his f
o
rmer job as a gardener. He explained that this was what he was going to do and went up to his room to find something appropriate to wear. When he returned, he also had wizarding robes on over a clean shirt and trousers, his Head Boy badge gleaming on his 
chest. When he saw Harry wearing the badge, Sirius looked at him with moist eyes.
\par 
\par \'93I remember your dad being Head Boy,\'94 he said softly, giving Harry a quick hug before leaving the room quickly, his nose twitching. Harry watched him go, then turned to Hermione.
\par 
\par \'93Ready?\'94
\par 
\par She nodded. Katie walked to Harry and put her arms around him; he held her, and she said in a muffled voice, talking into his chest, \'93They\rquote ll be over the moon, getting a visit from you, you know. Anyone in hospital. I just--I do hope it\rquote 
s no one we know. Especially those who died--\'94 Then she straightened up and put her hand over her mouth. \'93Oh, listen to me. That\rquote s terrible. As if only people I know should have the right to be unharmed--\'94
\par 
\par Hermione put her hand on Katie\rquote s arm. \'93No, no. I know just what you mean. I think--I think if I just find out that it\rquote 
s strangers who died, and who are lying in those hospital beds, I can cope. I can smile and be Head Girl and tell them it\rquote s going to be all right, and believe it, because then it won\rquote t really touch me. I don\rquote t--I don\rquote 
t know whether I can face anyone I know and say the same thing...\'94
\par 
\par Katie suddenly launched herself at Hermione, giving her a tight hug, then holding her at arm\rquote s length. \'93You\rquote re going to be a wonderful Head Girl, you know,\'94 s
he said thickly before bolting from the room. Hermione looked after her, eyes starting to fill with tears. Then she looked at Harry, annoyed.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, drat it; now I\rquote m going to be bawling before I even get there....\'94
\par 
\par Harry grinned at her. \'93Chin up. Stiff upper lip and all that. I\rquote ll do my best Percy impression and you can do your best impression of--well, of a female Percy. You have done for years, anyway....\'94
\par 
\par Hermione swatted his arm. \'93I am not a female Percy!\'94 But she was laughing now, he was glad to see. Unfortunately, he had a bad feeling that it would be very difficult to laugh once they arrived at St. Mungo\rquote 
s. They both seemed to have this thought at the same time; they sobered, and she looked up at him with large, apprehensive eyes.
\par 
\par \'93Duty calls,\'94 she whispered. This would be their first official act as Head Girl and Head Boy: visiting the wounded Hogwarts students in hospital. He went first, throwing the Floo powder into the fire and saying clearly, \'93St. Mungo\rquote 
s Hospital!\'94 He closed his eyes as he whirled, keeping his elbows in, one hand holding his glasses to his face. Finally, he fell out of a fireplace, stumbling for a moment (He\rquote 
d never been able to make a graceful landing when traveling by Floo) and quickly moved out of the way for Hermione. She emerged from the fire half a minute later.
\par 
\par They were standing in a large entrance hall with institutional-looking lino on the floor and dingy walls that would have been celadon green halfway up if they\rquote d been cleaned any time in the previous fifty years. No
n-dripping candles sat in sconces on the walls, their light doubled by smudged mirrors behind them. A very large, perfectly bald wizard in aqua robes sat at a large brown desk in the middle of the space; he did not look up at them but seemed to be staring
 at a parchment scroll before him. Harry and Hermione walked uncertainly toward the desk. Harry felt dwarfed by the cavernous space.
\par 
\par About three feet from the desk they encountered what seemed to be an invisible wall; they bounced back from it as though it were made of rubber. They stood before this barrier, perplexed. Still without looking up, the wizard said in a gruff, deep voice, 
\'93Names?\'94
\par 
\par They looked at each other and swallowed.
\par 
\par \'93Hermione Granger and Harry Potter,\'94 Harry answered for both of them, trying to keep his voice steady.
\par 
\par The large wizard looked up, his blue eyes wide. He wore one gold earring and was suddenly grinning from that ear to his other one.
\par 
\par \'93\lquote Arry Potter!\'94 he exclaimed. He checked the list of expected visitors. \'93I din' notice yer name on the list b\rquote fore, but \lquote ere it is! Oh, my, if I\rquote d known \lquote Arry Potter was comin\rquote --\'94
\par 
\par Harry reddened; he saw that a smile was playing around Hermione\rquote s mouth.
\par 
\par \'93We\rquote re supposed to be meeting Professor Dumbledore,\'94 he said, trying to maintain some dignity.
\par 
\par \'93Yeah, \lquote e\rquote s already \lquote ere. Lemme see ef I kin drum\rquote im up...\'94
\par 
\par The very excited, very large wizard left at a jog, his ample stomach and bottom bouncing as he moved, looking quite beside himself. Harry frowned, and after the wizard was gone, Hermione laughed out loud.
\par 
\par \'93You\rquote ll just have to get used to it, Harry,\'94 she said, practically breathless, \'93Now that you\rquote ll be out in the wizarding world more often. Most people at school are used to you by now, but outside of Hogwarts--\'94
\par 
\par He rolled his eyes. \'93The same thing happened when Orion met me. Do you know that Sirius never once told him I was coming to live in his house? And he\rquote ll be a first-year in September, too.\'94
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote d be willing to wager that all of the first-years will be a little star-struck by you. I mean, entering school and finding that Harry Potter is Head Boy....Someone they\rquote ve read about since they were very small. It\rquote 
s not like when we started at Hogwarts. Now that we\rquote re going to be seventh-years, most of the other students weren\rquote t even born when you survived You-Know-Who\rquote s curse. You\rquote re a legend to them.\'94
\par 
\par Harry frowned at her. \'93Do you think now that you\rquote re Head Girl you could say Voldemort, Hermione? Honestly...\'94
\par 
\par She frowned back at him. \'93Don\rquote t change the subject. All right, Voldemort. I don\rquote t have an aversion to it frankly; it\rquote s just a reflex, something I learned to do so I wouldn\rquote t upset other people. I don\rquote 
t have a thing about it, like Ron used to.\'94
\par 
\par The large wizard returned; the best word Harry could think of was that he pranced back to his desk on surprisingly small feet. \'93\lquote Ere \lquote e is!\'94
 he said excitedly. Harry grimaced. Albus Dumbledore came striding purposefully into the large room.
\par 
\par \'93Harry! Hermione! Good to see you. Come along, come along. I thought we\rquote d start with the youngest first.\'94 He reached his arm through the barrier and pulled Harry and Hermione through.
\par 
\par \'93Er, sir--if you could tell us--\'94 Harry looked over his shoulder at the large wizard and lowered his voice, \'93--did any Hogwarts students--did any of them die?\'94
\par 
\par Dumbledore looked at him with a very long face and sighed. \'93I\rquote 
m afraid so, Harry. A third-year Hufflepuff, a fifth-year Slytherin--who was to have been a prefect-- and two boys who were to have been first years. The others were all adults. Well, nominally--\'94
\par 
\par \'93What do you mean?\'94
\par 
\par The headmaster sighed. \'93Someone who was recently a student...I think you knew her, as she was a prefect....\'94
\par 
\par Hermione stepped forward. \'93Who?\'94 she wanted to know, her brow furrowed.
\par 
\par \'93Perhaps you remember a Ravenclaw named Niamh Quirke?\'94
\par 
\par Hermione covered her mouth. Harry looked very grim. He remembered good and not-so-good things about Niamh, but he couldn\rquote t really lay claim to knowing her. In his other life, she\rquote 
d been shagging Draco in the library....but she was also Head Girl during her seventh year (Since Alicia Spinnet wasn\rquote 
t at Hogwarts) and then she became a double agent. In this life he only remembered that she had been gossiping with her Ravenclaw friends in the library, leading Ron to sleep with Parvati....And she didn\rquote t seem to a
pprove of her brother being with Justin Finch-Fletchley, although Harry was never really clear about that.
\par 
\par \'93I remember her,\'94 he said hoarsely. Not wanting to put it off any longer, he said, \'93Let\rquote s go,\'94 to Professor Dumbledore.
\par 
\par They walked through doorways with Gothic arches and down dingy high-ceilinged corridors, passing nurses who appeared to be wearing nun\rquote 
s habits from the Middle Ages. Some of the nurses carried trays of potions. They also passed aqua-robed wizard orderlies transporting patients on le
vitating stretchers. A clutch of doctors consisting of two wizards and a witch bustled past them at one point, wearing identical peach-colored robes and tall pointed hats which matched; each of the three was carrying an armful of files, and they were evid
ently arguing about how to handle a case.
\par 
\par \'93No, no, Forsythe, thorn-tree flowers--especially the stamen--must be included in the potion or it will never work. The sort from Kenya--that mutated strain that was developed near Nairobi. Didn\rquote t you read my monog
raph on it last year in Journal of the WMA? If you don\rquote t keep up with the literature, you\rquote re liable to hurt someone with your ignorance--\'94
\par 
\par Forsythe straightened up as he passed; he had a beard of both brown and grey hair and wore thick round spectacles low on his rather long nose. \'93I\rquote 
ll have you know, Clancy, that I have been brewing this potion for my dear mother for years with absolutely no ill effect--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--No cure in sight either, I\rquote ll warrant--\'94 the witch with them said sarcastically; she was the youn
gest of the three, with abundant freckles, blue eyes, unnatural-looking blonde hair pulled into a bun at the back of her head and a nose with a jog in it, as though it had been broken at some point. She had the largest bundle of file folders in her arms. 
Clancy gave her a glare.
\par 
\par \'93When I need your help, Anderssen--\'94 Clancy said, running his fingers through his bright red hair as the three of them passed Harry, Hermione and Professor Dumbledore.
\par 
\par Harry heard her voice behind him now. \'93I read your monograph. At least you managed to get it published. The wizarding medical establishment is still so backward. Almost all witches in medicine are nurses. I can\rquote 
t get a JWMA article published to save my life. I\rquote ll bet if you sent one of mine in under your name they\rquote d snatch it up--\'94
\par 
\par Suddenly, Harry had a strange feeling that someone was staring at the back of his head. He whirled, but all three of the doctors were turning a corner and disappearing from sight. No one else was visible in the corridor.
\par 
\par Hermione was also staring after the doctors, as though fascinated. He recovered first and had to tug on her arm to get her to stay with him and Dumbledore. They finally reached the children\rquote 
s ward and Dumbledore led them to the first bed. Before the headmaster could even finish saying, \'93I\rquote d like to introduce you to--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Harry Potter!\'94 the boy cried, his eyes widening. Harry didn\rquote t recognize him; he reckoned he looked young enough to be going into his first year in September. At the boy\rquote s exclamation, the other young people 
in the ward looked up and the mobile ones started forward, surrounding him quickly.
\par 
\par Harry Potter, Harry Potter, Harry, Harry, Potter, Potter....
\par 
\par The visit became a blur to Harry, who wasn\rquote t sure how many hands he shook, how many good wishes for a speedy recovery he offered (Thanks to wizarding medicine, most of them wouldn\rquote t be in St. Mungo\rquote 
s more than twenty-four hours). They saw only two students they knew from Gryffindor: Amy and Andy Donegal, the muggle-born twins who were in the same year as Will Fli
twick. Amy had a twisted ankle that was mending quickly and Andy had some burns from throwing himself between his attacker and his mother.
\par 
\par \'93Mum and Dad wanted to take us to a muggle hospital,\'94 Andy told Harry, \'93But the Ministry wasn\rquote t letting anyone--even muggle parents of Hogwarts students--leave Diagon Alley to go anywhere but here.\'94
 Andy was clearly enjoying the other children seeing that he already knew the famous Harry Potter. \'93They\rquote re upstairs, in quarters that have been fitted out for the muggles to stay in until we can be released. I think they\rquote 
re rather enjoying themselves. We can\rquote t really demonstrate magic to them at home, of course. They keep asking matron to do tricks for them; I think she thinks they\rquote re getting rather tedious.\'94
\par 
\par Hermione smiled. \'93My parents are muggles, too. They always loved coming with me to Diagon Alley--\'94 She stopped abruptly, swallowing, as if thinking, There but for the grace of God--
\par 
\par Harry cleared his throat. \'93But soon you\rquote ll be right as rain, yeah?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Right,\'94 Andy said, remarkably cheerful despite his burns. \'93Matron said this poultice for my burns should work very fast. I can practically feel the new skin growing,\'94
 he added, indicating the plasters on his cheek and arm and on his left leg, below his hospital smock.
\par 
\par Finally, Dumbledore told them it was time to leave. For a moment, Harry thought of asking where the Longbottoms were, then changed his mind. As they walked back through the depressing corridors, Harry thought, This is where Neville comes 
during his holidays. To visit parents who have no clue who he is...
\par 
\par He still had a hard time reconciling the Aurors who had given him--and Snape--so much trouble with the people who were Neville\rquote s parents, who were held in very high esteem by none other than Alastor Moody himself. He couldn\rquote 
t help picturing them when they came to take Remus away, especially now that Ron was a werewolf and risked the same sort of prejudice in the wizarding world.
\par 
\par Ginny had gone back to the Burrow by the time they returned to the castle. Unfortunately, Hedwig hadn\rquote t yet returned from delivering a letter to the Dursleys (Checking up on his Aunt Petunia) so he couldn\rquote 
t take her with him. He threw a few things into a bag for the trip to London, and after saying goodbye to Sirius, Ron and Hermione, they went through the dungeons to the cottage which served as a garage. Soon, Katie was driving her father\rquote 
s car onto the ferry to Wemyss Bay, and soon after, they were on the road to Skelmorlie, heading for Carlisle.
\par 
\par Fortunately, the drive to Carlisle was uneventful, and they were quickly able to locate a pub where they could have their tea and get a room for the night. There was only one bed. That doesn\rquote 
t necessarily mean anything is going to happen, Harry reminded himself. She\rquote s probably knackered from driving, anyway... He wasn\rquote t even sure he wanted anything to happen.
\par 
\par While Katie was using the ensuite bath (A proper one, with the shower, sink and toilet all in the same neat white-tiled room) he undressed down to his boxers and climbed into the bed, putting his glasses on the table beside him and closing his eyes.

\par 
\par He heard her emerge from the bathroom and felt the covers move as she climbed into the bed, too. The orange color he was seeing through his eyelids disappeared as she tur
ned off the light, and he refrained from sighing with relief. Evidently she was too tired for--
\par 
\par Wrong, he thought, as she rolled over on him, kissing his neck, then moving her mouth up to his. With a jolt, he could feel the hard little points of her breas
ts on his bare chest, and he instinctively put his hands on her back, feeling the smooth skin there. Moving his hands down a little further, he realized that she wasn\rquote t wearing anything at all. Well. That makes her intentions perfectly clear....

\par 
\par She broke the kiss and whispered, \'93All right, Harry?\'94
\par 
\par He opened his eyes then, looking at her face in the dimness. \'93Yeah. I\rquote m just surprised.\'94
\par 
\par She shook her head with wonder. \'93You\rquote re surprised. Silly, silly boy,\'94 she said softly, fitting her lips to his again and beginning to help divest him of his boxers....
\par 
\par Lying with her afterward as she started drifting off to sleep, he wondered why he felt more like a dutiful husband than anything else. It was almost as though they were one of those couples trying to have a 
child, and they needed to make sure their timing was right so they could--
\par 
\par \'93Bloody hell,\'94 he said suddenly, waking her again.
\par 
\par \'93Mmm--what, Harry? What\rquote s wrong?\'94 She tried to open her eyes.
\par 
\par \'93You--you really are on Prophylaxis Potion, aren\rquote t you? I mean, it hasn\rquote t lapsed or anything? You\rquote re not--you\rquote re not trying to have a baby?\'94 He remembered hearing her give birth to Roger Davies\rquote 
 baby in his other life.
\par 
\par She sat up then, the sheet pooling around her waist; she still wasn\rquote t wearing anything. Even in the half-light from the streetlight, he could see she was quite irate.
\par 
\par \'93Harry Potter! How dare you accuse me of such a thing!\'94
\par 
\par He suddenly realized how this sounded. \'93I\rquote m--I\rquote m sorry, Katie! I think--I was starting to fall asleep, and all sorts of ridiculous thoughts started going through my mind--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Ridiculous is right! The very idea that I would try to trap you like that! I\rquote m beginning Auror training in a month, and I certainly do not have any intention of going through it while pregnant! I don\rquote 
t want to have a child for years to come, if at all! I haven\rquote t really made a final decision about it yet or anything, but--but really, Harry!\'94
\par 
\par He apologized sheepishly some more, also silently berating himself for not keeping his thoughts to himself wh
en he was so tired, as they were invariably odd and half-formed and should never see the light of day. He kissed her cheek contritely, looking at her closely, his eyes held open very wide, hoping she would calm down soon.
\par 
\par Finally, she sighed and gave a small laugh. \'93Oh--I can\rquote t stay angry with you when you\rquote re looking at me like that. But you realize--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes, Katie. I really do. I\rquote m dreadfully sorry and you have every right to be cross with me and to tell me what a stupid prat I am and--\'94
\par 
\par \'93All right, all right. Stop babbling.\'94 She laughed again. \'93Let\rquote s get some sleep. Just when I thought I was already done in you went and tuckered me out even more--\'94
\par 
\par She was grinning and Harry grinned back at her. \'93Oh, and you had nothing to do with it--\'94
\par 
\par They settled down to sleep poking fun at each other cheerfully, until they both finally dozed off, and Harry was able to finally stop worrying and rest his weary brain.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par They had only just left Manchester a few minutes before and were on their way to Birmingham the next day when Sandy hissed to Harry.
\par 
\par \'93What? Do you really mean it this time?\'94 he hissed back at her. \'93Because the last time you said something like that, you meant that Sirius Black was coming, so if it\rquote s Sirius you\rquote 
re talking about, please tell me now so I can stop worrying.\'94
\par 
\par \'93I do not mean Sirius Black. And I thought that time I made myself perfectly clear.\'94
\par 
\par Perfectly, Harry thought, grimacing, although he didn\rquote t say it aloud, in English or Parseltongue.
\par 
\par \'93Katie,\'94 said, his voice shaking, \'93We have a problem. Sandy says dark wizards are coming. We need to hide or something.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Hide? We just got on the M6, Harry! We\rquote re supposed to stay on the M6 for over seventy-five miles! How in the hell can we just hide? And how long would we have to hide? We\rquote d have to start moving again at some point.\'94
\par 
\par \'93All right then--we need to disguise ourselves.\'94
\par 
\par She snorted. \'93How? I\rquote m driving a car, in case you\rquote ve forgotten, on a busy motorway. How am I supposed to be able to--\'94
\par 
\par But Harry put out his hands and touched her hair lightly, his brow knit with concentration. When he removed his hands, he said, \'93Take a look in the mirror.\'94
\par 
\par \'93What are you--oh!\'94 she cried in surprise, then brought her eyes back to the road abruptly as a lorry cut across the lane in front of them. When she had her equilibrium back, she glanced in the mirror again. \'93Hmm. I\rquote 
ve sometimes wondered what I\rquote d look like as a blonde...\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, now you know,\'94 he said, sitting back. She turned to glance at him now and let out a scream.
\par 
\par \'93Harry! What--how--?\'94
\par 
\par He had lengthened his hair and grown a beard, as he\rquote d done in his other life to move about in the muggle world when he was a fugitive. He shrugged. \'93Animagus training
. Comes in handy for a lot of things. Growing hair was something I was actually doing when I was very young; McGonagall decided to train me because I\rquote d done that. She thought it indicated I might have the aptitude to be an Animagus.\'94
\par 
\par Katie looked like her heart was going very fast now. She shook her head as she drove. \'93I never know what to expect from you next, Harry.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Let\rquote s just hope Sandy wasn\rquote t--\'94 he started to say, but suddenly the traffic started slowing down, and instead of completing his sentence, Harry said, \'93I have a very bad feeling about this....\'94
\par 
\par And then he heard it; far ahead of where their car had had to come to a halt, there was a terrified cry and the sound of crackling, sizzling....Harry suddenly pulled Katie down onto the front seat of the car, out of sight of the other people in the cars a
round them.
\par 
\par \'93You Apparate to the Ministry, now! You have to get Aurors to come help. And Obliviators; I get the impression a lot of muggles are going to see a lot of things they shouldn\rquote t. Particularly the ones who are being attacked.\'94
\par 
\par \'93What are you going to do?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, I\rquote m not just going to sit here and let them attack muggles, or come after me; I have a suspicion someone still has an active Third Eye in Ascog, and that\rquote s how they knew I\rquote d be on this road. If they\rquote 
re actually after me, that is, and I think I can be forgiven for being a little paranoid. Even if they\rquote re not after me and this is all an insane coincidence, people out there need help. And I\rquote m going to do what I can to help them.\'94
\par 
\par \'93But--but you\rquote ll be seen doing magic then! And how do you know you won\rquote t be grossly outnumbered?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I don\rquote t. But anyway, I won\rquote t be seen doing magic.\'94 He reached into the bag at his feet and pulled out his Invisibility Cloak. She gasped, clearly recognizing what it was.
\par 
\par \'93Now--you go get help. I\rquote ll put this on and give some Death Eaters a little surprise.\'94
\par 
\par She nodded, still down on the car seat, then quickly kissed him on the lips before disappearing with a pop! His lips still tingled from the kiss as he slipped on the cloak, then awkwardly clambered out of his open c
ar window, to avoid opening and closing the door. He walked forward between the stilled cars, angry yells from motorists starting to merge into an excited cacophony accented by car horns. Harry saw another explosion and some green sparks. He started runni
ng flat out toward it, which was difficult, under the cloak, but he was very, very afraid that he knew what those green sparks were about....
\par 
\par A Death Eater whom Harry did not recognize from Voldemort\rquote s rebirthing (Voldemort had clearly been doing a lot of 
recruiting during the previous two years) was striding between the cars in a long cloak, hood up, pointing his wand at cars and sending sparks toward them. Harry heard him casually shouting \'93Crucio!\'94 and then--then he heard the curse that he\rquote 
d survived, an
d he started running again hoping against hope--but he was too late. A young man clutching the wheel of his car convulsed for a second, then just stopped, clearly dead. Harry was still a good thirty feet away, but even as he ran forward, he pointed his wa
nd at the Death Eater who\rquote d killed the man before he could attack anyone else.
\par 
\par \'93Expelliarmus!\'94 he cried as he ran. The wizard flew backward and hit a van, sliding down the side and slumping, unconscious, on the ground. His wand flew toward Harry; he let it
 bounce off him and fall to the ground, then walked over it to hide it and discreetly bent over, still covered by the cloak, and picked it up, pocketing it. He walked to the car where the young man sat and stood for a moment, staring at the dead driver, t
hinking of his own parents, seeing his mother dying again.... A fury welled up inside him and he strode forward to where the three other Death Eaters were, levitating a family\rquote 
s car, with parents and children inside all terrified. None of these Death Eaters seemed to have noticed that their comrade was down; they were all enjoying themselves too much.
\par 
\par Harry\rquote s heart was in his throat; if he forced them to break the spell or disarmed any of them, the car could come crashing down with five people in it who cou
ld be gravely injured. He watched helplessly as the car floated in the air, hoping Katie would return with help soon. He remembered other Ministry employees having a similar problem at the Quidditch World Cup when a family was being levitated and they wer
e worried about the muggles crashing to earth and being injured....
\par 
\par He stood with his wand at the ready, watching with his heart in his throat. He felt certain he would hear the children\rquote s screams in his nightmares. Then, in the blink of an eye, the three 
Death Eaters flung the car through the air, where it landed on the opposite side of the motorway, facing oncoming traffic that was still moving. Don\rquote 
t people notice anything? he wondered for a moment, before noticing himself that a very large lorry was going to crash into the car, in which the family was obviously quite shaken, but thus far, still alive.
\par 
\par Unless the lorry flattened them all....
\par 
\par \'93Wingardium leviosa!\'94 he cried with every bit of concentration he could muster (Never having levitated anything s
o large and heavy before). The car went flying up into the air again and Harry held it there, shaking, sweat pouring down his face as he struggled to maintain its altitude. The lorry drove on through the space which the car had occupied, the car just bare
ly above the top of the lorry, the driver of the lorry clearly amazed. Harry hoped the man wouldn\rquote 
t have an accident through sheer shock. Harry kept concentrating very hard, moving the car over in the air until it was back above the proper side of the road, then lowering it carefully down to the ground.
\par 
\par Two of the Death Eaters looked shocked; the other one, however, looked around, saying in a very suspicious voice, \'93Someone is here....\'94
\par 
\par Harry realized, with a shock, that it was a woman. He pointed his wand at her. \'93Stupefy!\'94
 he cried. She promptly stiffened and fell, looking rather plank-like. The other Death Eaters needed no other inducement to depart, suddenly Disapparating with a double pop!
\par 
\par Damn! Harry thought. I let them get away! But then he remembered that he had caught two Death Eaters, one of them a murderer, which wasn\rquote t bad for someone who was all alone and not yet done with school. He strode to the woman he\rquote 
d stunned and bent over her; her hood fell away from her face now, and he could see it clearly.
\par 
\par \'93Well, well, well,\'94 he said, more to himself than to her; he didn\rquote t think a stunned person could actually hear anything.
\par 
\par \'93Hello there, Rita.\'94
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par When Katie finally returned, the first wizard Harry had disarmed had also needed to be stunned, as he was starting to come around. Katie had brought four Aurors and two Obliviators with her, and the Aurors brought a horseless carriage like the one they
\rquote d used to take Harry to the Ministry, into which they bundled Rita Skeeter and the Death Eater Harry had disarmed. Katie returned to the car, standing next to it and looking around, confused.
\par 
\par \'93Harry? Harry! Where are you? Are you all right?\'94 He goosed her, making her jump. \'93Harry! Don\rquote t do that!\'94 she scolded, but the scolding degenerated into a giggle very quickly. \'93Oh, you frightened me!\'94
\par 
\par \'93Not as much as those Death Eaters frightened the muggles,\'94 he answered, still under the cloak. Up ahead, they could see that the Aurors were g
one with their quarry--including Rita Skeeter herself--and the Obliviators were going car to car putting memory charms on people. They climbed into the car again (Harry still in his cloak) and Katie frowned in his general direction.
\par 
\par \'93Aren\rquote t you going to take the cloak off, Harry?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Frankly--no. I think it\rquote s safest if I\rquote m not seen at all. Keep the blonde hair for now, too. You didn\rquote t tell the Ministry I was with you, did you?\'94
\par 
\par \'93No, I told them Death Eaters were attacking muggles in their cars--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Good. I think--I think I agree with Sirius. The Ministry may not be completely secure. Tell them as little as possible at all times.\'94
\par 
\par She frowned as she started the car. \'93I\rquote m going to be working for the Ministry, Harry, remember? When I\rquote m done my Auror training. Are you going to feel the same way then? About telling me things? Not that you\rquote 
ve been completely forthcoming about some information--\'94
\par 
\par Now Harry knew how Hermione felt about being harangued about keeping the Time Turner secret. \'93I was told to keep my Animagus training to myself, and that I didn\rquote t have to register until after I\rquote m done with school. We\rquote 
ve only been seeing each other for a month. What, was I supposed to transfigure myself on our first date and scare you witless?\'94
\par 
\par \'93No, evidently you were supposed to break the law and use my wand to do magic out of school on our first date,\'94 she responded grumpily as the traffic started to move again.
\par 
\par Harry sat back silently. They drove to Birmingham without saying two words to each other; he\rquote 
d been feeling very excited about catching Rita, too, and now there was a pall on everything thanks to their disagreement. He remembered that in his other life, Severus Snape wasn\rquote t keen on the idea of being married to an Auror. He turned to look
 at Katie; he was uncertain how he felt about continuing to have a girlfriend who was planning to be an Auror, if she was going to trust a possibly corrupt wizarding government unconditionally.
\par 
\par They had their tea in a pub in Birmingham, Harry still under the cloak. Katie was very cross about appearing to be eating alone, and ordering quite a lot (Harry was very hungry). Soon after five-thirty, they left for London, reaching Katie\rquote 
s flat by seven-thirty. When they were finally in the flat, Harry pulled off his cloak just as Sam walked into the living room from the kitchen.
\par 
\par \'93Aaaah!\'94 he screamed, when Harry appeared from nowhere.
\par 
\par \'93Aaaah!\'94 Harry screamed in response.
\par 
\par \'93Don\rquote t do that, Harry!\'94 Sam yelled at him, catching his breath. Then he looked down at the silvery cloak in Harry\rquote s hand. \'93Oh--you didn\rquote t Apparate--\'94
\par 
\par \'93No, I haven\rquote t learned yet. It\rquote s an Invisibility Cloak. Safety precaution.\'94
\par 
\par Sam nodded. \'93I remember Lily said James had one of those; she borrowed it once or twice for work. Good idea.\'94
\par 
\par Harry was still getting his breath. \'93Thanks.\'94
 Katie went to call Mrs. Figg to tell her they were back at the flat, then called Draco on the fireplace to tell him Mrs. Figg was on her way. Then, just as she was turning from the fireplace, Draco Malfoy suddenly appea
red in the middle of the living room with a pop! that made Katie shriek and almost sent Harry tumbling backwards over an ottoman.
\par 
\par \'93Malfoy!\'94 Harry yelled at him, trying to maintain his balance.
\par 
\par Katie glared at him, looking like she was going to hex him good. \'93Draco Malfoy! How did you know where to Apparate? I didn\rquote t tell you where I live!\'94
\par 
\par He smirked at her. \'93No, but I\rquote ve been here before. Your dad brought me, last summer, before we went to see his bloke in Diagon Alley for the tattoos. I can\rquote t believe you,\'94 he said, laughing and shaking his head. \'93
You were so bent on blindfolding me to take me out to Figg\rquote s car. I didn\rquote t feel like telling you back at the castle that that would be pointless. It was completely worth it to see the look on your--\'94 Now he sto
pped and really looked at her, his grin growing more lopsided by the moment.
\par 
\par \'93Hey--I like what you\rquote ve done with your hair--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Malfoy!\'94 Harry yelled. Draco Malfoy rolled his eyes. Sam stepped between them.
\par 
\par \'93Why don\rquote t we all sit and have something cold to drink?\'94
 he suggested. He fetched some Cokes from the kitchen and a beer for himself and they sat in the living room while waiting for Mrs. Figg. Katie and Harry told them about the Death Eaters and that one of them was Rita Skeeter.
\par 
\par Draco Malfoy whistled between his teeth. \'93So--maybe we\rquote ll find out if she really is Daisy Furuncle,\'94 he said, raising his eyebrows. Harry eyed him suspiciously.
\par 
\par \'93Yeah--maybe we will--\'94
\par 
\par The doorbell rang; it was Mrs. Figg, come to fetch Draco. They all went downstairs to see him off. Before he walked out the door of Sam and Katie\rquote s building he turned to Harry unexpectedly and said, \'93Oh, and Harry--I\rquote m--I\rquote 
m sorry I was getting on you for Ginny saving you and everything. I--I didn\rquote t realize what was going on at first--\'94
\par 
\par Harry could tell it wasn\rquote t easy for him to say it; he wondered whether Ginny had ordered him to do it. \'93It\rquote s all right, Draco,\'94 he said, forcing himself to also use the first name.
\par 
\par \'93Pity they have a pool instead of an enchanted lake, like at Hogwarts. I mean, at Hogwarts, if you fall in the lake, all you have to do is manage to get one of the enchanted creatures in there to touch you and you can breath under the water--\'94

\par 
\par \'93What?\'94 Harry said, frowning. \'93What are you talking about?\'94 But then he remembered that Dennis Creevey had been pushed back into the boat by the giant squid, and that Ginny had been underwater for an abnormally long period of time when he
\rquote d gone under the lake to battle the hybrid basilisk.
\par 
\par \'93You know. The enchanted creatures down there. Mermaids, the squid, all that. I heard they had to order them all to leave you and the other champions alone, not to help you, during the Tournament. That\rquote 
s their usual instinct. Except for the ones they wanted to attack you, like the Grindylows. It wouldn\rquote t have been much of a contest if the merpeople had been helping all of you, would it? Don\rquote t you know anything?\'94
\par 
\par Harry frowned, remembering Malfoy\rquote s father being so disdainful that Harry, Ron and Hermione hadn\rquote t known about the significance of the Westminster tube station. He restrained himself from retorting, gritting his teeth instead and saying, 
\'93I\rquote ll see you at the wedding later this month. Say hello to Aberforth and the lads for me.\'94
\par 
\par Malfoy laughed and shook his head. \'93Thought I\rquote d get you to take the bait that time. Oh well. Back to Figg\rquote s smelly old house....\'94
\par 
\par And climbed behind the wheel of the car (Mrs. Figg had moved over), slammed the door shut, and with a wave to Sam, he was gone.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par Harry was able to spend the next few days with Ron and Hermione at Ascog castle, and it almost felt like when they were younger and their hormones hadn\rquote t started to get in the way of their friendship. Harry and Hermione told Ron about St. Mungo
\rquote s; Harry told Ron and Hermione about the trip to London, and capturing Rita Skeeter. Hermione in particular listened avidly to his story about Rita. There was no love lost there.
\par 
\par \'93Sirius says she doesn\rquote t deny that she was a double agent, and she\rquote s threatening to take down Dumbledore\rquote s o
rganization, revealing that he had operatives working for him who did things that were outside the law. So far the Ministry seems to have just shrugged its collective shoulders about this. I mean, I don\rquote 
t think the Ministry is worried about that sort of thing right now as long as the operatives are bringing Death Eaters under control, you know? Before the Diagon Alley attack, it might have been different, but now....\'94
\par 
\par Hermione swallowed, and Harry thought she was perhaps remembering their trip to St. Mungo\rquote 
s; she looked at Ron and laced her fingers through his. He gazed back at her both lovingly and desperately and Harry realized it was his cue to give them some privacy. He made jokes and pretended to feel put-out, but as he walked down the stairs from the 
roof garden, where they\rquote d been sitting, he had a grin on his face. At least they might have a chance to be happy, he thought.
\par 
\par Ron told him that Hermione had shown him her Animagus form briefly and that she would be going to North America while they were at Hogwarts for the Quidditch match they\rquote 
d planned to attend. Harry tried to pry out of him what her animal was, to no avail; Ron had been grinning the whole time, shaking his head and sometimes laughing outright at Harry\rquote s suggestions.
\par 
\par \'93A stoat! She\rquote s not going to be a bloody stoat.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Erm--falcon.\'94
\par 
\par Ron made a face. \'93Our Hermione, a bird of any sort? Yeah--she loves heights, does Hermione. That\rquote s really going to happen....\'94
\par 
\par Just before Hermione was scheduled to take a Portkey back to Greenwich the next day, she stood on the landing outside her room with her bags, waiting to say goodbye to Harry and Ron. She hugged Harry soundly,
 and he held her closely, so glad they were all right again, cherishing the memories of the previous days they\rquote 
d spent together, the three of them, just like it used to be (Mostly). Then she turned to Ron, with that look in her eyes which Harry had first seen in the forest, not long before Ron was bitten. She slid her arms up around Ron\rquote 
s neck and started to pull his face down to hers, but Ron stopped just short of her lips and looked at Harry.
\par 
\par \'93Er, do you have to keep standing there, Harry?\'94
\par 
\par Hermione put her hand on his cheek and turned his attention back to her. \'93I don\rquote t care who sees us...\'94 she whispered, and he finally let himself be pulled down to her. Harry saw him open his mouth and then she did the same. One of Ron\rquote 
s hands laced itself into her hair and the other circled her waist, pulling her very close to him. Suddenly, Harry was feeling that perhaps he should have made himself scarce. He remembered the way she kissed....
\par 
\par It was Ron who broke the kiss, having turned a red deep enough to compete with his hair. \'93See you soon,\'94 he said raspily to her, as though he didn\rquote t quite have his breath back. \'93We\rquote 
re all going to meet up in Diagon Alley. On the wireless they say most of the shops should be rebuilt in another week.\'94
\par 
\par Hermione grinned. \'93I should be back by then,\'94 she said merrily, her eyes sliding over to Harry, who threw his hands up in frustration.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, come on. Tell me! I\rquote ll keep it a secret--\'94
\par 
\par \'93No, no! I shouldn\rquote t have shown Ron, but I couldn\rquote t resist--\'94
\par 
\par Harry couldn\rquote t help the lascivious grin that crept across his face. \'93What else did you show Ron while I was gone...?\'94
\par 
\par She swatted his arm. \'93Oh, you! Filthy, filthy mind--\'94
\par 
\par But she was laughing, and gave each of them an additional hug before picking up her bags, then the old empty ginger bee
r can which was her Portkey. At the precise time the Portkey was to take effect, sure enough, she disappeared utterly, like a light that winked out, and Ron and Harry were left on the landing, just the two of them. Ron sighed, looking at the empty space w
here she\rquote d been just moments before, and Harry slung his arm across his best friend\rquote s shoulders and offered to let him beat him at chess.
\par 
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par After Ron went back to the Burrow, Harry learned about the usual rhythms of life at Ascog Castle. He played with Orion, Leo and Mercy (Who was frightfully good at chess, but sometimes not as good as she thought she was), and sometimes read to them at bedt
ime. He grew better acquainted with Ursula and Alan, and with Sirius\rquote  parents; and he learned to walk wide circles around Cass and Floyd, especially when they\rquote 
d just returned home from their jobs with piles of work to do overnight. Harry never saw Cass smile, and he could swear Floyd was scowling at him every time he happened to meet his gaze.
\par 
\par He put to good use some of the things Ginny had taught him, swimming in the underground pool--but only when someone else was around. Sirius and Ursula and Alan would 
join him down there after the children were in bed, and the four of them laughed and talked and splashed about in the pool, Harry feeling almost like they accepted him as not only a member of the household, but as another adult. It was suddenly like havin
g two older brothers and an older sister, a strange sensation for Harry, after being the eldest son in his other life.
\par 
\par The Quidditch match at Hogwarts was three days before the full moon; Harry and Ron were going to Hog\rquote s End the night before the match, st
aying over, then walking up to the castle early the next morning. Sirius did not want him to go; he was worried about Harry\rquote s safety, especially after the trip back to London.
\par 
\par When the time came for him to go to Hogsmeade, Harry bade Sirius farewell, and Sirius again tried to convince him not to go.
\par 
\par \'93Harry, when you were driving down to London with Katie, you ran into Death Eaters and could have been killed! Now you\rquote re going to be sitting in the Quidditch stadium at Hogwarts with a thousand other people. You don\rquote 
t think Voldemort will think a match at Hogwarts is a prime opportunity, either to go after you specifically or just a large crowd?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Sirius--the Ministry has so many security precautions planned it\rquote s not funny. And you can\rquote t Apparate or Disapparate anywhere on the Hogwarts grounds anyway. They\rquote 
re even considering moving more of the professional matches there and running additional trains to the village to bring spectators. It\rquote s safer than anywhere else in Britain for watching Quidditch.\'94
\par 
\par Sirius frowned. \'93I don\rquote t know--I have loads of things to do or I\rquote d come with you, just to be sure--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Sirius, it\rquote s safe as houses. Trust me. Stop worrying. Oh, by the way--is there any news about Rita Skeeter? Or the bank?\'94
\par 
\par Sirius sighed. \'93No and no. You can\rquote t see inside the bank and there\rquote s been no word. Complete and utter silence. And I can\rquote t help but think that it\rquote s too bad she wasn\rquote t really on our side; she\rquote 
d be the perfect person to infiltrate it. Sometimes I wish I\rquote d chosen an animal a bit smaller, so I could do things like that...\'94
\par 
\par Harry nodded. \'93Me too. What about the Rita and Daisy thing?\'94
\par 
\par Sirius snorted. \'93She claims she knows nothing about it, and that in fact whoever is doing it is imitating her without crediting her. She reckons the name is a dig at 
her as well. Her full first name is Marguerite, which is another name for a daisy. And a \lquote Skeeter,\rquote  or mosquito, is also a pest, or an annoyance. A \lquote Furuncle\rquote 
 is kind of a boil, also an annoyance in its way. On the other hand, she says she loves the Daisy articles, so I\rquote m not sure whether to believe her....\'94
\par 
\par Harry sighed. \'93And why hasn\rquote t she been given Veritaserum?\'94
\par 
\par Sirius drew his lips into a line. \'93You have to understand, Harry; that Potion isn\rquote t universally accepted as a way to get the truth out of someone. It\rquote s not standard procedure or anything. And technically, Rita\rquote 
s not going to be charged with much. There\rquote s very little hard evidence against her at all. She\rquote s mostly been a spy for the other side, and while spying will get her a sentence, it won\rquote t g
et her much of a sentence. Not compared to someone who\rquote s done the Unforgivable Curses.\'94
\par 
\par This was starting to depress Harry; then he remembered what Sirius had said about having loads to do. \'93What do you have to do, precisely?\'94
\par 
\par Sirius gave a small smile and put his finger to the side of his nose. \'93Top secret. Which means I\rquote ll fill you in after the fact.\'94 Then his smile grew into a grin. \'93Oh, I suppose there\rquote 
s no harm....Snape and I have some undercover work to do. We\rquote re looking into where Annie Weasley has been all these years. Maggie\rquote s family is back, they\rquote ve learned she\rquote s a witch, and they\rquote 
ve put us onto the agency through which they adopted her. Place in Exeter. But to look into it, we have to appear to be respectable muggles. You know the drill.\'94
\par 
\par Harry grinned. \'93So you might find Annie!\'94
\par 
\par Sirius nodded. \'93Hope so. It would be nice if something went our way for once. It starting to feel like Voldemort and his people are just pecking, pecking away at us. First it\rquote s one thing, then another...Anyway, wish us luck.\'94
\par 
\par Harry did, wholeheartedly, before throwing some Floo powder into the fire in the sitting room and saying loudly, \'93Hog\rquote s End!\'94 It seemed very strange to be saying the name of what he considered to be his own house, but he didn\rquote 
t have time to think about this; soon he was whirling through the many fires of the Floo network, and he once again stumbled when he emerged from the fire.
\par 
\par He almost turned around and went back to Ascog. Ginny was standing in the entrance hall of Hog\rquote s End, her hands on her hips, glaring at Ron. The pair of them hadn\rquote t noticed his arrival. They were too absorbed in their argument.
\par 
\par \'93I told you I was coming to the match. Why do you have to be so--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yeah, and I suppose that means that Malfoy will be 
here, too, trying to sneak into your room at night. Do you know how many locking charms I had to put on the guest room door at Ascog to keep him from going out at night? And how many bad jokes I had to hear about me wanting him all to myself? I want him a
ll to myself, all right, so I can pound him into the ground....\'94
\par 
\par \'93I certainly didn\rquote t make any arrangements to meet him at night, so don\rquote t look at me that way.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Right. I\rquote m supposed to believe that? You\rquote re not a little girl anymore, Ginny. Others have noticed. Why haven\rquote t you?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I haven\rquote t done anything of which to be ashamed, Ronald Weasley. Draco--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Hasn\rquote t once pressured you to sleep with him? Come on, Ginny. I think I know that snake a little better than that.\'94
\par 
\par Sandy hissed to Harry, \'93I believe he is using \lquote Snake\rquote  in a derogatory manner again....\'94
\par 
\par Harry hushed her. Neither Weasley noticed the hissing.
\par 
\par \'93Why are you still with him, anyway? Just because he put his dad in prison? Sometimes you\rquote re as bad as Hermione. Can\rquote t ever admit you\rquote re wrong. Just get it over with and break up with--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Ahem!\'94 Harry said loudly now, hoping to keep Ron from finishing what he was saying. That\rquote 
s the last thing we all need, he thought. Something about Ron being right, and ordering you to do something, just made you want to be contrary and do the opposite thing. Hasn\rquote 
t he learned his lesson? Harry thought. After he told me to break up with Hermione we were together for another eight months. Ron could see what was wrong and what was right, but he couldn\rquote 
t translate that into convincing others. When it came to that he was completely incompetent. Harry hoped Ron wasn\rquote t planning to go to work in sales for Percy and the twins. If he did, Harry reckoned they\rquote 
d be out of business in no more than a week.
\par 
\par Ron and Ginny looked at Harry, both turning red. Harry stepped toward them, trying to keep his voice steady.
\par 
\par \'93Ginny\rquote s made it very clear many times that she wants to be with Draco Malfoy, Ron. We should all respect her wishes.\'94 His eyes were locked with hers while he said this, feeling hollow inside. Ginny suddenly looked very open and vulnerable.

\par 
\par Now it was Ron who cleared his throat. \'93Well, all I know is I wasn\rquote t expecting to have to put up with that prat again already. I just wanted to see a Quidditch match, and--\'94
\par 
\par \'93He\rquote s not coming!\'94 Ginny burst out suddenly, her voice very sharp. She tore her eyes away from Harry\rquote s and glared at her brother again. He glared right back.
\par 
\par \'93He\rquote s in Surrey,\'94 she continued. \'93We probably won\rquote t be able to see each other again until Alicia\rquote s wedding. Are you happy?\'94
\par 
\par Ron looked confused for a moment, then blustered, \'93Well, yeah. I guess I am. But--but why do you get the best room? Every time--\'94
\par 
\par \'93If you want your pick of the guest rooms, Ron, you should be better organized so you can leave sooner. I was here first and I claimed my room. You and Harry can decide who\rquote s getting which of the other two. No--I take that back. I\rquote ll ta
ke Harry up to the other nice room, and you can take what\rquote s left. That\rquote s what you get for being so annoying. Come on, Harry. I\rquote ll show you where to put your things.\'94
\par 
\par She turned from both of them and started marching purposefully up the broad stairs. Harry followed, carrying his bag. He turned to glance at Ron for a second; Ron was scowling.
\par 
\par When they reached the top of the stairs, Ginny turned right and Harry followed her. She opened a heavy oak door; Harry hesitated, then crossed the threshold. He swallowed, looking around.
\par 
\par Jamie\rquote s room.
\par 
\par He bit his lip to keep from crying, thinking of the years he and Jamie had played in here, and in his room as well. The four-poster bed was exactly where his sister\rquote s used to be, and the diamond-paned window looking out
 over the garden was the same as ever, as was the massive carved wooden mantelpiece and overmantel.
\par 
\par \'93Harry--are you all right?\'94 Ginny said softly.
\par 
\par He turned to her, trying to compose himself again. \'93Of course,\'94 he said in a voice he wished didn\rquote t sound so strangled. \'93I\rquote m fine,\'94 he added, his voice closer to normal now. She nodded uncertainly.
\par 
\par \'93G--good. You just seemed--odd.\'94
\par 
\par He forced a laugh. \'93And that\rquote s different how?\'94
\par 
\par Now she laughed too, and he tried not to be so glad to see that, but it was very hard. He sobered now and stepped toward her.
\par 
\par \'93I want you to know, Ginny. I\rquote m--I\rquote m trying to make my peace with you being with Malfoy.\'94 It was a lie, but he knew the truth would just antagonize her. And maybe if he repeated this particular lie enough times he\rquote 
d come to believe it himself. She held onto the doorframe, meeting his gaze, unflinching.
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s good,\'94 she whispered.
\par 
\par \'93I just want you to be happy,\'94 he said more softly, unable to take his eyes away from hers. \'93I think that\rquote s what Ron wants too. He\rquote s just--well, completely tactless about communicating that\'94.}{\f1\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 

\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par Ginny laughed and the spell was broken. \'93Truer words were never spoken. No one will ever confuse my brother for a diplomat.\'94 He laughed with her, but Harry thought, That\rquote s why he\rquote s such a valuable friend.
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m all right here. Why don\rquote t you break it to Ron that he\rquote s staying in the scullery?\'94
\par 
\par She flashed him another brilliant smile before she left, and when he was certain he was alone, he collapsed on the bed, his heart thudding painfully in his chest.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par They had a raucous dinner at the Three Broomsticks with the other residents of Hog\rquote s End. It was good to see the twins and Percy again when they weren\rquote t trying to be on their \lquote mum and dad\rquote 
 behavior. Harry was glad to see that Percy was loosening up, finally (For him). He actually laughed and joined in the conversation, and he didn\rquote t attempt to bore them all with the various bookkeeping woes of running a successful business.
\par 
\par When they returned to the house, they stayed up late playing charades and Exploding Snap and wizarding chess. It almost felt to Harry like the old days in the Gryffindor common room, except that Hermione wasn\rquote t sitting in the corner with 
piles of books while everyone around her was having fun. They all dragged themselves up to bed well after midnight, and Harry fell on his bed with his clothes on, asleep immediately.
\par 
\par He wasn\rquote t sure what time it was when he awoke; his candles were still bu
rning, and he decided to get out of his hot jeans and sleep in his underwear as usual. Then, when he was about to return to the bed, he realized that he had to visit the loo. He dug his summer dressing gown out of his bag and tied it around his waist, pad
ding barefoot down the corridor to the bath shared by the bedrooms at the end of the house closest to the top of the stairs.
\par 
\par He stopped and yawned hugely when he was in the corridor again, finally looking at his watch. It was after three in the morning. He dragged his feet back to his room, turning the doorknob, then thinking idly, I didn\rquote 
t close the door all the way. I shouldn\rquote t have to turn the knob.
\par 
\par As soon as he was in the room, he saw the way the moonlight was shining in the bay window, over the window seat, and he walked to it as though mesmerized. He sat down on the window seat where he\rquote 
d spent many, many hours in his other childhood. He loved the way he could see down the High Street in one direction and over the fields in the other; it made him thi
nk of seeing both the future and the past from one vantage point. He lifted his face to the moonlight, bringing his feet up onto the cushion, hugging his legs to his chest and feeling more peaceful than he had in a long time.
\par 
\par \'93Harry!\'94
\par 
\par He whipped his head around. Oh, that\rquote s right.... This was no longer his room. In the night, returning from the bathroom, his feet had automatically taken him here instead of to what he thought of as Jamie\rquote 
s room. Someone else had this room; then he saw the \lquote Someone else' quite clearly, and his heart leapt into his throat.
\par 
\par Ginny was sitting up in the bed, which wasn't where his bed had been in his old life. He hadn\rquote t even noticed there was a bed when he\rquote d entered; he\rquote d gone straight for the bay window. The sheet was around her waist and he couldn
\rquote t help noticing that she was sleeping in a very thin summer nightdress. His jaw worked soundlessly; he didn\rquote t know what to say.
\par 
\par \'93Harry, what do you think you\rquote re doing in my room?\'94

\par 
\par 
\par 
\par \'93Harry, what do you think you\rquote re doing in my room?\'94 
\par 
\par Harry looked at her. Ginny was so pale in the moonlight that she seemed to glow from within. He swallowed. A million lies leapt to his tongue, but he couldn\rquote 
t bear to utter one of them. It had been so comforting to tell Snape about his other life, to show him the Pensieve. If he told Ginny about that life, would she believe him?
\par 
\par She clutched at the basilisk amulet on her breast, her eyes closed, and Harry remembered that he\rquote d already told her that a time traveler had given him the second amulet. She had se
emed to believe him at the time. Perhaps he could build on that--explain to her that he was the time traveler. That he had given it to himself.
\par 
\par He rose and started toward the bed, so he could sit closer to her, to tell her. That\rquote s all he had in mind, but her eyes flew open and she said urgently, \'93Stop!\'94
\par 
\par He froze. Putting up his hands defensively, he stuttered, \'93I--I wasn\rquote t trying anything. Honestly. I just didn\rquote t want to shout across the room--\'94
\par 
\par \'93I didn\rquote t think you were trying anything. It\rquote s just that--\'94 She bit her lip, and Harry saw that she was still holding the amulet.
\par 
\par \'93You know that he can see you when he\rquote s touching the amulet,\'94 he said with surety. She nodded.
\par 
\par \'93Yes, so don\rquote t come too close. Or else he\rquote ll see you, too.\'94
\par 
\par Harry frowned. Just after he\rquote 
d almost drowned and Draco Malfoy had fallen down the stairs because of his Mark hurting, there was no time to consider the fact that Draco Malfoy had actually seen Ginny when he held the amulet--just as Harry had seen her. Did that mean he really loved 
her? he wondered. Could he love her and cheat on her at the same time?
\par 
\par \'93You\rquote re already holding onto your amulet; can\rquote t you see whether he\rquote s awake? Is it too dark in his room at Mrs. Figg\rquote s?\'94
\par 
\par She gazed at him as though he should know the answer to this. Harry waited, perplexed, and she finally said in a whisper, \'93I don\rquote t see him when I hold the amulet, Harry.\'94
\par 
\par The most difficult thing he had ever done was to not leap across the room and take her in his arms. He remembered that she had clutched at the amulet and then discovered him in the en suite bathroom. She had seen him. But that didn\rquote 
t explain her reaction...
\par 
\par He swallowed and willed himself to have self-control. \'93This should be far enough,\'94 he said shakily, as he returned to the window seat. \'93Whenever I saw you, it was like a six-foot diameter bubble around you. It didn\rquote 
t reach farther than that.\'94
\par 
\par She touched the amulet again and a smile blossomed on her face. \'93You--you saw me? When you held it? Really?\'94
\par 
\par He smiled warmly back at her. \'93Really.\'94
\par 
\par She was looking at him the way she had after she\rquote d revived him, and his heart skipped a beat. Why is she still with Malfoy? She doesn\rquote t see him when she holds the amulet, and she does see me. And she knows what that means. So--
\par 
\par \'93Why are you in my room, Harry? You didn\rquote t answer me.\'94
\par 
\par Oh, right, he remembered. My other life.
\par 
\par \'93W-well, Ginny, what I have to tell you may sound pretty far-fetched. But it\rquote s all true. Do you remember when I tried to give you the amulet last Christmas and I told you it was from a time traveler?\'94
\par 
\par She answered slowly. \'93Yes--\'94
\par 
\par He took a deep breath; it was now or never. \'93Well--I was that time traveler.\'94
\par 
\par She looked at him blankly, very still, very quiet. Finally she said, \'93I\rquote m afraid I don\rquote t understand.\'94
\par 
\par He took another deep breath then and explained that he\rquote d been having nightmares during the previous summer, and didn\rquote t get a proper night\rquote 
s sleep for about two months. He told her about Voldemort putting the Tempus Fugit spell on him at King\rquote s Cross, about being taken to Godric\rquote s Ho
llow and doing the Tempus Bonae Voluntatis spell, traveling back in time to the night his parents were killed.
\par 
\par Her jaw dropped. \'93Harry! How could you?\'94
\par 
\par He hit his brow repeatedly with his fist and leaned over where he sat, his head in his hands. \'93I know, I know. So stupid! But--but he told me something before I did. I wasn\rquote 
t even sure whether he was lying. He could have done, I suppose. But somehow--something told me he wasn\rquote t...\'94
\par 
\par Softly, he told Ginny about his mother being pregnant when she died, about the sister who had never been born. She covered her mouth in horror, her eyes glistening. He described his parents in the cozy cottage, how wonderful it was to see them.
\par 
\par \'93And when he was about to kill her,\'94 he told Ginny, \'93I--I just couldn\rquote t let him. The first time, anyway.\'94
\par 
\par She uncovered her mouth. \'93What do you mean, the first time?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, the first time, I--I convinced my mother to save herself and me,\'94 he explained. He couldn\rquote t bear to tell her he\rquote d used Imperius.
\par 
\par \'93With a spell,\'94 she said quietly. It wasn\rquote t a question. He nodded sheepishly. Perhaps he could tell her.
\par 
\par \'93It was--\'94
\par 
\par \'93No.\'94 She\rquote d put her hand up to stop him. \'93I--I think I know what spell you\rquote re talking about. Don\rquote t tell me, and I can truthfully say you didn\rquote t.\'94 Harry nodded; she had guessed, and she wasn\rquote 
t screaming at him, telling him what an awful person he was. She was trying to protect him instead.
\par 
\par \'93Well,\'94 he went on, \'93I didn\rquote t actually get that memory in my head until months later, in May, after I fixed the timeli
nes. The only memory I had of that until then was a memory of the second time. The second time, I was taken into the trees near the house well before Voldemort arrived to kill my parents.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Taken? By whom?\'94
\par 
\par \'93By me.\'94
\par 
\par She frowned. \'93I hate to say this again--but I don\rquote t understand.\'94
\par 
\par \'93I was stunned and taken into the trees by me; a me who had come from the future, but not this future; a different future that I had created by saving my mother the first time. That\rquote s why it was the second time. The me who had 
traveled back in time to stop me from changing time had been the one to do it the first time. I--he--I--oh, bother!--I saved my mother by--by convincing her to plead for my life and hers. That time, she did what Voldemort wanted and promised to raise me a
s his servant. He put an Obedience Charm on me--\'94
\par 
\par \'93You too!\'94 she exclaimed.
\par 
\par \'93--}{\f1\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 A}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 nd he left. Then I traveled forward in time again, back to the first of September. But it was a very, very different first of September. It was a world where my mother hadn
\rquote t been killed by Voldemort, and a world where he hadn\rquote t tried and failed to kill me, losing his power.\'94
\par 
\par \'93He had never fallen,\'94 she said in awe.
\par 
\par Harry was grim. \'93It was terrible. The world was terrible. Well--not all of it. I finally had almost everything I\rquote d ever wanted. I had a family--a real family. Mother, stepfather, sister, half-brothers--And we lived here. At Hog\rquote 
s End. This was my room. I lived here for over ten years.\'94 He could see that she understood now. She looked around at the large, gracious room. \'93I really wasn\rquote 
t trying anything when I came in here. I had been to the loo, and when I came back, it was just--force of habit. You had put me in what I thought of as Jamie\rquote s room.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Jamie?\'94
\par 
\par \'93My sister.\'94
\par 
\par He saw her swallow. \'93Oh,\'94 was all she said, staring at him. He went on.
\par 
\par \'93So suddenly, I had this life with everything I\rquote d ever wanted. But the price was that it was a world where Voldemort had never fallen. Well, that wasn\rquote t the only price; I also had to serve him. I was initiate
d as a Death Eater, and then told to--to do something--\'94
\par 
\par \'93A Death Eater!\'94 He nodded. \'93What--what were you told to do?\'94 she whispered, as though she didn\rquote t quite want to find out.
\par 
\par He could barely get the words out. \'93I was told to kill Ron.\'94
\par 
\par Her mouth was wide open in an \lquote O.\rquote  \'93He told you to kill your best friend?\'94
\par 
\par Harry shook his head. \'93Ron wasn\rquote t my best friend. We--we didn\rquote t get on at all. After all, he was in Gryffindor and I was in Slytherin.\'94
\par 
\par He had thought she looked shocked before, but now--
\par 
\par \'93Slytherin!\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, my dad was the head-of-house--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Dad? You said you had a stepfather. So did your father live, too? Did your mother and father split up and then she remarried?\'94
\par 
\par \'93No, no; my father was killed by Voldemort just like before. My mother remarried when I was three-and-a-half. I always called my stepfather Dad.\'94
\par 
\par He could see her mind working furiously, her brow furrowed; when she looked up at him her eyes were very round. \'93Harry--was your stepfather--Professor Snape?\'94
\par 
\par He smiled at her reaction; he wasn't sure he'd ever seen her look so shocked. \'93
When I first realized that he was--well, I can't even begin to tell you everything that was going through my head. But he was actually a really good dad. I got used to him being my dad pretty quickly. M
aybe it was because my mum....well. That can wait. Anyway, my best friend\rquote s name was earlier in the alphabet than mine, and he\rquote d already been sorted into Slytherin. When my turn came to be sorted I asked to be put into Slytherin--and I was.
\'94
\par 
\par \'93You asked?\'94
\par 
\par He shrugged. \'93In this life I asked not to be in Slytherin, and the Hat put me into Gryffindor. I knew most people are just put into one house or the other, but both times I was sorted, it gave me a choice. My sister said she was given a choice, too.
\'94
\par 
\par \'93You said your best friend was already in Slytherin. Who was it?\'94
\par 
\par He looked at her steadily, a very clear picture forming in his mind of the boy in his other life who had been his friend for over ten years.
\par 
\par \'93Draco Malfoy.\'94 Her gasp erupted in the quiet room like an explosion. He explained to her that his mother and Snape had been \lquote befriended\rquote 
 by the Malfoys--the other family whose son was in the Prophecy--and he and Draco had grown up together, along with Jamie. He told her how the three of them were never
 apart, and how Draco and Jamie had fallen in love. And how he and Draco were initiated together. She merely nodded at that.
\par 
\par \'93Well, he didn\rquote t have different parents, did he?\'94
\par 
\par \'93But in that life, he was told to kill someone.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Who was he told to kill?\'94 she asked shakily.
\par 
\par He gazed at her steadily again. \'93You.\'94
\par 
\par She had no words. Her jaw opened and closed soundlessly. He explained the Muggle-born ban to her, and the General Strike, which had led to her and Ron being targeted, which in turn led to his mother
 deciding that she knew how to get around the Obedience Charm.
\par 
\par \'93So,\'94 she said softly, \'93She was going to kill the two of us so you and Draco wouldn\rquote t have to?\'94
\par 
\par He shook his head. \'93Just Ron. She wasn\rquote t concerned about Draco. But--I couldn\rquote t let her. I didn\rquote t let her. I--I disarmed her--\'94
\par 
\par Unbidden, the tears cascaded down his face as he looked into the night sky, remembering his mother flying backward, remembering the sound when she struck the cave wall and the sight of her still, crumpled body on the ground.
\par 
\par \'93It killed her. I killed her,\'94 he said simply, turning his face back to Ginny\rquote s, which he saw was also wet with tears. He so wanted to be holding her, crying out his heart; it was agony to stay where he was. \'93
I was convicted at trial and sentenced to five years in Azkaban.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Azkaban!\'94 she said in a fearful whisper. \'93So that\rquote s--that\rquote s how you knew...\'94 He nodded to her, knowing that she was talking about when they\rquote 
d been in the sitting room at Ascog, and Harry had voiced his fears to them all about the dementors leaving Azkaban.
\par 
\par \'93And then--I had a letter. A letter telling me that you and Jamie had both been murdered. I--I couldn\rquote t stay where I was. I knew that world was wrong, for so many reasons, and I had to do something to fix it. I escaped, the same 
way Sirius had, using my Animagus abilities.\'94
\par 
\par \'93So--you changed the timelines back because your sister died?\'94
\par 
\par He swallowed. \'93And--and you. When I managed to--to find my way back to this life, I was so glad to see you--\'94
\par 
\par She gasped. \'93That\rquote s when you came running into my dorm and--and--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes.\'94
\par 
\par He remembered holding her tightly, kissing her, the way she had clung to him and kissed him back before coming to her senses....
\par 
\par \'93Harry--you said that you had had a dream--a very real dream. You said that I died in your dream. That--that wasn\rquote t a dream, was it?\'94 He shook his head, gazing longingly at her. \'93Harry,\'94 she whispered now; \'93
What was I to you in that life?\'94
\par 
\par He couldn\rquote t hide his feelings from her any longer; his face showing all of his love, and she knew, she knew....
\par 
\par \'93Do you even have to ask?\'94 he choked. They were both crying freely now; she was a blur to him, but he could hear her sniffling.
\par 
\par \'93Harry,\'94 she said in a thick voice, \'93In that life, was--was it Draco who killed me?\'94
\par 
\par He swallowed. \'93No, Ginny. He--he sacrificed himself to save us all,\'94 he told her. He explained about the diary, and Draco not wanting to be part of the time change, so he wouldn\rquote t remember Jamie.
\par 
\par \'93He did that?\'94
\par 
\par \'93If he hadn\rquote t--\'94 Harry pushed his glasses up and wiped the tears from his face, not wanting to think of what the world would have been like if he hadn\rquote t been able to fix the timelines. He didn\rquote 
t even tell her about the changes in the muggle world, the wars....
\par 
\par She sat up straighter, wiping her own tears, and looking hopeful. \'93Do you think--do you think he would do that in this time? I mean--I don't want him to die. I just wonder--the Obedience Charm--\'94
\par 
\par He shrugged. \'93I really don\rquote t know, Gin. He was so different in so many ways. He and Jamie and I grew up together. He would do anything for me. But--it\rquote s just not the same in this life. He\rquote s not the same.\'94
\par 
\par She sat back against her pillows now, fingering the amulet. \'93He frightens me so,\'94 she whispered. \'93Sometimes. Not all the time. I--I wonder how much longer I can stand being with him. Oh, Harry, I wish he wasn\rquote t in that damn Prophecy!\'94

\par 
\par Harry gaped at her. \'93What are you saying, Ginny?\'94
\par 
\par She sighed. \'93You\rquote ve been completely open and honest with me, Harry, and--I haven\rquote t been with you. But I want to be. I feel so tired. So utterly tired. Acting all the time like I\rquote 
m so in love with him. Yes, I had feelings for him at one time. I\rquote d convinced myself that you were never going to give me the time of day and I n
eeded to get on with my life. Draco and I became friends. And then more than friends. And then we became caught up in the plan to trap his father.\'94 She covered her face with her hands. \'93I\rquote 
m so ashamed of what I did in the Potions Dungeon, when you and Ron found me. But--but I\rquote 
m so glad you found me when you did. I--I was half-afraid he was going to try to make it far more realistic than we had discussed. Oh, Harry! I was so glad to see you and Ron--\'94
\par 
\par He recalled how real her shivering had been, and the way she had clung to him when he\rquote 
d carried her up to the infirmary. Later, he had felt inclined to agree with Malfoy that she was quite the actress. Now it seemed she had been doing far less acting than they\rquote d originally suspected.
\par 
\par \'93And later, of course, I had to put a good face on it. When he was trying to be sweet, he could be very sweet, and I tried to forget about the dungeon and tell myself that he\rquote d been acting, too.
\par 
\par \'93But the longer I\rquote ve been with him, the less right it feels. He keeps pressuring me. You know. And sometimes I think he might--might--snap. So many times I\rquote ve cried myself to sleep at night, wishing I hadn\rquote 
t given up on you. But I had to make out in public that I was happy, that we were the model couple.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Why?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, at first it was because of his father. And then I realized that it was far better to have him on our side. You know what they say: Keep your friends close--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--And your enemies closer,\'94 he finished, watching her.
\par 
\par \'93Exactly. And then--then you took me flying for the first time,\'94 she whispered. \'93And I--I couldn\rquote 
t not do that again. Spending time with you was so wonderful. I thought--at least we can be together as friends. I really thought we could, that I could prevent the old feelings from coming back....But it was so hard t
o be with you, and talk with you, and fly with you, and to see that you had feelings for me....and then not admit that I felt the same way....Plus I had Hermione to think of....But the day you saved me from the Lethifold, I couldn\rquote 
t stand it any more, and I gave in...\'94
\par 
\par Harry remembered the way she had seemed to abandon all of her reserve when she kissed him back--and what an effort it was for her to separate herself from him and to tell him she would no longer meet him on top of the Astronomy Tower. \'93But--I couldn
\rquote t break up with him--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Why not?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Harry! What do you think he\rquote d do if I did that? I don\rquote t mean to me--somehow I don\rquote t get the impression he would try to hurt me. It\rquote s you I\rquote ve been worried about. You know he\rquote 
d blame you. And now that we know about the Obedience Charm, it\rquote s a very good thing I didn\rquote t break up with him, isn\rquote t it? I mean--he\rquote s like--like--\'94
\par 
\par \'93A ticking bomb,\'94 Harry said.
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote ll do, I suppose,\'94 she conceded. \'93We certainly don\rquote t want him to change sides, Harry. Think of everything
 he knows now! He knows about you being a Golden Griffin Animagus, about your Invisibility Cloak, about your aunt having magical abilities--\'94
\par 
\par \'93He knows where Katie lives and he didn\rquote t tell her, and now she\rquote s going to train to be an Auror--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Good Lord,\'94 she breathed.
\par 
\par Harry looked at her desperately. \'93This is all my fault. This is worse than Hermione being with Viktor Krum--and I say that even now that I know Viktor was Voldemort\rquote s heir. It\rquote 
s my fault. I-I treated you like some kind of carrot to dangle in front to him, and now--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Harry!\'94 she interrupted him. \'93I did that willingly. No one pushed me into it. And I thought--I thought he might truly change. I thought that if he wasn\rquote t under his father\rquote s influence, he might be different.\'94 Harry thought how d
ifferent he was after ten years with him and Jamie. \'93He really didn\rquote t seem enthusiastic about being a Death Eater, after all. And I admit--I was rather attracted to him. And he was attracted to me. I wasn\rquote 
t supposed to be thinking of you--you were with Hermione. He was even making an effort to get along with my family. I thought--All right. I can get over Harry and be happy with Draco....\'94
\par 
\par Harry scrutinized her. \'93What went wrong?\'94
\par 
\par She sighed. \'93I didn\rquote t get over you, that\rquote s what went wrong. And Draco kept accusing me at every turn of still having feelings for you--which didn\rquote 
t exactly endear him to me. It was a bit of a vicious cycle. Not that I could let any of that show in public....He started to do things. He\rquote d ogle other girls right in front of me to ge
t a rise out of me. And I have to admit--he got to me at first. I don\rquote t enjoy being humiliated.\'94 Harry shook his head, restraining himself from saying what he really thought. \'93And then--there was the incessant pressure to sleep with him--\'94

\par 
\par \'93Oh, Ginny. That must have been awful, him trying to make you do something you didn\rquote t want to do--\'94
\par 
\par \'93What? Oh, right. Well, yes--as I said, it started off that way--\'94 She started playing with the sheet with her fingers, plucking at it nervously, not looking at him.
\par 
\par He frowned. \'93What are you saying? I thought you didn\rquote t want to sleep with him?\'94 His voice shook.
\par 
\par \'93Well,\'94 her voice was shaking now as well, \'93Not as such. And I certainly didn\rquote t when I was only fifteen. Some girls are ready at that point, but I wasn\rquote t, and he just didn\rquote t respect that at all. But--but I\rquote 
m older now. And sometimes....Let me put it this way. When I got hacked off at Katie for telling me Draco had been cheating on me, I\rquote d--I\rquote d just been upstairs with him, and we were, um, let\rquote s just call it snogging...\'94
\par 
\par Harry tried not to feel aroused by her telling him this. She was blushing in the dim light that was starting to permeate the sky; they\rquote d been talking for some time.
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote d had the thought before that I--well, that what would be the harm in finally g
iving in? I had very nearly given in at the end of the term, when I received my O.W.L. results--well, to be honest--I was so excited about my results, I practically attacked him. If Professor Sprout hadn\rquote t interrupted us--\'94
\par 
\par \'93I know.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, that\rquote s right. Well--technically, he is my boyfriend. I\rquote m just a flesh and blood human being, and he can--he can be very persuasive.\'94 She was blushing even more deeply. \'93
But that day at Ascog--I touched the amulet and saw you kissing Katie. And I felt like I wanted to die
. It was one thing to see the two of you in bed together, just lying there; to actually see you doing something, looking like--like you desired her so utterly....I remembered that I was trying to get him to be fed up with me and leave me, and that wasn
\rquote t very likely to happen if I slept with him. I put him off again and told him I wasn\rquote t ready--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Which was a lie,\'94 Harry said softly. \'93You haven\rquote t slept with him because you\rquote re hoping that will make him leave you.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes, it was a lie! I\rquote m not made of stone, you know. And he was--oh, I don\rquote t want to get into it. I\rquote 
m sorry I was so cross with Katie. But--but I was feeling very frustrated having to stop Draco yet again, and cross with myself for not wanting to stop him, since I didn\rquote t really care for him and it was just a physical thing, and I\rquote 
d seen you kissing her, and then Katie was basically shredding my plans by telling me Draco was an unfaithful cad....Did she think I was stupid? Of course he\rquote s an unfaithful cad. I know that. He\rquote s Draco
 Malfoy. Good heavens, he was sneaking around with Mariah all last year!\'94
\par 
\par \'93You know about that too?\'94
\par 
\par She raised her eyebrows at him. \'93You know about that?\'94
\par 
\par He felt very, very small. She continued, \'93My dilemma is--I\rquote ve got to convince him to be the one to break up with me, or there\rquote 
ll be hell to pay all round. Luckily, that sneak had already tried to cover his tracks with a letter--which I knew was a pack of lies the moment I read it--and so I had something I could wave in Katie\rquote s face.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Why were you attacking me, then? When you saw I was in the bath, I mean.\'94
\par 
\par She looked at him levelly now. \'93Because I knew that meant that you knew he\rquote d been cheating on me. I--I thought better of you, Harry. I would have thought you would tell me such a thing, not leave 
it to Katie. Plus, I hate to say it again, but--but I\rquote d seen you two kissing. Not to mention the image of the two of you in bed at the pub was rather fresh in my mind. That day I was this close--\'94
 she held up her thumb and forefinger barely a half-inch apart \'93--to declaring I would never have anything to do with another man for the rest of my life. I didn\rquote t realize you also knew about Mariah.\'94
\par 
\par She hugged her knees to her chest, the sheet covering most of her, and Harry felt deeply ashamed. She had thought he was as bad as Malfoy. Men. Sticking together to protect each other\rquote s right to unlimited shagging.
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m so sorry, Ginny. I--I thought you really cared for him and I didn\rquote t want to hurt you. And I didn\rquote t think you\rquote d believe me anyway. I reckoned you\rquote d think I was trying to get you to leave Malfoy again.\'94
\par 
\par She nodded. \'93Well, you were probably right about that. Except that I really would have believed just about anything you told me he was capable of, all the while lying to you and claiming that I didn\rquote t believe a word you said, to maintain the fa}
{\f602\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'e7ade.\'94 She sighed. \'93I\rquote m sorry, Harry. It seemed--more prudent. If I\rquote 
d been honest with you, we--we might have been tempted to do something, and we probably would have been discovered by him....I thought it fairer to}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  you to let you get on wi}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
th your life. My current problem is--since he\rquote s cheating on me now, I can\rquote t very well expect him to get frustrated with me for not sleeping with him. Why\rquote s he going to bother breaking up with me if he\rquote 
s shagging other girls, and still thinks I might give in any day now? And I can\rquote t get all huffy about him shagging the other girls and break up with him, because he\rquote s under that Obedience Charm. We don\rquote 
t want him Apparating to You-Know-Who\rquote s side the next time he\rquote s summoned and doing whatever he\rquote s told, do we?\'94
\par 
\par She sighed and tightened her arms around her legs. \'93So I\rquote ve go a boyfriend I don\rquote t want, who\rquote s getting far too good at very nearly seducing me--\'94 Her voice shook and so did her hand, as it pushed a lock of hair behind her ear; 
\'93--and if I show him the door it\rquote s liable to get us all killed. And if my frustration gets the better of me and I give in, I\rquote ll never be rid of him....besides feeling terribly, terribly guilty.\'94
\par 
\par She would feel guilty because of me, Harry thought. She was s
acrificing any happiness she might have in her youth to protect others-- mostly to protect him. This was the last thing he had expected to hear. Everything he had heard and seen that had passed between her and Draco Malfoy during the previous year had bee
n a lie; well, almost everything, he thought, remembering overhearing their argument on Malfoy\rquote s birthday. That had been an unguarded moment, in private. And even then--Ginny wasn\rquote 
t being completely honest with Draco about not wanting to sleep with him. She did desire him, against her will, but she felt dirty and guilty about that and claimed to him that she wasn\rquote t \'93ready\'94
 so that he might eventually decide to leave her.
\par 
\par \'93Why,\'94 his voice shook, \'93Would you feel guilty about sleeping with your boyfriend?\'94 He thought he knew, but he wanted to hear it from her again. He could never tire of hearing it....
\par 
\par \'93Well, there are two reasons. First, there\rquote s you, of course. Second--\'94 She paused and bit her lip. \'93He loves me.\'94
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par She sighed. \'93The amulet, remember? It\rquote s very clear that in his own Draco Malfoy sort of way, he does actually love me. And I don\rquote t feel the same. I may have once, not as strongly as him, but I certainly don\rquote 
t any more. He loves me and I don\rquote t love him back. It\rquote s you I love. If that\rquote s not a good reason to feel guilty, I don\rquote t know what is. And even though I love you, we can\rquote t be together....we can\rquote 
t even sit closer together than this...Not while I\rquote m the one he sees in that damn amulet. Not while Voldemort can use him to kill and destroy.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Ginny,\'94 he said throatily, feeling like she was a million miles away instead of a mere ten feet. \'93How do you expect me to go on after you tell me you love me, but we can\rquote t be together? Why didn\rquote 
t you tell me when I told you I love you?\'94
\par 
\par She looked at him sadly. \'93I couldn\rquote t, Harry. I just couldn\rquote 
t. If I left Draco for you he would kill you. I know it. Every time I considered running to you and confessing my feelings, all I could picture in my mind was--was the way Hermione and Colin and
 Penelope looked when I was in first year and my selfishness was getting people hurt. I don\rquote t ever want people to be hurt again because of my selfishness, my greediness. That\rquote 
s what led to it. I was greedy; I needed to talk to Tom, to talk to someone. And even after Mrs. Norris, I kept on, didn\rquote 
t I? And I killed the roosters, and even Nearly Headless Nick was affected....And it was all because of me. When I finally worked out what was making me do it....I don\rquote t know how many hours I sat in the hospital wing
 crying over the three of them....I never want to feel that way again, Harry. And maybe that\rquote s a kind of selfishness, too. But that\rquote s a kind of selfishness I can live with. And a kind that other people can live with too.\'94
\par 
\par \'93But--but--you\rquote re telling me now,\'94 he whispered.
\par 
\par She gazed at him longingly and he caught his breath. She was so beautiful, sitting there with her hair tumbling about her shoulders, with such an expression of love and desire it was all he could do not to run to the bed and take her in hi
s arms. He thought of Katie and suddenly wished he had not been so weak and selfish, wishing that they had never done anything past snogging....
\par 
\par \'93I know, Harry, I know. But--but after you told me about what happened--about changing time--I couldn\rquote t bear to lie to you any more. I want to think of every lie I ever told you and put it right.\'94 She swallowed and closed her eyes. \'93
Let me think--well, there was when you found me trying to get to the Trophy Room because I found that note from Draco. I lied about thinking it was for me. You really must have thought I was quite the naive ninny! I found it in Mariah\rquote 
s Potions text, and I knew they were meeting. It wasn\rquote t that I was jealous, although I was a little peeved that he might be sneaking around behind my back
. Point of pride, you know. I was really hoping to see whether they actually cared for each other; I hoped that if she could make him forget me, he\rquote d break up with me and I\rquote 
d be free. I never did get a chance to see them, though, thanks to Filch. And you.\'94
\par 
\par He grimaced. \'93Sorry.\'94
\par 
\par She shook her head and smiled at him. \'93I\rquote m not. I could almost forget about everything else while you were holding me, and we were standing behind that statue, waiting for Filch to leave....I never wanted that moment to end....\'94 Bu
t suddenly a yawn overcame her, and she stretched languorously; Harry practically choked, watching her thin nightdress move as she did this. \'93Oh my--we\rquote ve been talking so long the sun is coming up. I\rquote 
m going to look a fright, dark circles under my eyes...\'94
\par 
\par \'93Lie down,\'94 he said softly. \'93I\rquote ll sing you a lullaby. Something my mother used to sing to me.\'94
\par 
\par She laughed. \'93You\rquote ll what?\'94 He nodded and she snuggled down in the bed, her head on the pillow, gazing at him expectantly. He swallowed and watched as her eye
s drifted closed; she looked so angelic and peaceful. Then, with her eyes closed, she whispered, \'93I do love you, Harry. Every time you told me that, I wanted to tell you the same thing, and now I have....\'94 her voice trailed off sleepily.
\par 
\par The room was very still. Harry couldn\rquote t speak. But he could sing. He watched her face as she drifted into sleep, listening to his voice, to the Welsh words of a mother to her child:
\par 
\par Huna blentyn yn fy mynwes
\par Clyd a chynnes ydyw hon
\par Breichiau mam sy'n dyn am danat,
\par Cariad mam sy dan fy mron
\par Ni cha dim amharu'th gyntun
\par Ni wna undyn }{\f602\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'e2 thi gam
\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Huna'n dawel, anwyl blentyn
\par Huna'n fwyn ar fron dy fam....
\par 
\par He continued to watch her; her breaths were regular and d
eep, and he thought he could even see her eyes moving behind her eyelids. He rose and walked to the bed, not caring about Malfoy and his amulet. He saw that Ginny was clutching the basilisk as she slept, a small smile curling around the edge of her mouth.
 He leaned down and kissed her brow.
\par 
\par \'93I love you too, Ginny,\'94 he whispered to her. \'93Sleep well.\'94
\par 
\par He crept into the corridor carefully, hoping no one would see him leaving her room, but everyone in the house still seemed to be asleep. He crawled back into the bed in \'93Jamie\rquote s room,\'94
 falling asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow. For once he felt utterly at peace.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par \'93The wolf shall pounce.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Huh?\'94 Harry muttered to Sandy, eyes closed.
\par 
\par \'93The wolf shall pounce.\'94
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s nice....\'94 he droned sleep
ily. A moment later, he was vaguely aware of the door to his room opening and heavy footsteps crossing to the bed. He jumped when a voice suddenly split the silence of the room, the sound ricocheting around his poor, empty-feeling cranium.
\par 
\par \'93C\rquote mon!\'94 Ron said, jogging in place at the foot of the bed, dressed for running. \'93I already rang a gong in Ginny\rquote s ear and got told off. She isn\rquote t running this morning; it\rquote s just you and me.\'94
 Harry groaned, only able to open one eye so far, trying to sit up.
\par 
\par \'93Correction: it\rquote s just you. I\rquote m having a lie-in.\'94 He squinted at his watch. It was seven o\rquote clock.
\par 
\par \'93It\rquote s seven o\rquote bleeding clock,\'94 Harry complained. \'93Are you out of your flipping mind? I was up until five.\'94 He closed his eyes and dropped back onto the pillow, but a mo
ment later he grunted with surprise and his eyes flew open again in shock.
\par 
\par Ron had grabbed one of his ankles and pulled him up in the air so that he was hanging upside down, staring at Ron\rquote s shins. Harry swore violently. \'93Oi, listen to the mouth on you! I want an explanation, and I want it now, Potter!\'94
\par 
\par \'93An explanation for what, you bloody sod?\'94 Harry choked, trying to reach out for Ron\rquote s legs so he could do something to him. He didn\rquote t know what he wanted to do specifically, he just knew he wanted to hurt him a great deal. He didn
\rquote t ever remember Ron physically attacking him before. Ron held him farther away from his body when Harry\rquote s arms started flailing at him; Harry couldn\rquote t reach him. Ron was showing no signs of stress or strain, holding his best frie
nd upside-down in the air wearing nothing but his boxers (something which was making Harry feel very vulnerable). Harry might have been a feather to him. Damn werewolf strength, Harry thought grumpily.
\par 
\par In the doorway of his room, Harry now saw upside-down versions of Fred and George; they were in dressing gowns, covered in more freckles than ever, and sporting large, amused grins.
\par 
\par \'93Yes, Ron,\'94 one of them said. \'93An explanation for what?\'94 Harry couldn\rquote t tell whether it was Fred or George, especially as he was upside-down, but they were both looking highly amused.
\par 
\par \'93Harry here said that he didn\rquote t want to go running this morning because he was up until five in the morning.\'94
\par 
\par The twin who hadn\rquote t yet spoken shrugged and said, \'93So what? I don\rquote t even feel like running when I\rquote ve had eight hours--not that Angelina ever lets me--\'94
 That was George then, Harry thought. Fred gave him a backhanded swat on the arm, but both of them were still grinning.
\par 
\par \'93Yeah, well, Ginny\rquote s not coming either, and she said it was because she\rquote d been up until five in the morning!\'94 he exploded now, directing this at Harry\rquote s head as much as this was possible. Harry could think of only two words:

\par 
\par Bloody hell.
\par 
\par Suddenly, Ginny\rquote s upside-down image appeared next to her brothers\rquote  in the
 doorway; she had pulled on a garish plaid dressing gown over her nightdress. "Ron!" she cried. "Whatever are you doing? Put Harry down now!" Harry felt Ron's grip on his ankle loosening, and Ginny must have had the same thought; she cried, "No!" before R
on could open his hand and let Harry fall on his head. "On the bed!" she admonished him.
\par 
\par Harry had a hard time seeing Ron\rquote s face from his current position, but he could tell that Ron wasn\rquote t happy. Neither were the twins. As he fell back onto the bed, he sa
w that the identical freckled faces were frowning deeply at him--and the twins were almost never not smiling or laughing. That did not bode well.
\par 
\par Ginny put her hands on her hips and glared up at Ron. \'93Remus told you that you are not to use your strength that way. Remember Roger Davies in the infirmary? I thought you were doing so much better now....\'94
\par 
\par Ron shook his finger in her face. \'93Oh, no you don\rquote t! You\rquote re not going to turn this around and make it all about me. I want to know what the pair of you were up to until five in the morning!\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, no you don\rquote t want to know,\'94 Ginny shot back; Harry looked back and forth between them. He was unlikely to get a word in edgewise and decided he wouldn\rquote t even try. \'93You don\rquote t want to know because the truth is boring a
nd mundane and wouldn\rquote t give you an excuse for throwing a fit. The truth is we were just talking. That\rquote s all! Talking!\'94
 Harry watched Ron's face; he was strongly reminded of Ron's reaction to finding out he and Ginny had spent the night in the Quidditch changing rooms, and he wondered how soon did you shag my sister? would come out of his mouth.
\par 
\par Harry smiled feebly at the twins, who stood to his left with identically-crossed arms and identical scowls directed unnervingly at him. George--at least, he thought it was George--raised one eyebrow at him. Harry wasn\rquote 
t sure what that was supposed to mean.
\par 
\par \'93Talking?\'94 Ron said incredulously. \'93Talking all night until five in the morning?\'94
\par 
\par \'93No, not talking all night. Somewhere around three o\rquote clock Harry went to the loo, and he--he opened the wrong door on the way back.\'94 He glanced at her warily; she begged him with her eyes not to contradict this little lie.
\par 
\par \'93Er, yeah,\'94 he said. \'93And then I saw the window seat and sat down, looking down the High Street, and Ginny surprised me by asking me what the hell I was doing in her room. I didn\rquote t even see her until she spoke,\'94 he added truthfully. 
\'93We ended up talking until five.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Talking? For two hours?\'94 Ron said, still unwilling to believe.
\par 
\par \'93Yes,\'94 Ginny said firmly. \'93Talking. But by five we were both knackered. Harry came back to his room and we both went back to sleep. End of story.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well--\'94 Ron blustered, Ginny having knocked the wind out of his sails; \'93Well--\'94 he tried again, \'93Why are you just standing there while Harry here is in his underwear, eh?\'94
\par 
\par She threw up her hands. \'93Because I\rquote m not a child, that\rquote s why. And I have six brothers. And we\rquote ve both been down in the pool at Ascog at the same time--\'94
\par 
\par \'93It\rquote s not the same! Don\rquote t come parading in here in your underwear and tell me it\rquote s the same thing as a bikini!\'94
\par 
\par She looked at him blankly. \'93Ron, I do believe you\rquote ve become completely unhinged. It\rquote s a pity wizards aren\rquote t in the habit of consulting mental health professionals unless they\rquote ve suffered brain damage. I\rquote d s
ay you need years of therapy.\'94
\par 
\par \'93You\rquote ve trying to make this about me again!\'94
\par 
\par She stood toe to toe with him. \'93It is about you. It\rquote s about how you were accusing me yesterday of shagging my boyfriend--which I would be perfectly within my rights to do, if I wanted--and now you\rquote 
re accusing me of shagging Harry, who is your best friend. We were talking, Ron. We\rquote re friends too, Harry and I. And anyway, I thought you didn\rquote t like Draco. If you thought I was with someone else--especially Harry--I thought you\rquote 
d be the first one to throw a parade. Not that we were doing anything....I\rquote m just saying....\'94
\par 
\par Ron backed down a bit, grimacing. \'93It\rquote s not that--that--\'94 He couldn\rquote t finish. \'93Oh, bollocks,,\'94 he said lamely, sitting at the foot of the bed. Ginny smirked at him, tri
umphant. Harry glanced at the twins, who seemed to have come over to Ginny\rquote s side. George (He thought) winked at him.
\par 
\par \'93You know we\rquote d rather you were with Ginny than Malfoy being with her, right Harry?\'94 George said to him.
\par 
\par \'93I think it\rquote s just that--well, the idea of anybody shagging our sister--\'94 Fred said, bobbing his head in Ginny\rquote s direction.
\par 
\par Ginny whirled on them. \'93So, are you going to do the same thing to Maggie? Are you going to walk up to Professor Snape and challenge him to a wizard\rquote s duel for shagging your sister?\'94
\par 
\par All four boys gaped at her and said in unison, \'93Snape?\'94
\par 
\par Ginny crossed her arms and looked at them all very smugly. \'93Turns out they met and had a brief, steamy affair six years ago,\'94 she said, clearly taking great pleasure in telling them this. \'93
She told me all about it when she came to stay at the Burrow. We sat up late. Talking,\'94 she said pointed to Ron in particular. \'93Well--not really everything. I\rquote m assuming the \lquote steamy\rquote 
 part from one or two hints she dropped. She had just finished school and was going to begin university, to read Classics. As a treat, her parents bought her sailing lessons--she\rquote 
d always wanted to learn--but she was a bit of a disaster. Almost immediately, the boom knocked her overboard. Well, this other yacht happened to be passing by--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--}{\f1\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 T}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 he Patricia,\'94 Harry said softly, remembering sailing on the Firth of Clyde in his other life. Ginny raised one eyebrow and went on; Harry hoped the boys hadn\rquote 
t noticed.
\par 
\par \'93--And they fished her out of the water. Snape and his uncle taught her to sail instead, and, well--\'94 Ginny blushed prettily. \'93Let\rquote s just say that wasn\rquote t all he taught her--\'94
\par 
\par Ron and the twins had dropped their jaws in disbelief.
\par 
\par \'93But--but--but--\'94 Fred sputtered. \'93It was Snape!\'94
\par 
\par Harry bristled. \'93He was good enough for my mum. You should be happy for your sister if there\rquote s some chance they might get back together!\'94
\par 
\par Now it was Ron\rquote s turn to say, \'93But--but--it was Snape!\'94
\par 
\par \'93I know! And yes, he\rquote s been rough on all of us in school, but it\rquote s for a reason. None of us wanted to be on his bad side, did we? He made us work damn hard, and I, for one, am glad he did.\'94 He turned to Fred. \'93Are you telling me you
\rquote ve never used anything you learned from him when you\rquote re creating your stuff? What about Canary Creams, or Ton-Tongue Toffee?\'94
\par 
\par Fred looked sheepish now. \'93He actually gave me two O.W.L.s, for beginning and intermediate Potions. Flitwick and McGonagall were the only other professors who did that. In fact, they were the only three who gave me any O.W.L.s.\'94
 Well, Harry thought, that made sense; Potions, Charms and Transfiguration would be the areas of magic involved in making a sweet that temporarily transfigured you into a canary, or that put an engorgement charm on your tongue.
\par 
\par \'93She said he was quite romantic with her,\'94 Ginny said, harking back to Maggie\rquote s and Snape\rquote s relationship. \'93
He told her he was a teacher at a boarding school up north, and that he would leave his post if he could, but that his headmaster was counting on him to come back, especially as a new student was coming who was something of a celebrity--\'94
\par 
\par Harry sat up straighter. \'93Wait--how long ago did you say this was?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Six years.\'94
\par 
\par Harry swallowed. \'93That was me. I was the reason he had to leave her--because Dumbledore wanted him to look after me.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Look after you!\'94 George howled, almost doubled up with laughter. \'93Snape?\'94
\par 
\par Ron was sober. \'93Don\rquote t laugh. He saved Harry\rquote s life during our first year. Remember Harry\rquote s first Quidditch match, when his broom
 was trying to throw him? That was because Quirrell was jinxing him. Snape was countering the jinx--only we didn\rquote t know that--\'94
\par 
\par Harry nodded. \'93Right. Hermione and Ron thought he was the one jinxing me because they could see him staring at me and moving his lips, doing the counter-jinx. So Hermione--er--\'94
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94 Fred wanted to know.
\par 
\par \'93She set fire to his robes,\'94
 Ron said placidly. Fred and George tried to suppress it for only a moment before they burst out into peals of laughter. Harry, Ron and Ginny were having a difficult time containing their laughter now too; it was too infectious.
\par 
\par While the others continued laughing, Harry sobered, thinking That\rquote s why he looked like he hated me from the first day I was a Hogwarts. It had nothing to do with my mother or father. I had taken him away from Maggie.
\par 
\par He felt ill and put his arms across his stomach. In the midst of Ron and Fred and George chatting noisily about Snape and how Harry, Ron and Hermione thought he was after the Stone, Ginny sat on the bed and looked at him.
\par 
\par \'93Are you all right, Harry?\'94
\par 
\par He smiled at her, remembering her telling him that she loved him. At last... But they couldn\rquote t be together. Not yet. Not for a long time, perhaps. Plus, there was the small matter of Katie still. He sighed.
\par 
\par \'93I know what would make me feel better. I think I want to go for a run after all.\'94
\par 
\par She nodded. \'93I think I will, too. I\rquote ll go get ready.\'94
\par 
\par Harry watched Ron and the twins while he searched in his bag for some running clothes. He smiled and shook his head over some of the things they were saying as he donned some shorts and tied his running shoes. When he was pulling on 
a green former T-shirt (The sleeves had been cut off), he heard Fred say, \'93Oh, no. What if--what if he becomes our brother-in-law?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Eeeeew,\'94 was Ron\rquote s immediate reaction. Harry laughed.
\par 
\par \'93They\rquote re just now getting reacquainted after six years! And anyway, you never know--he might decide he wants to leave Hogwarts to be with her....\'94
\par 
\par Ron brightened now. \'93Good point! Maybe we can convince them to marry sometime in the next month. Before our seventh year starts, preferably--\'94
\par 
\par George cried, \'93Hell, no! We\rquote re out of school. We don\rquote t care if he\rquote s still teaching there. But relatives--argh! You have to see them at every birthday, every holiday--\'94
\par 
\par Ron and his twin both wrestled him onto the bed. \'93Oh, it\rquote s such a burden seeing your relatives, is it?\'94 Ron asked him,
 but now he was laughing, and Fred and George joined him. Harry grinned at the tangled mass of Weasleys on the bed. For a minute, it reminded him of the good-natured wrestling with his own brothers....
\par 
\par Brothers. Severus Snape\rquote s sons. He remembered vividly now how happy his stepfather had been at Simon and Stuart\rquote 
s first birthday party. Harry was five and Jamie was three, and his dad had been constantly ordering everyone to smile, snapping their pictures with his camera, until h
is mother, laughing and beautiful, had finally grabbed the camera from him and took his picture with the twins, one little boy on each hip, and his stepfather smiling broadly, his eyes crinkled up merrily as he held his boys, deep smile-lines etched in hi
s cheeks....And then he insisted that Harry was his boy too, and pulled the bashful Harry into the picture....
\par 
\par Harry laughed at the Weasley boys. \'93You might find that you actually prefer a happy Snape over an angry-with-the-world Snape. I know I prefer being around him when he\rquote s happy.\'94
\par 
\par Ron and his brothers looked at each other, perplexed. \'93When have you ever seen Snape happy?\'94 one of the twins demanded. Suddenly, Harry looked up and saw Ginny standing in the doorway in her running clothes. She had a very 
distressed look on her face. She knew...
\par 
\par Harry slapped Ron on the back. \'93Ready to go running?\'94 He hoped no one would notice he hadn\rquote t answered the question.
\par 
\par Ron looked up at him, frowning. \'93When did you get dressed? And I thought--\'94 He saw Ginny standing in the doorway, also dressed for running. He shrugged and stood. \'93Well, I guess we\rquote re going running.\'94
\par 
\par He seemed calm once more, following Harry and Ginny down the stairs and outdoors. Rather than shocking the residents of Hogsmeade, they ran to the castle and back twice. After taking turns in the shower, they sat down with the other residents of Hog
\rquote s End to eat breakfast in the kitchen. Percy and Lee weren\rquote t coming to the Quidditch match; they had pressing business to take care of, a new client in Belgiu
m who would be carrying the full Weasley Wizard Wheezes product line in all of their shops. There was evidently some question of whether they would accept payment in Belgian francs, as everyone\rquote s Gringott\rquote 
s assets were still frozen and inaccessible. But when Percy met Harry\rquote s eye, he turned bright red and looked away. He did the same thing with Lee, with whom he was going to be working instead of going to the match. Harry thought this very odd.

\par 
\par Harry watched Ginny while he ate; it was such a lovely feeling, being in this familiar place, where she\rquote 
d never been in his other life, and just being able to watch her eat, and talk to her brothers, and know that she loved him. We have years, he thought. We have years ahead of us. If it\rquote s all a matter of waiting, I 
can wait. I can be patient. For her, the wait will be worth it.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par As they approached the familiar Hogwarts Quidditch pitch, they encountered a roped-off area before they reached the stands, and saw that a number of authoritative-looking people Ha
rry immediately pegged as Aurors were scrutinizing everyone entering. There was a bit of a queue to approach. Ron frowned.
\par 
\par \'93Security,\'94 he explained to Harry, not looking particularly happy about this.
\par 
\par Harry leaned out of the queue to see what the Aurors 
were doing. Most people received a nod and were passed through; occasionally a witch or wizard was asked for his or her wand, and the wand was tested to find out the most recent spell it had cast. Harry straightened up again, telling Ron, the twins, Angel
ina and Ginny, \'93This could take a while.\'94
\par 
\par Sandy hissed to Harry, \'93You shall be wanted.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Wanted?\'94 he hissed back at her. \'93Wanted by whom?\'94
\par 
\par She didn\rquote t answer.
\par 
\par After a while Harry kicked a piece of turf, muttering, "Why are they even bothering to hold Quidditch matches if they're so worried about security?"
\par 
\par "Blimey, Harry," Ron said. "Do you know how people would panic if the League Cup was canceled? I mean, the attack on Diagon Alley was bad, but they never even canceled the L
eague Cup during You-Know-Who's first reign of terror. Everyone would think it was the end of the world if they did that."
\par 
\par "You mean they wouldn't have a good way to pacify everyone," Ginny countered. "This way, they can simultaneously occupy people with mindless sport--"
\par 
\par "Bread and circuses," muttered Harry.
\par 
\par "--And make it look like the Ministry's really doing something, just because they're checking over everyone who's entering the stadium. I'm sure they're really going to get to the bottom of the Diagon Alley attack by doing that."
\par 
\par "Ginny!" Ron said urgently, watching an Auror who was looking at Ginny very intently. "Don't say things like that here, all right?" he said out of the corner of his mouth.
\par 
\par Harry didn't like the look of the Auror either. "I
 agree with Ron, Ginny. You can't be too careful what you say in public. Rant back at Hog's End, all right?" His eyes pleaded with her, and she backed down from her brother, her eyes locked with Harry's. He looked away from her reluctantly.
\par 
\par They finally reached the front of the queue, and after a moment\rquote 
s visual examination, everyone in their party was passed through but Harry. He stood waiting, while the Auror--a middle-aged man of either Indian or Pakistani descent--looked at him suspiciously, even going so far as to touch Harry\rquote 
s scar with a frown. Harry flinched and backed up when he did this, wondering what was going on.
\par 
\par \'93What is it, Aziz?\'94 the other Auror asked him. She was about thirty, very large and Nordic-looking, like a Valkyrie.
\par 
\par \'93Come with me,\'94
 Aziz said to Harry, his hand clamped on his arm, dragging him toward a tent that had been erected near the Quidditch changing rooms. Harry looked back and forth between the Aurors when the large woman clamped her hand on his other arm.
\par 
\par \'93What? What did I do? What\rquote s going on?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Did you think you\rquote d get away with it, Death Eater?\'94 Aziz asked him, his face very close to Harry\rquote s. Harry panicked for a moment, thinking that they somehow had detected that he\rquote d been initiated in his other life.
\par 
\par \'93G-get away with what?\'94 he sputtered. He saw that the others were shocked to see the Aurors dragging him away; Ron and Ginny started to move toward him, but some other Aurors stopped them.
\par 
\par \'93Harry!\'94 he heard them yelling at him.
\par 
\par \'93Get away with what? You\rquote re not very clever, are you? Did you think you could walk in here, masquerading as Harry Potter, of all people, and no one would notice? Not a very inconspicuous disguise, after all.\'94 The hands on his arms tightened.

\par 
\par \'93But I am Harry Potter, you idiots!\'94 Harry suddenly pulled his arms free. \'93That\rquote s why you\rquote re detaining me? You don\rquote t believe I\rquote m me?\'94
\par 
\par \'93What\rquote s going on here, what\rquote s going on?\'94 a familiar voice said, pushing through the crowd. Harry looked up and saw Ludo Bagman, head of Magical Games and Sports for the Ministry. \'93Ah, Harry! Good to see you!\'94
\par 
\par The Aurors looked at him uncertainly. \'93Hello, Mr. Bagman. You know Harry Potter personally?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Of course I do, of course I do! I know everyone worth knowing, right Harry?\'94 he said with a jovial wink. Harry never thought it would be possible to be glad to see Ludo Bagman, but he was.
\par 
\par \'93Well,\'94 the Valkyrie said, \'93can you help us positively identify him?\'94
\par 
\par Harry had a sudden thought. He motioned for Bagman to come closer and whispered to him what he knew about his past goblin troubles and how he was trying to help Harry during the tournament. Bagman straightened up, reddening.
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s Harry Potter, all right,\'94 he told the Aurors, who backed away now, as though they had never been dragging Harry over the grass to the tent.
\par 
\par \'93How do you know?\'94 Aziz said, still looking suspicious.
\par 
\par \'93Let\rquote s just say he told me something which I daresay only Harry knows--and something which only Harry will continue to know, eh?\'94 he said with a raised eyebrow.
\par 
\par Harry raised his eyebrow back; he hadn\rquote t been trying to blackmail Bagman, not really; but he needed to make sure he chose a piece of information that was not common knowledge.
\par 
\par The Aurors finally let him pass, and Bagman, waved him off, saying, \'93I\rquote ll come talk to you before the match! Must fly now, very busy...\'94 And he was lost in the crowd once more.
\par 
\par Harry was relieved to join his friends again; Ron and Ginny both looked at him with concern as they climbed up to their seats. Harry somehow felt a pall had been cast on the day.
 After they bought some bottles of butterbeer from a vendor, he pulled out his Omnioculars to scan the stadium, both making an effort to forget about his humiliation at the hands of the Aurors and trying to see who had come that he might know. (He hoped n
o
 one he knew had noticed him being detained). He frowned as he looked through the lenses; regularly spaced throughout the spectator seating were witches and wizards standing with crossed arms, their wands at the ready. They appeared to be very alert, scan
ning the crowd with their eyes, occasionally nodding at each other, and generally looking ready to act at a moment's notice.
\par 
\par Aurors.
\par 
\par There were Aurors all over the place. Harry swallowed, remembering being a fugitive. Somehow, the Aurors didn't have the e
ffect of calming him and making him feel everything was under control. He remembered his momentary panic when the Aurors had been dragging him toward the tent, and trying to get Ginny to stop talking about Diagon Alley when that Auror was looking at her. 
W
hat was the wizarding world coming to that they had to have so many Aurors at a Quidditch match? he thought. He tried to ignore them, but it was difficult. Every time he spotted another, his pulse quickened. Unfortunately, Aurors were never again likely t
o give him a feeling of safety and reassurance.
\par 
\par There were still about twenty minutes to go before the match was supposed to start. They had good seats, right in the middle on the Chudley Cannons side, although a part of Harry looked longingly toward the Holyhead Harpies side. He\rquote 
d already surprised Ron once by calling the Harpies his favorite team (Which it was, in his other life); he wasn\rquote t going to make that mistake again.
\par 
\par \'93So the Cannons had a good year?\'94 he asked Ron, not having been following the League very closely. He tried to ignore an Auror standing about twenty feet away.
\par 
\par Ron rolled his eyes. \'93Do you even know how the League works after all this time, Harry? All you care about is the Inter-House Quidditch Cup at school. The League--now that\rquote s real Quidditch.\'94
\par 
\par Harry bristled; he knew very well how the Quidditch League worked, but that was from his other life, and he was very, very tired of saying, \'93I can\rquote t tell you,\'94 when people asked him how he knew something he wasn\rquote 
t supposed to know that he\rquote d learned in that other world. Fine, he thought. From now on I\rquote ll just play dumb.
\par 
\par \'93All right then,\'94 he said in a challenging voice. \'93Explain it to me.\'94
\par 
\par \'93You\rquote re sure you want to know? All right. Each season, 
the thirteen teams in the league play four matches each for a total of twenty-six matches. The rankings from the previous season--before the quarter-finals, that is--determine the pairings. There are three divisions, but the top-ranked team isn't put into
 any of them. Division A always has the teams that were ranked second, fifth, eighth and eleventh. Division B gets third, sixth, ninth and twelfth. The rest are Division C. With me so far?\'94
\par 
\par Harry nodded, itching to pick up his omnioculars again; Ron could be almost as pedantic as Hermione at times, especially on the subject of Quidditch. Plus, he already knew all this.
\par 
\par \'93Each team,\'94 Ron went on, \'93Plays the other three teams in the same division, for a total of six matches within each division. The top-ranked team--the one that doesn\rquote 
t have a division--plays the other top teams from the previous season, down to number five. That's how the top five teams get their fourth match. The bottom eight teams then pair off for one more match each. After that the new rankings are done.\'94

\par 
\par Harry glanced around the stadium, barely listening to Ron now. \'93Right, right, each team plays four matches and then they redo the rankings according to how many wins each team has...\'94
\par 
\par \'93Right! You\rquote ve got it.\'94 Well, I\rquote m not a complete idiot, Harry thought. \'93For instance,\'94 Ron went on, \'93
This year, the two teams that were both undefeated--the Harpies and Puddlemere United--were ranked third and seventh last year. Puddlemere had a very bad year; they're doing a lot better now. So, since the H
arpies had a higher rank than Puddlemere last year, this year they're ranked first and Puddlemere second, even though they both have four wins. Are you lost yet?\'94
\par 
\par Harry rolled his eyes. \'93Do you want me to be?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Nah,\'94 Ron said, not noticing Harry\rquote s impatience. \'93So; the teams with three wins each were ranked the same way, according to where they fell on last year\rquote 
s rankings. Same for the teams with two wins, and one. You get the idea. So, with the new ranks done, from one to thirteen, they take the top eigh
t teams and pair them off for four League quarter-final matches. The Cannons actually came in fifth in the new rankings, and then they actually won their quarter-final match against the Appleby Arrows. I couldn\rquote t believe it.\'94
\par 
\par \'93But the Holyhead Harpies are undefeated,\'94 Harry said, suppressing a smile, feeling mischievous. Ron looked a bit grumpy.
\par 
\par \'93Yeah, yeah, they're undefeated.\'94
\par 
\par Harry relented, feeling a bit bad for Ron. He was wearing the bright orange Cannons hat Harry had given him, disappearing against his bright hair. He\rquote d been waiting for years for the Cannons to do this well. It wasn\rquote 
t that they didn't have an illustrious history; they\rquote d been League champions twenty-one times. Unfortunately, the last time was in 1892.
\par 
\par \'93Well, if the Cannons have come this far, they must be playing really well. They can\rquote t have had many losses.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Just the one,\'94 Ron said reluctantly.
\par 
\par \'93Oh; which team?\'94
\par 
\par Ron hesitated before answering. \'93The Harpies.\'94 He sighed. \'93They were both in Division B.
 The Harpies are the division champions; they trounced all of the other teams in Division B. And then they slaughtered the Wigtown Wanderers in the quarter-finals, and that was even with Wilmer Parkin in the pink of health. He just joined the team this ye
ar. I think he\rquote d rather play for someone else, but it\rquote s a family tradition for players in his family to be on the Wanderers. He\rquote 
s their only decent player right now, a Chaser, and he was out for the first two matches of the season, two separate injuries. Tr
ouble is, he also plays for England, and he was hurt in European Cup games against Transylvania and Luxembourg right before each of those division matches. Hard luck. He was finally available for their game against the Tutshill Tornadoes, but by then, Pud
dlemere was undefeated so they won Division C.
\par 
\par \'93The Wanderers wouldn\rquote t have squeaked into the quarter-finals at number eight if they hadn\rquote t beaten the Falmouth Falcons in their fourth match. The Falcons haven\rquote t won a match all season; completely pathetic. 
I mean, the Wanderers were ranked thirteenth last year-- before Parkin joined--and the Falcons were twelfth, and the Falcons still lost.\'94
 Ron sighed again and picked up his program, flipping the pages idly, as though trying to forget how good the Harpies were. Then he saw something in the program which made him brighten considerably. He held the page up for Harry to see.
\par 
\par \'93Speaking of the European Cup, there\rquote s still that to follow, even after the League Cup is over! Last one was during the Christmas holiday
s when we were in fourth year. I didn't really follow it, since we were so caught up in you being a Tournament Champion and the Yule Ball and everything. Plus, I think a lot of people were still reeling from the World Cup. Since Krum couldn\rquote 
t play for Bulgaria, as he was doing the Tournament, Bulgaria didn\rquote 
t qualify, and there were so many starting players for Ireland who were injured during the celebration of their World Cup win, they had to play a lot of reserves for their qualifying match, which came right after, and--well, they didn\rquote 
t qualify. With Ireland and Bulgaria out of it, I think a lot of people lost interest that year.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Who finally won?\'94 Harry asked, genuinely interested now.
\par 
\par Ron looked thoughtful. \'93Italy beat Norway, I think. They played in 
Greece. It didn't attract that many people, not after the World Cup. This year, Wales, Ireland and England are all still in it. Scotland didn't make it. But wait until you hear this: the final will be in Wales, between Christmas and New Year! We won
\rquote t be in school! Maybe we can get tickets.\'94
\par 
\par Harry's eyes grew large at the thought. \'93That would be brilliant! Where in Wales is it?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Some old castle. There\rquote s actually enough space within the outer walls for the pitch, and the seats are up on the parapets. I don\rquote t care of I don\rquote t get anything for Christmas if I get to see the European Cup final.\'94
\par 
\par Fred clapped Ron on the shoulder. \'93Well, you know we're going to be there, little brother. We\rquote ve just signed a concession contract to have Weasley\rquote s Wizard Wheezes sold at the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final. Lee did it. He\rquote 
s amazing, Ron. He could sell anything. Just has the gift of gab, you know?\'94
\par 
\par Then Fred caught Harry\rquote s eye and looked a bit awkward. \'93Er, sorry Harry.\'94
\par 
\par Harry frowned. \'93Sorry about what?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, you know. Mentioning Lee.\'94
\par 
\par Harry was still baffled. \'93Why can't you talk about Lee?\'94
\par 
\par George gave him that look again, that made Harry think he knew more than he was saying. \'93Because of Katie, Harry,\'94 he said calmly. Harry looked him in the eye, afraid to blink.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, right. No. I mean, I'm fine about Lee. And he seems to be fine about me. No problem. Did either of us give you the impression otherwise back at the house? I\rquote m just sorry he couldn't be he
re today. I know how he likes a good Quidditch match, even if he isn\rquote t doing the commentary.\'94
\par 
\par Fred and Ron looked at each other as though they didn\rquote t believe this for a minute. Harry really didn\rquote t want to have a conversation about this, and was relieved to hear a voice saying, \'93Oi! Harry!\'94
\par 
\par It was Bagman again, making his way through the seats. \'93Harry! There you are!\'94 Harry saw the twins immediately adopt hostile glares, even though he\rquote d gotten Harry out of his spot of trouble earlier. He never had paid th
em back their money from the World Cup.
\par 
\par \'93Hello, Mr. Bagman,\'94 Harry said evenly.
\par 
\par \'93God, Harry! Call me Ludo!\'94 He slapped Harry on the back, ignoring the twins (Or so Harry thought). But suddenly, he was addressing them quite amiably, as though there was no
 bad blood between them at all and they had just been having a few pints down at the pub.
\par 
\par \'93I understand we're to have some of your creations sold at the European Cup matches.\'94 He smirked, leaning over conspiratorially, putting his finger to the side of his nose. \'93You may thank me,\'94
 he said to the twins, sotto voce; Fred and George looked at each other, alarmed. \'93Least I could do,\'94 Bagman said, standing up straight again and clearing his throat. It seemed to be the closest the twins would get to an admissio
n of guilt or an apology. Harry wondered how Bagman had ever managed to get the goblins to leave him alone (If they indeed had).
\par 
\par Bagman turned back to Harry. \'93Listen, I wanted to talk to you. Don\rquote t run off after the match. Friend of mine wants to talk to you. Captain of the Welsh team.\'94
\par 
\par Harry had tipped up his bottle of butterbeer to drink, and now risked spitting it all over Bagman. He only just managed to swallow instead of choking on it.
\par 
\par \'93Er, why?\'94
\par 
\par Ludo looked very sober now. \'93You haven\rquote t heard? One of the casualties in the Diagon Alley attack was Audra Griffiths. She was the starting Seeker for Wales, and also for the Harpies. Their former reserve Seeker has moved up; she\rquote 
s playing today, and has also taken Griffiths\rquote  spot on the Welsh team. The Harpies hired a new reserve Seeker, but she doesn't qualify for the Welsh team, as she wasn\rquote t born there and doesn\rquote 
t live there. I understand you were born in Wales. Is that true?\'94
\par 
\par Harry swallowed, trying to think whether he'd ever seen his birth certificate. \'93I--I don\rquote t know. I think so. I can check.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Check quickly. Tryouts for the reserve spot on the Welsh team are the first Saturday in September. You should do it, Harry. You could even get the starting spot, you never know. The Cup games start the week af
ter that. Eight Saturdays of matches between the sixteen qualifying European teams. The quarter-finals are for four weeks after that, then the semi-finals. The final is the twenty-eighth of December, in Wales. Of course, if you were playing for Wales, and
 they lost their match in early October, that wouldn\rquote t much matter, would it?\'94
\par 
\par Harry couldn't tell whether he was trying to guilt him into trying for the team. Playing in the European Cup! And if he managed to get the Welsh team to the final--to be played 
in Wales...! It would be even better than the World Cup. Then he reminded himself it would only be a reserve slot. Still...
\par 
\par \'93Oh, wait,\'94 Bagman said suddenly; \'93You would have to be of age to even try out. Are you seventeen yet?\'94
\par 
\par \'93You bet!\'94 Ron said excitedly; Harry just noticed that he\rquote d been barely containing his excitement the entire time Bagman had been speaking. \'93He just had his birthday!\'94
\par 
\par Bagman nodded and clapped his hands together with satisfaction. \'93Excellent! Stick around after the match, Harry; I\rquote ll bring Owen over to meet you. Owen Aberystwyth.\'94
\par 
\par Harry nodded at him, unable to find words, as Bagman moved off and the spectators began to anticipate the start of the match. Harry wasn\rquote t sure he would really see the match, after looki
ng forward to it for so long; all he could see was himself, wearing the colours of Wales, flying over the pitch as a magically-amplified voice cried to the crowd, \'93I give you Potter!\'94
\par 
\par He couldn\rquote t believe it; he might be able to play Quidditch for Wales while he was still in school. It was beyond his wildest dreams. He forgot about Voldemort, about Diagon Alley, about being Head Boy...
\par 
\par He had somehow forgotten that the opening was for a reserve player as he lifted his Omnioculars to his eyes again, scannin
g the crowd, imagining all of these people coming to see him play Seeker in the European Cup final...The Aurors didn't have the power to bother him any more.
\par 
\par \'93Ron!\'94 he said suddenly, putting his elbow in Ron\rquote s ribs.
\par 
\par \'93Ow, Harry! What, are you trying to get back at me for this morning?\'94
\par 
\par \'93No, no; did you bring your Omnis?\'94 Ron nodded, taking them out. \'93Right. Look see who\rquote s over there, right behind the Holyhead team physician.\'94
\par 
\par Ron put his Omnioculars to his eyes and tried to look where Harry was pointing. Harry picked his up and looked again; then he swallowed, a cold feeling creeping over him.
\par 
\par She seemed to be looking right back at him through the lenses....
\par 
\par Ron and Harry turned to look at each other. \'93What\rquote s she doing here?\'94 Harry demanded. \'93Since when is she into Quidditch?\'94
\par 
\par Ron shrugged. \'93She was at the World Cup. And since she lost her home, her husband and then disowned her son, she has to have been doing something to earn a living and stay busy.\'94
\par 
\par \'93But what?\'94 Harry demanded, thinking out loud. \'93And I doubt she\rquote s hurting much for money. She has enough extra for a Quidditch ticket.\'94
\par 
\par Harry looked again at Narcissa Malfoy. She\rquote d cut her hair so it was short and boyish, but he easily recognized those features, especially as they were contorted into tha
t unpleasant expression he had first seen at the Quidditch World Cup. She turned to speak to the woman who was the Harpies team physician--in fact, most of the people on the Harpies\rquote 
 side were women, as it was by tradition an all-witch team. He frowned now as he continued to watch Draco Malfoy\rquote s mother talking to the other blonde woman. There was something about the other woman, something familiar....
\par 
\par \'93Who\rquote s that Malfoy\rquote s mum is talking to?\'94 Ron asked, looking with his Omnioculars again.
\par 
\par Harry frowned while he continued to look. \'93I think she\rquote s a doctor at St. Mungo\rquote s. There\rquote s something about her--\'94
\par 
\par \'93The game\rquote s about to begin!\'94 Fred said excitedly. Harry looked up; Fred was next to Ginny, who was sitting the farthest from Harry. Ron, George and Angelina were in between. He and Ginny couldn\rquote t get too close, but he wished....
\par 
\par Ludo Bagman was the commentator. \'93Ladies and gentlemen,\'94 his magically-amplified voice intoned. \'93Please stand for a moment of silence in honour of Audra Griffiths, of t
he Holyhead Harpies, and Wilmer Parkin, of the Wigtown Wanderers, both tragically lost in the recent attack on Diagon Alley. Let us all remember these two talented players, a true loss to the British and Irish Quidditch League....\'94
\par 
\par Harry noticed a thunderstruck look on Ron\rquote s face as they stood. All witches and wizards who were wearing hats removed them, and all present bowed their heads in respectful silence. When Bagman said, \'93Thank you. You may be seated,\'94
 the rustling of the crowd almost kept Harry from hearing Ron.
\par 
\par \'93I don\rquote t believe it.\'94
\par 
\par Where they were sitting again, Ron said, \'93Parkin. I can\rquote t believe he\rquote s dead. It\rquote s the end of an era.\'94
\par 
\par Harry wanted to ask why, but Bagman had started announcing the two teams. The players flew out toward the middle of the field while the crowd cheered them on. While the spectators on the opposite side were cheering on the Harpies, Ron said to Harry, \'93
He was the last Parkin. He was young; about twenty-five. No kids.\'94
\par 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93So? I mean, it\rquote s bad that he was killed in the attack, and it\rquote s too bad he never had kids, but I don\rquote t understand why it\rquote s the \lquote end of an era.\rquote \'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, not in general. For the Wigtown Wanderers it is, though. The club was started almost six-hundred years ago by a family of four brothers and three sisters. Their dad was a wizarding butcher. That\rquote 
s why they still have a silver meat-cleaver on their robes, and that\rquote s why Parkin was playing for them when any team in the League would have loved to have him. For almost six-hundred years there\rquote s a
lmost always been at least one Parkin on the team, or there\rquote s been one getting ready to be old enough. This one, though; he was the last one. And since he hadn\rquote t had kids yet--no more Parkins on the Wigtown Wanderers.\'94
\par 
\par \'93And the Harpies score!\'94 Bagman cried, making Ron turn around and grab his Omnioculars.
\par 
\par \'93Aw, the luck! Don\rquote t distract me any more, Harry!\'94
\par 
\par Harry sighed and settled back to watch the game through his own Omnioculars, so that it would be recorded and he could play it back later, as slow or as fast as he liked.
\par 
\par The game was very exciting, but Ron became grumpier and grumpier as it went on. Harry was starting to worry about his werewolf temper and strength again. Finally, the Harpies\rquote  Seeker made a spectacular dive which Harry followed with hi
s Omnioculars, making sure he caught it all to watch again and again later. His heart was in his throat until the moment when she had the Snitch in her hand, and the crowd was on its feet, all of the Harpies\rquote 
 fans screaming hoarsely, and Harry longed to join them; in his other life he had never seen his favourite club do so well.
\par 
\par After the game, Ludo Bagman came to Harry again and brought two other wizards with him. \'93Harry!\'94 he said jovially. \'93Harry, this is Owen Aberystwyth. Owen, it is my pleasure to introduce to you Harry Potter.\'94
\par 
\par Harry stood and shook hands with Aberystwyth, a medium-height man who had black hair and bright blue eyes, and who looked like he hadn\rquote t shaved for several days. E
verything passed in a blur. Aberystwyth asked about which Quidditch players he liked in the League. Ron supplied him with the names, saying things like, \'93
Oh, Harry was just going on about Rudy Finster, on Puddlemere. Brilliant at dodging Bludgers, Harry said.\'94 Ron was putting quite a lot of words in his mouth; he dreaded having to remember any of it in future conversations with the Welsh captain.
\par 
\par Finally, Owen Aberystwyth was able to talk to Harry very seriously about the concerns he had for the team. Ron finally started paying attention to the other man whom Ludo Bagman had brought with him, but Harry didn\rquote 
t hear their conversation. He was too dazed at the thought of playing in the European Cup. When they began their walk back to Hogsmeade, Harry caught Ginny\rquote s eye. She grinned at him behind Fred as they walked.
\par 
\par \'93Isn\rquote t that amazing?\'94 she asked him. \'93You might be playing for Wales and Ron might be playing for England!\'94
\par 
\par His jaw dropped. \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par Fred laughed at his expression. \'93Harry, weren\rquote t you paying any attention? The other bloke was Monty Mathers, captain of the English team. They\rquote ve got to replace Parkin. They have reserves, of course, but when they move up, there\rquote 
ll be reserve openings. He actually wanted to talk to Angelina about trying, but she said she wasn\rquote t interested. Ron was, though, so he said all right, come and try, what\rquote s it going to hurt?\'94
\par 
\par Harry frowned. \'93Why should Angelina turn that down? What\rquote s she thinking? She was a brilliant Chaser.\'94
\par 
\par Fred frowned at the three in front of him, Ron, Angelina and George, all chatting noisily about Ron trying for the open reserve position. \'93Dunno. Seems queer to me, that\rquote s for sure...\'94
\par 
\par Harry was even more excited now; if he was playing for Wales (Even if he was a reserve and never had the chance to actually play) and if Ron was a reserve for England, if either of those teams went to the final, they\rquote 
d probably be able to get fantastic tickets for their friends, even without the twins\rquote  pull. (And now it seemed they might owe their good fortune to Bagman putting in a good word for them, not Lee\rquote s salesmanship).
\par 
\par However, he never could get Sandy to tell him whether You shall be wanted referred to the Aurors who didn't believe he was Harry Potter; the captain of the Welsh team, or--
\par 
\par Ginny Weasley.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par When they\rquote d returned to Hogs End, Percy and Lee still weren\rquote 
t back from Belgium, so they had lunch without them. Harry hung about the rest of the afternoon, lounging on the terrace with Ron and the twins and Ginny and Angelina, stealing looks at Ginny ev
ery so often, just reveling in being able to see her, even from a short distance. When he finally had to return to Ascog, it was a wrench, and when she stepped forward to give him a firm hug, he didn\rquote 
t want to let go of her for a second. She stepped back finally, standing next to Ron, smiling at him lovingly. Harry tried to keep Ron focused on him, so he wouldn\rquote t notice the look on Ginny\rquote s face.
\par 
\par \'93And next week we go shopping in Diagon Alley.\'94
\par 
\par \'93I hope they\rquote ve finished sorting things out by then,\'94 Ron said with a sigh. Harry agreed.
\par 
\par \'93Right. I\rquote ve got all of this money from working for Aberforth, but it\rquote s in pound notes. I was going to change it to Galleons, but that\rquote s been impossible so far.\'94
\par 
\par \'93The way things are going in Diagon Alley, from what I hear, you\rquote d better hang on to your pound notes,\'94 Ginny said, a warning in her voice. \'93Many of the merchants aren\rquote t taking Galleons now. So many people can\rquote 
t get to their money or only had a small supply of gold on hand, so some of them have started taking muggle money. After all, they have to be able to have some way to pay their employees, and to buy more wares to sell. And the inflation that\rquote 
s hit the shops! Zoey told me she bought the Standard Book of Spells, Grade 6 for sixty pounds. Her parents have an emergency stash of muggle money. But sixty pounds is about twelve Galleons, and I know that inside Ron\rquote s old book, which I\rquote 
ll be using, it says it sold for four Galleons.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Now, remember, Ginny, that one was also the twins\rquote , which they shared--after Fred dropped his into a Dissolution Potion, to test it for Snape during Potions class--and it was Percy\rquote 
s before that. Percy had to have a new copy, of course, since he said there had been new editions between him and Charlie being in school. So that makes it about five years old.\'94
\par 
\par \'93And you\rquote re telling me the price tripled in five years? They\rquote re trying to make money any way they can, and soon everything\rquote s going to be priced out of anyone\rquote 
s reach! I hear some witches and wizards have gone back to the barter system.\'94
\par 
\par Harry smirked; he had a feeling Ron wasn\rquote t going to win this fight. \'93I\rquote 
d better be going, you two. Sirius was going to be doing some undercover work, and I want to find out how that went. If you need some muggle money, I can lend you some until the Gringotts mess is cleared up, Ron. Don\rquote t worry about it.\'94
\par 
\par For once Ron didn\rquote t object; he wasn\rquote t the only one in a fix over this. \'93Thanks, Harry. I\rquote ll pay you back as soon as they\rquote ve got the damn goblins under control again. For all that Binns keeps teaching us about
 goblin rebellions, we wizards don\rquote t seem to be any better at controlling them than we ever were, eh?\'94
\par 
\par Harry agreed; then, before he lost his willpower and pulled Ginny into his arms, he threw the Floo powder into the fire, walked into the warm green flames and said, \'93Ascog Castle!\'94 Ron and Ginny whirled out of sight.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par Harry was surprised to see Severus Snape and his godfather chatting amiably on the couches in the sitting room when he returned to the castle. He stumbled into the room, shocked a
lso to see that Snape was in his sailor garb. He had on a smart blue jacket, white trousers, a white shirt, and his hair was pulled back at the nape of his neck. Sirius looked as though he\rquote 
d gotten some sun and was wearing simple jeans and a white T-shirt, looking more relaxed than Harry had ever seen him. How odd, Harry thought. He remembered that Sirius had looked very interested in Maggie when he\rquote 
d first met her; evidently, he didn\rquote t bear Snape any ill will for Maggie preferring him.
\par 
\par \'93Harry! Welcome back. I heard the match on the wireless. So the Cannons are out of it. Hard luck, that.\'94 Harry shrugged.
\par 
\par \'93I reckon I can bear to cheer on the Harpies, if they take the League this year,\'94 he said, trying to avoid Snape\rquote s eye.
\par 
\par Sirius smiled. \'93Sit down, Harry, sit down. We have some news about Annie Weasley. Well, in a way....\'94
\par 
\par Harry sat, looking back and forth between them. \'93What do you mean?\'94
\par 
\par Sirius sighed. \'93When we went to inquire about her at the adoption agency, they sent us to the hospital where Maggie was seen by the Doughertys, before they adopted her. It\rquote 
s private, run by an order of nuns, and they also run an adjacent orphanage. They don\rquote t handle the legalities of adoptions themselves, however--they use the adoption agency for that. They didn\rquote t want 
to deal with having lawyers on staff and such. When we started digging, I had hoped we wouldn\rquote 
t need to use a lot of spells to get people to tell us what we needed to know, but we encountered a good bit of resistance at first. We thought they were just bei
ng close-mouthed in general, but then we found some people who opened up about Annie, and as we talked to person after person...well, to put it lightly, no one had anything nice to say about Anna Burroughs....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Anna Burroughs?\'94
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s what the sisters named her. They all knew somehow that her name was Annie, and they heard her saying something in her sleep about a \lquote burrough\rquote ...\'94
\par 
\par Harry opened his eyes wide. \'93The Burrow! She was saying the name of her home!\'94
\par 
\par Sirius slapped his head. \'93Of course. I didn\rquote t think of that. Right. So maybe the memory charm didn\rquote 
t work as well on her as it did on Maggie. Little things got through, evidently. Still, as I was saying, Anna Burroughs was not the most popular child at the orphanage...\'94
\par 
\par \'93That doesn\rquote t matter. Why do we care that they didn\rquote t like her? The Dursleys didn\rquote t like me and that never put you off, Sirius.\'94
\par 
\par \'93It\rquote s not that they didn\rquote t like her....Let me start over. Annie was eight going on nine when she was abducted. For all intents and purposes, let\rquote 
s call her nine. She was a smart, healthy nine-year-old girl, and when she woke up in hospital with no memory of her early life, she was rather skeptical about the stories she was being told about being the only survivor of the house fire that kil
led her entire family. She didn\rquote t even have any burns, for one thing. Nor any lung-damage, from smoke.\'94
\par 
\par \'93But--but--didn\rquote t they tell Maggie that she was the only survivor in her family too? How could they not notice? How could they not realize that the girls were sisters?\'94
\par 
\par Snape sighed. \'93Because the spells Pettigrew used on the sisters--by which I mean the nuns--confunded them to such a degree that they could not even recognize that they had two red-haired girls with remarkably similar features and very si
milar stories. Pettigrew had Maggie as the survivor of a car crash, not a fire. Now, you and I, if we saw the girls, neither of whom remembered anything at all, and heard those stories, we\rquote 
d think there must be some connection. Any reasonable person would. Not so with the sisters who were working at the orphanage and hospital in 1979. Pettigrew saw to that.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Right,\'94 Sirius added. \'93Plus, Maggie was adopted very quickly. She left from the hospital. She never actually lived at the orphanage.\'94
\par 
\par \'93So how long did it take for Annie to be adopted?\'94 Sirius and Snape looked at each other uncertainly. Harry saw. \'93What\rquote s wrong?\'94
\par 
\par \'93She wasn\rquote t ever adopted, Harry,\'94 Sirius told him.
\par 
\par \'93So--she lived there until--when? Did she leave at eighteen? Or sixteen? Did she take her GCSEs? Her A-Levels? She must have some kind of identification, she must have a government paper trail of some sort....\'94
\par 
\par Snape shook his head. \'93No, nothing. For a very simple reason: she ran away from the orphanage.\'94
\par 
\par Harry\rquote s jaw dropped. \'93Ran away! When?\'94
\par 
\par Sirius sighed again. \'93When she was twelve. Actually, she didn\rquote 
t run away from the orphanage; she had been placed with a family interested in adopting her, and she ran away from their home. The police looked for her--not very hard, in my opinion, judgi
ng from the information on file with the police in Exeter. She was never found.\'94
\par 
\par \'93She was only twelve! How can a twelve-year-old girl disappear without a trace?\'94
\par 
\par He looked back and forth between the two of them. Both men looked distinctly uncomfortable. \'93Miss Weasley--or Miss Burroughs, I should say, was a troublemaker of the highest order, according to the nuns at the orphanage,\'94
 Snape said stiffly, as though discussing one of his own more troublesome students. \'93Every time she was placed with a family in
terested in adopting her--and, mind you, she was placed with no fewer than seven families over a three-year period, which is a very high rate, considering her age at the time--she managed to stir up enough chaos and mayhem that she was promptly returned t
o the orphanage.\'94
\par 
\par Sirius nodded. \'93The reverend mother\rquote s files were full of the things she\rquote d done. Objects flying around the room. Televisions changing channels every second or faster, flipping through the entire spectrum; and they couldn\rquote 
t be turned off--even unplugging the blasted things didn\rquote 
t work. The same thing with various kitchen appliances; they would go mad and couldn't be stopped by cutting the power. Taps were mysteriously stuck in the on-position, flooding the house. One house was even made comp
letely inaccessible because as soon as she was out of the car, vines began to grow all over it, sealing all of the windows and doors so no one could get in. As soon as they returned her to the orphanage, all of the vines disappeared.\'94
\par 
\par Harry swallowed. \'93Sounds like she was doing some powerful accidental magic.\'94
\par 
\par Snape shook his head. \'93I do not believe it was accidental. She was protesting. She did not want to live with any of those families. That was very clear. She made sure they, in turn, did not want her
. The incidents became more pronounced as she became older. More--extreme.\'94
\par 
\par Sirius smiled now. \'93The reverend mother said she didn\rquote t know whether to have the girl exorcised or taken before the Pope for a private audience.\'94
\par 
\par Harry frowned. \'93Why?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Because she thought she was performing miracles. She called her a \lquote Living saint.\rquote  She also said that many saints were not exactly known for being popular, so she didn\rquote 
t hold that against the girl. When a dog was hit by a car in front of the orphanage, Annie went running right out to it and healed its broken bones and stopped its internal hemorrhaging.\'94
\par 
\par \'93She healed it?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes. Which is very advanced magic for adults, and usually requires a wand, some potions...But she did it as a child. She was twelve, and would have been in her second year at Hogwarts if she\rquote 
d never been taken from Molly and Arthur. It was not long before she ran away. The owners of the dog came running right up and saw her do it, evidently. He\rquote d been on a lead, but it was old and it snapped, and t
he loose dog went running in front of a car....Afterward, the owners of the dog spoke to the reverend mother about Annie, saying they wanted to give her a home. She was packed off to visit them, to see how they all got on. The reverend mother said she had
 
great hopes this time; Annie already seemed to get on so well with the couple, and she loved the dog and clearly would take good care of it. She still thought the girl was quite holy, performing miracles, not magic, and she wanted to her to be happy and h
ave a home. The reverend mother thought Annie was destined for great things.\'94
\par 
\par \'93And then she disappeared.\'94
\par 
\par Sirius nodded again. \'93Right. When she left the orphanage with the family, that was the last any of the sisters saw of her.\'94
\par 
\par Harry thought about this. \'93Did you get the name of that family? So you can talk to them?\'94
\par 
\par Snape stood. \'93Yes; in fact, I am going to see them tomorrow. Or at least, I am going to try to track them down. So far all we have is the address where they lived fifteen years ago. If that
 is not still their residence, some additional research will be necessary. But I fully expect we will be able to speak with them soon.\'94
\par 
\par Harry shook his head. \'93I don\rquote t know whether we should tell the Weasleys about this yet. It doesn\rquote t sound very hopeful....\'94
\par 
\par Sirius heaved a sigh. \'93I agree. Although Severus,\'94 he nodded at him, \'93Has already told Maggie. She won\rquote t tell Molly and Arthur and the others, I\rquote m sure. It may not be as easy to find Annie as it was to find Maggie.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Could I at least tell Ron and Ginny?\'94 Harry asked. Sirius agreed to this. Then Harry saw that Snape was getting ready to leave; Harry looked nervously at his godfather. \'93Er, Sirius--there\rquote s something I\rquote 
d like to talk to my--to Professor Snape about. Could you excuse us for a minute?\'94
\par 
\par Sirius looked like he was biting his tongue, refraining from asking, but he said, \'93Of course,\'94 and left the room, looking over his shoulder briefly. Snape looked at him expectantly. Harry weighed his words before beginning.
\par 
\par \'93Sir, I--I just found out about you and Maggie. I mean that you met six years ago. Just before I started school. And I wanted to say--I\rquote m sorry you had to leave her. It\rquote s all my fault, and I don\rquote 
t blame you for hating me because of it--\'94
\par 
\par Snape\rquote s mouth was a very thin line. \'93Harry, I returned to the school for many reasons. You were one of them, yes. The Stone was another. And the loyalty I owe to the headmaster is yet another. Besides,\'94
 he added, a slight smirk at the edge of his mouth, \'93If I hadn\rquote t saved your skin in your first year, there might no longer be a Hogwarts. Who else, after all, would dare to go into the Chamber of Secrets and slay a basilisk at the age of twelve?
\'94 His eyes actually seemed to be glittering with amusement now.
\par 
\par \'93You know about that?\'94 Harry\rquote s jaw dropped.
\par 
\par \'93You need to be mindful of who knows your secrets, and to whom they tell them. I am becoming reacquainted with Maggie Dougherty, and we talk a great deal; she, in turn, has been talking with her youngest sister and her sister has been telli
ng her about the most interesting things that have happened to her....You can guess the rest.\'94
\par 
\par Harry grinned. \'93Yeah, I can.\'94 He looked at Snape\rquote s clothes pointedly. \'93Where are you off to, then?\'94
\par 
\par \'93The Patricia is anchored up in the Bay. My uncle is on boa
rd, waiting for me to Apparate below decks, and then we are sailing back up to Dunoon. From there I will Apparate to Exeter tomorrow to meet your godfather and speak to the family who owned the dog healed by Annie Weasley--or Anna Burroughs.\'94
\par 
\par Harry nodded. \'93Thanks for--for doing all this.\'94
\par 
\par Severus Snape raised one eyebrow sharply. \'93You should have figured out by now, Potter, that I am not doing this for you. Tell your godfather not to be late tomorrow.\'94 And with that, he Disapparated with a pop! and Harry was alone.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par The trip to Diagon Alley was not something Harry wanted to repeat soon. The only admission points were the fireplaces in the Leaky Cauldron, Madam Malkin\rquote s, and Flourish and Blotts. It was necessary to call the dining room at the pu
b to schedule an arrival (A clerk was taking calls there and scheduling people for the various fireplaces), and Aurors were waiting at each hearth to \'93Greet\'94 people as they arrived, ascertaining that they had legitimate business to attend to.
\par 
\par Harry wasn\rquote t questioned this time when he arrived in Madam Malkin\rquote 
s. The Aurors seemed to believe he was really Harry Potter. He was meeting Ron there, or so he thought; when he arrived, one of the Aurors who looked him over checked a parchment of scheduled arrivals a
nd departures and found that Ron and Ginny had been slated to arrive in the Leaky Cauldron twenty minutes before he landed in the robe shop. He thanked the Aurors, making certain to be just deferential enough but not licking their boots, and made his way 
through the Alley to the pub.
\par 
\par Diagon Alley was very nearly deserted. Very fe
w people seemed to be venturing into it these days. It felt so odd not to be jostled by crowds of people as he walked by the shop windows. His footsteps echoed on the cobblestones, and he saw more than one previously-thriving shop cleaned out, with a \'93
To let,\'94
 sign in the window, and the name of the same agent, over and over, who evidently managed most of the Diagon Alley properties. No more than three people walked by him, looking at him as suspiciously as the Aurors, and hurrying on their way, as though w
orried that they too would look suspicious for being in the Alley.
\par 
\par When he passed the bank, he couldn\rquote t help stopping and staring. He\rquote d never seen the great outer doors closed before; they\rquote d always been folded behind the marble pillars supporting the port
ico. The inner doors, which were the ones he usually used, were impressive enough, Harry had thought. These massive bronze doors were covered, he saw now, with depictions of various wizard-goblin wars, all of the images showing the goblins doing dreadful 
t
hings to the wizards. As with most magical depictions, whether paintings or photographs, the images moved rather than remaining still. Harry watched with fascination as a pack of a dozen goblins surrounded a tall wizard and beheaded him, then proceeded to
 hack his dead body to pieces....He swallowed. Binns\rquote  dry delivery had never brought to life the utter carnage of those conflicts. He was glad it was burnished bronze and not living colour.
\par 
\par He entered the Leaky Cauldron and immediately found Ron and Hermione and Ginny sitting at a table near the dart boards. He grinned at them and strode over, about to greet them just as the door to muggle London opened, and Draco Malfoy stepped into the pub
\rquote s dim interior.
\par 
\par Harry\rquote s day went downhill from there.
\par 
\par They bough
t their books, their new robes, their Potions supplies. Every merchant seemed to have a different way of calculating the exchange rate between Galleons and pounds, and many of them, even when they accepted the notes (Ginny had been right--the inflation wa
s outrageous) looked at the bits of paper while frowning deeply, as though Harry might have simply transfigured stray pieces of parchment to look like this. He heard the clerk in the bookstore say, as they left, \'93I\rquote ll tell you one thing, I
\rquote ll be glad when we can use real money again.\'94
\par 
\par At every turn, Harry felt like he was seeing Draco Malfoy whispering in Ginny\rquote s ear, grinning mischievously, and Ginny blushing and smiling back at him. He remembered her saying that he was getting far too good at very nearly 
seducing her. He tried very hard not to let his feelings show, but by the end of the shopping excursion, he was feeling like hitting something (Or someone) very, very hard. The feeling he\rquote d had at Hog\rquote 
s End, that he could wait as long as necessary for her, was very hard to maintain when Draco Malfoy was drooling all over her right under his nose.
\par 
\par Hermione looked at him with concern as the five of them sat around a table at Florean Fortescue\rquote s, eating ice cream. They were Florean\rquote s only customers.
\par 
\par \'93Are you all right, Harry? You\rquote ve been clenching your jaw all afternoon. You\rquote ll have a terrific headache when you try to get to sleep tonight. And that\rquote 
s really bad for your teeth, as well. My parents see loads of people who grind their teeth like that. It\rquote s extremely unhealthy.\'94
\par 
\par Harry grimaced and concentrated on eating his ice cream. \'93I\rquote m all right,\'94 he said, trying not to notice that Draco Malfoy was feeding Ginny a cherry with whipped cream on it. Fortunately, Ron took it upon himself to be peeved about this.

\par 
\par \'93Oi, Ginny, can\rquote t you feed yourself? You have to get that git to help you?\'94
\par 
\par Draco Malfoy smirked at Ron. Ron glowered back at him. Harry tried to imagine Hermione allowing Ron to feed her like that. He couldn\rquote t. He\rquote d never done anything of the sort when 
he was with her, either. He decided to avert a more severe exchange of hostilities by being the bearer of bad news.
\par 
\par \'93I suppose I\rquote m a bit tense about the news Sirius and Professor Snape keep dredging up about Annie,\'94 he lied, although it was true that it wasn\rquote t good news.
\par 
\par He had already told Ginny and Ron about Annie\rquote s running away, since Sirius had said it was all right. \'93What now?\'94 Ginny said, turning away from her boyfriend.
\par 
\par He filled Hermione and Draco Malfoy in on the first news about Annie before telling them all what had been learned when Sirius and Snape had gone looking for the family with the healed dog.
\par 
\par \'93They\rquote re gone,\'94 he said simply. They all looked at each other, perplexed.
\par 
\par \'93Gone?\'94 Hermione said, as though unwilling to believe. \'93You mean they emigrated or something?\'94
\par 
\par \'93No. Actually, from what they can tell, the family never existed in the first place.\'94
\par 
\par The four of them looked at each other in confusion, then back at Harry. \'93They never existed,\'94 Hermione parroted, as though Harry had perhaps meant to say something entirely different.
\par 
\par \'93Well, after she ran away, police were sent to the house, and the family answered their questions about what had happened and all that. But when Sirius and Snape tried to find where they had moved after they left
 that house, and they traced the ownership records in the town hall, the person who owned the house at the time that that family lived there said that the house was vacant when Annie disappeared. He didn\rquote 
t manage to lease it to someone else until a couple 
of months later. There are also no telephone records for the family, or any other type of records. Employment, drivers licenses, nothing. And the sisters at the orphanage insist that they had all of the required papers. The mother and father each had a bi
rth certificate. They had jobs. But when Sirius and Snape checked out that information too, it turned out to all be false. None of it was real.\'94
\par 
\par Ginny looked genuinely alarmed. \'93Oh, no....It sounds like she was kidnapped again, this time by these people who pretended to want to adopt her. That\rquote s dreadful. You don\rquote t suppose--you don\rquote t suppose they--they hurt her?\'94 Ginny
\rquote s real meaning was clear, and it made them all tense up.
\par 
\par \'93We have no way of knowing. What Sirius and Snape--and I--found very odd was that she\rquote d managed before to get out of situations she didn\rquote 
t like. She seemed to like it fine at the orphanage; she never tried to run away from there, and the reverend mother said that if she was performing her \lquote Miracles,\rquote  as she called them, while at the orp
hanage, the other children kept it quiet, and the sisters never saw a thing. She only seemed to do it when she was sent to a family who might adopt her. We prefer not to think she disappeared with this family against her will. She must have wanted to go--
wherever they went. I fail to see how someone with her powers, and who was willing to use her powers, could be hurt or made to go anywhere against her will by muggles....\'94 He bit his lip, not saying what he suspected. But Ron caught on.
\par 
\par \'93They weren\rquote t muggles! They must have been a wizarding family! They recognized her for a witch!\'94
\par 
\par Harry nodded. \'93We think that\rquote s possible. So she might have known she was a witch--and that there\rquote s a wizarding community--from about the age of twelve. The question is--if she w
as taken in by wizards, did she go to wizarding school? She probably didn\rquote 
t go to Hogwarts, because Charlie was still there and he would have recognized her. So--did she go to some magic school abroad, like Durmstrang or Beauxbatons, or perhaps one of the smaller European schools? Maybe a school in America?\'94
\par 
\par Hermione brightened. \'93Perhaps, if they find her, she wouldn\rquote t need to be told she\rquote s a witch--just that she\rquote s a Weasley!\'94
\par 
\par Harry sighed again. \'93It\rquote s easier said than done. Sirius and Snape aren\rquote t convinced the family gave their true name to the sisters at the orphanage. It\rquote ll be like looking for a needle in a haystack. We don\rquote 
t even know that they stayed in this country, or Europe, or in this hemisphere. And she\rquote s owl-proof. We\rquote re really no closer than we ever were to finding her.\'94
\par 
\par He pushed back from the table, not interested in finishing his ice cream. He tried not to notice the way Malfoy draped his hand over Ginny\rquote s shoulder, or the way she shivered when his fingers brushed her neck....He clenched hi
s jaw again, feeling the beginning of the headache that Hermione had warned him about....
\par 
\par He was glad to get back to Ascog. Somehow, Ginny confessing that she really loved him and was just acting when she was around Draco to protect him had had the effect
 of making him even more discontented with his life (At least when he saw her with Malfoy). When the Sunday before the wedding finally rolled around, he realized that he was dreading this, dreading seeing Ginny walking down the aisle as one of Alicia
\rquote s bridesmaids, dreading standing up with Roger Davies, of all people, dreading seeing her at the party after, not daring to dance with her or take her in his arms....
\par 
\par I\rquote m in for a week of torture, he thought, wondering if he could find some excuse for backing out now. But he could think of nothing, and he dutifully packed and prepared to step into the fireplace to travel to Alicia\rquote s parents\rquote 
 estate in Sywell, Northamptonshire. She had had the fireplace in the lodge, where she was living, connected to the Floo network; since she was a witch, the Ministry had allowed it. (She\rquote d asked about connecting her parents\rquote 
 house, but they had refused). When he fell out of the fireplace at Alicia\rquote s, clutching his bag, Alicia was waiting for him.
\par 
\par \'93Harry!\'94 she gushed, hugging him and kissing him on both cheeks. She then held him at arm\rquote 
s length, her golden hair pulled into a sleek chignon at the nape of her neck. She looked very elegant in a champagne-colored skirted suit and pearls, very smart and grown-up, and Harry suddenly
 felt like an eleven-year-old again, stammering out his hello. She tucked her arm into his, leading him outside to her car. \'93Thank you so much for agreeing to do this, Harry! You\rquote 
re the last one in the wedding party to arrive. Everyone else is up at the house; I think father has them all in the drawing room, having a sing-along and generally being loud. He always seems to think he\rquote 
s campaigning. But it looks like he actually has a very good chance at a seat in Parliament. Isn\rquote t that wonderful?\'94
\par 
\par Harry nodded as he sat in the car and closed his door. \'93Fantastic,\'94
 he said unenthusiastically. She kept up her animated chatter as she drove up the gravel drive to the manor house, and Harry watched with envy some horses running in the paddocks, wishing he were as free. But he\rquote 
d signed on to be held prisoner in a country house for a week, and there was no getting out of it now. He smiled feebly at Alicia as she continued to talk, not really hearing her words and trying not to feel empty and trapped.
\par 
\par The e
ntrance hall was very grand, with an enormous vase of blowzy roses on a large round mahogany table in the center of the space. The floor was a complicated pattern done in encaustic tiles and a pair of grand stairways wound up both sides of the room, disap
pearing up into the grand house. Through a curtained archway Harry could hear a crowd of people singing along with a piano: Rule Britannia. They couldn\rquote 
t complete the song and it degenerated into laughter. Alicia gave his bag to a prim-looking maid and told her what room to take it to. The maid disappeared as swiftly as any house-elf and Alicia led him to the drawing room.
\par 
\par The drawing room was enormous. It would have held six Ascog Castle sitting rooms, if not more. There were several groupings of squashy c
ouches and armchairs in a variety of patterns that somehow harmonized, numerous Persian rugs, and in general a shabby- genteel English country house look and feel that communicated both money and a carelessness about money that only the very rich could af
ford. The grand piano was in one corner, being manned by Alicia\rquote 
s father, who seemed to be quite accomplished, and a fine baritone, too. He recognized the Weasley twins, standing beside Ginny. Hermione was already there as well, and Angelina and--he swallow
ed--Katie. (He knew he had to have a certain conversation with her, and he was dreading that, too). There were some other people too, but Harry couldn\rquote t see everyone in the crowd around the piano from his lurking position near the doorway.
\par 
\par \'93I have a million things to do,\'94 Alicia whispered to him. \'93Make yourself at home,\'94
 she said, as though that was ever going to happen, before disappearing between the curtains again. Her father started playing the introduction to a song, with a lot of ornamentation, saying, \'93
Now, I want to hear the little lark Alicia said is singing for the wedding. Where is she?\'94
\par 
\par Then Harry saw her; Ruth bashfully raised her hand and Harry couldn\rquote t help grinning. He knew what a wonderful voice she had, and he was pleased to find out that she would be here too. The introduction ended, and Mr. Spinnet nodded at her, \'93
I think you know it. Everyone does.\'94
\par 
\par She nodded and immediately started singing the sweetest rendition of Danny Boy that Harry had ever heard. It made his throat ache to hear her, it was so beautiful, and he remembered feeling the same way about the singer who had played Dido when he\rquote 
d been to the opera in Hogsmeade. Then a tall blond man next to her, with a close-cropped beard and bright blue eyes, smiled at her and whispered 
in her ear. She nodded, and then he joined her, his tenor voice amazingly high, as, in a unison that sent chills up Harry\rquote s spine, they went up, up, for the climax of the song:
\par 
\par \'93...But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
\par Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
\par 'Tis I'll be HERE in sunshine or in shadow...\'94
\par 
\par They sounded amazing together, and as they finished the song more gently, the man harmonizing with her now, everyone in the room seemed to be holding their breaths, until they both finished
 holding the final soft, tremulous note, and Mr. Spinnet moved his hands up the keyboard, playing the cadenza with a delicate flourish. A moment later, the silence in the room was rent with deafening applause; Ruth coloured prettily at the acclaim, and th
e blond man looked very pleased both with her and with himself, grinning at the reaction.
\par 
\par The blond man\rquote s reaction changed abruptly when Mr. Spinnet began to play the introduction to With Cat-like Tread. He shook his head vigorously, frowning.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, no you don\rquote t--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, come on, you know you want to. A little G and S never hurt anyone...\'94 Mr. Spinnet teased him playfully.
\par 
\par \'93No,\'94 the man insisted adamantly. Mr. Spinnet changed abruptly and started playing the introduction to a different song.
\par 
\par \'93I think you mean yes. Ambrose told me you never could say no to this one....\'94
\par 
\par The blond man laughed now, hearing it. \'93You\rquote ve got me there. All right, all right,\'94 he relented, and Harry wasn\rquote 
t quite sure what he would hear. He could have been knocked over with a feather when, a few moments later, he heard a very familiar falsetto singing a song he still heard sometimes in his nightmares....
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m called little Buttercup, dear little Buttercup, though I could never tell why.....\'94

\par 
\par 
\par 
\par Harry crossed 
the room, a feeling of urgency in his bones, while the man was still singing, the falsetto grating on him as it had in prison. When he reached the piano he halted, glaring at the man, who abruptly ceased singing, looking at Harry with an extremely alarmed
 expression. Harry could see him swallow.
\par 
\par Mr. Spinnet didn\rquote t realize immediately that he\rquote d lost his singer; he continued playing for several bars before stopping and saying, \'93What\rquote s the matter, old boy? Cat got your--\'94 Then he noticed where the man was loo
king; he jumped slightly when he turned and found Harry standing very close by. \'93Oh, hello there. Didn\rquote t see you come in. What\rquote s your name? Do you know everyone?\'94
\par 
\par Harry didn\rquote t take his eyes off Buttercup. \'93What are you doing here?\'94 he ground out. The room was very still. The man swallowed again; beads of sweat were visible on his brow.
\par 
\par \'93Why shouldn\rquote t Roger\rquote s cousin be here? He\rquote s also singing for the wedding. And his mum\rquote s matron of honor. And you are--?\'94 Alicia\rquote s father prompted hi
m again. Harry looked at him now, frowning slightly. He was pink-cheeked and had waving light-brown hair and opaque blue-grey eyes. There was a very slight touch of grey at his temples. Harry thought he looked like many, many politicians he\rquote 
d seen on television and would blend right in if he were elected to Parliament.
\par 
\par \'93Harry Potter,\'94 he said now; he couldn\rquote t ever remember having to introduce himself in the wizarding world before (At least, not in this life). Of course, this wasn\rquote t technically the wizardin
g world, even with so many witches and wizards about, and Alicia\rquote s father clearly did not immerse himself in news and information about the world in which she had lived since the age of eleven.
\par 
\par \'93Ah, yes! The last groomsman. Welcome, welcome! We\rquote ve been having a ripping time here--\'94
\par 
\par But Harry saw that Roger Davies\rquote  cousin was still regarding him with a touch of fear; then he remembered that in this life, Buttercup might not have done anything that warranted his going to prison. He had been on the verge of asking him how he
\rquote d gotten out of Azkaban, and was very glad he hadn\rquote t. And even though he had been sent to prison, he reminded himself, that didn\rquote t have to mean that he\rquote 
d done anything very bad. I was in there for killing my mum, but I was also protecting Ron\rquote s life. He might have been in there for a similar reason. Sam Bell was.
\par 
\par And then he remembered something else; Sam had described the cramped, combined accommodations for prisoners like him who weren\rquote t serving life sentences. Harry was unusual; he was
 in solitary confinement even though he only had a five-year sentence. It was for his own protection. Other people in solitary were likely to be there for more dire crimes--and they were likely serving life sentences. Life sentences were mandatory for the
 Unforgivable Curses.
\par 
\par But here he is, Harry thought. Free and getting ready to participate in his cousin\rquote s wedding. He looked around at the others surrounding the piano now; there was Oliver, whom he hadn\rquote t noticed before, and Lee, who nodded at him. He al
so saw Cho Chang, but he looked away from her before she met his eye.
\par 
\par Hermione moved toward him, frowning, only to find that Katie was also moving toward him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Ginny looking concerned and reining herself in. Harry thought quickly and grabbed Hermione\rquote 
s hand before Katie could get to him, saying, hurriedly to Mr. Spinnet, \'93Will you please excuse us for a moment?\'94
\par 
\par He saw Katie frowning and stopping herself from continuing toward him while he dragged Hermione from the room,
 back out into the grand entrance hall. She staggered after him, nearly tripping twice and righting herself. He was aware of a score of eyes boring into the back of his head. Once they were in the hall, Hermione pulled her arm from his grasp and pushed he
r disheveled hair from her face.
\par 
\par \'93What\rquote s going on, Harry?\'94
\par 
\par Then he saw the nasty scab on the side of her face, running along her left cheekbone and into her hair, above her ear. It didn\rquote t look deep; it was a dark maroon color, only slightly raised, and wh
en she saw him looking at it she hastily arranged her hair over her cheek again. He stepped close to her and held her right shoulder with his left hand, then pushed her hair back behind her ear again and looked closely at the wound. She didn\rquote 
t move, but looked into his eyes fearfully.
\par 
\par \'93I could ask the same thing, Hermione. Where\rquote d you get this?\'94
\par 
\par Their faces were very close; she pressed her lips together, then said, \'93On my trip.\'94
\par 
\par He brushed his fingers over it lightly; it was slightly rough under his touch. \'93Why didn\rquote t you let McGonagall heal it, then? It wouldn\rquote t take much.\'94
\par 
\par She swallowed. \'93I--I didn\rquote t want her to know about it. I told her I hadn\rquote t had any problems--\'94
\par 
\par He frowned. \'93What? Weren\rquote t you together?\'94
\par 
\par She shook her head. \'93
In her cat form she would have been considered food for the animals I was bonding with. I needed to go off on my own and find a group to accept me and let me live with them for a while. I had to maintain my Animagus form the whole time. It was exhausting.
 And then--then I got lost on the way back to Professor McGonagall. I wandered into this village--a town, rather--and--and--\'94
\par 
\par He put his hand on her cheek gently. \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par She swallowed. \'93A man saw me and--and he shot at me.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Shot at you!\'94 He was appalled.
\par 
\par \'93The bullet only grazed me!\'94 she said quickly. \'93It was easy enough to hide it with my hair and some makeup, so I didn\rquote t show the wound to Professor McGonagall. I knew she\rquote 
d blame herself. After the bullet grazed me, I ran behind a building and transfigured back into my human form. He came looking for a--an animal, and found me instead. I told him I\rquote d seen it running off, and I pointed, and he went in the direction I
\rquote d said. He didn\rquote t suspect a thing, of course. I didn\rquote t let him see the side of my face, or he might have thought it odd that he\rquote 
d just grazed an animal in that very spot, and here was a girl with the same kind of wound....I found a telephone and managed to call the little inn where Professor McGonagall was staying, so she could come and get me.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Where was this?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Out west,\'94 she said vaguely. \'93I started off in Saskatchewan, actually, and wound up in northern Montana. Evidently, I had traveled quite a distance with the--the other animals. It\rquote s just a scratch, and it should be fairly inconspic
uous by the wedding. It would have attracted a lot more attention if I had a huge bandage over it.  Don\rquote t tell Ron, whatever you do. He\rquote d go mad with worry--\'94
\par 
\par \'93And what about me?\'94 he demanded. \'93You go off to America, or Canada, or whatever, and nearly get yourself shot and killed, and I\rquote m not supposed to care? You act like it\rquote 
s nothing! What kind of animal is this, anyway, if people are just shooting them in the streets in America?\'94
\par 
\par She looked very grim. \'93It was a frontier town, Harry. Yes, they still exist. Mind you, they also have televisions and computers and carry telephones on their belts. They don\rquote 
t live in the past. Most people live on ranches miles from the town and just go there to do some shopping or pick up the post. They have to worry about wil
d animals attacking them or their livestock. Everyone has guns in their cars or trucks. Rifles, really. I\rquote m sorry I didn\rquote t tell you, but since this is the way you\rquote re reacting, can you blame me?\'94
\par 
\par They were still very close. He looked down at her, trying not to feel worried and failing. He was on the verge of saying, \'93If I\rquote d known what you were planning to do, I wouldn\rquote t have let you go,\'94 but there wasn\rquote t any \'93let\'94
 about it. He was her friend again, not her boyfriend. And even when he was her boyfriend, she wouldn\rquote t have accepted being ordered about by him.
\par 
\par He reached into his shirt and pulled out his wand. Instead of saying what he thought, he said, \'93Here,\'94 very softly; \'93Let me; it\rquote ll just take a moment.\'94 He touched the wand to the wound and smoothed it ove
r the surface; tiny bubbles emerged from the tip, as though it was trying to emit champagne. The bubbles were flattened under the stroking, smoothing wand, and soon her skin was clear and free of the scab. The new skin was, however, a bit paler than that 
around it, which was tanned. Harry remembered the gash of white on Draco Malfoy\rquote s leg where his stepfather had healed the boy\rquote s wound at the seaside.
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s a bit better. Now you just need to use the makeup to even out the skin tone, and no one will be the wiser,\'94 he said softly. She gazed at him, still a little fearful.
\par 
\par \'93And you won\rquote t tell Ron?\'94
\par 
\par He sighed. He didn\rquote t like this. \'93Well--can I assume that you were shot at because you\rquote re an animal that can hold its own against a werewolf?\'94
\par 
\par She gave him a small smile. \'93You could say that. Thank you, Harry.\'94 She stood on her toes and kissed him on the cheek.
\par 
\par \'93Now, now, is that a proper greeting for your best friend?\'94 he asked mischievously, taking her in his arms and hugging her firmly.
\par 
\par She hugged him back, saying into his shirt, \'93I\rquote ve missed you, you know.\'94 Then she backed up from him, although their arms were still around each other. \'93And now that I\rquote 
ve told you about being shot at, perhaps you could tell me about that little display in there. Have you met Roger\rquote s cousin before? What could you possibly have against him?\'94
\par 
\par He sighed. \'93It\rquote s a long story, and one I was hoping to tell you and Ron together, after the term starts, although now....Right now, let\rquote s just say I don\rquote t trust him and it wouldn\rquote 
t surprise me to find out that Aurors are looking for him.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Aurors! Why on earth would you say such a thing?\'94
\par 
\par Harry grimaced. \'93Of course, for that matter, I don\rquote t really trust Roger either, so--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh? Why don\rquote t you trust Roger?\'94 Harry looked up, reddening; Alicia was standing on the stairs, looking down at the two of them. \'93And before you talk about not trusting other people, may I point out to you that you\rquote 
re holding your former girlfriend rather closely, that her current boyfriend--your best friend--is conveniently not here at the moment, and your current girlfriend--who also happens to be a good friend of mine--is right through those curtains?\'94
\par 
\par Alicia crossed her arms and looked at the two of them with a raised eyebrow. Harry and Hermione stepped away from each other awkwardly; Harry thrust his hands deep into his pockets and Hermione didn\rquote 
t seem to know what to do with her hands, but finally decided on folding her arms across her chest, like Alicia. She was very red.
\par 
\par \'93I just--I just don\rquote t trust him not to go looking for you on the wedding day,\'94 Harry lied, hoping it was convincing. \'93You know that superstition about the groom seeing the bride before the ceremony. But Roger probably won\rquote 
t be able to resist--\'94
\par 
\par Alicia gave him a reluctant half-smile; he wasn\rquote t sure she believed him, but she seemed to have a grudging respect for his being able to think quickly. \'93I see,\'94
 she said, not sounding completely convinced. He hoped she would be unwilling to accuse him of lying to her.
\par 
\par She started down the stairs, but Harry said, \'93Actually, I\rquote ve had a tiring day. Perhaps you could show me my room and I can rest a bit before dinner?\'94
\par 
\par Alicia turned and went back up the stairs, not saying a word, Harry and Hermione following her. She led them to a large chamber
 with two beds, one of which was liberally decorated with clothes spilling out of an open suitcase on a rumpled duvet; the other bed was made up neatly, with Harry\rquote s bag sitting at the foot. With her hand on the doorknob, she said tersely, \'93You
\rquote re in with Oliver, which you can probably tell, given the mess.\'94 She turned to Hermione and asked, \'93Do you want to see your room, too?\'94
\par 
\par Hermione nodded. \'93I wanted to practice a little, in private.\'94
\par 
\par They left and Harry threw himself on the bed, lying with his hands behind his head, staring at the ceiling.
\par 
\par Buttercup. Buttercup is here.
\par 
\par There were too many questions for his brain to handle. What did he do in my other life to land in Azkaban? Was it just bad luck, like with me, and Sam? Is he involved in criminal activity now, and he just hasn\rquote 
t been caught? Is he perhaps even a Death Eater?
\par 
\par He sat up on his elbows, remembering Roger Davies pursuing him in Fraserburgh when he landed there after escaping Azkaban. Roger was a Death Eater in that life. In this life, his brother had attacked him and others in the forest, as though he sympathiz
ed with the Death Eaters. And why should he sympathize? Why, because he\rquote d found out his big brother was a Death Eater and he aspired to follow in his footsteps. And perhaps Roger was a Death Eater because of this cousin....
\par 
\par Brilliant, Harry thought. I\rquote m supposed to stand up with a Death Eater at his wedding, and listen to his cousin the Death Eater sing, and watch the Death Eater groom marry a friend of mine, all as though nothing is wrong.
\par 
\par Then he realized that it was odd that a Death Eater should be marrying a muggle-born witch, or \'93Mudblood.\'94
\par 
\par But was he going to just marry her? Was she marrying him of her own volition?
\par 
\par Or was Alicia in very grave danger?
\par 
\par He sprang from his bed and returned to the corridor, walking from door to door, calling softly, \'93Hermione! Hermione!\'94
 trying to find her room. Finally, he heard her cello and followed the sound to a door near the end of the passage, just before a swinging frosted glass door that seemed to lead to the service stairs. He cautiously opened the door from 
which the music was emanating and found her sitting in a chair near the window, bowing frightfully fast, practicing going up and down the scale, her left hand a blur on the strings.
\par 
\par \'93Hermione!\'94 he called to her, making her jump. A moment of painful noise leapt from the cello as her bow scraped across the strings awkwardly.
\par 
\par \'93Harry! Don\rquote t do that! You almost made me break the bow, or a string, or something!\'94
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m sorry, Hermione. But--but I have to talk to you. I think I need to tell you some things now, especially with Buttercup here. I can\rquote t wait for Ron--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Especially with who here?\'94
\par 
\par \'93With--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Speaking of not trusting people,\'94 Alicia was saying, bursting into the room suddenly as though they had never paused in their earlier conversation, \'93Have you re
ad this issue of the Daily Prophet, Harry? Because you know what they say about glass houses....\'94 She sounded very suggestive.
\par 
\par Then she left again, throwing the paper on one of the two beds and looking at Harry and Hermione as though she fully expected them to start shagging as soon as she was gone. Harry locked the door after her, then went to the bed to look at the paper and fi
nd out what she was talking about.

\par POSSIBLE SECURITY PROBLEM
\par AT QUIDDITCH MATCH
\par 
\par by Daisy Furuncle
\par 
\par At the recent semi-final Quidditch League match between the Holyhead Harpies and the Chudley Cannons, held at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, there was a disturbance before the match caused by none other than Hogwarts\rquote 
 new Head Boy, Harry Potter}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .
\par 
\par \'93I didn\rquote t cause a disturbance!\'94 he said testily. Hermione looked at him, frowning.
\par 
\par \'93What on earth are you reading?\'94 She put her cello down on the chair carefully and crossed the room, sitting next to him on the bed and looking at the article with him.
\par 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Potter was detained by Aurors who were screening spectators as they entered the stadium. Before Potter reached the front of the queue, he was heard questioning the Ministry\rquote 
s decision to continue to hold Quidditch League matches, since so much security is necessary to ensure the safety of all attendees. Potter called the matches a way to \'93Pacify everyone,\'94 and added, \'93This way, they can
 simultaneously occupy people with mindless sport and make it look like the Ministry\rquote s really doing something, just because they\rquote 
re checking over everyone who's entering the stadium. I'm sure they're really going to get to the bottom of the Diagon Alley attack by doing that.\'94 He also called the policy to continue to hold matches, \'93Bread and circuses.\'94
\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par \'93I didn\rquote t say that! Well, yeah, I said the part about bread and circuses, but Ginny said the other things--\'94
\par 
\par \'93She shouldn\rquote t be saying that where she can be heard! And neither should you!\'94
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s what Ron and I said! I mean about what Ginny said. But apparently, it was too late by then. And now I\rquote m the one who\rquote s supposed to have said all of it! And--and it sounds much worse than it did at the time...and it s
ounded bad then.\'94
\par 
\par \'93You do realize what this means, Harry?\'94 Hermione prompted him. He looked at her and shrugged. \'93It means that Rita Skeeter is not Daisy Furuncle.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Or, like Sirius said, there\rquote s more than one. Blimey; how many people have I hacked off? How many times this summer am I going to be--to be--\'94
\par 
\par \'93I believe the words you\rquote re looking for are \lquote pilloried in the press,\rquote \'94 Hermione said helpfully. He made a face.
\par 
\par \'93I don\rquote t think I\rquote ve ever used the word \lquote pilloried\rquote  in my entire life.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, you should start, because it\rquote s the best description I can think of for what Daisy Furuncle is doing to you. Anyway, there\rquote s more.\'94
\par 
\par Harry sighed. \'93Isn\rquote t there always?\'94
\par 
\par Hermione took the paper from him and read, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'93Ludo Bagman, who was once accused of being a Death Eater, saved Potter from further questioning by the Aurors after Potter whispered something in Bagman\rquote 
s ear. Whether this is a secret password for members of an underground society to recognize one another is unknown.\'94}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par 
\par \'93Oh, please!\'94 Harry exploded, glaring at the words on the paper.
\par 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'93After the match, Owen Aberystwyth, captain of the Welsh national team, was seen speaking to Potter. Rumors that Potter may replace Audra Griffiths, the late Welsh Seeker who coincidentally perished in the recent
 attack on Diagon Alley, have yet to be confirmed.\'94
\par 
\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 He scowled. \'93They\rquote re trying to make it sound like I killed her or something, to have a chance at the team!\'94
\par 
\par \lquote Oh, Harry! Is there any grain of truth to that?\'94
\par 
\par He looked at her in shock. \'93Of course not, Hermione! How can you ask me that?\'94
\par 
\par \'93No, stupid,\'94 she said, swatting him on the arm. \'93I meant the part about you possibly being on the Welsh national team.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh. Sorry. Actually, for once, a small grain of truth. But I still need to try out. I sent Hedwig to Little Whinging, so Aunt Petunia or Uncle Vernon could send me my birth certificate, to verify that I was born in Wales and that I\rquote 
m of-age, but she hasn\rquote t come back yet. She might come find me here, I suppose. Ron\rquote s thinking of trying out for an opening on the English team. Reserve Chaser.\'94
\par 
\par He thought she\rquote d be thrilled about this, but she frowned deeply. \'93Is that quite fair? With his, erm, special abilities? And aren\rquote t there a lot of night games, for security? What if it\rquote s--the wrong time of month?\'94
\par 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93I reckon he\rquote ll discuss all of that with the captain. It won\rquote t really matter unless he makes it through the trials, anyway. They might be very tough. In fact, they probably are.\'94
\par 
\par She nodded, still looking thoughtful. \'93I don\rquote t know about this....I know Ron would be thrilled, but if he made it, he\rquote d be in the public eye quite a bit. And that would have been fine before, but now...\'94
\par 
\par \'93What do you mean?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, Harry, you know the way Remus has lived for years! That horrid night-watchman\rquote s job at that warehouse. Never enough money, all of it. Just because he\rquote s a werewolf and most witches and wizards are so stupid and prejudiced....\'94

\par 
\par \'93It\rquote ll be fine, Hermione. Don\rquote t fret over something that hasn\rquote t happened yet.\'94
\par 
\par She still looked vaguely discontented. \'93And then there\rquote s you. You\rquote ll make a lovely target, you will, flying around at a World Cup game....\'94
\par 
\par Harry rolled his eyes. Hermione would never understand Quidditch. \'93It\rquote s the European Cup, Hermione. And that\rquote s why they\rquote re checking everyone g
oing to the matches. You should have seen all of the Aurors in the stadium; they were everywhere. Listen, when we get to school I can show you the game, since you missed it. It\rquote s recorded on my Omnioculars.\'94 She rolled her eyes.
\par 
\par \'93I can\rquote t wait,\'94 she said sarcastically. He laughed.
\par 
\par \'93No, you might really like this. The Harpies are an all-witch team, after all. And were they brilliant! Don\rquote t tell Ron I said that,\'94 he added sheepishly. She laughed.
\par 
\par \'93A turncoat, are we? Tired of crossing our fingers and hoping for the best?\'94 she said smiling wickedly, paraphrasing the Chudley Cannons\rquote  motto.
\par 
\par \'93Well, it was pretty clear the Harpies were going to win, wasn\rquote t it? A pity the cup final is the same day as the wedding. I know what I\rquote d much rather be doing...\'94
\par 
\par They we
re silent for a moment while Harry thought about having to be in a stuffy church in formal clothes instead of watching what promised to be a spectacular final between the Harpies and Puddlemere United. Hermione perused the Daisy Furuncle article again, fr
owning, then looked up from the paper and said to him, \'93You said you wanted to tell me something. That you didn\rquote t want to wait for Ron. And you were going on about \lquote Buttercup.\rquote  What was all that?\'94
\par 
\par Harry swallowed. Would she believe him as readily as Ginny? He had no idea, but he had to try. \'93Yes,\'94 he began slowly. \'93You see, I\rquote ve met Roger\rquote 
s cousin before, and he sang that song all of the time and wanted to be called Buttercup, so that\rquote s the name I know him by.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Where was this?\'94
\par 
\par He paused, breathing deeply through his nose. \'93Azkaban,\'94 he said finally.
\par 
\par She raised one eyebrow and looked at him blankly. \'93Azkaban,\'94 she said, incredulous. So once again, he went through the chain of events, the not-sleeping, followed by Voldemort influencing him to perform the 
spell which took them back through time. Hermione, however, was stuck on the sleeping problem.
\par 
\par \'93Harry! You never try to think clearly or make snap judgments when you haven\rquote t had enough sleep! Didn\rquote t my experience in third year teach you anything?\'94
\par 
\par \'93What? What are you talking about?\'94
\par 
\par \'93When I was using the Time Turner. You remember how I was. A bit mad. Doing things I normally wouldn\rquote t have done. A loosening of inhibitions. I mean, no matter how much I longed to tell off Professor Trelawney from day o
ne, I would never have done it if it weren\rquote t for my lack of sleep. And while you and Ron may not need an excuse like that to hit Malfoy, it\rquote 
s really not in my nature to just walk up to someone and smack him, no matter how much of a git he is.\'94 She grinned now. \'93Not that I\rquote ve ever regretted hitting Malfoy....\'94
\par 
\par Harry laughed. \'93Who would?\'94 She laughed guiltily as well, then sobered.
\par 
\par \'93I don\rquote t suppose you want to tell me how you went from saving your mother to being in Azkaban?\'94
\par 
\par He drew his mouth into a line. \'93Not at the moment, no,\'94 he said, swallowing, trying to prevent the image of his mother lying dead at his feet from creeping into his brain again. \'93
What I did--I received a five-year sentence. But there was a worry about--about my safety--\'94
\par 
\par \'93I should think so! You were only sixteen! And they were proposing putting you in with hardened criminals--\'94
\par 
\par He shook his head. \'93No, Hermione. You don\rquote t understand. Azkaban isn\rquote t like a muggle prison. The \lquote hardened\rquote  criminals are all crouched in corners, gibbering incoherently. Some of the other details I\rquote 
ll tell you and Ron together. The thing is--they put me in solitary, to protect me, and in the cell across the corridor from mine was Buttercup.\'94
\par 
\par Her jaw dropped in shock. \'93Roger\rquote s cousin was in Azkaban?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Only I didn\rquote t know he was Roger\rquote s cousin. I didn\rquote t know much about him at all. I eventually found out that his father was an itinerant actor and his mum was a witch. I didn\rquote t even know his name, but one day I called him 
\lquote Buttercup,\rquote  just because he was singing that stupid song so much, and he finally spoke to me and told me about his parents and why he sang Gilbert and Sullivan tunes all the time.\'94
\par 
\par She looked completely incredulous now. \'93Okay, Harry. You let Voldemort convince you to save your mum because you weren\rquote t sleeping. I believe that. You went to Azkaban. Less likely, but I\rquote 
ll give you the benefit of the doubt. But how could a person in Azkaban, with those dementors all around, still be happy enough to sing Gilbert and Sullivan all the time?\'94
\par 
\par \'93You\rquote re assuming he liked singing Gilbert and Sullivan.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh,\'94 she said simply, frowning. \'93So he didn\rquote t.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Hated it. He seems to have made his peace with the Buttercup song, though. In this life. But did you hear the way he objected to the other one?\'94
\par 
\par She nodded, still frowning. \'93That\rquote s true....\'94
\par 
\par \'93Now, here\rquote s why I\rquote m very, very concerned. Even though I was in solitary with just a five-year sentence, as far as I know, all of the other pris
oners there had life sentences. That means Buttercup must have done an Unforgivable Curse, or killed a lot of people, like they thought Sirius had done. Unfortunately, I never did find out what his specific crime was, or how long he\rquote 
d been in there. None of that. And, in that life--Roger Davies was a Death Eater.\'94
\par 
\par \'93He was?\'94 Her eyes opened wide in shock.
\par 
\par \'93He was trying to track me down after I escaped from prison--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Why should a Death Eater be tracking you, instead of Aurors?\'94
\par 
\par He looked at her grimly. \'93They both were.\'94 He saw understanding dawn on her face.
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s why you were in solitary, wasn\rquote t it?\'94 He nodded. She stood and began to pace, her hands on top of her head; he could see how fiercely she was thinking. Suddenly she stopped and faced him.
\par 
\par \'93Since there was such a to-do when Sirius escaped, I think it\rquote s fair to assume that he didn\rquote t go to Azkaban in this life, and that he didn\rquote t escape. Sirius was said to be the first person who\rquote d ever done it.\'94
\par 
\par Harry shook his head. \'93That\rquote s because Sirius was the first one who\rquote 
d done it that they knew about. Remember, years ago, Barty Crouch and his wife helped their son escape, and they did it so cleverly no one was the wiser. When you think about it, Sirius was downright amateurish about it. Not that I can 
pass judgment; I escaped in exactly the same way. And the same thing happened--it was all over the wizarding and muggle news, and I was hunted from Fraserburgh to Dover. No, the Crouches were frightfully clever. And if they could pull a switch like that, 
who\rquote s to say it\rquote s never been done before or since? We can\rquote t assume.\'94
\par 
\par She frowned again. \'93All right. But we know his name. Wouldn\rquote t people notice if someone with the same name as an Azkaban prisoner was just out in the world doing things?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Maybe. It depends. Since he\rquote s a half-blood, and it seems that he traveled about quite a bit and lived in the muggle world, he might not have very much to do with wizards.\'94
\par 
\par \'93But wouldn\rquote t his wizard relatives, like the Davies family, know that he was sent to Azkaban?\'94
\par 
\par He thought again about the man\rquote s face. Something about it wasn\rquote t right. \'93Not if he didn\rquote 
t give his real name when he was arrested. He might have given a false name, confessed to whatever charges they brought against him, and escaped, while making them think they still had him in prison....\'94
\par 
\par Hermione shook her head. \'93I think you\rquote re getting a bit far-fetched now, Harry. And I say that having heard about the time-travel and everything. It\rquote s probably more logical to assume that he didn\rquote t go to prison in this lif
e. It would be far more plausible.\'94
\par 
\par Harry finally conceded this. \'93The trouble is--he\rquote s the sort of person who could do something that would land him in solitary in Azkaban. He\rquote s capable of it. I mean, how likely would it be for two prisoners to be across 
the corridor from each other, both framed? Although, technically, I wasn\rquote t framed....At any rate, I\rquote m just saying that in a world where Voldemort never fell, he did something dreadful enough to go to prison. Perhaps the only reason he
\rquote s not in prison in this life is that Voldemort fell before he could find himself in a situation where he was tempted to do that dreadful thing. But now that Voldemort is back--\'94
\par 
\par Hermione sat down on the bed next to him again. \'93I see what you mean. Of course, if he was the one who\rquote 
d fixed the timelines and remembered you from that life, he might assume the same thing about you, Harry. After all, you were in solitary in Azkaban.\'94
\par 
\par \'93I was a strange case. Like I said, how plausible would it be for two of us to be in a similar situation? I just don\rquote t see it. Most of the people who were in there belonged in there. I\rquote 
d be very careful around him, if I were you, Hermione.\'94
\par 
\par She shrugged. \'93You\rquote ll be having a lot more contact with him than I will, Harry. And Roger, too. I mean, you\rquote ve got your fitting tomorrow, and the stag party later in the week. Haven\rquote t you checked your timetable?\'94
\par 
\par \'93My timetable?\'94
\par 
\par She walked to the desk by the window and came back with a neatly-printed grid that looked as though it was computer-generated. Harry raised his eyebrows.
\par 
\par \'93Alicia is as orderly as ever, eh?\'94
\par 
\par Hermione nodded. \'93She\rquote s my role model as Head Girl.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Ah, but she\rquote s with her former Head Boy now.\'94 Hermione blushed.
\par 
\par \'93I meant the way she ran the prefects\rquote  meetings and things like that, Harry.\'94
\par 
\par \'93You mean the way she emasculated Roger at every turn? Oh, very charming. I\rquote m really looking forward to the new term now.\'94
\par 
\par She threw a pillow at him, laughing. \'93Yes, well, don\rquote t take any personality lessons from Roger and I won\rquote t have to emasculate you, will I?\'94
\par 
\par He grabbed another pillow and hit her back. She looked shocked, but quickly recovered, and soon they were laughing hysterically and thwacking each other with the pillows repeatedly, until they collapsed in a tired heap on Hermione\rquote 
s bed, breathless. Harry landed face down, his head near the foot, while Hermione was lying the opposite way. He looked down at the time table that had fallen on the floor, forgotten during their roughhousing. He picked it up, groaning.
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94 she wanted to know, moving to the end of the bed.
\par 
\par \'93According to this, tomorrow all of the groomsmen are going to London to be fitted for our wedding clothes.\'94
\par 
\par She shrugged. \'93I told you. 
So what? The bridesmaids are doing that as well. Lucky me! I get to decide on my own clothes. She tried to sell me on dressing like one of the bridesmaids, but I explained to her that I already had an ensemble that was designed to allow me to play the cel
lo, and a long tight skirt wasn\rquote t part of the plan. It looks like a floor-length skirt when I\rquote m just standing about, but it\rquote s actually divided. The best of both worlds, trousers and skirts.\'94
\par 
\par He shook his head. \'93Well, while you\rquote re wearing something like trousers, I\rquote ll be busy wearing a skirt.\'94
\par 
\par She laughed, her brow furrowed. \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par He showed her the time table for the groomsmen. \'93Oh,\'94 she said, a smile curling at the edge of her mouth. \'93I hadn\rquote t noticed that before.\'94 He strongly suspected that she was thinking of his legs.
\par 
\par \'93Right,\'94 Harry sighed wearily, falling back on the bed again. \'93On the day of the wedding, I\rquote ll have to put up with Buttercup, who may or may not be a dangerous criminal; I\rquote ll have to put up with Alicia and e
veryone else believing that damn article in the Daily Prophet; I\rquote ll have to stand up with Roger-bloody-Davies as a groomsman on the last Saturday of August--and I\rquote ll have to do it all while wearing a--a kilt.\'94
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par \'93You shall change,\'94 Sandy had told him as he washed his hands, preparing to go down to dinner. He frowned. Did that mean he was going to need to perform the Animagus transfiguration for some reason? He really shouldn\rquote 
t, he knew. Not away from school, even though he was of-age. He wasn\rquote t going to be registered until after the end of his seventh year. He shrugged. Sandy must have meant something else.
\par 
\par Harry was about to enter the dining room when one glance through the curtains in the doorway informed him that he was woefully underdressed. He swiftly ducked into the hall, whispering to Sandy, \'93If you meant I should change, I wish you\rquote 
d said that, instead of saying you shall.,\'94 he said irritably. She didn\rquote t answer. He decided to transfigure his shirt into a dinner jacket, and his vest into ano
ther shirt, with a green tie already tied around his neck. He also decided, as he would be seated much of the time, that his trousers would do.
\par 
\par As he finished adjusting his magically-enhanced clothes, Sandy said, a little testily, \'93I was right, wasn\rquote t I?\'94 He didn\rquote t answer her.
\par 
\par \'93Harry!\'94 Alicia cried when he finally entered the room, with a smile that didn\rquote t extend to her eyes. He looked around nervously; again, he was the last to arrive. \'93There you are. I\rquote ve put you here, between Hermione and Cho.\'94

\par 
\par Brilliant, he thought, taking his seat, giving Cho a small smile which she returned briefly. Mostly, he thought she looked sad. He had a sudden thought. That\rquote s terribly tactless, to ask someone to be in your wedding just after she\rquote 
s lost her second boyfriend in as many years.
\par 
\par Frightfully crisp and precise servers brought the food around, and when a plate was put in front of him, Harry leaned slightly toward Hermione and asked her, \'93Erm, what is this?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Aspic,\'94 she said out of the corner of her mouth. \'93It\rquote s nice. An acquired taste, perhaps. You should try it to see whether you like it.\'94
\par 
\par He looked down at the array of forks to the left of his plate. The other diners had started to eat, and a low murmur of dinner conversation started up at the table. \'93Which fork do I use?\'94 he asked her now, trying not to move his lips.
\par 
\par \'93Start from the outside and work your way in,\'94 was the hushed reply, as Hermione took a bite of aspic from her fork.
\par 
\par Right, he thought, picking up the outermost fork. However, one taste of the aspi
c, and he had a problem. He held it in his mouth, not chewing; after a few minutes, his eyes started to water. Hermione looked at him, then away, then did a double take, her eyes widening as she saw the look on his face.
\par 
\par \'93Do you have a problem, Harry?\'94 she whispered, lifting her wineglass to drink.
\par 
\par \'93You could say that,\'94 he said, pushing the offending piece of food into his cheek with his tongue so he could talk. This unfortunately brought it into contact with his tastebuds again. \'93I can\rquote t stand it,\'94 he whispered.
\par 
\par She grimaced. Still behind the cover of her glass, she said, \'93Don\rquote t be a baby. Chew and swallow, and then don\rquote t eat anymore.\'94
\par 
\par What he really wanted to do was spit it out into his napkin, but he had the distinct impression that that would be frowned upon. He tried to swallow it without chewing, so he wouldn\rquote 
t have to taste much of it, and almost gagged. He started coughing very loudly, and Hermione had to pound him on the back and thrust his water glass at him, which he gulped greedily. When he
 was composed again, he saw that everyone at the table was looking at him. He smiled feebly, muttering, \'93Just went down the wrong way. I\rquote m fine now.\'94
\par 
\par The conversational murmur started up again after that, but Harry had noticed who was sitting across from him now.
\par 
\par Ginny.
\par 
\par She looked at him desperately, as though worried that he might really be choking to death. He found that he couldn\rquote t not look at her; he gazed into her large brown eyes and felt lost in them, felt like he never wanted to look at anything else.

\par 
\par He thought Hermione a bit rude for kicking him in the shin.
\par 
\par Harry bit his tongue, rather than call attention to himself again. He frowned at Hermione, but she was gesturing with her head to a person sitting across the table. To Ginny\rquote s right was Lee, and on Lee\rquote 
s other side was Katie. She was looking strangely at Harry. Then, when she realized he was looking back, she coloured deeply and turned to Fred, on her right, asking him something Harry couldn\rquote t hear. He looked down at his plate of uneaten as
pic. She\rquote d seen him looking at Ginny. She seen the emotion on his face. She knew.
\par 
\par He spent the rest of the dinner studiously ignoring both Katie and Ginny, feeling that this was the safest course of action. He tried engaging Cho in conversation once or tw
ice, but she was chatting in a subdued manner with Oliver, on her left, and seemed to be ignoring him. Mr. Spinnet stood after they were done their puddings and addressed them all, thanking them for coming to help celebrate his daughter\rquote 
s marriage (It sounded rather like a campaign speech) and suggesting they move to the drawing room for coffee and cognac.
\par 
\par Harry didn\rquote t want to go to the drawing room; he just wanted to go to sleep. He especially didn\rquote t want to socialize with Cho or Buttercup, and Alicia was
 getting on his nerves now, too (Although he felt more charitable toward her and was willing to excuse it as prenuptial nerves). He quietly explained to Hermione that he was going upstairs, and she nodded before following Ginny into the drawing room with 
the others. He slipped into the entrance hall and started up the stairs to his room, but a moment later he heard a voice behind him.
\par 
\par \'93Harry!\'94
\par 
\par He turned; it was Katie. She was wearing a peach-coloured sheath that made her tan look very pronounced. Her hair
 was pulled up in a loose twist at the back of her head but some tendrils had escaped and lay on the nape of her neck. He swallowed, wishing she didn\rquote 
t have to look so pretty just now. He stood half-way up the stairs, drumming his fingertips on the banister waiting for her to catch him up. We have to get this over with, he thought. He knew he had to break up with her, make it clean. He shouldn\rquote 
t continue to let her think he was even trying to get over Ginny, because it would be a lie, and he knew it was a lie now. He had been blind and stupid and hadn\rquote t known, before (Or hadn\rquote 
t wanted to admit it to himself), but now--now he had no excuse.
\par 
\par \'93Katie,\'94 he said slowly as she climbed the stairs, her heels clicking on each step. We have to talk, he was going to say. Then he thought, Oh, that\rquote s dreadful. Everyone knows that nothing good ever comes after that...
\par 
\par \'93We have to talk, Harry,\'94 she said, now standing on the same step with him. He had opened his mouth to speak, but she had beaten him to it, and he snapped it shut again, feeling rather stupid.
\par 
\par \'93Er, sure. Let\rquote s go upstairs.\'94 He looked around the entrance hall; since reading the most recent Prophet article, he\rquote 
d felt more paranoid than ever, expecting someone to be listening to him every moment of the day. She followed him up to the room he was sharing with Oliver Wood; just as he put his hand on the doorknob, his jacket suddenly re
verted to a blue shirt, which he was wearing unbuttoned over his thin cotton vest, rather than a white button-down shirt with a green tie. There was no tie at all. Harry looked down, embarrassed. Katie frowned.
\par 
\par \'93I--I hadn\rquote t really brought anything appropriate for a dressy dinner, so I transfigured my clothes before I went into the dining room. It was a sloppy spell, obviously. Already worn off.\'94 He hoped she didn\rquote 
t think he was disrobing, that he had designs on her (Especially after her saying, We need to talk.) He opened the door and as she closed it, he hurried to button his shirt, so his vest was no longer exposed.
\par 
\par He waved to a chair, but she stood near the door, looking like she wanted to bolt any second. \'93Harry--I need to talk to you because--because I don\rquote 
t think this is working out. You and me. I mean, we started off with my dad fixing us up, and then you moved to Scotland, and you\rquote re going back to school soon, and I\rquote m starting Auror training, and--and I just don\rquote t think it\rquote 
s working. I\rquote m sorry, Harry.\'94
\par 
\par She finally met his eyes. She\rquote d been looking all around him while the words came tumbling out of her mouth, as though she was afraid to look straight at him. He nodded, glad that he didn\rquote t have to do it.
\par 
\par \'93I understand,\'94 he croaked. Well, he thought. At least we\rquote re in agreement. \'93I\rquote ll--I\rquote ll miss you.\'94
\par 
\par She smiled. \'93Well, we\rquote re both staying in the same house for a week. But--I think we should probably spend our time with other people, if you know what I mean.\'94
\par 
\par He nodded. \'93Right. Of course.\'94
\par 
\par She put her hand on the knob and turned to go, but looked at him again first. \'93Harry--I really am sorry this didn\rquote t work out.\'94
 She seemed to have let her guard down now, and Harry gave her a feeble smile. Her hazel eyes were just a little shiny.
\par 
\par \'93Me too,\'94 he said softly. Then she was gone.
\par 
\par He undressed and turned off the light, deciding that Oliver could bloody well find his way to bed in the dark. He let a single tear fall in mourning for what he and Katie might have had were it not for all of the other complicat
ions in their lives. Wiping the tear away, he rolled over, punching his pillow, trying not to think. His exhaustion finally overwhelmed him and he fell into a dreamless sleep.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par Harry never understood how he survived to Friday of that week. He withstood being fitted for a kilt in the tartan of the Davies family, plus the other gear to go with it; he withstood a cocktail party to which Mr. Spinnet\rquote 
s many political supporters had been invited, honouring his daughter and her fiance. He had hoped to talk to Roger\rquote 
s cousin at the party, but the man always seemed to find a way to avoid him. He withstood going to the races on Wednesday, trying not to remember when he\rquote d been there with Draco in his other life, cheering on Alicia to her win on Granny\rquote 
s Ghost. That Alicia had been much less annoying, in his opinion. This one he barely recognized. He was starting to feel very sure that she wasn\rquote t marrying Roger of her own volition, her personality seemed so altered, but he didn\rquote 
t know to whom he should talk about this. Hermione seemed to have noticed nothing wrong, and he was afraid she\rquote d think he was mad and becoming as paranoid as Moody.
\par 
\par She had accepted his not telling her more about his other life yet, as he wanted to tell her and Ron other details with the help of the Pensieve. She was one of the few people he wasn\rquote 
t avoiding (Like Ginny, Katie, Cho, Alicia and, when he was at the house, Roger), but she needed to spend a good deal of time practicing the cello, so he often found himself wandering over the g
rounds aimlessly, hands sunk deep in his pockets, having rambling conversations with Sandy and wishing he\rquote d had the nerve to say \lquote no\rquote  to Alicia\rquote s request to be a groomsman.
\par 
\par He didn\rquote t really want to avoid Ginny, and had to force himself not to send stupid 
lovesick stares her way at meals, but he was afraid that if they were alone together he would be tempted to do something which, if Malfoy saw it while holding the basilisk amulet, would mean an all-out declaration of war.
\par 
\par He understood now why she\rquote d kept her feelings from him for so long; he was going mad knowing that she loved him and that she knew he loved her, but they couldn\rquote t even sit beside each other or hold hands. He didn\rquote 
t remember things being so difficult for him, somehow, when he thought she loved Draco Malfoy.
\par 
\par The rehearsal dinner was Thursday night. That afternoon, Angelina had presided over the hen party, and Harry had escaped the house to avoid the chorus of oohs and ahs over the gifts the women had given Alicia and Roger. He went ru
nning around the paddocks, sometimes racing with one of the Spinnets\rquote  horses, for fun, and rested, eventually, far out in a field so distant from the big house, all he could see around him was green grass, hedges, some fences and hot, blue sky.

\par 
\par The next morning, at breakfast, Harry received a very rude shock when he entered the dining room and discovered the last person he wanted to see sitting next to Ginny, contentedly eating bacon and eggs and talking to Oliver Wood about Quidditch.
\par 
\par It was Draco Malfoy.
\par 
\par He looked levelly at Harry, a challenge in his eyes. Then suddenly, he grinned and laughed. \'93I hear you\rquote re all wearing kilts, Harry!\'94 he said cheerfully. \'93I\rquote 
d have brought mine if I knew. Ah, well. We can get Davies good and pissed tonight and he won\rquote t have any bloody idea what he\rquote s agreeing to tomorrow at the church.\'94
\par 
\par Harry smiled feebly. Next to Malfoy, Ginny laughed and looked every bit his happy companion, so that Harry almost wondered for a moment if he\rquote d dreamt that night at Hog\rquote s End, telling her about his other life, her telling him she wasn
\rquote t in love with Draco Malfoy. He tried to ignore her, so he wouldn\rquote t seethe, walking to the sideboard and getting a plate for his food.
\par 
\par \'93I didn\rquote t know you were coming, Draco,\'94 he forced himself to say as he put some kippers on his plate from a silver salver.
\par 
\par \'93Well, Ginny arranged for me to come for tonight--I can come along for the stag party-- and then I\rquote m staying over for the wedding tomorrow. I\rquote m going to kip on a camp bed in Fred\rquote s and George\rquote s room. Ron\rquote 
s here too; he already finished eating and he and Hermione have gone off somewhere. He\rquote s going to be in with you and Oliver.\'94
\par 
\par Harry felt very petty as he mouthed the words, Ginny arranged for me to come for tonight with his back to them. He arranged his face into a smile before turning around, saying, \'93That\rquote 
s nice. Fred and George were speculating that Oliver would know the best way to do--erm, to do this.\'94
\par 
\par Ginny looked wickedly at Draco Malfoy now. \'93Well, good. That\rquote ll keep you boys occupied while we keep Alicia busy, having her last wild night before the ceremony--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Hey!\'94 Malfoy responded, although he was laughing. \'93You girls already had the hen party, you said.\'94
\par 
\par \'93This isn\rquote t a hen party,\'94 Ginny said, her voice very suggestive. \'93It\rquote s more of a distaff version of what you all will be getting up to.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh,\'94 said Oliver, sitting across from her and eating some toast with marmalade, \'93So you\rquote re going to get Alicia pissed and see if she\rquote ll make a pass at a stripper? Roger might like to see that, actually.\'94
\par 
\par Ginny frowned, confused. \'93Why would Roger want to see her with another man the night before their wedding?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh,\'94 Oliver said again, with an expression of complete innocence. \'93I wasn\rquote t talking about a male stripper.\'94
 He started laughing then, and Malfoy joined in. Harry sat next to Oliver, thinking about half-heartedly joining in with the laughter, but changing his mind. Alicia came sweeping in then and they sobered, although Harry saw Oliver sending merry looks at D
raco Malfoy, like they were part of the same conspiracy. Which they were, Harry reckoned. Why did he feel like he was on the outside looking in? he wondered. He should be looking forward to this. And yet--
\par 
\par \'93I feel like doing some riding,\'94 Alicia announced when she was done her breakfast. \'93Would anyone else like to come along? Some of the horses could really use some exercise.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yeah, I\rquote d like that,\'94 Draco Malfoy said, finishing his tea. \'93Haven\rquote t been riding in ages. We used to have some nice horseflesh. I rather miss that,\'94
 he added a little wistfully, and this time, when Ginny looked sympathetically at him, Harry wasn\rquote t so sure it was an act.
\par 
\par Harry rose to leave, feeling a bit grumpy. \'93I\rquote ve never ridden, so I suppose I\rquote ll pass,\'94 he said before leaving the room. He strode up the stairs, two at a time, and almost ran over Hermione as she was coming out of his room.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, there you are, Harry--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Hullo,\'94 he said, surprised to see her. \'93Where\rquote s Ron? I thought you two had gone off together.\'94
\par 
\par \'93He was feeling a bit grimy and wanted to take a shower, so I cleaned a lot of the girly things out of our bath and he\rquote 
s using it now. You must have used it earlier, when we were eating breakfast. Was Oliver using yours, or something? Anyway, I didn\rquote t know whether you\rquote d already gone down to breakfast, so I was looking for you to give you this.\'94
 She was holding one of the basilisk amulets by the chain; it swung back and forth, catching the morning light. Harry frowned.
\par 
\par \'93Why are you trying to give me that?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I found it in the bath, on the counter next to the sink. You must have forgotten it when you took your shower.\'94
\par 
\par Harry shook his head. \'93That\rquote s not mine anymore, remember? That\rquote s Ginny\rquote s. I never took mine off when I had it, anyway.\'94
\par 
\par She swung it up so that it landed in her hand, and she hefted it, feeling its weight against her palm. \'93That\rquote s right, you didn\rquote t. Well, almost never,\'94
 she added, reddening, evidently remembering when she had asked him to take it off. She closed her hand around it and then froze, startled. She closed her eyes for a moment and her mouth dropped open in surprise. \'93Oh....\'94
 she said slowly. Harry furrowed his brow, wondering why she was doing that. She used to look that way--she used to look that way when he was her boyfriend, and especially when h
e was doing certain things to her....He opened his eyes wide when he realized the cause of her reaction.
\par 
\par \'93Hermione Granger!\'94 he said, shocked by her behavior.
\par 
\par Startled, she opened her eyes, still grasping the amulet. \'93What?\'94 she said quickly, looking ver
y guilty. But Harry saw that she was still grasping the amulet. He held out his hand and tried to look very stern, hoping he wouldn't start laughing. She grimaced and put it in his hand. He clasped it and closed his eyes for a moment, seeing Ginny and Dra
co Malfoy and Alicia walking across the lawn, talking casually. He opened his eyes again.
\par 
\par \'93Ron\rquote s still in the shower, isn\rquote t he?\'94 he said pointedly, still being the disciplinarian. She was turning very red now, and he could see her swallow. He was having a very difficult time now keeping a straight face. \'93
Get a good look, did you?\'94
\par 
\par She was clearly very irked. \'93I didn\rquote t know that\rquote s what I\rquote d see! I didn\rquote t know I\rquote d see anything!\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, you continued to look even after you knew, didn\rquote t you? That\rquote s called an invasion of privacy, I believe, Miss Granger.\'94 He felt a smile pull at the corners of his mouth, and opened his eyes wide, trying to suppress it.
\par 
\par She looked at him with narrowed eyes. \'93And you\rquote ve never used it that way, I suppose?\'94
\par 
\par He looked at her guilelessly. \'93No. Not once.\'94
 That was the truth. He was tempted to finally let himself smile, but then he didn't feel very much like smiling. Suddenly, he had a terrible thought: Draco Malfoy could see Ginny any time. That meant any time. He thought
 for a moment of Ginny taking a shower, remembering her standing under the warm spray in the Quidditch changing rooms the morning after that dreadful storm....
\par 
\par He put it in his pocket. \'93I\rquote ll take this to Ginny,\'94 he said. \'93You go practice cello and let poor Ron shower in peace. When he\rquote s ready for you to see him in the shower, I\rquote m sure he\rquote ll let you know.\'94
 He tried to put Malfoy out of his mind and continued to rather enjoy winding up Hermione.
\par 
\par \'93But--but--\'94 she sputtered. \'93What is that thing? What does it do?\'94
\par 
\par Harry looked up and down the corridor, then hustled her into his room. \'93I\rquote m not sure what it is,\'94 he whispered to her, after closing the door. \'93
I can only tell you what it seems to do. When you held it, you saw Ron. Not just an abstract Ron, like a photograph you might keep on the mantle. But Ron right now, what he\rquote s actually doing this very minute.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Right--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Now, when I hold it, I see--\'94 He swallowed, looking down at it, wondering whether he should say. And then it turned out that he didn\rquote t need to.
\par 
\par \'93You see Ginny, don\rquote t you?\'94
\par 
\par He looked up and nodded at her, feeling like a fist was clenching his heart. She put her hand on his arm sympathetically. \'93I\rquote m not blind, you know. And you should bear in mind that Draco Malfoy isn\rquote t, either.\'94
\par 
\par He sighed. \'93I know.\'94 He looked down at the amulet in his hand again. \'93That\rquote s why I\rquote m taking it to her.\'94
\par 
\par Suddenly she had put her arms around him and was hugging him tightly. She backed up a little, stood up on her toes and kissed him on the cheek. \'93Poor Harry,\'94 she said softly, a pity in her eyes that he didn\rquote t like. He stepped away from her.

\par 
\par \'93You\rquote d better go practice. I\rquote ll take this to Ginny.\'94
\par 
\par When he reached the front door, he clutched the amulet again, seeing Ginny talking to Alicia while standing next to a stra
wberry roan with a snow-white mane and tail. Alicia was patting the horse and Ginny was nodding. She had bundled up her hair so that it was a mass at the back of her head. Alicia helped her adjust the chin strap on the black dome of a riding helmet she
\rquote d put on, and then gave her a leg up. Ginny put her foot in the stirrup and swung her other leg over the horse\rquote s back, sitting uncertainly on the roan, holding the reins, and Alicia\rquote 
s head was near her knee, talking again. Harry assumed that Alicia had given her the jodhpurs she was wearing.
\par 
\par Then Alicia disappeared and Draco Malfoy moved into sight, also wearing jodhpurs and a riding helmet, mounted on a large chestnut. His body moved easily with the horse\rquote 
s, a complete natural. Ginny looked far less natural on her mount. Their horses walked side by side at a slow, easy pace, Ginny holding the reins nervously, and then Alicia was beside them on a black-maned piebald steed which looked far too large for her 
to control, but which seemed to be obeying her every whim. She had also bundled up her hair and wore a helmet and jodhpurs. The three of them sped up a little as they left the cobblestone-paved stable yard. Harry remembered Malfoy\rquote 
s Alicia-on-a-horse fantasies, and wondered if they were coming true. Except now he was probably having Ginny-on-a-horse fantasies. Harry put the amulet back in his pocket and sat on the front steps that led down to the drive, deciding that he didn
\rquote t have to give it back to her right away. Soon they would be galloping across the paddocks, and he wouldn\rquote t be able to reach her anyway.
\par 
\par Growing restless after a while, he finally decided to walk down to the stable yard to wait for them instead of sitting in the sun on the front steps. T
he yard was orderly and well-kept, with a couple of grooms bustling about, tending to the horses. Harry walked idly from stall to stall, looking at the handsome beasts, then stopped when he saw a familiar face.
\par 
\par \'93Magic Man,\'94 he said softly to the horse with the lightning bolt blaze between his eyes. What do you know, he thought. He patted the horse\rquote 
s neck, smiling grimly, and fed him a carrot one of the grooms had handed him, with an admonition to be careful of his fingers. Sighing, he leaned against the gate to Magic Man\rquote 
s stall and put his hand in his pocket again, feeling for the amulet. He closed his eyes and could see Ginny quite clearly; she and Draco were not on their horses any more. He could see the horses\rquote  legs, so they were somewhere nearby; Ginny
 and Draco were on the ground, their helmets on the grass next to them, and Alicia was nowhere in sight. Draco Malfoy was kissing down the side of her neck while she threw her head back in abandon, and his fingers were deftly unbuttoning her blouse. Harry
\rquote s mouth went dry when he saw this.
\par 
\par Damn. They\rquote d managed to shake the chaperone.
\par 
\par Just then, Alicia came walking into the stable yard, leading her horse by the reins. \'93Knox! Knox!\'94 This seemed to be the name of one of the grooms. Harry wasn\rquote t sure where they\rquote 
d gone, but they had seemed quite busy. He put the amulet back into his pocket and walked out into the yard to meet her. She looked startled to see him.
\par 
\par \'93Er, hullo, Harry,\'94 she said, her voice shaking. \'93Ali Baba\rquote s gone lame. I had to walk back.\'94 She cleared her throat and called the groom again. \'93Drat!\'94 she added. \'93Where is that boy?\'94
\par 
\par \'93So,\'94 he said, trying to sound as though it didn\rquote t matter a great deal to him. \'93You left Ginny and Draco on their own?\'94
\par 
\par She shrugged. \'93He\rquote s an experienced horseman. We talked about that on the one date we had. You know; the ceilidh. The one I asked you to, and you turned me down. Remember?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I remember,\'94 he said. \'93How could anyone forget being kissed by you?\'94 he added, intentionally stroking her ego.
\par 
\par He smiled at her now; for someone about to be married, she suddenly seemed very insecure, and in need of having her ego stroked. As the groom she called hadn\rquote 
t answered her (Harry suddenly felt very superstitious, wondering whether this was a bad sign), she led Ali Baba into his stall and continued talking to Harry while tending to the horse herself.
\par 
\par \'93Yes, well, there are very few men whom I\rquote ve kissed, but you are one of them. Glad to know it was memorable, especially as you were secretly seeing Hermione at the time and probably snogging her senseless every chance you got, if not shagging.
\'94
\par 
\par He frowned; now she sounded bitter. She\rquote d been having frequent mood swings during the week, which he\rquote d put down partly to nervousness about the wedding, and partly to the suspicious nature of the wedding.
\par 
\par \'93Of course,\'94 she went on, \'93I thought I was going to the ceilidh for Draco to be able to dance with Hermione, not with Ginny....\'94 She spread a blanket on Ali Baba and patted his side affectionately, giving him some sugar cubes from her po
cket and stroking the long nose gently.
\par 
\par Harry was utterly confused now. \'93You what?\'94
\par 
\par She emerged from the horse\rquote s stall and closed the gate securely behind her. \'93He asked me to go to the ceilidh and said it was very important to him because he was seeing a girl in Gryffindor, and they didn\rquote 
t want anyone to know about the two of them. He said Ron would be especially upset if he knew. Well, it didn\rquote t occur to me he meant Ginny. I just couldn\rquote t picture her doing that, knowing how much bad blood there was betw
een their families. You don\rquote t have to be wizard born to know about that. I naturally assumed it was Hermione, if Ron was supposed to be upset. I mean,\'94 she said, rolling her eyes, \'93He was completely obvious at the Yule Ball.\'94
\par 
\par They walked back out into the yard and sat on a bench pushed up against the grey stone of the stable. \'93He was actually very sweet, going on about his girlfriend, saying how smart she was, top marks in her year. As he\rquote 
d had the good taste to choose a Gryffindor, and as I assumed it was Hermione, and that Hermione wouldn\rquote 
t be with anyone who was unworthy of her, I agreed to do it. You and Hermione did say you were going just as friends. I believed you. Then, at the ceilidh, when Draco and Hermione went off to
 dance together, and she made that crack to the Malfoys about her parents being dentists, I was certain I had been right. I mean, you were so obviously trying to pair off Draco and Hermione. And I assumed that\rquote s why you were surprised he\rquote 
d brought me; knowing his father didn\rquote 
t want his son with a muggle-born, to camouflage a secret relationship with Hermione with a date with another muggle-born seemed rather guileless. He did switch to dancing with Ginny, but I thought that was just to throw off his father.
\par 
\par \'93You could have knocked me over with a feather when, after the Quidditch final, there you were on the pitch, kissing Hermione, while Draco Malfoy was kissing Ginny Weasley! Until then, I rather thought you fancied Ginny.\'94 He didn\rquote 
t comment on this. She laughed and shook her head. \'93It\rquote s a good thing Katie\rquote s the one who\rquote s going to be an Auror. I\rquote d be dreadful.\'94
\par 
\par Then, with absolutely no warning, her lips were suddenly on his and her tongue was pushing insistently at his mouth. He sprang to his feet, definitely not interested in giving in to temptation this time.
\par 
\par \'93Alicia! Stop that! You\rquote re getting married tomorrow!\'94
\par 
\par She raised her eyebrows. \'93Right. Tomorrow. So shouldn\rquote t I have as much fun as possible today? Oh, speaking of Katie, did I mention that she told me she\rquote d broken up with you?\'94
\par 
\par \'93No, you didn\rquote t, but that\rquote s not why I\rquote m--\'94 His eye was caught by something; he looked at her now, at her boots. They were quite clean. His own shoes were rather muddy from his walk down to the stables; it had rained overnig
ht and the ground was still damp. He saw her shoes, the ones she\rquote d worn at breakfast, sitting against the outer wall of the stable next to what he recognized as Ginny\rquote s shoes and Draco\rquote 
s shoes. All three pairs of shoes were as muddy as his. Of course, he t
hought.  They changed into riding boots after they reached the stables. He had seen an array of boots lined up inside the stable, below some pegs with extra helmets. And she had said she was walking Ali Baba into the stable yard because he was lame....But
 he wasn\rquote t, Harry realized. He wasn\rquote t lame at all.
\par 
\par \'93Ali Baba isn\rquote t lame,\'94 he said with certainty. She looked at him with her jaw dropped. He pointed at her boots. \'93There isn\rquote t a speck of mud on your boots. If you\rquote d walked your horse all the way back, they wouldn\rquote 
t be so clean. You only walked from just outside the stable yard, didn\rquote t you?\'94
\par 
\par She looked down at her boots now, in shock. \'93Bloody hell. You\rquote re good, Harry. Oh, I just wanted Fred and George to think they had someone with them, you know. They still treat her like such a child! I wasn\rquote 
t expecting you to be here. I decided that, in case anyone asked, I had come back because of a lame horse. I didn\rquote t want the twins trying to beat Draco to a pulp. Please don\rquote t tell them. Draco and Ginny are really very sweet together, aren
\rquote t they? I\rquote m sorry for being a romantic....\'94
\par 
\par He plunged in. \'93Such a romantic that you\rquote re marrying someone you don\rquote t love?\'94
\par 
\par She froze, then her eyes iced over. \'93What makes you say that?\'94
\par 
\par He sat very close to her now. \'93Maybe it\rquote s that you didn\rquote t tell your two best friends you were even seeing Roger. They didn\rquote t find out until you sent your wedding invitations! Maybe it\rquote s that I don\rquote t think you\rquote 
ve been seeing each other very long, and you\rquote re already getting married. Maybe it\rquote s that I nev
er saw you even be civil to Roger Davies until last spring when I was reading to your class at the village school, and then, out of the blue, I saw the two of you kissing in your classroom, before Disapparating. Fleur was looking for him that day, and I l
ied to her and told her I hadn\rquote t seen Roger. So he was obviously still seeing her--or so she thought. That day I saw you do two uncharacteristic things: you were kissing someone I could have sworn you hated, and you were being the \lquote 
other woman.\rquote  Somehow, I thought that only an Alicia Spinnet who was not in control of her own actions would do these things. Unfortunately, I didn\rquote 
t come to this conclusion until later, when--when there were just too many things happening to deal with it.\'94
\par 
\par She swallowed and looked at him. \'93I\rquote d made no bones about not liking Roger when I was in school, that\rquote s true. I didn\rquote t know how to tell Katie and Angelina I\rquote d had a change of heart. I was afraid they\rquote 
d laugh at me. And then there was the original reason why I went after Roger...\'94
\par 
\par \'93You went after him? Not the other way around?\'94 Harry was skeptical.
\par 
\par \'93Yes. When Roger started seeing me behind Fleur\rquote s back--it was just because I didn\rquote t like her. All right, couldn\rquote t stand her would be far more accurate. Ever since she came here....Well, that\rquote 
s a long story. Anyway, I went after Roger. Made a big show of burying the hatchet, all that. It worked. And Roger--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--Wouldn\rquote t believe you any more than I do. Why are you marrying him, really?\'94
\par 
\par She had her mouth open, then closed it again. Finally she gave him a steely gaze and said, \'93You wouldn\rquote t understand, Harry. There are a lot of reasons two people might get married. I have my reasons, and I don\rquote 
t have to justify myself to you. I have my eyes wide open and I am going to marry Roger Davies tomorrow.\'94
\par 
\par He looked at her shrewdly. \'93Now I believe you. That you have your reasons, and that you believe you know what you\rquote re doing. However--when I saw you two kissing in that classroom, that didn\rquote t look like someone who would say, \lquote I
\rquote m with Roger because I have my reasons;\rquote  that looked like someone who was acting blindly. Someone who was under a curse or a spell or the influence of a potion. You may be acting freely now, but I don\rquote t believe you were then
. And I have a very bad feeling that if Roger has convinced you that he\rquote s not up to no good, you\rquote 
ve made a very big mistake to believe him. Evan died because he aspired to be a Death Eater, he wanted to do something that would get him noticed by Voldemort.\'94 He noticed that, as a muggle-born witch, she didn\rquote t wince at the name. \'93
Roger was blaming me, but I had the distinct impression he was really blaming himself and just lashing out at me. I think Evan found out his big brother was a Death Eater. You\rquote re not safe, Alicia. You can\rquote t marry Roger.\'94
\par 
\par She crossed her arms. \'93When you\rquote re quite finished, Harry,\'94 she said, \'93I would like to ask you just what the hell are you talking about? Roger, a Death Eater? Did you hit your head or something?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Have you ever seen him with his clothes off?\'94 She hesitated, and Harry had a feeling she hadn\rquote t. \'93You haven\rquote t, have you? Waiting for the wedding night? How traditional.\'94
\par 
\par She looked very offended now. \'93Of course I\rquote ve seen him with his clothes off! Don\rquote t be daft. All right, I\rquote ll bite--how can you tell a Death Eater when he\rquote s not dressed?\'94
\par 
\par He looked at her; she didn\rquote t know. She really didn\rquote t know. Was Roger all right? Did he not have the Dark Mark? He couldn\rquote t decide whether she was incredibly thick or an even better actress than Ginny.
\par 
\par Alicia didn\rquote t wait any longer for an answer. She retrieved her shoes and removed her boots with a jack while talking to him. \'93I think you need to go have a lie-down, Harry. I am marrying Roger tomorrow. I am not under Imperius. I am not under a
ny other spell. I am not being influenced by a potion. Just because I kissed you--well, isn\rquote t it normal for a nervous bride to be thinking about all of the boys she\rquote s kissed before and never will again? I\rquote 
m sorry I startled you. It was a stupid impulse. It doesn\rquote t mean I don\rquote t want to marry Roger. In fact--I\rquote ve quit my teaching job and Roger and I will both be working on getting my father elected to Parliament. We\rquote 
re going to be married and working together. Oooh, he\rquote s a Death Eater, you say. Yes, every day Death Eaters marry muggle-born witches and work to get their fathers-in-law elected to Parliament. Very likely. I\rquote ll see you at lunch.\'94
\par 
\par She turned and started walking away from him, but he caught up to her and grabbed her arm, turning her around. \'93Alicia,\'94 he said urgently. \'93What will happen if you don\rquote t marry Roger?\'94
\par 
\par She suddenly looked frightened, very frightened, and he knew he was onto something. Yes, she was marrying him of her own free will. Because she was trying to avoid something worse. (Harry t
ried to think of something worse than marrying Roger Davies, and failed.) What was she afraid of?
\par 
\par But her face had closed up again. She glared at Harry. \'93What will happen is my father will have paid thousands of pounds for the perfect wedding for no bloody reason, that\rquote s what. And I will tell you this now, Harry Potter,\'94
 she hissed between her teeth. \'93If you do anything--anything--to make tomorrow less than completely perfect, I will hunt you down, torture you, and kill you. That\rquote s a promise.\'94
\par 
\par She turned on her heel and marched out of the yard, leaving Harry standing, staring after her, completely stumped. Against his better judgment, he wrapped his hand around the amulet in his pocket again, despite telling Hermione he didn\rquote 
t do that sort of thing, but in
stead of seeing Ginny succumbing to Draco Malfoy, he saw her buttoning her blouse, standing, and screaming silently at the blond Slytherin. Draco Malfoy seemed to be screaming right back. She clapped her helmet on her head and struggled to get back into h
er saddle again. Looking annoyed, Draco helped her, appearing to be continuing to give her an earful. They were riding along again after he leapt effortlessly into his saddle, and then he saw Malfoy reach out and give Ginny\rquote 
s strawberry roan a great slap! on the rump.
\par 
\par Suddenly, the horse reared, while Ginny held onto the reins for dear life; then it was galloping as if running for its life, and Harry\rquote s view of her moved along with her. He could see how terrified she was, pulling at the reins to get the hors
e under control, but it still ran on, and now she was sinking her hands into the mane, horror distorting her features. Finally, the horse stopped abruptly, and he saw her body go flying from the saddle, and then her figure lying on the grass, her eyes clo
sed, her limbs splayed out around her.
\par 
\par Nooooo! his brained screamed.
\par 
\par He couldn\rquote t see Draco Malfoy anywhere near her. Harry couldn\rquote t take this. He stuffed the amulet into his pocket and ran into the stable; he started to move toward Ali Baba, but the anima
l backed away from him. Two other horses clearly recognized his agitation and moved to the backs of their stalls as well. When he came to Magic Man, however, he was able to open the stall and bring the animal out with no problem. He looked around for a sa
ddle, but didn\rquote t know where they were kept, or, indeed, even how to properly attach one to a horse. He gave up and led Magic Man out to the yard, using a mounting block to jump onto the horse\rquote 
s quivering back, holding onto his mane tightly with his fingers.
\par 
\par He held onto the horse tightly with his knees and pressed his heels into the horse\rquote s sides and told him, \'93C\rquote mon, boy. We\rquote ve got to find Ginny.\'94
 His voice shook, and when he smacked him smartly on the rump, as Malfoy had done with Ginny\rquote 
s horse, the horse abruptly galloped out of the stable yard and toward a large fence with a stile. Harry swallowed, his fingers holding the mane securely, his thighs already aching from gripping the horse\rquote 
s body with them. He stared grimly at the fence, an
d then a moment later, he felt the horse gathering himself to jump. When he did, it was amazingly like flying, Harry thought. They landed with a thud on the other side, and continued galloping across the paddock, Harry\rquote 
s teeth chattering in his head.
\par 
\par Harry wasn\rquote t sure how long he had looked for Ginny and how many miles he\rquote d ridden when he saw Malfoy\rquote 
s abandoned chestnut steed about a quarter-mile away in the next paddock. He clicked his tongue at Magic Man, who resumed galloping, and soon, Harry was jumpin
g over the fence into that paddock, feeling much more natural about this after the sixth or seventh time. Ginny was lying on the ground near the chestnut, not moving that he could see. He leapt onto the ground from his bareback mount and his tired, aching
 legs collapsed under him. He crawled to Ginny\rquote s side.
\par 
\par He took off her helmet and patted her cheeks gently. \'93Ginny! Ginny!\'94
\par 
\par She opened her eyes groggily, giving him a small smile when she saw him. \'93Harry,\'94 she said softly. \'93Oh, good. I seem to have fallen from my horse....\'94
\par 
\par She sounded delirious; he asked her desperately, \'93Do you think you\rquote ve broken anything? Does it hurt more in one place than another?\'94 He began feeling her limps gently, holding her wrist between his fingers, gently touching her knees, h
er ankles. She groaned.
\par 
\par \'93No,\'94 she managed to say. \'93I don\rquote t think I\rquote ve broken anything. I just ache all over. It is a good thing I had the helmet on, though. My head feels like it\rquote s exploding.\'94
\par 
\par He was afraid that meant she had concussion. He helped her to sit up; her back was covered in mud. \'93I think it was the damp ground that saved you,\'94
 he informed her, although he wondered how much of that was from her lying on the ground earlier with Draco Malfoy. He decided not to say anything about that. After all, she hadn\rquote t succumbed, clearly. When he\rquote 
d seen her in the amulet, on the out-of-control horse, it was from the front, so he hadn\rquote t known about the mud.
\par 
\par \'93Where\rquote s Malfoy, anyway? He\rquote s just left you here? Did he take your horse? His is still here.\'94
\par 
\par She shook her head. \'93I don\rquote t know where mine is. Ran off. He didn\rquote t want to waste time riding back for help, he said. He was going to Apparate to the lodge and bring Alicia back with her car.\'94
\par 
\par He helped her to stand, shakily. \'93I\rquote ll take you back. You can ride with me. That all right with you?\'94
\par 
\par She looked at him with her mouth open slightly, and it took all of his willpower not to pull her to him and start kissing her desperately; she looked like she might be having a similar thought. She swallowed.
\par 
\par \'93All right.\'94
\par 
\par He took out his wand and made a piece of earth rise up next to the horse, so he could use it as a mounting block. Ginny nervously stepped onto the raised earth. After leaping onto the horse\rquote 
s back, he reached down from his seat on Magic Man and put his hand around her wrist. \'93Hold onto my arm. Come on; I\rquote ll pull you up.\'94
\par 
\par \'93I don\rquote t know, Harry...\'94 she started to say, although she did hold his wrist, as he was already holding hers.
\par 
\par Suddenly, he\rquote d already pulled and cried \'93Accio Ginny!\'94 at the same time, to help it along, and now she straddled the horse, sitting behind Harry, one arm wrapped around his waist. \'93Hold on tight,\'94
 he told her, putting his wand away, so she put her other arm around him too.
\par 
\par \'93Harry,\'94 she said nervously, \'93This horse doesn\rquote t have a saddle!\'94
\par 
\par Harry urged Magic Man on and he started galloping across the damp earth, his hooves raising great clods of turf. Harry turned slightly and smiled at her. \'93You\rquote ve ridden a golden griffin without a saddle.\'94
\par 
\par She laughed and held him more tightly, leaning her head on his shoulder. \'93It was lovely, too,\'94 she said in his ear. \'93Much less bumpy.\'94
\par 
\par They rode back in silence; Harry loved the feel of her pressing against him, warm and solid and Ginny. She was all right, that was the important thing. He couldn\rquote t prevent the image he was seeing in his mind\rquote 
s eye, Ginny being thrown from the horse and lying on the cold, damp ground, so still....He\rquote d thought--he\rquote d thought the worst. And it would have been all Malfoy\rquote s fault, he seethed. But a
s they galloped on, and he felt her warm breath on his neck and her body pressed against his back and her arms around his waist, he calmed a bit. I\rquote ve got you, Ginny. You\rquote ll be all right now.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par Ginny was given a clean bill of health by the doctor
, who said she did not have concussion. She was to rest during the remainder of the day, however. Harry wanted to sit by her side in the drawing room, at her beck and call, but Draco Malfoy was doing that instead. Hermione and Ron had gone for a walk on t
he grounds, and he felt utterly superfluous.
\par 
\par Finally, the time came for them to leave for the stag party. Harry was not looking forward to this. He hadn\rquote t been able to talk to Roger when he\rquote d been fitted for his kilt, as Roger hadn\rquote t gone with them. (Mr. D
avies had taken them to London.) And Roger\rquote s cousin had been managing to avoid him as well. He knew he wouldn\rquote t get the opportunity to speak with them quietly during the evening\rquote 
s scheduled debauchery, and he was starting to feel more and more that the wedding should not go forward....
\par 
\par When he returned to the Spinnet estate with the others, as the only one who had decided not to drink (Even Ron had had a pint) he felt very restless, pacing back and forth in his room, thinking furiously, while Oliver snored
 loudly, grunting and making other noises occasionally which made Harry wince. Ron, at least, was sleeping quietly on the camp bed.
\par 
\par Near dawn, he finally fell asleep. When Ron woke him, the room was bright with late-morning sunshine, and his best friend was laughing at him. \'93Harry! Get up already! What\rquote s your excuse? I didn\rquote t see you drink anything last night.\'94

\par 
\par Harry rubbed his head. \'93It\rquote s a good thing, too. My head feels bad enough without adding alcohol.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, although I\rquote m a lowly guest and not a member of the wedding party, I\rquote ve been dispatched to get your lazy bum out of bed and see to it that you are arrayed in your Highland regalia for photographs. Everyone\rquote s waiting.\'94

\par 
\par \'93What time is it?\'94
\par 
\par Ron checked a carriage clock on the mantle. \'93Eleven. Workmen have been clearing all of the furniture out of the drawing room for three hours already. That\rquote s to be the ballroom. And a huge tent is being erected on the lawn for dining. You\rquote 
ve missed all the excitement.\'94
\par 
\par Harry swore. He didn\rquote t exactly agree with Ron\rquote s assessment. \'93The wedding isn\rquote t until four o\rquote clock! We\rquote re going to spend five hours taking photographs?\'94
\par 
\par \'93No,\'94 Ron said. \'93The groomsmen are going to be photographed, then eat lunch. After lunch, Alicia and the bridesmaids are going to have their hair and makeup done to be gorgeous, and then they\rquote 
ll be photographed. Then we all get into cars to go to Kettering. I\rquote m riding along with the musicians: Hermione and Ruth and Roger\rquote s cousin. He\rquote s a nice bloke. He\rquote ll be driving us.\'94
\par 
\par Harry said, \'93Hmph!\'94 but didn\rquote t elaborate. Somehow he managed to drag himself to the shower and then donned his gear for the wedding. It was the worst of b
oth worlds. He had a stiff white shirt front, white tie and tails, and an itchy wool kilt. It\rquote s the last Saturday in August! he thought, not for the first (Or last) time. Ron grinned when he saw him.
\par 
\par \'93I have to say, Harry. You don\rquote t look very happy.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yeah, well, maybe that\rquote s partly because I\rquote m wearing a wool kilt in August, but it\rquote s also partly because Alicia should not be marrying Roger Davies.\'94
\par 
\par Hermione knocked on the door, which was slightly ajar, and entered without waiting for permission. \'93What did you say about Alicia not marrying Roger?\'94
\par 
\par He had her lock the door and he told both of them about his conversation with Alicia the day before. Ron whistled. \'93I don\rquote t know, Harry. I\rquote d take that part about her torturing you and killing you very seriously. 
Girls can be completely irrational about wanting perfect weddings.\'94
\par 
\par Hermione bristled. \'93There\rquote s absolutely nothing irrational about it,\'94 she said stiffly. \'93Many girls start dreaming about their weddings when they\rquote re very young....\'94
\par 
\par \'93My point exactly,\'94 Ron said, rolling his eyes.
\par 
\par Harry started pacing again. \'93She\rquote s worried that something dreadful will happen if she doesn\rquote t go through with this--I\rquote m sure of it. How did she seem last night, Hermione?\'94
\par 
\par Hermione snorted. \'93You don\rquote t want to know.\'94
\par 
\par \'93No, I really do. Did she seem happy about the wedding?\'94
\par 
\par Hermione frowned. \'93Hard to tell. She became pissed very quickly and started telling old Quidditch stories. Oh. My. God. I thought the pair of you were bad about that. She kept saying to Angelina and Ginny and Katie, \lquote 
Remember that game against Hufflepuff when....Remember that game against Slytherin when....I don\rquote t know when I\rquote ve been more bored in my life. It almost drove me to drink.\'94
\par 
\par \'93You mean you didn\rquote t?\'94 Ron asked her, as though doubting this.
\par 
\par \'93Ronald Weasley! Of course I didn\rquote t.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yeah, well you had wine with your dinner, I noticed. Before you went out.\'94
\par 
\par \'93That is a glass of wine in a private home with a large meal. I\rquote ve also had wine with dinner when I\rquote 
m at home with my parents, on special occasions. That is hardly the same thing as ordering hard liquor in a public house at the age of sixteen. For one thing, the publican could get in a great deal of trouble.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Er,\'94 Harry said, before she could continue this diatribe, \'93How was the rest of the evening? When Alicia wasn\rquote t talking about Quidditch, I mean.\'94
\par 
\par Hermione started ticking off points on her fingers. \'93Well, let\rquote s see. Angelina must have had too much to drink before she left, because I didn\rquote t see her 
drink anything at the pub, but she kept running to the loo and spewing anyway. Yarrow kept complaining to me about her break-up with Fred--I really don\rquote t care for her--Cho didn\rquote 
t seem to drink anything, but she kept going on these crying jags and wanted to talk to me about Viktor. Erg. And then Katie....\'94
\par 
\par Harry frowned. \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par Hermione reddened. \'93Well, she was pretty pissed as well. She kept cornering me to talk about you.\'94
\par 
\par Ron raised an eyebrow. \'93Why?\'94
\par 
\par Hermione was growing redder by the second. \'93She, er...she wanted to compare notes, you might say.\'94
\par 
\par Now Harry felt his face grow warm. \'93Good Lord,\'94 he breathed. \'93You didn\rquote t--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Of course I didn\rquote t!\'94 she exclaimed, her voice a trifle squeaky. \'93I mean--that is the last conversation I want to have ever. Well, it\rquote s a draw. I didn\rquote t want to talk to Cho about Viktor, either.\'94 She sighed. \'93
That had to be one of the most uncomfortable nights of my entire life. Oh, and Ginny didn\rquote t help. She was being so silly--\'94
\par 
\par Ron looked alarmed. \'93You didn\rquote t let her drink, did you?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Of course I didn\rquote t, Ron! What do you take me for? No, she didn\rquote t need any help from alcohol; Alicia had given her some pain pills earlier, because of that fall she took yesterday. She had some more this morning. That\rquote 
s why she was being so giggly at breakfast. I\rquote m not sure what Alicia gave her, but I don\rquote t think she should have any more. How did the stag night go for you and the lads?\'94
\par 
\par Ron groaned. \'93Not much better than your outing. Let\rquote s see; Roger was pissed and kept calling everyone \lquote old boy;\rquote  
Fred and George kept trying to give muggles Canary Creams; and Harry and I had to keep intercepting them, so they wouldn\rquote 
t get in trouble. Lee was trying to sell the publican on carrying their product line, which, luckily, the man thought was a drunken rant. Actually, it was a drunken rant. Malfoy kept going on about how much money he used to have. You\rquote 
d think when he\rquote s drunk he\rquote d be improved, but he\rquote s just a bore. Percy eventually showed up and helped keep the twins in line, luckily. That was one good thing. And if there\rquote 
s one thing I can say for Perce, he can hold his liquor, although I think he had more than a pint. Let\rquote s see, what else....Oliver made a pass at the wife of a lorry driver, who threw a chair at his head. He must have weighed twenty-five sto
ne, this bloke....\'94
\par 
\par Hermione laughed. \'93And most of them had terrible headaches at breakfast this morning. Did you see Oliver? The way he winced when anyone made the slightest bit of noise? I\rquote m glad you two had the sense not to drink.\'94
\par 
\par It was Ron\rquote s turn to become slightly red; Harry had the feeling he wasn\rquote t going to tell her about having the one pint of stout.
\par 
\par \'93No strippers, then?\'94 Hermione asked suggestively.
\par 
\par \'93Not a one,\'94 Ron sighed. Hermione swatted him.
\par 
\par \'93You\rquote re not supposed to sound so disappointed.\'94
\par 
\par He grinned. \'93You\rquote re not supposed to be so gullible.\'94 That earned him another swat. He pretended it hurt.
\par 
\par Someone knocked on the door. \'93Ron! You were supposed to get Harry to come downstairs!\'94 It was Roger.
\par 
\par Harry strode to the door and opened it. \'93Sorry, Roger. Hermione was just telling me and Ron about the girls\rquote  night out.\'94
\par 
\par He raised his eyebrows, looking interested. \'93Oh? I haven\rquote t heard anything about it yet. Anything juicy?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Er, not really. If you want to hear Alicia go on for hours about Quidditch, just give her a little too much to drink. That\rquote s evidently the result.\'94
\par 
\par Roger grinned. \'93That\rquote s the result when she\rquote s with a pack of women,\'94 he said suggestively. Harry wondered again what Roger was holding over her head, but he seemed perfectly happy 
and jovial, getting ready to be married. If he was a Death Eater now, and somehow blackmailing Alicia into marrying him, it ironically had made him a much more pleasant person to be around. Harry didn\rquote t know what to think.
\par 
\par The afternoon sped by, and Harry thought he would go blind from the number of times he saw the camera\rquote s flash. Finally, at three o\rquote 
clock, they piled into cars to drive to Kettering. The church was bedecked with more flowers than Harry had ever seen. Everywhere he looked, he saw white roses surrounded by thistles and greens, and tartan ribbons hanging down from the arrangements.

\par 
\par Promptly at three-thirty, Hermione began playing her cello. Harry smiled, watching her. He sat in the front row with Roger, Fred, George, Lee, Oliver and Roger\rquote s father. Harry turned and saw Ron sitting several rows back on the bride\rquote 
s side with Percy; they were both watching her play, but Harry could see that Ron was following every movement she made. Much of the time, Percy was listening with his eyes closed, a p
lacid smile on his face. They looked rather foreign in their stiff formal clothes; Hermione had been admiring Ron in his before they left. Harry had never seen him look so adult. It was hard to equate with him with the eleven-year- old he'd met on the Hog
w
arts Express. Ron had been admiring Hermione's outfit as well; she was wearing what appeared to be a long silky purple dress, but she had given a little kick, showing them that the skirt was really very full trousers, allowing her to hold her cello easily
. The bodice was rather tight, with a low draped cowl and full, translucent elbow-length sleeves.
\par 
\par \'93Thank goodness I do not have to wear a bridesmaid dress,\'94 she had said, rolling her eyes. Harry hadn\rquote t seen the dresses; after his stint in front of the phot
ographer had ended, he had gone back up to his room for a nap. It was also clear that she was very pleased by Ron\rquote s reaction to her appearance (Which was, for lack of a better word, gawping).
\par 
\par Hermione and the singers took turns performing before the ceremony. In addition to Ruth and Roger\rquote 
s cousin, a baritone and alto from the church choir sang; the four performed several madrigals without accompaniment, their harmonies tight and perfect. Harry smiled when he heard Ruth\rquote s perfectly round tones; her clear, 
high voice was most easily heard of the four, and he almost found it possible to forget his other concerns as he listened.
\par 
\par Finally, Hermione and the singers sat in the pews and the organist began playing. Roger gestured to his groomsmen, and they all stood with him before the altar rail, looking to the back of the church. Harry had heard the guests entering, but he hadn
\rquote t realized how full the church was getting. The organ stopped suddenly, the priest entered and stood next to Roger, and someone opened the
 doors at the rear of the sanctuary. The organ started up again, a huge fanfare this time, and an older woman Harry now knew to be Ambrose Davies\rquote 
 sister (Mother of Buttercup) began walking down the aisle in a matronly dress the same shade as the thistles 
she carried amongst the white roses. Angelina followed, wearing a dress of the same colour, but a slightly different style. It appeared to have a halter top, although Harry couldn\rquote 
t tell very well by seeing it from the front. She wore a wreath of thistles 
on her hair. Katie followed, wearing the same wreath of thistles and a version of the same dress that was appropriate for her height, her tanned arms fully visible. Harry met her eyes for a moment, but she quickly looked away. Yarrow followed, tall and st
a
tely, then tiny Cho. Lastly, Harry saw Ginny walking down the aisle, dressed the same as the other girls, but somehow....Somehow it all looked so very different on her, Harry thought. Her arms were pale and freckled, not tan, her long red hair had been pu
l
led up into a loose arrangement on her head, topped by the thistles, but some long curls ornamented her bare shoulders, and her thistle wreath sat on her hair with a slightly rakish tilt, as though her hairpins had come loose. He thought it was possible t
hat she was holding her bouquet of roses and thistles upside down. But even though she wasn\rquote 
t perfect, he still could have looked at her all day. He thought the colour of the dress suited her far better than any of the other girls, although he knew he shouldn\rquote t tell anyone this.
\par 
\par The organist played yet another fanfare when Ginny finally joined the other bridesmaids, and then Alicia appeared in the doorway, on her father\rquote s arm. He was wearing very stiff-looking white tie and tails. And Alicia--
\par 
\par She looked like a princess, was the only thing Harry could think. His throat felt very tight as the guests all stood and watched her walk toward Roger Davies, the organ blaring deafeningly. Please, he prayed silently. Let it be all right.
\par 
\par The service didn\rquote t seem to last any time at all. At some point, Ruth stood to sing, and then Roger\rquote 
s cousin. In the blink of an eye, it seemed, Alicia and Roger were kissing and the organ was blaring again, and the happy couple was walking up the aisle, while the attendan
ts paired off behind them; Ambrose Davies with his sister Bronwen; Angelina with George (He knew it was George because he\rquote 
d started growing a mustache), Katie with Fred, Yarrow with Lee and Cho with Oliver. Suddenly, he realized that not only had Alicia re
done the pairings, but--but this left him walking up the aisle with Ginny. He shook as he held out his arm to her and she took it, holding up her dress a little with her right hand as they walked, so she wouldn\rquote 
t step on the hem. He tried to look straight ahead, but it was very difficult not to turn and stare at her.
\par 
\par The photographer had them pose for some more photographs with the bride and groom and wedding party outside the church. Three pairs of attendants were placed on each side of Alicia and Roger, 
and each groomsman was supposed to put his arm around his partner. Since their dresses had halters on top, the girls\rquote  backs were all bare from the neck to the waist. Harry put his hand on Ginny\rquote 
s smooth back while the photographer fiddled with his equipment; she looked up at him for a moment, shivering a little.
\par 
\par \'93Is my hand too cold?\'94 he whispered to her.
\par 
\par She shook her head. \'93No. No, it\rquote s--\'94 she bit her lip. \'93It\rquote s very nice,\'94 she said softly, turning to smile for the photographer. \'93I wish you didn\rquote t have to move it ever.\'94
\par 
\par Hearing her say that almost made him smile like a complete fool for the photo, but he managed to temper it a bit by the time the flash exploded in his face. After a few more shots, they piled into the cars to go back to the Spinnets\rquote  hou
se. Harry found himself in the same car with Ginny, Yarrow, Lee, Angelina and George. No ex-girlfriends of mine, he thought gratefully. Ginny was pressed against him from waist to knee, and he was trying not to think about this.
\par 
\par When they arrived at the house, they found that there were candles lining the drive, although it wasn\rquote 
t dark yet, and an enormous white tent on the lawn between the house and the stableyard with numerous servers bustling about. They were instructed to go into the drawing room and wait. Harry took Ginny\rquote 
s hand as she climbed the steps beside him. I will take advantage of touching her and being with her as much as I can today. I have a perfectly good excuse, as we\rquote re both attendants, so I might as well take advantage of that. Let Drac
o Malfoy try to tell him off for just doing his job. Let him try.
\par 
\par The orchestra was still tuning up; Alicia disappeared upstairs to touch up her make-up while the guests arrived. Harry fetched Ginny some punch and stood in a corner with her, just enjoying being near her.
\par 
\par \'93Didn\rquote t Hermione sound wonderful?\'94 she asked him. \'93And Ruth?\'94
\par 
\par He couldn\rquote t take his eyes off her. \'93You look beautiful, Ginny,\'94 he said softly. She smiled, turning a little pink.
\par 
\par \'93You look very dashing, you do. I know you\rquote re annoyed, but I think a kilt suits you. It really does.\'94
\par 
\par He grinned. \'93If you want me to wear a kilt every day for the rest of my life, I will.\'94
\par 
\par She laughed. \'93I may hold you to that!\'94
\par 
\par Finally, the orchestra was done tuning up and began playing in earnest. Harry watched nervously as George and Angelina and some other couples began taking to the floor, turning in circles, laughing and enjoying themselves.
\par 
\par \'93Would you--would you like to dance?\'94 he asked her, uncertain.
\par 
\par \'93Yes,\'94 she said simply, taking the hand he was holding out to her. And then he just knew that there was Ginny in his arms, and music, and Ginny\rquote s eyes close to his....
\par 
\par They remained on the floor for three songs, not even stopping between. Then suddenly, Harry felt a hand on his shoulder, and saw Ginny\rquote 
s face drain of colour. He turned and found Draco Malfoy, in immaculate formal clothes, his white shirt and tie roughly the same colour as Ginny\rquote s face at this moment.
\par 
\par \'93Thanks, Harry, but I think I can take it from here,\'94 he said between his teeth. There was a challenge in his voice.
\par 
\par \'93Ah,\'94 Harry said, trying not to squeak. \'93There you are. About time. Now I can go and dance with some of the girls who are actually available.\'94 When he said this, he felt dreadful, but it was necessary for Draco Malfoy\rquote 
s benefit. He nodded at Harry approvingly.
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s right. Just remember. This one\rquote s not.\'94
\par 
\par As he took Ginny in his arms, she raised her eyebrows at him. \'93Oh, that\rquote s nice. Talk about me like I\rquote m not here.\'94
\par 
\par But instead of acknowledging this remark, Draco Malfoy simply held her at arm\rquote s length, with a lascivious half-smile. \'93You look smashing,\'94 he breathed. She coloured, and looked down, as though she didn\rquote 
t want to be pleased about his saying this, especially in front of Harry. Harry cleared his throat.
\par 
\par \'93I kept telling her that, but you know women. If it\rquote s a bridesmaid\rquote s dress, they think it\rquote s automatically dreadful.\'94
\par 
\par Malfoy laughed. \'93True. C\rquote mon, then,\'94 he said to his girlfriend. \'93Are you still loopy on painkillers? Can you dance?\'94
\par 
\par She didn\rquote t comment on the painkillers. \'93I can dance.\'94
\par 
\par Harry walked to the edge of the dance floor, watching them. They actually moved very well together, he had to admit, and were probably the finest-looking couple on the floor, if one was being objective. (Malfoy\rquote 
s lucky he can wear proper formal clothes, Harry thought. With trousers).
\par 
\par He sighed. Watching Ginny with Malfoy for hours on end. This is going to be a very long night, he thought.
\par 
\par He was relieved when Ron and Hermione arrived.
\par 
\par Ron looked around the transformed drawing room, whistling. \'93Hey,\'94 he said suddenly. \'93In the car, Hermione and I were talking. Do you suppose they invited Fleur?\'94
\par 
\par Harry practically choked on his punch. \'93Er, I sincerely doubt it.\'94
\par 
\par Hermione shrugged. \'93Oh, you never know....\'94 But she didn\rquote t elaborate.
\par 
\par They kept him company for a while, chatting and drinking punch, but finally, Hermione dragged Ron out to the dance floor. Harry laughed at the expression on Ron\rquote s face, but that expression changed abruptly when
 he had his arms around her, holding her to him....
\par 
\par Several women Harry had never seen before boldly asked him to dance. He went along, going through the motions, constantly searching the dance floor for Ginny and Draco, who never seemed to sit down.
\par 
\par Finally, Roger and Alicia entered and had their first dance, and soon after, they were all ordered into the dining tent on the lawn, and ate the most complicated- looking, least filling, and, probably (Harry thought) the most expensive food he\rquote 
d ever had in his life. He listened with only half an ear to Ambrose Davies\rquote 
 toast to the newlyweds, sipping his champagne, wondering if it would make him drunk. Ginny sat by his side, his dinner partner, and he was startled when, at one point inexplicably eating with he
r fork in her left hand, she reached under the table and took his left hand in hers, where no one could see their joined hands. Harry\rquote 
s heart turned over and he squeezed her hand reassuringly. She gave him a small smile and went back to eating. We have to appreciate the small things, he thought. And take advantage of even the briefest opportunities.
\par 
\par After the cake was cut and passed round, they returned to the house for more dancing. By this time it was dusk, and a teal blue sky was starting to show a star
 here and there, while the candles lining the drive flickered like stars that had fallen to earth.
\par 
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione stood together, talking, and Remus Lupin saw them and joined in, sipping his champagne and looking around the dance floor a little wistfully. When they\rquote 
d been talking for a few minutes, Hermione waved at someone on the dance floor suddenly.
\par 
\par \'93Maggie! Professor Snape!\'94 she called.
\par 
\par Harry\rquote s jaw dropped. Snape was wearing white tie and tails, like the rest of the men, looking dashing enou
gh that many, many women in the room were giving him quite appreciative glances. Maggie walked by his side, as he strode over to them, smiling happily, her ecru gown clinging to her slim body, an asymmetrical hem making it possible for her to walk without
 being hobbled. Her short curly hair looked very cool, and long silver earrings just touched her shoulders.
\par 
\par Ron goggled at his older sister. \'93Look at you!\'94 he said in surprise. She laughed, eyes the same blue as Ron\rquote s positively sparkling.
\par 
\par \'93I could say the same thing. And you\rquote re supposed to be one of my little brothers?\'94 Harry realized, with a slight shock, that Ron and Snape were now the same height.
\par 
\par "Bear in mind that he wasn't even "Little" when he started school," Hermione said with a half-smile, look
ing up at him with an expression of clear admiration and affection. "And you two!" she said to her professor and his date. "It's so unbelievable that you met years ago and are together again! What are the chances of that?"
\par 
\par Maggie laughed. "How did you find out?"
\par 
\par Ron shuffled his feet. "Well, Ginny told me and Fred and George and Harry, and I told Hermione. Oh, Percy knows, too." He looked thoughtful for a second. "And I think he told Bill and Charlie and Mum and Dad. So that's everyone."
\par 
\par Maggie's eyes opened wide. "Goodness! At first I thought it would be difficult keeping so many family members up-to-date on what was going on in my life, but clearly that's the last thing I need to worry about."
\par 
\par Severus Snape turned to his date. \'93I forgot to inform you, my dear, that because you told your sister certain--things--it is now common knowledge that we first met six years ago.\'94
 He looked meaningfully at Harry. Harry suddenly had a better understanding of what Snape had meant when he'd said he wa
sn't looking for Annie Weasley for his sake; he was clearly doing it for Maggie's sake. His black eyes glittered with amusement, despite the ominous tone. Harry gave him a half smile.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, Severus, there\rquote s little harm in them knowing, is there?\'94
\par 
\par Hermione shook her head. \'93I still can\rquote t believe what a coincidence it was that you two met that way...\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh,\'94 Maggie said calmly, taking a sip of champagne from a flute she nicked from a passing server. \'93It wasn\rquote t a coincidence.\'94
\par 
\par Hermione frowned. Realization dawned on Harry.
\par 
\par \'93You knew. You knew you were going to meet him. So you asked for sailing lessons....\'94
\par 
\par She laughed again. \'93Full marks, Harry. Although I simply knew I was going to meet someone important in my life. I had a very, very strong premonition. An
d I had a dream about sailing on the Firth of Clyde. Mum and Dad were mystified about why I should specifically request sailing lessons there, of all places, when there were other possibilities that were closer to home. And when the summer was ending--" h
e
r voice became softer. "Even though I was sad that we were going off to our separate lives, I also had a very strong feeling that we would meet again." She seemed mesmerized by him for a moment, before shaking herself and smiling round at them all. "And I
 was right, wasn't I? I\rquote ll tell you the full story another time. Right now, I want to dance some more...\'94
 she said, putting down her drink and pulling their acquiescent Potions Master back to the dance floor, while they struggled to pick their jaws up off the floor. Harry turned to Remus Lupin, surprised to find him chuckling.
\par 
\par Then Ron cleared his throat and said, \'93Er--I need to talk to Remus about something. Why don\rquote t you two have a dance?\'94 he said to Harry and Hermione. \'93You haven\rquote t yet.\'94
\par 
\par So Harry and Hermione took to the dance floor, and after that, Alicia was tapping him on the shoulder.
\par 
\par \'93I haven\rquote t danced with all of the groomsmen yet,\'94 she informed him. Hermione relinquished him, going to find Ron, and Harry took the bride in his arms and they began to dance.
\par 
\par \'93Alicia, I--I don\rquote t think I\rquote ve ever seen a more beautiful bride,\'94 he told her quietly as they moved around the floor. She shrugged and blushed.
\par 
\par \'93All brides are beautiful,\'94 she said simply.
\par 
\par They danced for a few more minutes before he said, \'93Alicia--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Are you going to apologize for yesterday?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Sorry. I mean--no.\'94 He smiled. \'93Now I seem to be apologizing for not apologizing. No, I was going to say--it's a shame."
\par 
\par "What is?"
\par 
\par He held her so that his mouth was close to her ear and he didn't have to speak loudly. "That in years to come you won't remember this day as the day you married the man you love."
\par 
\par She backed up from him slightly, her eyes very large and frightened, but she continued to dance with him, perhaps aware of the fact that everyone was probably watching the bride to a certain extent.
\par 
\par "Harry--"
\par 
\par "Listen, Alicia," he interrupted her. "I know you think you're alone. But you're not. If you ever need someone to talk to--\'94 He swallowed. She looked up, but there was a cloud behind her eyes. \'93
What I mean is, I have some friends. Friends who could help you. If you need help. Of any kind. If you--if you ever feel you\rquote re having trouble coping on your own. Do you know what I mean?\'94
\par 
\par She was very quiet. Finally she lifted her eyes to his and said. \'93Yes, Harry. Thank you.\'94
\par 
\par The music ended and the dancers stood back and clapped politely. Roger strode over to his bride and said, \'93There you are!\'94 before leading her off somewhere. He didn\rquote 
t seem to notice Harry at all. The fearful look she gave Harry as she walked away with Roger gave him a very bad feeling in the pit of his stomach.
\par 
\par He hovered at the edge of the dance floor for some time, watching people who\rquote d had quite a bit of champagne continue to try to dance. Remus, Ron and Hermione seemed to have disappeared, and he didn\rquote 
t see Snape or Maggie, either. His head was buzzing a little, he had to admit. It wasn\rquote t unpleasant; and it tasted a lot better than that watered-down whiskey he\rquote d had in Snape\rquote s office....
\par 
\par \'93She comes on wings of vengeance.\'94
\par 
\par Harry froze. He wasn\rquote t sure whether the voice came from his head or from Sandy, concealed under his clothes. When he realized it was Sandy, he turned away from the crowd, so no one would see his lips moving, and said, \'93Well, that\rquote 
s very poetic of you, Sandy, but what the hell does that mean?\'94
\par 
\par No answer. He sighed. No, she wouldn\rquote t tell him, would she?
\par 
\par \'93All right, then,\'94 he said to her. \'93At least tell me--what should I do?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Go outside.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Huh?\'94
 He was startled, not really expecting an answer. He looked around, but no one was taking any notice of him. Of course, he thought, that meant someone probably was taking notice of him and writing down everything he said or did for yet another Daisy Furun
cle article. I\rquote ll just have to take my chances, he thought, as he strode to the curtained doorway to the entrance hall.
\par 
\par There were at least a dozen people in the entrance hall, standing in groups of twos and threes, chatting and laughing. Harry eyed them warily, wondering again what Sandy\rquote 
s prediction had meant, as he walked to the large arched door, which had been left open for air circulation. He walked through the doorway and stopped at the top of the steps leading down to the drive, hoping to catch a co
ol night breeze before he decided what to do next. However, the still summer night offered him no respite from the oppressive warmth of the bodies on the dance floor inside the house.
\par 
\par He looked down the gravel drive with its candles, and then he saw her, 
a lone figure walking toward the house in robes so pale they seemed to shine with their own light. As she came closer and closer, Harry recognized her, and realized that what he thought was a cape was her hair streaming out behind her. She stopped and gaz
ed up at the house, gay with laughter and merriment, music floating on the night air. She didn\rquote 
t seem to notice Harry, but was looking up above him, at the second floor of the house. When Harry looked up too, he saw that Roger and Alicia were on the balcony above the front door, standing very close together.
\par 
\par Just then, Hermione and Ron practically plowed into him. They were out of breath; Ron\rquote s eyes had a wild look to them, with that red light Harry was still getting used to.
\par 
\par \'93Harry!\'94 he whispered fiercely, looking up at the balcony quickly. \'93I\rquote ve got something very important to tell you. You--you know, don\rquote t you, that I can hear really well now, right? Well, I heard Roger and Alicia talking, and you won
\rquote t believe it! I already told Hermione, and she thinks--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Not now,\'94 Harry interrupted him, nodding at the figure standing in the drive. Ron turned, his jaw dropping. On his other side, Harry was aware of Hermione stiffening and clutching at his arm.
\par 
\par Harry looked back at the pale figure; she seemed nominall
y to be a beautiful woman, the same as ever, but there was a fire in her enormous blue eyes that both mesmerized and terrified him. Her sheet of long, silvery blond hair started whipping behind her in an unseen wind. He could hear the orchestra\rquote 
s music behind him still, but suddenly it sounded as though all of the instruments were out of tune, as though every note were somehow being distorted into a misshapen, warped cacophony. Her skin shone like the moon, and when she lifted her hands--
\par 
\par The three of them
 gasped. It appeared that she was holding a ball of fire in each hand. Her face elongated and her nose and mouth seemed to merge into a long, sharp, cruel beak. The candles that had lined the gravel drive started to shake, and then they rose into the air,
 floating in frantic circles around her. Harry could feel Hermione shaking as she gripped his arm harder. He glanced at Ron, who looked horrified.
\par 
\par \'93Harry! Look!\'94 Ron said now. Harry turned again and saw that enormous wings were unfolding from her shoulders; they seemed to have ripped through the fabric of her diaphanous white robes. They weren\rquote t angel\rquote s wings though; they weren
\rquote t something from a greeting card or Sunday School book. They were green and scaly, like dragon\rquote s wings, shining in the light from t
he candles and the fire in her hands. As they unfolded, Harry gasped. Her gaze did not waver from the second floor balcony.
\par 
\par \'93So,\'94 Ron said in a strangled voice, \'93Fleur decided to come.\'94 He was clearly attempting to seem lighthearted, but he sounded too terrified for it to be convincing. \'93We wondered whether she would,\'94
 he added, his voice going a bit squeaky now. Harry nodded dumbly, looking at the spectacle before them, and keeping a sharp eye on the floating candles, which were starting to whirl even faster.
\par 
\par She lifted her hands with their balls of fire and a sudden wind arose, making the pale robes whip around her legs. Now the ribbons and flowers that had adorned the railings flanking the steps went flying free, swirling around her, some getting caught
 on her wings momentarily before blowing about again. Ron, Harry and Hermione were all holding onto each other tightly as the gale grew stronger, and they had to screw up their eyes, squinting into the wind. Hermione\rquote 
s hair was blowing in her face, and Har
ry was thinking that a kilt was really the last thing he wanted to be wearing right now. Fleur Delacour continued to stand at the center of the maelstrom, an electric crackling emanating from her now, her eyes completely blue, no trace of white or black i
n them as she gazed malevolently at the balcony.
\par 
\par Hermione leaned toward both Ron and Harry so they could hear her. \'93I think,\'94 she cried above the howl of the wind, \'93That Fleur may have a little bone to pick with Roger!\'94

\par Hermione shook her head. \'93I know you love Quidditch, Harry, but it is just a game. They were hired to do a job and they did it. This--this isn\rquote t a game or a job to Fleur. This is her life.\'94
\par 
\par Snape and Maggie appeared behind them with Remus Lupin, all of them shielding their faces from the flying debris and the scouring wind. Percy and Katie staggered outside as well, followed by Lee and Fred. Harry wasn\rquote 
t sure whether Ron had heard what Hermione had said; his best friend turned to Remus and yelled above the wind, \'93What do you reckon? Between the two of us, could we calm her down?\'94
 Harry assumed he intended to use some of the calming techniques Remus had been teaching Ron.
\par 
\par The older werewolf looked at the fierce creature before them. \'93We need to be very careful,\'94 he shouted back at Ron. \'93Don\rquote t antagonize her further.\'94 Ron nodded and Harry wasn\rquote 
t sure what they planned to do, but he hoped they would do it soon.
\par 
\par But before any of them knew what was happening, Alicia screamed, ducking, as a ball of flame hurled by Fleur narrowly missed her, hitting instead the 
curtains hanging just inside the French doors that opened onto the balcony where she and Roger stood. Roger sprayed water at the flaming curtains with his wand, screaming to Alicia to get inside.
\par 
\par \'93No!\'94 Alicia responded rebelliously. She joined him in putting out the fire, her carefully-arranged blonde hair flying free, grim determination on her face.
\par 
\par \'93It\rquote s you she\rquote s after!\'94 Roger bellowed at her. Alicia responded by pointing her wand at Fleur.
\par 
\par It was Roger\rquote s turn to scream, \'93No!\'94 He tackled Alicia and pushed her to the floor of the balcony; they were out of sight now, behind the heavy stone balustrade. Harry couldn\rquote 
t decide whether Roger had been protecting Alicia or Fleur. Hermione was biting her lip, looking up at the balcony. Ron turned to Remus.
\par 
\par \'93We\rquote d better move quickly!\'94 Ron said.
\par 
\par Remus looked at Fleur, swallowing. \'93Don\rquote t startle her!\'94 he warned Ron. Harry had thought Hermione and Maggie had heard what Ron and Remus had been discussing, but when the two werewolves--or more 
specifically, Ron--started toward Fleur, Harry and Snape had to restrain them. Percy and Fred looked poised to dive after their brother as well; they wavered, evidently torn between trusting in his abilities and continuing to treat him as their baby broth
er.
\par 
\par Both Hermione and Maggie were crying, \'93Ron!\'94 Snape held his date around the waist to restrain her; Harry had his arms around Hermione\rquote s torso, pinning her arms to her sides.
\par 
\par He shouted at Snape, \'93Maggie should get inside. We need someone to distract the Muggles and keep them away from the windows and doors.\'94
\par 
\par Percy\rquote s jaw was clenched. \'93I\rquote ll go to the Ministry for help.\'94
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote ll go with you,\'94 Katie said unexpectedly. They Disapparated with a double pop! Harry saw Ron and Remus moving their lips, speaking to Fleur, their faces pleading, but he couldn\rquote 
t hear any of it. His head was buzzing with the champagne he\rquote d had earlier.
\par 
\par \'93Where\rquote s Dumbledore?\'94 Harry asked Snape. \'93I thought I saw him somewhere in the back of the church--\'94
\par 
\par \'93He had--business to attend to,\'94 Snape said clearly above the now-constant howl of the wind. \'93I know where he is. I\rquote ll go.\'94
 He too Disapparated. Fred and Lee dragged Maggie inside, glancing over their shoulders at Ron, who stood tall and determined, facing Fleur Delacour. Harry heard F
red and Lee close the front door with some effort, because of the wind; he continued to hold Hermione, but he was having a very hard time keeping her in check. His muscles were feeling the strain. He tried to calm her down before she broke free and did so
mething brave but stupid.
\par 
\par \'93Give them a chance!\'94 he shouted in her ear. \'93Please!\'94 he begged her now. \'93You know they\rquote re safer than the rest of us. It\rquote s harder for her to hurt them.\'94
\par 
\par She sagged against him, sobbing. He turned her to face him, holding her tig
htly as she buried her face in his chest; he patted her back and attempted to smooth her wild hair with his other hand. It was very difficult, however, to calm someone else when his own heart was going a mile a minute, and when he could see over her head 
that Ron and Remus did not seem to be having any luck.
\par 
\par Fleur rose into the air, her enormous wings moving effortlessly. She flung a ball of fire at Remus Lupin, who stepped nimbly to the side, avoiding it. Harry thought he said, \'93I can do that too! Look.\'94 
It was hard to tell; Harry had to read his lips. Suddenly, Remus was also holding fire in each hand. Harry remembered him casually conjuring up fire at a moment\rquote s notice the first time he met him, on the Hogwarts Express.
\par 
\par But although Remus Lupin\rquote s face was not angry and he wasn\rquote 
t hurling the fire at her, she recoiled and pointed at him with the hand that had hurled the fire at Alicia. Suddenly, he was flying backwards at a tremendous speed, disappearing into the night, over the hedges and paddocks, his hands still flaming....

\par 
\par Harry caught his breath and the sound made Hermione turn. Ron faced Fleur alone now. Evidently, he decided that talk wasn\rquote t enough, having seen what happened to Remus, and he pulled out his wand. Harry couldn\rquote t hear the spell, but a 
crackling red light was emitted from the wand, only to be deflected by the Veela wings, which evidently were a great deal like dragon wings.
\par 
\par Fleur now turned on Ron, who still stood his ground. She pointed, and now, he too was flying backwards over the landscape, the banishing charm quickly making him disappear from sight.
\par 
\par Hermione screamed his name and broke loose from Harry, running in the direction Ron had gone. Harry stood alone on the steps, facing Fleur. He didn\rquote 
t know if Roger and Alicia were still up on the balcony. I have to get this right, he thought nervously, remembering the gang of dragon-handlers that had been necessary to subdue 
the Hungarian Horntail; then there was the conjunctivitis charm which Krum had used on his dragon in the Triwizard Tournament, hitting it where it was most vulnerable: the eye. At least her entire body doesn\rquote 
t have dragon scales, he thought. As long as I miss the wings I should be fine.
\par 
\par His head throbbed as he cried, \'93Stupefy!\'94 He pointed at her mid-section, trying to keep his hand from shaking, but behind him, someone else had simultaneously called out a warning.
\par 
\par \'93Watch out!\'94
\par 
\par She moved even as Harry\rquote s spell was traveling toward her, the wings again deflecting the spell. Harry swore, turning to see who had shouted the warning.
\par 
\par It was Roger Davies.
\par 
\par \'93You!\'94
\par 
\par \'93Get out of here, Potter! This doesn\rquote t concern you!\'94
\par 
\par \'93I think it does, when she starts attacking my friends!\'94
\par 
\par \'93They shouldn\rquote t have tried to--\'94
\par 
\par \'93What the hell is going on?\'94 Harry demanded of him, interrupting. The magical storm swirled noisily around them. Roger Davies set his jaw and did not reply. Alicia stood behind him, Harry saw now. He didn\rquote t kn
ow whether they had Apparated down from the balcony, and he didn\rquote t care. This doesn\rquote t make any sense. \'93She tried to kill your wife!\'94 he screamed at Roger.
\par 
\par \'93Harry!\'94 Someone to his right had called his name, the sound almost disappearing in the storm. He turned to see Ginny and Draco tearing around the corner of the house, fighting against the buffeting wind. Evidently, they hadn\rquote 
t been inside when Fleur had arrived, so they weren\rquote t shut up with the rest of the guests. Draco Malfoy was the one who had screamed his name.
\par 
\par \'93What\rquote s going on?\'94 Ginny cried, when they had reached the steps; she looked at Fleur fearfully, shivering. The wind whipped her hair and the skirt of her dress; Harry immediately shrugged off his jacket and wrapped it around Ginny\rquote 
s bare back, thinking that Alicia obviously hadn\rquote t reckoned on this happening when she selected halter dresses for her bridesmaids. Draco grimaced, as though he wished he\rquote d thought of giving her his jacket, but he didn\rquote 
t say anything. Ginny slid her arms into the sle
eves and then wrapped her arms around her middle while Harry told them what had happened to Ron and Remus. As soon as the words were out of his mouth, without warning, Ginny turned and ran toward Fleur, her hair completely undone now, flying wildly around
 her head like a russet storm cloud. She pulled her wand from a holster on her leg and pointed it at Fleur, but she had no time to utter an incantation before a ball of flame was flying toward her.
\par 
\par \'93No!\'94 Harry cried, running and diving for her. He knocked 
her to the ground, but the ball of flame hit him in the back, instead; she screamed as she fell, the sound filling his brain as the pain from the ball of fire exploded within him. He felt like a hundred Cruciatus Curses were being put on just his back. Th
e pain was mind-numbing, but with an enormous wrench, he focused, and then he was rising up, up and out of his body, away from the pain, and he could look down and see himself, see his shirt burning away, see Ginny\rquote 
s mouth open in a silent, horrified scream. His body was atop hers still, shielding her.
\par 
\par Harry could see everything with perfect clarity. Draco Malfoy was slowly pulling out his wand and Roger Davies was dragging on his arm 
and shouting at him soundlessly, all in slow motion. As if moving underwater, Draco pulled his fist back, then moved it forward again, excruciatingly slowly, his knuckles finally smashing into Roger Davies\rquote 
 jaw. Inch by inch, Roger flew backwards, colliding with Alicia, who was knocked down very gradually, her new husband on top of her, holding his jaw and glaring at his attacker.
\par 
\par Harry saw that his shirt was in burnt tatters and that his back was covered in ugly burns. There were no longer flames on his b
ack, though, and his kilt was intact. Still, Ginny knelt by his side, tears streaming down her face, so slowly, so slowly, that he could see each one. It all seemed to be happening so slowly....
\par 
\par He saw Draco Malfoy\rquote s face then, saw the raw fury as he pointed his wand at Fleur, his eyes grey as steel and yet afire. Fleur\rquote 
s hand held another ball of fire, and she was once more aiming at Harry. If she hits me again.... Harry wondered how long it would take for him to die....
\par 
\par As the fire left her hand, Draco Malfoy blasted it out of the air, and corkscrew tongues of fire came showering down from the sky, very small and relatively harmless now. Malfoy had prevented the fire from reaching Harry.
\par 
\par Draco\rquote s lips were moving, and at first Harry thought he was saying
 his name again, but then he realized that it was that curse. Roger Davies was slowly getting to his feet, but he disarmed Draco Malfoy too late; the spell was cast. The blond boy went slowly flying back against a porch pillar as his wand floated toward R
oger. However, he only seemed to be winded, and promptly launched himself at the groom, and the two of them tumbled languidly down the steps, locked together, even as Draco\rquote 
s spell was having its effect on Fleur. Harry looked down on the shriveled skin that was his own back, thinking, No, Draco. Not that....not that curse....\'94
\par 
\par For Draco Malfoy\rquote s aim had been true. Fleur convulsed when the curse hit her, and, in mid-air, she changed to her human appearance again. Roger and Draco could not see it, as they wer
e rolling over and over on the ground. But Harry could see it; like film being run slowly backwards, her face metamorphosed back into the woman he had first seen three years earlier, her wings folded and diminished until they were completely gone, and the
n he saw her fall, fall, fall....
\par 
\par She seemed to lie there forever, and Harry feared the worst, but then she lifted her head, her eyes still utterly blue, and as she knelt, Harry had a horrible premonition of what she was going to do. He remembered what thi
s was like, the sensation of being appalled by his own actions, even as he was unable to stop himself....
\par 
\par She knelt and, with a slow grace, raised her small, white hands, positioned to hold an invisible knife-handle; she brought her hands down, as though 
the blade on her unseen knife had sliced into her abdomen; she moved her hands across her body, performing a perfect pantomime of the grisly ritual, her face dripping with perspiration, and every movement slow, so agonizingly slow and drawn-out--although 
Harry knew that for her, it was happening impossibly quickly. She put down the imaginary blade and continued the pantomime, pretending to remove her own insides, to disembowel herself, continuing the morbid play....
\par 
\par Then she started screaming. She opened h
er mouth wide, her eyes horrified; she hardly seemed to have a moment for breathing. Harry was not sorry he could not hear her. She looked to be in more pain than anyone Harry had ever seen, her face reddening as the screaming went on, and on, and on....F
inally, she stopped and collapsed on the ground, and Harry remembered that Karkaroff had blacked out when Draco Malfoy had put the same curse on him.
\par 
\par Roger Davies and Draco Malfoy were still locked in their slow-motion combat, occasionally landing blows on
 each other, no wands in sight, while Alicia stood nearby, pointing her wand at the pair of them, but casting no spell. Gradually, Harry saw Roger escape from Draco\rquote 
s grasp, and, as though moving underwater, run to Fleur. He held her limp body in his arms, while Alicia lowered her wand and stared at him, her husband, crying over his former girlfriend. Her face was inscrutable.
\par 
\par And then all at once, there were people: Snape, and Dumbledore, and Percy and Katie and some Aurors he didn\rquote t recognize all suddenly appeared. A wizarding ambulance popped! into existence on the Spinnets\rquote 
 lawn; it seemed sudden even to Harry, so he knew it was in the blink of an eye for the others. Ron and Remus and Hermione came running around the corner of the house and headed strai
ght for him and Ginny. People were suddenly everywhere; milling in groups; talking to Draco Malfoy, who was waving his arms wildly; hovering over Fleur, who was still in Roger\rquote 
s arms; looking at the burnt skin on his back, trying to revive him. He looked down at the chaotic scene dispassionately, thinking about what to do next.
\par 
\par Go back.
\par 
\par It was a very logical-sounding voice, like the voice at the back of his head that had questioned why he should jump on the desk, the first time the Imperius Curse had been placed on him.
\par 
\par No, he thought at the voice. It will hurt.
\par 
\par Life is pain. You know this. You can\rquote t refuse to go back much longer.
\par 
\par Why?
\par 
\par If you wait too long, you won\rquote t be able to go back....
\par 
\par Not go back.
\par 
\par In some ways, it was tempting, so very tempting....He felt light and free and utterly without pain, emotional or physical. He could never feel pain again, could he? Or have his heart broken....
\par 
\par He looked down at Ginny, crying and shouting at him to wake, he assumed. Not true, he thought. I can still feel enough to not want to hurt her that way, to not want to abandon her....
\par 
\par He made himself sink down again into his body, knowing that the pain that would greet him would be astronomical, knowing that it might be too much to bear. I\rquote ve borne the pain of Cruciatus, he reminded himself. I\rquote 
ve received the Dark Mark. He wasn\rquote t ready yet to give up, ready to say that he was too tired to continue, to shoulder on. He still had so much to do....
\par 
\par The second his mind and body and soul were one agai
n, the messages being sent to his brain from the nerve-endings in his back caused him to howl in pain so loudly that it made his throat raw, but he could see, even in the midst of his pain, that Ginny was smiling and laughing hysterically through her tear
s.
\par 
\par \'93He\rquote s alive!\'94
 she screamed to whomever was nearby, clearly having doubted it. The ambulance workers pushed her away, as well as Ron, Hermione and Remus. He saw Draco Malfoy take Ginny in his arms, while she sobbed on him uncontrollably, still wearing Harry\rquote 
s jacket, and the pain continued to push on Harry\rquote s brain relentlessly, regardless of the ministrations of the mediwizards; the burns turned every neuron he had into a pain receptor, lighting up his entire mind with more agony than he\rquote 
d ever experience
d. He looked up at Ginny and Draco again, gasping when he saw that Draco Malfoy had transformed into an enormous black dragon, breathing fire at Ginny...she would be engulfed in flames....But a second before the flames reached her, he blinked, and saw tha
t they were both human again, holding each other desperately, and that reasonable voice in the back of his mind said, You\rquote re just hallucinating from the pain.
\par 
\par Right, he said to the voice. So make it stop.
\par 
\par His mind was too overwhelmed, and he couldn\rquote t withstand the temptation to escape again, through more conventional means this time....
\par 
\par Everything went black.
\par 
\par * * * * *
\par 
\par Harry thought that he had perhaps made a mistake; maybe he had died. Was this heaven? he thought. It looked like no other place he\rquote d ever been.
\par 
\par He had awoken to find himself lying on his stomach in a huge bed with an elaborately-carved headboard and heavy-looking brocade hangings. Raising himself slightly and looking around the room, he saw lush Persian carpets, gilded cornices and pictur
e frames, brocade- upholstered sofas and chairs around the walls, a crystal chandelier and huge French doors which seemed to open onto a balcony; it all came into focus when he put on his glasses, which someone had considerately left on a marble-topped ta
ble next to the bed.
\par 
\par It was an overcast day, but candles in sconces all around the room cast a warm glow on everything. He\rquote 
d never been in such a rich-looking room in his life. Since the illumination was candles, not electric lights, he assumed that he was in a wizarding house. The artwork was all still-lifes and landscapes, so there were no moving people, but when he squinte
d
 at a painting above the mantel, opposite the bed, he saw that a light breeze was blowing the marsh grasses depicted therein, and that the clouds in the painted sky were drifting ever so subtly across the expanse of blue. Now this, he thought, is my idea 
of a room in a castle. He actually liked the homespun simplicity of Ascog Castle, but this room definitely seemed to be more deserving of the \'93castle\'94 moniker. It might even be a room in a palace, he realized.
\par 
\par He tried to turn over onto his back, and immediately discovered why he\rquote d been sleeping on his stomach; the pain made him sit bolt upright, sweating profusely. Mental note, he thought; don\rquote t do that again.
\par 
\par He swung his legs over the side of the bed and landed on a soft carpet, his toes sinking into it
s luxurious depths. In a far corner of the huge room was an oversized mirror, as big as the Mirror of Erised; Harry walked to it, his knees shaking. He saw immediately that it was an ordinary mirror and that he was the same as ever, for the most part. His
 chest was bare and he wore striped silk pajama trousers which were a couple of inches too short. He ran his fingers through his hair and over the stubble on his cheeks and chin; there would be time for grooming later.
\par 
\par \'93If you need a shave, the en suite bath is on the other side of the room,\'94
 the mirror informed him helpfully. He blinked, having forgotten that wizarding mirrors spoke, after spending a week back in the muggle world. How soon we forget. He turned and saw an open door on the far side of the ro
om; the limited view he had of the fixtures within made him think it was probably on a par with the prefects\rquote  bath at Hogwarts. All he could see was beige marble.
\par 
\par \'93Thanks,\'94 he said to the mirror. \'93Maybe later.\'94
\par 
\par Then he turned and looked over his shoulder
 at the reflection of his back; there was one enormous piece of cloth somehow adhered to the skin. He assumed that there was some kind of poultice under it, but while the poultice may have been generating new skin for him, it was certainly doing nothing f
or his pain. He turned again to face his reflection, wondering, Where am I?
\par 
\par Harry touched his scar tentatively; it hadn\rquote t hurt since the day Diagon Alley had been attacked and he\rquote d gone down in the pool at Ascog. He\rquote d seen in the news that there had been s
ome scattered Death Eater activity, but nothing in which Voldemort himself had been directly involved. He moved his hand down to reflexively to finger the basilisk amulet hanging around his neck, feeling a warmth and calmness seep into him as he did so. H
e
 closed his eyes and saw Ginny in the kitchen at the Burrow, kissing her mother on the cheek and then stepping toward the fireplace. Ron stepped into view then; from the mantel, he took down the flower pot where they kept the Floo powder and held it out t
o his sister....
\par 
\par Wait a minute, he thought, releasing the amulet, then taking it off and holding it by the chain, staring at the silver metal. This was in my pocket. Who put it around my neck? he wondered. In the chaos that followed Ginny\rquote s riding accident
, and then the wedding and Fleur, he hadn\rquote t given it back to her. He\rquote d continued to carry it around, not trusting himself to wear it, waiting for a good opportunity to give it to her. (He\rquote 
d probably had several opportunities after returning to the Spinnet house from the church, he realized, before Draco Malfoy had arrived, but he\rquote d been intoxicated with her company and had completely forgotten).
\par 
\par He wandered back to the bed with it, wondering, but just then a tapestry in the corner started moving and a door
 concealed behind it started creaking open; he dove for the bed, shoving the amulet under his pillow and sitting up in the middle of the mattress (his back not making contact with anything), clasping the blankets around his waist as he waited to see who w
as entering (without knocking, he thought irritably).
\par 
\par He was surprised; it was two of the doctors he\rquote d seen when he and Hermione had visited the Diagon Alley casualties. He couldn\rquote t remember their names. The man had short red hair (He was the one who had b
een berating his colleague for not reading his monograph). With him was the blonde witch whom Harry had also seen talking to Narcissa Malfoy at the Quidditch match, the Harpies\rquote  team physician.
\par 
\par The doctors seemed surprised to see him awake. \'93Well! You\rquote re looking somewhat improved, I see,\'94 the wizard said to Harry. \'93Told you my burn poultice was the way to go,\'94
 he muttered to his colleague, making notes on a piece of parchment attached to a clipboard. She was carrying an armful of file folders, much as when Harry and Hermione had seen her. Her mouth twisted.
\par 
\par \'93Yes, yes, you were right,\'94 she said, as though admitting this left a very poor taste in her mouth. As before, they were both wearing peach-colored robes and matching pointed hats. This time, however, h
er hair was down from its bun, resting in golden curls on her shoulders. She took spectacles from her pocket and placed them across her nose with its little jog and looked down at the top file she was holding.
\par 
\par \'93At six-hundred hours he was still running a slight fever and his pulse was sluggish,\'94 she announced. Looking up, she eyed him critically. \'93Looks like that\rquote s probably passed. We shall see.\'94
\par 
\par She placed her pile of folders on an ornate gilded chair and withdrew her wand from her robe pocket. Standing next to Harry, she placed her hand on his brow, which startled him; most people didn\rquote 
t walk up to him and just start touching his scar. Perfunctorily, as though it were in the way, she picked up his right hand. Harry looked down at his arm, but then he tur
ned his head and saw that there was nothing on his left arm, and he immediately panicked.
\par 
\par \'93My snake!\'94
\par 
\par She put his right hand down. Both doctors looked at him quizzically. \'93Excuse me?\'94 the red-haired wizard asked, his round face very pale.
\par 
\par \'93I--I have a snake. She\rquote s green, about twenty inches long. I usually wear her wrapped around my left arm. I was wearing her when--when I was burned--\'94 He swallowed. Sandy had to be all right...
\par 
\par The witch nodded. \'93The snake was removed in the ambulance,\'94 she said, as though Sandy were a boil or an unsightly mole. \'93If you wish to have it again--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Her! She\rquote s--I talk to her. She\rquote s not an it.\'94
\par 
\par They looked at each other, eyebrows raised. Harry grimaced. Oh, lovely. Now I\rquote m a raving lunatic to them.
\par 
\par \'93You don\rquote t understand. I\rquote m a Parselmouth,\'94 he explained. \'93Sandy and I--her name is Sandy--we have conversations. She\rquote s not really a pet. She\rquote s a friend.\'94
\par 
\par But if he thought that was going to make them more understanding, he was sadly mistaken. \'93A Parselmouth!\'94 the wizard said, going even paler. The witch looked at Harry very suspiciously. He was glad he didn\rquote 
t tell them that snakes had the Sight.
\par 
\par \'93Can we get on with it? Your snake is safe. She will be returned to you before you leave.\'94 She lifted his right hand again and placed the point of her wand under his arm, making him recoil and giggle in what he felt was a very undignified way.

\par 
\par \'93Sorry,\'94 he said, trying not to laugh any more. \'93That tickles.\'94
\par 
\par She frowned at him and he tried not to flinch this time when she placed the tip of her wand in his armpit. To his surprise, numbers began to appear on the handle.
\par 
\par \'93I didn\rquote t know you could use a wand like a thermometer,\'94 he said, trying to be conversational. She withdrew the wand and looked at the numbers as though he hadn\rquote t said anything.
\par 
\par \'93Normal,\'94 she announced to the other doctor, who was writing with a long green quill that appeared to have come from a parrot. Then she suddenly looked at him and said, \'93I think I liked you better when you were unconscious.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Anderssen....\'94
 the other doctor said in a warning voice. Harry turned and looked at her again. Seeing her at close range like this, a thought was struggling to swim up from the depths of his confused memories of two lives....That was it! He knew who she was now!
\par 
\par \'93Nita?\'94 he said to her tentatively. She jerked her head up and glared at him suspiciously.
\par 
\par \'93How do you know my name?\'94 she demanded suddenly. Then he realized he shouldn\rquote t have done that.
\par 
\par \'93Er, I know Draco. Your cousin.\'94
\par 
\par She looked less suspicious now, but no more friendly. \'93Ah, yes. The one who knows nothing about family loyalty.\'94
\par 
\par The other doctor was the one glaring now, but at her, not Harry. \'93I\rquote ll excuse myself now, if you don\rquote t mind, Anderssen. Don\rquote t forget that meeting,\'94
 he added, tapping his watch and raising his eyebrows. He looked at Harry for a moment as though he was concerned, but it didn\rquote t keep him from leaving.
\par 
\par Harry turned to her, bristling. \'93Draco doesn\rquote t know about family loyalty because he helped put his dad away?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Why else? And thanks to him, my poor Aunt Cissy is just that--poor. She\rquote s been living with me ever since Uncle Lucius went to prison.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, maybe she should ask whoever lives here about making a contribution to the Narcissa Malfoy Rich and Idle Fund,\'94 he said, waving his arms at the opulent room. \'93Obviously no expense was spared in the creation of this place...\'94
\par 
\par She went red with fury now. \'93How dare you!\'94
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94 he said, truly bewildered. \'93I appreciate that someone opened his home to me and arranged for doctors from St. Mungo\rquote s to come see me and all, but--\'94
\par 
\par \'93This is not a private home,\'94 she said between gritted teeth. He stared.
\par 
\par \'93Oh. Are we at Hogwarts?\'94 He wondered whether it was some elaborate, seldom-used chamber for state dignitaries. It turned out he wasn\rquote t far off the mark.
\par 
\par \'93No. We are at St. Mungo\rquote s.\'94
\par 
\par He frowned at her now. \'93No, we\rquote re not. I\rquote ve been to St. Mungo\rquote s, and this is definitely not St. Mungo\rquote s.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh really?\'94 she answered, crossing her arms, her wand still in hand. She looked over her spectacles at him. \'93Take a look, if you don\rquote t believe me.\'94
\par 
\par He rose slowly and made his way to the door; he was surprised how heavy the tapestry was that he had to push out of the way. When he put his head out of the room, there were the same long, high Gothic corridors he\rquote 
d passed through when he and Hermione had visited St. Mungo\rquote s. He saw the same wimpled nurses and bored-looking orderlies, going about their business. He pulled his head back into his room, looked around and then peered 
into the corridor again, in case it was some sort of portal, like the doorways at the Ministry of Magic. Finally, he closed the door and returned to his bed.
\par 
\par \'93I don\rquote t understand. Why is this here?\'94
\par 
\par She waved her hands. \'93You were brought to the Minister\rquote s room. Not my decision, but you know how some people are. Harry Potter is in hospital, we must take him to the Minister\rquote s room--\'94 she said in a snide, high-pitched voice.
\par 
\par He frowned. \'93The Minister\rquote s--?\'94
\par 
\par She rolled her eyes. \'93The Minister of Magic. Surely you\rquote ve heard of him?\'94
\par 
\par He stared around at the opulence. \'93So, when Fudge comes here, this is where he stays?\'94
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s right. It\rquote s only fitting that--\'94
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s disgusting!\'94 he exclaimed, wondering if he would have dared do this with the other doctor in the room.
\par 
\par \'93What are you talking about?\'94 she said impatiently.
\par 
\par \'93What do you think I\rquote m talking about? This--\'94 he waved his hands, \'93--this is obscene! All those grungy wards and corridors, and that entrance hall that could use a coat of paint, or at least a
 decent cleaning....How could so much money be squandered on a room for one person?\'94
\par 
\par She drew herself up and looked very proud. \'93I\rquote ll have you know that my uncle paid for this room himself. No money was taken from the operating budget for the hospital.\'94
\par 
\par Harry remembered Cornelius Fudge saying at the Quidditch World Cup that Malfoy had just made a very generous contribution to St. Mungo\rquote 
s. For this, he thought, his stomach turning. No wonder Fudge was always defending him, he realized, almost wishing that 
he was back in his other life, where Fudge had never advanced further than being an Inquisitor. Even Barty Crouch, for all that he had the poor judgment to break his son out of jail, would never have approved something like this, Harry thought, looking ar
ound again, frowning.
\par 
\par \'93If it weren\rquote t for my uncle, I wouldn\rquote t be a doctor!\'94 she continued vehemently. \'93When they didn\rquote t want to take me in the training program here, he was the one who convinced the board to accept me, even though I\rquote 
m not a wizard! And other witches have been accepted since then. I was the first. So don\rquote t you sit there, benefiting from my care, and say anything against my uncle! Now lie on your stomach!\'94
\par 
\par Harry glared at her for a moment, then did as he was told. She began to peel back the 
bandage on his back; he winced. It was still incredibly painful. To distract himself, he looked around at the room again, feeling far more disgusted with Cornelius Fudge than Lucius Malfoy, if he were to tell the truth. Glancing at her over his shoulder f
or a second, he then turned and pillowed his head on his arms, remembering the one time he had met Nita Anderssen in his other life....
\par 
\par It was another Malfoy Christmas party. Harry and Draco were in their third year; Jamie in first. They had grown out of p
laying Paper Chase, and were no longer confined to the nursery during parties (Not that they had ever stayed there), but they had been warned not to eavesdrop on adults\rquote 
 conversations. This meant, naturally, that they wanted to eavesdrop on as many adult conversations as possible, and flitted about the party trying to do just that. 
\par 
\par They finally decided to station themselves in the entrance hall, concealed behind three su
its of armor standing in a niche; from here they could see everyone entering the party. Narcissa Malfoy swept into the hall soon after they had concealed themselves; she was greeting her brother and his wife and their daughter, who had just arrived for th
e party.
\par 
\par \'93Nils!\'94 she said rapturously to an older wizard whose face was remarkably like hers, his grey and blond hair blending into silver. She seemed like she was going to kiss him on the cheek and then purposefully missed it; the same almost-kiss maneuve
r was repeated with her willowy sister-in-law, who was also silver-blonde. Then she looked at her niece, who was as tall as her, with golden blond hair pulled back into a tight bun and hard blue eyes behind her spectacles. She was wearing long black robes
 and carrying a heavy book. Narcissa Malfoy, in contrast, had donned sapphire-blue robes with silver threads permeating the fabric, so that she sparkled as she moved. She looked critically at her niece\rquote 
s attire, which contrasted starkly with the festive holiday decorations in the hall.
\par 
\par \'93Ah, Nita. You, er, brought reading. And you\rquote re wearing black. How--festive,\'94 she said weakly. 
\par 
\par Nita grimaced. \'93I\rquote m sorry, Aunt Cissy. I didn\rquote t have time to work on an outfit like yours. I\rquote ve been revising constantly. After the new year I\rquote m taking my Matron examinations.\'94
\par 
\par Narcissa Malfoy smiled, something Harry rarely saw, and hugged her niece with what looked like genuine affection. \'93I know, dear. We\rquote re all frightfully proud of you, you know. Youngest Matron at St. Mungo\rquote s ever! Before you know it, you
\rquote ll be in charge of the entire nursing staff!\'94 Nita frowned.
\par 
\par \'93If I ever am in charge, I am immediately changing the uniform for nurses. I hate wimples,\'94 she grumbled. \'93And even being the youngest Matron ever isn\rquote t as good as being a doctor.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Now, now. Nurses are very important, you know that. And witches don\rquote t become doctors; wizards become doctors. You know how proud of you we all are, don\rquote 
t you? I told Lucius that you would be a worthwhile investment. I plan to be quite smug about that for years to come,\'94 she added, smiling at the younger woman.
\par 
\par Beside Harry, Jamie yawned, bored. \'93After they\rquote re gone,\'94 she whispered to Harry and Draco, \'93Let\rquote s go find the twins and have some fun.\'94 Harry knew that she meant \'93Fun at the twins\rquote  expense,\'94 but he didn\rquote 
t mind that, so he nodded.
\par 
\par However, just as Narcissa Malfoy and the Anderssens left the hall, a tall bespectacled wizard with thinning red hair abruptly Apparated into the entrance hall of Malfoy Manor. His robes were plain and black
, quite utilitarian, and it was clear that he was not there for the annual Malfoy Christmas Party. In fact, Harry thought, he knew he\rquote d seen the wizard before, but not at the Malfoys\rquote 
 parties. There were Malfoys nearby, though, he seemed to recall...
\par 
\par Then he remembered; it was at the World Cup in Spain, when he was ten years old. The first time he met Ginny Weasley. The tall wizard was Ginny Weasley\rquote 
s father. Remembering how badly that encounter had gone, Harry shrank back behind Draco and Jamie. He wonder
ed whether Ron Weasley and his brothers had told their father that he was stalking Ginny. He swallowed, trying to come up with a plausible way to explain his behavior in a perfectly innocuous manner.
\par 
\par Mr. Weasley had his wand out, but his face actually looked friendly. Hearing the music emanating from the drawing room, he called, \'93Hullo! Hullo?\'94 He didn\rquote t make a move, but seemed to be waiting for someone to come out and speak to him. Draco
\rquote s mother returned to the entrance hall, clearly keeping an eye out for new arrivals so that she could greet them, as the hostess. She strode purposefully into the grand hall, her hand extended, saying, \'93Happy Christma--\'94
 but stopping, looking dumbly at her newest visitor. \'93Oh!\'94 she said icily, composing herself. \'93It\rquote s you.\'94 When she wanted to be cold no one could be as cold as Narcissa Malfoy.
\par 
\par Harry cringed, waiting for Mr. Weasley to demand to see him; instead, he said, \'93Hello, Narcissa. Er, Happy Christmas. Sorry to burst in on your party this way, but it is very important that I speak to Lucius.\'94
\par 
\par She put her hand in her robe pocket, and Harry thought it was quite possible that she was reaching for her wand. Not taking her eyes off the red-haired wizard, she called, \'93Lucius! Please come to the entrance hall!\'94 She continu
ed to glare at Mr. Weasley, icy fire in her eyes, her jaw clenched. In less than ten seconds, Draco\rquote s father was striding into the hall, his deep blue moir}{\f76\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'e9}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 robes swirling around him, his features contorted in abject hatred upon seeing his visitor.
\par 
\par \'93Weasley! What the hell are you doing here? I know my wife couldn\rquote t have been so stupid as to invite you! That means you must be crashing my party. Finally figured out that it would be a cold day in hell before you ever received an invitation?
\'94
\par 
\par Arthur Weasley gave him a lopsided smile. \'93Good to see you too, Lucius. No, I\rquote m not here for the party. I\rquote m here on business. I have a warrant to search the premises.\'94
 He pulled a piece of parchment from his robes and handed it to Lucius Malfoy. Now that he knew he wasn\rquote t the reason for Mr. Weasley\rquote 
s visit, Harry was feeling a little braver, as he peeked out under an arm belonging to one of the suits of armor behind which they were hiding. He could see the official seal of the Ministry of Magic on the parchment. \'93So,\'94 Mr. 
Weasley was saying now, \'93If you\rquote ll please give us your complete cooperation--\'94
\par 
\par A moment later, it was evident what he meant by \'93Us;\'94 Harry recognized Frank and Gemma Longbottom, who had suddenly Apparated into the entrance hall with a doublepop! They flanked Mr. Weasley. Draco suddenly grasped Harry\rquote 
s arm painfully and whispered in his ear, \'93Longbottom\rquote s parents!\'94
\par 
\par Harry nodded, not ma
king a sound. He knew all too well who they were. He looked at Jamie, beside him, who glowered at the Longbottoms, perhaps, like him, remembering when they had come to take away Remus Lupin. Harry and Jamie had not told Draco about that; it was too painfu
l.
\par 
\par The Longbottoms\rquote  wands were pointing at Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy; Draco\rquote s mother was livid.
\par 
\par \'93Get out!\'94 she screeched now. \'93Get out of my house!\'94 She had drawn her wand and was holding it with a shaking hand. The Longbottoms stiffened, poised for action. Harry felt like he couldn\rquote t breathe.
\par 
\par \'93Aunt Cissy!\'94 Nita Anderssen said in surprise, returning to the entrance hall, clearly having heard her aunt cry out. \'93Whatever- -?\'94
\par 
\par But her question was drowned out by the furious argument now being waged by the Malfoys, the Longbottoms and Mr. Weasley. Harry looked at Draco\rquote 
s cousin Nita, surprised to find her looking right back. She edged over to the suits of armor and glanced into the space behind them, grinning.
\par 
\par \'93So,\'94 she said softly. \'93What are you lot up to?\'94
\par 
\par Draco hushed her and she nodded conspiratorially, speaking to them now while surveying the scene before them.
\par 
\par \'93Are those Aurors?\'94 she asked quietly, nodding at the three intruders, who took no more notice of her than the Malfoys did.
\par 
\par \'93Not all of them,\'94 Draco told her in a low voice. \'93The red-haired prat is Weasley\rquote s dad.\'94
\par 
\par \'93You mean Percy Weasley? Head Boy at Hogwarts?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Nah. Well--I mean, Percy Weasley\rquote s Head Boy, all right. More\rquote s the pity. But I don\rquote t mean him. Ron Weasley. In our year. To call him an insufferable git would be to insult insufferable gits everywhere.\'94
\par 
\par She frowned, then looked up at Mr. Weasley; Harry could see her in profile. Extreme loathing was etched on her face.
\par 
\par \'93Well, I know Weasleys. Wouldn\rquote t trust one as far as I could throw it. I hope Uncle Lucius and Aunt Cissy give him what\rquote s coming to him for crashing the party.\'94 Her voice shook slightly.
\par 
\par \'93Yeah, we feel the same way about Weasleys,\'94 Draco said. \'93Well, except for Harry\rquote s crush on the little sister. He\rquote s always haring after her...\'94
\par 
\par Harry smacked Draco\rquote s arm. \'93Shut up, you!\'94 he hissed. Nita\rquote s eyes narrowed as she turned to look at Harry. She seemed about to say something when Harry\rquote s elegantly-attired mother and stepfather suddenly appeared in the entran
ce hall doorway, interrupting the argument between the Malfoys and their uninvited guests.
\par 
\par \'93Lucius! Narcissa!\'94 Lily Evans said in that clear, ringing voice which never failed to get her Potions students\rquote  attention. \'93What is going on here?\'94 Her long red ha
ir was laced through with gold strands falling from a simple gold circlet, glittering in the candlelight, and her robes were evergreen brocade.
\par 
\par \'93Lily,\'94 her husband said slowly; \'93Don\rquote t you think we should let--\'94
\par 
\par \'93What I think is that I need to talk some sense into my former colleagues!\'94 Harry\rquote s mother said sharply, looking daggers at the Longbottoms.
\par 
\par Lucius Malfoy definitely looked like he didn\rquote t want a woman fighting his battles for him. \'93Now, Lily. This is my house--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Please, Lucius.\'94 She glared at the Longbottoms. \'93Consider it my Christmas gift to you and Narcissa and Draco,\'94
 she said between gritted teeth. Severus Snape hurried forward before the Malfoys could change their minds (No one had noticed that Nita had joined the younger children in their h
iding place). His bottle-green velvet robes belling out behind him, he herded the Malfoys out of the entrance hall, looking over his shoulder at his wife, then shooting hateful glances at the Aurors flanking Mr. Weasley.
\par 
\par \'93So, who\rquote s that?\'94 Nita whispered to Draco.
\par 
\par \'93Our mum,\'94 Jamie told her softly. Nita nodded. \'93Right. You look like her. Except for your hair color.\'94
\par 
\par Jamie\rquote s mouth was very thin. \'93Our dad had dark hair.\'94 Her response was almost inaudible. Harry looked at her; her large green eyes were shiny with tears, her usual response to any mention of the father she\rquote d never known.
\par 
\par \'93What the hell do you think you\rquote re doing?\'94 Lily Evans said to the Longbottoms and Mr. Weasley now. \'93It is Christmas tomorrow! You know that this is when Lucius and Narcissa hav
e their annual party! And yet you come in here, with your warrant--\'94
\par 
\par Frank Longbottom lifted his chin. \'93I don\rquote t see why we should show any consideration for You-Know-Who sympathizers.\'94
\par 
\par Harry\rquote s mother threw up her hands. \'93I\rquote m not a sympathizer, you dolt! As if I could be!\'94 She didn\rquote t remind him of how her first husband had died, and from the look on his face it was evident that she didn\rquote t need to. \'93
But thanks to the way you and too many other Aurors do their jobs, there are a huge number of people who are 
somewhere in the middle, not sympathizing with Voldemort, but not terrifically sympathetic to the Ministry either. And I wonder why that might be, eh? Raids during Christmas parties, perhaps?\'94
 she said to Mr. Weasley, whose ears turned bright red. She turned on the Longbottoms. \'93
Dragging away a werewolf, who also happens to be a man, in the middle of the night from a house where he is a welcome guest? A house where my children, who adore him, were sleeping? Do you know how difficult it was to explain to my 
two youngest children in the morning what had happened to Remus? He was going to take them to Diagon Alley. They\rquote d been looking forward to it for ages. But you--!\'94
 she cried, her fury making it impossible for her to put more of her emotions into words.
\par 
\par She looked back and forth between the three of them, who looked distinctly uncomfortable now. \'93May I remind you,\'94 she said now, the imminent threat quite clear, \'93That my husband and I both teach your children?\'94 She looked at Mr. Weasley. \'93
I believe right now that I am teachingfive of yours, Arthur. One of whom is hoping to do well on his N.E.W.T.s and two of whom are slated to be taking their O.W.L.s at the end of the summer term.\'94 She turned to the Longbottoms. \'93And you; I\rquote 
m teaching two of your three sons right now, and the third one is coming to Hogwarts in a year or two, I believe. Do you feel it is wise to antagonize two of your children\rquote s professors in such a manner?\'94 
\par 
\par Harry thought it was mostly his mother, not his stepfather, who was antagonized, but the four of them behind the suits of armor didn\rquote t dare let even a whisper pass their lips at this point.
\par 
\par \'93Get out!\'94 Lily Evans said to the three of them now, her voice echoing off the hard limestone of the floor and walls. Arthur Weasley turned to the Aurors and nodded.
\par 
\par \'93Go. I will talk to Lily for a moment and join you back at the office.\'94
\par 
\par The Longbottoms hesitated, but Mr. Weasley looked at them again with one eyebrow raised, exerting a surprising influence over them by doing this. They Disapparated with a doublepop! and Arthur Weasley turned to Harry\rquote s mother.
\par 
\par \'93It\rquote s--it\rquote s good to see you again, Lily. It\rquote s been some time,\'94 he said quietly. She looked disturbed by his lack of anger toward her, but nodded all the same.
\par 
\par \'93I think the last time was when Sam and I came to that village where--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yes,\'94 he said, clearing his throat, interrupting her. He looked unspeakably 
sad. Next to him, Harry heard Nita make a small skeptical noise in her throat. He glanced at her, frowning. She was still glaring at Mr. Weasley. Turning back to look at his mother, he saw that she appeared to be a bit sorry now for the way she\rquote 
d been speaking to Mr. Weasley, and her face softened.
\par 
\par \'93How is Bill? I heard he\rquote s with the Ministry.\'94
\par 
\par Arthur Weasley nodded. \'93Yes. Transportation. He complains that it\rquote s just a lot of forms to fill out--you know, fining people for Apparating without licenses, sorting them out when they splinch themselves, all that--but I daresay they couldn
\rquote t function without him, what with the labour shortage and all.\'94 Lily Evans nodded grimly. \'93You know,\'94 he added, \'93He was--he was quite broken up about--I mean--when James--\'94
\par 
\par She lifted her head, looking like she was trying to be brave now. \'93He sent me a lovely letter.\'94
\par 
\par Arthur nodded. \'93He had only been serving as Head Boy for two months, at the time. All summer he\rquote d said that if he could be half as good a Head Boy as James Potter, he\rquote d be the second-best one Hogwarts had ever had.\'94
 Harry thought he saw his mother quickly run the back of her hand across her eyes now. It was very fast; afterward she was standing and speaking to Arthur Weasley in a very dignified manner again.
\par 
\par \'93We always knew Bill would do well. And Charlie. It\rquote s a pleasure to have him on the teaching staff. Harry and Draco are really enjoying Care of Magical Creatures with him.\'94
\par 
\par Arthur nodded. \'93We\rquote re just glad he\rquote s closer to home. Romania was so far away....\'94 He cleared his throat and looked at her very seriously. \'93I\rquote 
m sorry if those of us who work for the Ministry sometimes come across as martinets, Lily. I wish you could see Lucius Malfoy the way I do--\'94
\par 
\par Harry knew that she did. She opened her mouth as if to say this, then shut it again quickly and swallowed; perhaps she didn\rquote t think it wise to say this in Lucius Malfoy's own house. \'93
I just think--I think the Ministry should spare a little concern for its public image. One must consider how something like this looks, Arthur. A raid on Christmas Eve, during a large party? It\rquote 
s not going to make most people very avid supporters of the Ministry, is it? I mean--Draco is here. And Narcissa\rquote s niece. And my four children. And the Parkinsons\rquote  daughter, and the Notts....Do y
ou think we want our children seeing this? Seeing the way we adults cannot get along, the way we try to blindside one another and sneak around and--\'94
 She seemed to be having trouble breathing suddenly, putting her hand on her chest; Harry clearly saw the tears running down her face.
\par 
\par Arthur Weasley stepped forward, concerned. \'93Are you all right, Lily? You seem a bit--stressed.\'94
\par 
\par She looked at him, eyes glistening. \'93You have no idea.\'94 She sighed deeply. \'93Please, Arthur. Come back the day after tomorrow...\'94
\par 
\par He patted her hand. \'93Of course. You\rquote re right, you\rquote re right. I shouldn\rquote t have listened to Frank. \lquote Surprise him,\rquote  he said. \lquote I can\rquote t wait to see the look on his face,\rquote  he said.\'94
 Mr. Weasley grimaced. \'93Well, I for one could have waited.\'94
\par 
\par She raised her eyebrows at him. \'93And now you shall. But Arthur--\'94
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par \'93I--I didn\rquote t mean to threaten your children. Before. It\rquote s just--ever since I married Severus, Frank and Gemma have been so impossible--\'94
\par 
\par He smiled at her. \'93You know how they are about Slytherins. And I\rquote m not saying they\rquote re my favourite people. As it is, what with Neville and Ron being best mates, we see them far more than we\rquote d like to.\'94 Lily looked sadly at him.

\par 
\par \'93My condolences,\'94 she said, before breaking into a smile. He still smiled back at her.
\par 
\par \'93Ah, well. You know how it is. We put a good face on it for the children\rquote s sake.\'94
\par 
\par She nodded. \'93Then you know.\'94 She let him think abut that for a moment, before understanding dawned on his face. He knew now how she felt about the Malfoys.
\par 
\par \'93Ah, ah, I see, I see. Yes. Of course.\'94
\par 
\par She put her hand on his arm and said gently. \'93Happy Christmas, Arthur. And to Molly as well. And say hello to Bill for me.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Happy Christmas, Lily,\'94 he said with a small smile, before Disapparating.
\par 
\par Harry rested his right cheek on his forearm, trying to remember why that was the only Christmas party where he remembered seeing Nita. He had a vague recollection of Draco\rquote 
s Uncle Nils saying in earlier years that she was at home alone again, revising, and in later years that she had volunteered to work during the holidays. As it was, even though her parents had dragged her to the party he\rquote 
d just remembered, she had taken a book with her. (Although she had let herself be distracted from her revision by the goings-on in the entrance hall).
\par 
\par Harry thought about what he remembered; she\rquote d been interested in magical medicine in his other life, also, but in that life she didn\rquote 
t have the opportunity to study to be a doctor, only a nurse. Was that because Voldemort had never fallen? he wondered.
\par 
\par He flinched as she worked. \'93Can\rquote t you just--you know, do a spell or a charm or something to fix the problem?\'94 he said between gritted teeth.
\par 
\par \'93Hmph! Don\rquote t get me started. Clancy is my senior,\'94 she said bitterly, continuing to work. \'93He has set out your treatment. I\rquote m to follow his orders.\'94
\par 
\par As she worked on his back, he had an evil thought. \'93I didn\rquote t know doctors did nurses\rquote  work,\'94 he said. He turned his head slightly; her eyes were furious now. He had succeeded in winding her up. He 
didn't look down on nurses; he liked Madam Pomfrey very much. But he knew what her opinion was.
\par 
\par \'93This is not nurses\rquote  work. I wouldn\rquote t trust any of them with this.\'94 He winced again, wondering whether she wouldn\rquote t trust them to cause him enough pain.
\par 
\par \'93If Voldemort hadn\rquote t fallen, you\rquote d probably be a lowly nurse, you know,\'94 he dared to say. She stiffened, then continued to work, covering up his back with the bandage again.
\par 
\par \'93My uncle would have--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Your uncle would have killed even more people, given the chance!\'94 he said angrily, rolling over and sitting up, glad she was done. How could she continue to defend him? Even Draco Malfoy didn\rquote t do that.
\par 
\par \'93He didn\rquote t kill anyone,\'94 she said, crossing her arms, still holding her wand.
\par 
\par \'93No, he didn\rquote t get his hands dirty himself. But he did order the Clearwater family killed. That\rquote s his fault.\'94
\par 
\par She was silent, staring at a point over his head. Finally, she met his eyes again. \'93Fine. I\rquote ll give you that. It was wrong. But sending him to prison should have been adequate pu
nishment. There was no reason to make my aunt destitute. She deserves that money far more than- -\'94
\par 
\par \'93Percy Weasley? I don\rquote t know about that. Oh, I don\rquote t doubt he\rquote d rather have his fiance back, rather than the money, but I think it was perfectly reasonable 
to take the money and give it to him, seeing as your uncle took away his future wife and--well, his future. In that your precious Aunt Cissy never lifted a finger to get him to stop what he was doing or tried to turn him in, I don\rquote 
t see why she deserves to be living in the lap of luxury.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Turn him in!\'94 she cried. \'93Like her no-good son! I\rquote ll have you know that she has more loyalty than that! I doubt you would ever understand,\'94 she added bitterly.
\par 
\par He glared. \'93I\rquote m loyal to those who deserve it. Loyalty once saved my life, and the lives of three other people.\'94 He remembered how glad he had been to see Fawkes flying overhead in the Chamber of Secrets, and to hear the phoenix song....

\par 
\par \'93Then how do you explain being loyal to the Weasleys?" she asked bitterly, as though this was a contradiction. Harry wondered whether Draco had ever told her about that first time on the Hogwarts Express, when he\rquote 
d extended his hand to Harry, only to be rejected. \'93They\rquote re practically your adopted family, I understand. No wonder you\rquote re defending Percy Weasley getting my aunt\rquote s money. If you only knew what the Weasleys really are--\'94
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94 he demanded. \'93What are they, really?\'94 he challenged her. Draco Malfoy and his father must have fed her anti-Weasley propaganda for years before Draco started seeing Ginny, he thought.
\par 
\par Her face had reddened. She didn\rquote 
t answer, but turned on her heel and stalked to the door. When she opened it, she stopped in surprise; four people stood there, about to enter. Ron and Hermione stood looking at her awkwardly, Ginny and Draco Malfoy standing next to them. Malfoy looked ve
ry surprised to see his cousin.
\par 
\par \'93Nita!\'94 he cried.
\par 
\par She glared at him, and then at Ron and Ginny, before pushing past them. They all turned and looked after her for a moment, then gave a collective shrug and entered the room. They quickly forgot about her w
hen they saw the opulent room, their jaws dropping. Oddly enough, instead of questioning the appropriateness of the room, Hermione was the first to recover.
\par 
\par \'93Harry!\'94 Hermione cried, launching herself at him and throwing her arms around his back to hug him. Harry never knew where the agonized cry he uttered came from; it didn\rquote t seem to be from his throat. She pulled back, looking stricken.
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote m--I\rquote m sorry, Hermione,\'94 he said, when the power of speech had returned to him; \'93But--this really isn\rquote t a good time for anyone to be touching my back...\'94
\par 
\par \'93Why\rquote s that?\'94 Ron said grinning, pulling his hand back as if to slap Harry hard on the back. He stopped his hand a few inches away, as Harry gave him an evil look. Ron laughed. \'93You know I wasn\rquote t going to--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Yeah, because I knew you wanted to go on living,\'94 he responded, forcing himself to laugh too.
\par 
\par \'93Ron!\'94 Hermione chastised him. \'93It\rquote s not funny!\'94
\par 
\par Harry looked at Ginny and Draco. \'93Hello,\'94 he said quietly to them. Ginny swallowed and looked at him, her eyes very wide; he could see she was trembling. Draco Malfoy looked a bit uncomfortable. Harry nodded at him.
\par 
\par \'93Draco.\'94 He forced himself to use the first name. He remembered the fury in his face when he had blasted the fireball out of the air, the fireball which could have killed him; and then cursing Fleur....
\par 
\par \'93Harry,\'94 Draco responded after a moment; Harry thought it was possible Ginny had nudged him with her elbow to get him to speak.
\par 
\par \'93Thanks,\'94 Harry said to him now. Draco Malfoy frowned at him.
\par 
\par \'93For what?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, um, you saved my life.\'94
\par 
\par Draco paused. \'93I guess that makes us even.\'94 Then he narrowed his eyes. \'93Wait--how do you know? Who told you?\'94
\par 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93I saw you.\'94
\par 
\par \'93You did?\'94
\par 
\par He looked at Ginny now. \'93The reason why it seemed so hard for people to revive me was that I wasn\rquote t really there. Not completely. I used the pain-blocking technique, where I\rquote 
m sorting of floating above my own body, able to see everything going on around me....\'94
\par 
\par Understanding flooded Draco Malfoy\rquote s face now. \'93Oh,\'94 he said, drawing it out. Ginny\rquote s mouth opened and closed several times before she spoke.
\par 
\par \'93That\rquote s why you--you--\'94
\par 
\par \'93Sorry,\'94 he said softly to her. \'93I rather got the impression that you--you thought I was dead. I didn\rquote t mean to frighten--anyone.\'94 He\rquote d been about to say \'93Frighten you\'94 and changed it at the last moment.
\par 
\par She whispered, \'93I\rquote m just glad you\rquote re all right.\'94
\par 
\par Draco Malfoy put his arm around her shoulder and pulled her tight against him, kissing her brow. She looked at him sadly, and Harry wondered how she was feeling about him now; she seemed very solicitous, and frankly, he didn\rquote 
t blame her. Draco Malfoy appeared to be very emotionally fragile suddenly. He turned to Harry again, his voice cracking. \'93I need to say thanks, too, Harry.\'94
\par 
\par \'93For what?\'94
\par 
\par \'93For saving Ginny,\'94 he said, looking down into her eyes again. Now Harry understood; it wasn\rquote t that Draco Malfoy was suddenly in the business of being nice to Harry Potter, or even paying Harry back for saving him from the
 giant spiders in the Forbidden Forest. He had kept Fleur from hurling the ball of fire at him because he had saved Ginny from the same fate.
\par 
\par \'93How--how is Fleur?\'94 Harry asked now, to change the subject. His four visitors all looked at each other uncertainly; Draco Malfoy looked particularly uncomfortable. Hermione finally illuminated him.
\par 
\par \'93Oh, Harry--she\rquote s very bad. She\rquote s in a room upstairs in the mental ward--a padded cell, really. Just sitting in the corner, rocking. The-- the pain from the Hara Kiri curse--it was too much for her--\'94
 She glanced nervously at Draco Malfoy, then away.
\par 
\par Harry frowned. \'93So--just having the curse on her the one time--it had the same effect as Cruciatus being put on the Longbottoms for a long time? You're sure she's not just in shock? Maybe she'll come out of it.\'94
\par 
\par \'93That would be nice, but so far the damage appears to be permanent,\'94 she said quietly. \'93You see--well, first I think Malfoy was very keyed up when he cast the spell. And then there\rquote s--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--There\rquote s the Obedience Charm--\'94 Harry said for her.
\par 
\par She nodded. \'93Increasing his power. And added to that--\'94 She bit her lip and looked down; she seemed a bit green. He waited for her, but finally he couldn\rquote t wait any longer.
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par Ginny finally spoke. \'93Fleur is pregnant.\'94
\par 
\par Harry\rquote s jaw dropped. \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par Malfoy finally spoke, very mechanical, as though he was trying to keep his voice devoid of emotion. \'93When I had that curse put on me by my dad, he wasn\rquote t doing it in a life-and-death situation. He wasn\rquote t all worked up. It wasn\rquote 
t as strong. And even when I--when I used that spell myself, other times, I wasn\rquote t so--so--\'94 His self-control collapsed, and he looked worse than Harry had ever seen him in this life, almost as bad as when the Draco Malfoy in his other lif
e was mourning Jamie Potter. Understanding dawned on Harry.
\par 
\par \'93Right,\'94 he said softly. \'93And while you were imagining that you were disemboweling yourself, which is horrible enough, you weren\rquote t imagining that you were cutting yourself open and removing your own child from the womb--\'94
 He swallowed hard. \'93No wonder it overwhelmed her,\'94 he whispered.
\par 
\par \'93And no wonder she showed up at the Spinnets\rquote  like that,\'94 Hermione said softly, swallowing, looking like she didn\rquote t want to think about what Fleur had imagined when Draco had cursed her. \'93
It also provides another explanation for why she was so powerful. When a witch is expecting a baby--it augments her magic for a while. The power grows at first, then dwindles as the delivery date approaches. Fleur is about twenty w
eeks along, the doctors said. That\rquote s about half-way, so she was at her strongest. That helped her a bit. The doctors say that physically, she\rquote s fine and the baby is fine. Well--I should say, from the neck down, she\rquote s fine--\'94
\par 
\par \'93But her mind--?\'94 Harry prompted her. Hermione shook her head. \'93She\rquote s gone. She\rquote s said a word here and there in French, but even that doesn\rquote t make any sense. No one can reach her. It was--it was just too much for her to bear.
\'94
\par 
\par Harry saw that Draco had dark circles under his eyes; he\rquote d never seen him so adversely affected by something he\rquote d done. Usually he erected a fa}{\f76\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'e7}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
ade of being utterly pleased with himself, no matter what he did, no matter the result. He wasn\rquote t even bothering with that now. The self-loathing was emanating from him like heat, and Harry found himself unable to say anything critical.
\par 
\par \'93Draco didn\rquote t know she was pregnant,\'94 he said to Hermione. \'93He--he meant well.\'94
\par 
\par The blond boy brought his head up abruptly, looking suspiciously at Harry for some sign of sarcasm, but found none. \'93That doesn\rquote t change what I did,\'94 he said quietly, surprising Harry.
\par 
\par \'93No,\'94 he agreed. \'93That\rquote s true.\'94 He couldn\rquote t argue with that. Then he thought about what Hermione had said about Fleur\rquote s pregnancy. \'93Hermione--twenty weeks ago would have been--m
id-April, roughly. That was--that was after I saw Roger and Alicia at the Hogsmeade school\'94.
\par 
\par Ron frowned. \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par Harry narrowed his eyes. \'93He was sneaking around with Alicia in March. Possibly before that, but I saw them in March. Fleur didn\rquote t get pregn
ant until mid-April. He must have been seeing both of them at once. And then we all received wedding invitations at the end of July, when Fleur was about sixteen weeks along. At that point, you\rquote 
d think it would be Roger and Fleur announcing their wedding, not Roger and Alicia, right? I mean, if he was seeing two girls and had to choose one to marry at that point, you\rquote d think it would be the one carrying his child.\'94
\par 
\par He remembered the way Roger Davies had been behaving when Fleur was attacking. He\rquote d been protecting her. He must have known she was pregnant. And he\rquote d told Alicia that it was her Fleur was after. Hermione had been wrong; Fleur didn\rquote 
t have a bone to pick with Roger. She wanted Alicia out of the way....
\par 
\par He looked up at them all. \'93I thought Alicia was marrying Roger because he was threatening her in some way, or perhaps threatening her family. I\rquote m not so sure about that now--\'94
\par 
\par Ginny frowned. \'93You don\rquote t think Alicia\rquote s threatening Roger, do you? And that\rquote s why he couldn\rquote t be with Fleur--?\'94
\par 
\par He shook his head. \'93No. I still think someone\rquote s threatening Alicia or her family, and that\rquote s why she married Roger. But I don\rquote t think Roger\rquote 
s the one doing the threatening, see. He still seems to care a lot about Fleur. I think he may even have known she was carrying his child. I believe that the same person who\rquote s threatening Alicia is also threatening Roger.\'94
 The four of them looked at him in amazement. \'93I think that someone is manipulating both Alicia and Roger, and Fleur was caught in the middle. For some reason, someone wants Roger and Alicia to be married, and they don\rquote 
t care what Roger and Alicia want. The question is--who?\'94
\par 
\par \'93And why?\'94 Ron said ominously. Then he opened his eyes wide and hit his head. \'93Oh! I almost forgot! What I heard Roger and Alicia talking about!\'94
\par 
\par Harry had forgotten about that too. \'93What did you hear?\'94 he said anxiously.
\par 
\par Ron looked grim. \'93This may explain a bit. Roger and Alicia--well, they\rquote re going to be working to get her father elected to Parliament.\'94
\par 
\par Harry looked at him blankly. \'93Yeah, I know. She told me already. That\rquote s what you had to tell me?\'94
\par 
\par Hermione swatted Ron with the back of her hand. \'93That wasn\rquote t the important part, Ron. Don\rquote t you remember what else you told me? About the whip?\'94
\par 
\par Ron frowned. \'93Yeah, but that\rquote s the part I didn\rquote t understand. They said that once they got her father elected, all they\rquote 
d need to do was get the whip out of the way, and her dad would have a clear path. And you got all excited about that. But--I don\rquote t get it. What\rquote s so big about getting a whip out of the way?\'94
\par 
\par She rolled her eyes. \'93I didn\rquote t realized you didn\rquote t know what they were really saying, Ron. The whip is a person. Or rather, two people. There\rquote 
s a majority whip and a minority whip. The whip is the person in the party who gets all of the other people in the party to vote the same way. Or tries to. The whip is a very powerful, important person. Normally, a newly-elected member of Parliament doesn
\rquote t stand a chance of having any power or influence. But if they\rquote re planning to get rid of th
e people who already have the power and influence, that would change. Although I imagine they'd have to get rid of more than just the current whips...there are probably other people who imagine they'd be next in line if a whip position opened up....\'94

\par 
\par Harry frowned. \'93Which means even more people could be in danger. So. Someone made Roger leave Fleur and start seeing Alicia, but he didn\rquote 
t obey, strictly speaking. And even though she seemed to be under the influence of a spell or potion at first, perhaps once
 she found out that the objective was to get her dad elected and into a position of power, she decided not to fight it....So Alicia isn\rquote t as innocent as she might seem. Or she really has been threatened, so she doesn\rquote 
t dare tell her father that if he wins, it might be because of something illegal she and Roger have done. If Roger and Alicia are going along with this because they\rquote ve been threatened, when you think about it, Fleur is the one who\rquote 
s really been wronged....\'94 He didn\rquote t add that she\rquote d been further wronged by Draco Malfoy putting the Hara Kiri Curse on her.
\par 
\par They were all silent for a minute. Harry saw that Ginny and Draco seemed very cozy together, and for once, he didn\rquote t mind. He could see that Draco Malfoy was torn up inside by what he\rquote d done. De
veloping a conscience, Harry thought. That I wouldn\rquote t have predicted.
\par 
\par When the awkward silence had stretched for an uncomfortable period of time, Harry quietly said, \'93Draco, for the past two years people have been telling me that it\rquote s not my fault Cedric died. I\rquote ll probably always feel responsible anyway.
\'94
\par 
\par His mouth twisted. \'93Yes, but you\rquote re not the one who cursed him. And no matter what I\rquote ve done in my life, until now, I didn\rquote t go about attacking pregnant women.\'94
 Harry grimaced; this was going to take time. He decided not to push.
\par 
\par \'93Your cousin Nita\rquote s one of my doctors. She says your mum has been staying with her.\'94 Draco nodded.
\par 
\par \'93I know. Just because she disowned me doesn\rquote t mean I don\rquote t feel the need to know where she is.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Nita\rquote s rather down on you, just so you know. And down on Weasleys, as well.\'94
\par 
\par Draco Malfoy shrugged. \'93What do you think she grew up hearing? My Uncle Nils was in school with your dad, you know,\'94 he said, nodding at Ron and Ginny, \'93And my mum was several years ahead of your oldest brother. And then there\rquote 
s my dad and your dad....No love lost there. There are loads of reasons for her thinking I\rquote m a turncoat,\'94 he added, tightening his grip on Ginny.
\par 
\par \'93When did she start at Hogwarts?\'94 Harry asked.
\par 
\par Draco shook his head. \'93She didn\rquote t go to Hogwarts. Durmstrang." So that's the same in this life, Harry thought. "My aunt\rquote 
s Swedish, works for their Ministry of Magic in Magical Games and Sports. She and Uncle Nils live in Kopparberg most of the year; her biggest job is organizing the annual broom race from Kopparberg to Arjeplog. It\rquote s always on New Year\rquote 
s Eve. Father was going to take me in fifth year, as a reward, after--\'94 He swallowed. \'93After I was initiated. See, the spectators all start out in Kopparber
g, then Apparate to Arjeplog to congratulate the survivors. He needed to wait until I knew how to Apparate to take me.\'94
\par 
\par Hermione furrowed her brow. \'93The survivors?\'94
\par 
\par \'93The course goes through a dragon reservation,\'94 Harry explained to her. \'93The trophy looks like a Swedish Short-Snout.\'94 He remembered that he and Draco, when they were best friends, talked about the day they\rquote 
d be able to Apparate so they could go to the race. Harry tried not to laugh at the way Hermione shuddered; if there was one thing Hermione liked less than flying, it was probably dragons. He recalled the way she\rquote 
d scratched up her own face, worrying over him during the first task of the Triwizard Tournament. And she was definitely glad to see the last of Norbert, the Norwegian Ridgeback.
\par 
\par \'93So, you speak Swedish?\'94 he said suddenly to Draco, remembering that he\rquote d only pretended to speak Swedish in his other life.
\par 
\par \'93Nah. My mum does, though. I never did get to see the broom race in fifth year, and I only visited them in Sweden two other times. 
Usually they came to see us at the holidays. And for years, Nita stayed at Durmstrang during the Christmas and Easter hols. I hardly ever saw her. Mum was big on visiting her brother a lot, though. She was very close to Nita. Treated her like a little sis
ter. They\rquote re actually not that far apart in age. Well, they\rquote re about as far apart as Mum and Uncle Nils. She\rquote s the one who--\'94
\par 
\par \'93--got your father to talk people here into taking Nita for doctor\rquote s training. I know. She said.\'94 Harry thought of pointing out th
at Lucius Malfoy had also paid for the magnificent room they were in, but he stopped himself. Hermione would launch a tirade far worse than his if she knew about that. There was some awkward silence.
\par 
\par \'93Anyway,\'94 Ron said abruptly, bringing a bag out from behind his back. \'93I brought you a few things.\'94 He started taking items out of the bag and laying them on the bed. \'93
Quidditch Through the Ages, Flying with the Cannons, and your Omnioculars, so you can watch the Cannons/Harpies game again, if you like. Oh, and Hermione thought you might want your N.E.W.T. book,\'94
 he added, with a sidelong glance at Hermione, to see whether she had detected the humour in his voice. Harry grinned.
\par 
\par \'93Thanks. But tomorrow\rquote s the first. I don\rquote t know when they\rquote re letting me out of here. I\rquote d hate to miss the feast tomorrow night.\'94
\par 
\par \'93Oh, before we came in, we saw a Dr. Clancy in the corridor and asked him about you,\'94 Hermione said. \'93He said you won\rquote t be able to take the Hogwarts Express, but they\rquote ll take you right to Hogwarts tomorrow ev
ening in an ambulance, so you won\rquote t miss the feast. You are Head Boy, after all. Can\rquote t be missing that.\'94
\par 
\par Harry grinned at her, then frowned almost immediately. \'93But what about my other things?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Don\rquote t worry, Harry,\'94 Ron told him. \'93I went to Ascog for this lot and Sirius is going to bring the rest of your things to Hogwarts for you. He\rquote 
s staying for the feast, he said. He wanted to come with us to see you, and Remus too, but--\'94 He hesitated.
\par 
\par \'93What?\'94
\par 
\par \'93Well, the operatives are very busy, suddenly. I think they\rquote re worried about something big happening soon. Snape\rquote s in on it too. But he and Sirius both say they\rquote ll be at the castle for the feast tomorrow night.\'94
\par 
\par \'93I hope that\rquote s not just optimism talking,\'94 Harry said darkly, remembering that Severus Snape had been missing most of the previous year.
\par 
\par Hermione looked grim. \'93That\rquote s what we all hope,\'94 she said quietly. Harry found himself looking at Ginny, feeling very guilty about this now, as she stood with Draco Malfoy\rquote s arm around her. The boy who had saved his life. She\rquote 
d been very quiet.
\par 
\par \'93How are you?\'94 he asked her now. He realized now that he\rquote d pushed her to the ground rather violently just before he was hit by the fireball, and just the day before she\rquote d taken a bad fall from a horse. He\rquote d been very angry w
ith Draco Malfoy about that, and even more so when Draco had claimed to not know why the horse had bolted. Unfortunately, Harry had felt he couldn\rquote t reveal that he\rquote d seen him slap Ginny\rquote s horse when he\rquote 
d held the amulet. Plus, at the Spinnets\rquote , Ginny had t
old the doctor that the horse had been spooked for no apparent reason, covering up for Draco. Harry had claimed he just happened on her, so that made all three of them lying about what had occurred. And, he remembered, I still haven\rquote 
t given her the amulet...
\par 
\par Ginny gave him a small smile. \'93I\rquote m fine.\'94
 She looked sideways at Ron, cautiously, as though he might contradict her. Their visit was cut short, though, when a nurse came into the room with a tray of food for Harry. She told the four that they needed to
 go and let Harry rest. Hermione leaned over and kissed him lightly on the cheek, and Ginny followed suit, her lips lingering for just a moment as Harry looked into her eyes, his heart aching. Ron and Draco both nodded at him and then they were gone and H
arry was left alone with his food.
\par 
\par He toyed with the mashed potatoes and limp beans with his fork, feeling rather lonely. Pushing the tray away, he fell onto his stomach again, idly leafing through the Cannons book, watching Quidditch players fly about on the pages.
\par 
\par He wasn\rquote t sure how long he\rquote d lain there when there was a knock on the heavy door. \'93Come in,\'94
 he said, not looking up from his book. He heard the door open and feet walking toward him. He reckoned it was a nurse or an orderly, taking his tray aw
ay, but he was completely unprepared for the hands that clamped themselves onto his head, and the all-too-familiar voice, sounding just as it had in the tent in Surrey.
\par 
\par \'93Believe!\'94 the voice cried.
\par 
\par Harry\rquote s head felt like it was going to explode. Then--he saw light behind his eyelids. And there was rain, blessed rain. Suddenly, he was standing in a bright field, naked, and cool, soothing water was cascading over him. He didn\rquote 
t have his glasses on, but he could see everything around him with complete clarity
. The rain fell on his face, and he grinned, looking up, holding his arms out, welcoming it. His hair was plastered wetly against his head, he felt the rain rolling in rivulets down his back, and then he felt tongue after tongue of water moving on his bac
k, not just down, following gravity, but up, down, sideways, in circles, soothing the skin, renewing it, and he felt the most amazing inner peace and happiness, and knew that everything was going to be all right....
\par 
\par He slowly opened his eyes; he saw the headboard of the bed and his pillow in the flickering candlelight. It was night; he didn\rquote t know how long he\rquote d been lying there, how long he\rquote 
d been imagining standing in the field, in the rain. His breathing was steady and slow. He felt-- remarkable. Rodney Jeffries has healed me. He didn\rquote t know how Jeffries had gotten into St. Mungo\rquote s, how he\rquote 
d even known Harry was there, or what room he was in. He knew security was tight since the Diagon Alley attack. A hospital was meant to be a safe place; a sanctuary. He wasn't sure he felt so safe any more. And yet--it wasn\rquote 
t a Death Eater or someone else with evil intentions who had come into his room. He was certain that Jeffries had healed him. He raised himself on his arms and as the muscles in his back moved, he coul
d tell that the bandage and poultice were no longer on it. Harry looked over his shoulder, expecting to see Rodney Jeffries.
\par 
\par The room was empty. Harry scrambled to his feet and ran to the door, looking frantically up and down the high corridor, then turning and looking at the Minister\rquote s room again.
\par 
\par Whoever had healed him was no longer there.
\par 
\par Then he saw that, in his haste, he\rquote d caused a parchment to fall to the floor from the bed. He bent over and picked it up.
\par 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Dear Harry,
\par 
\par I hope that you are feeling better and that I was able to be helpful. That is all I have ever wanted. You may have already surmised some of the truth about me. As you may have suspected, I was a Squib, before the Westminster attack. Now I am something els
e. I hesitate to call myself a wizard, as I am not credentialed. I merely have some magical abilities that I have striven to use for good. Whether I have always succeeded is a matter of some debate, I suppose, but that has always been my goal.
\par 
\par After I saw 
you in Surrey, I was afraid that Aurors might pursue me and attempt to keep me from helping people, since I assumed that you have powerful protectors following you always. I discovered, of course, that that is not the case, but only after I put memory cha
rms on my staff and discharged them. Their disappearances made headlines, but their reappearances didn\rquote t, of course. They are all with their families once more.
\par 
\par By the time you read this I will be gone from St. Mungo\rquote s. Having healed you, I know that I cannot refrain from sharing this gift any longer. Since I saw you in Surrey, I\rquote 
ve been going mad, not daring to help people who need it. I have decided that I will no longer be frightened of doing what I know is right. I\rquote m afraid I have something of a major d
ifference of opinion with the rest of the wizarding world on this subject. I believe that with great power comes great responsibility. (Yes, I\rquote m quoting someone else. I don\rquote t remember who. But I believe he was right). I don\rquote 
t believe that those with magica
l ability should shut themselves away for fear that muggles will demand magical solutions to everything, or in fear that the witch hunts of the Middle Ages will be reborn. I believe it is our obligation to provide these solutions that muggles do not have.
 
I believe it is woefully irresponsible to keep from the vast majority of mankind information that could help eradicate deadly diseases, hunger, poverty, war. I believe it is irresponsible to see someone suffering and refuse to help because of ideological 
considerations.
\par 
\par I want to be able to live with myself again. I want to know that my life has purpose and meaning and that I have made a difference and changed people\rquote s lives for the better. I could have left without telling you any of this, but I felt you 
should know. Having helped you, I know that I cannot remain hidden away, keeping my abilities to myself. I plan to resume the work in which I was engaged before. I know there will be obstacles, both in the wizarding and muggle worlds, but I will not let t
hose obstacles stop me. From what I know of you since you started Hogwarts, I believe that if you were in my position, you would do the same thing.
\par 
\par I hope your aunt is doing well and that you have a good term.

d-Three-Quarters with his new robes billowing out behind him, his Head Boy badge pinned to the ebony silk, smiling at the sight of the Hogwarts Express on this crisp, clear September first. The air was redolent of new leather and brass, from the first-yea
rs\rquote  trunks, but the prevalent scent was of autumn, even above the sulfur odor of the train engine, and Harry breathed it all in happily; it was the smell of going home, the smell of returning to Hogwarts.

\par "Yes, Harry Potter. I know. That is the twenty-third time you have told me." She sounded just a bit impatient. 
\par Harry thought for a moment before hissing, "You know, Sandy, I don't know why, but it never occurred to me that you could count." 
\par "Just because I do not have fingers and toes does not mean I cannot count, Harry Potter." 
\par Harry smirked and did not rise to the bait; she seemed a little touchy lately about anti-snake prejudice. 
\par Humming happily, he headed for a clump of people out of wh
ich blossomed, like some exotic plant, the tall red head of his best friend, Ron Weasley. He stood outside the group for a moment, waiting for them to notice him, glad that he was going to be able to return to school in the normal way. It was the last tim
e, after all, that he would be getting the Hogwarts Express at eleven o\rquote clock on September first from King\rquote s Cross Station, London. He didn\rquote t want to miss it. 
\par When Dean Thomas suddenly noticed him, all at once there was an uproar, and Harry couldn\rquote t help l
aughing out loud as his friends fell on him. Ron needed to be told not to hug so hard (he obviously still required some werewolf training regarding that), while Hermione trod on his toes as she jumped up and threw her arms around his neck. Neville grinned
 ear to ear, standing back shyly, Dean pumped his hand, and Seamus patted him on the back vigorously, then stopped, horrified, as he remembered Harry\rquote s burn injury. But Harry told him it was all right, he was completely healed. 
\par \'93Harry,\'94 Ron sputtered in amazement, \'93what are you doing here?\'94 
\par Harry shrugged, still smiling broadly. \'93I\rquote m fine. Like new.\'94 He noticed Draco Malfoy now, his arm around Ginny as though restraining her, and he said to him, \'93Must have been that cousin of yours. After she took care of me, I was a new man,
\'94 he said, grinning, letting him take that as a double-entendre if he liked. Ginny\rquote s eyes went wide and he winked at her, feeling puckish. 
\par When he was trying to convince the hospital staff to discharge him from St. Mungo\rquote s, he had told Clancy, \'93That junior of yours, Anderssen, really did the trick. You\rquote ve taught her well.\'94
 He had decided not to tell anyone about Rodney Jeffries. 
\par Clancy had been disbelieving until he\rquote d examined Harry himself. He\rquote d taken Nita off a little ways then and started speaking to her in a very irate tone. Harry heard her when she raised her voice and said, \'93I didn\rquote 
t do a damn thing but what you told me to do. Give me some Veritaserum if you like! I\rquote ll tell you the same thing!\'94 Then she turned on her heel and strode off, but not before glaring hatefully at Harry. He wondered whether she\rquote 
d be in trouble for speaking that way to her senior, but he wasn\rquote t sure he cared. Nita was friendly with Narcissa Malfoy, and that was enough for him. 
\par When Clancy was satisfied that Harry really was completely recovered, he\rquote d had an orderly bring Sandy to him, as well as some clothes that Sirius had dropped off, and they\rquote 
d let him return to Ascog Castle. Since Sirius had already left with his trunk, all he needed to do was retrieve his Head Boy badge (Ron hadn\rquote t known he\rquote d put it in a secret compartment of his top desk drawer). 
\par He was able to Floo to Diagon Alley, since he wasn\rquote t bringing his trunk, and he\rquote d carried his robes over his arm like an overcoat while he rode the Underground to King\rquote 
s Cross. He had a rucksack over one shoulder with the things Ron had brought to the hospital, so he looked like any other student on the Tube. He\rquote d been positively giddy when he walked through the barrier between platforms nine and ten. 
\par Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Draco took one of the forward compartments set aside for prefects; Ron hesitated for a moment, as the only one among them who wasn\rquote 
t a prefect, but Harry reminded him that he was Head Boy and Hermione was Head Girl; who was going to argue with them about their best friend being in one of the prefects\rquote  compartments? 
\par The first thing Hermione did as the train started moving was put Crookshanks on Ron\rquote s lap, where Argent was already curled up, so she could pull out a rolled-up parchment and read it. 
\par \'93Hey!\'94 Ron yelled as the cats started hissing at each other and batting with their paws. \'93My lap is already taken. Here, Harry. You take Crookshanks.\'94 Ron nudged the large ginger-colored cat off his lap and toward Harry, who was sitting on 
his other side. Draco Malfoy, who was sitting across from them with Ginny, was clearly horrified. Harry noticed that when Ginny was holding her black cat MacKenzie on her lap--as she was now--her boyfriend sat several inches away from her, pale as a ghost
. 
\par Ron thrust his face between Hermione and her parchment. \'93What\rquote s this then? As Head Girl, you will be responsible for-- blimey, Hermione. Can\rquote t this wait until you get to school?\'94 
\par She started to say, \'93I\rquote m Head Girl now, and I have to--\'94 but stopped when she saw the pleading expression in his eyes. She sighed and rolled up the parchment again, saying, \'93Oh, all right....\'94 
\par Harry was amazed; he had always had a much harder time getting Hermione to relax when she was his girlfriend. He smirked at Ron. \'93If you\rquote re not careful, Ron, you\rquote ll be corrupting our Head Girl. Next thing you know, she\rquote 
ll be doing her assignments at the last minute....making up her Arithmancy homework....\'94 
\par \'93Oh, as if I could!\'94 she burst out indignantly. \'93It\rquote s not the same as Divination. Thank heavens I\rquote ve seen the last of that.\'94 
\par Ginny bristled. \'93My sister is quite good at all forms of Divination, I\rquote ll have you know. And even Professor Snape, who wouldn\rquote t give Professor Trelawney the time of day, respects her abilities. And Maggie says tha
t Arithmancy is just another form of Divination anyway, and one based on far more superstition than something like Astrology, which is very complex and requires much more in the way of calculations and knowledge of Astronomy. Why, she says Arithmancy is h
ardly better than Bibliomancy.\'94 Ginny sounded like she was challenging Hermione. 
\par "What does that girl have against people with the Sight?" Sandy suddenly hissed at Harry from under his clothing. He chose to ignore her; the last thing he needed was to be a translator of Parseltongue in a three-way argument about Divination. 
\par \'93Oh, really?\'94 Hermione said tartly. \'93Well, Professor Vector says--\'94 
\par Ron quickly intervened before his girlfriend and his sister could escalate the argument, and soon the Divination/Arit
hmancy wars were forgotten. After the tension had died out between the girls, Harry thought that it was his most enjoyable ride to Hogwarts in a very long time. They went through several rounds of Exploding Snap, and played with the cats (except for Draco
 
Malfoy), and bought too many sweets and laughed and talked and laughed some more. Harry was glad to see that Draco Malfoy was letting himself be drawn out a bit; he even managed to laugh at his own ailurophobia (as Hermione knew his cat-fear was correctly
 termed). Harry was more than a little worried about him after his reaction to cursing Fleur Delacour. 
\par It seemed in no time they were pulling into Hogsmeade Station and seeing Hagrid\rquote s head rearing up above the crowd of students, as usual. \'93All right, Harry?\'94 he boomed out, grinning, as he strode toward him. 
\par Harry beamed back at him. \'93I\rquote m all right, Hagrid. And you?\'94 
\par To his surprise, Hagrid shrugged. \'93I\rquote ll do, I suppose. Here; the headmaster wanted me ter give yeh this as soon as yeh was off the train.\'94 He extended to Harry a rolled-up parchment that looked just like Hermione\rquote 
s, and he assumed it began, \lquote As Head Boy, you will be responsible for--\rquote  Harry stuffed it into his robes. 
\par \'93Thanks, Hagrid.\'94 Hagrid gave him a very small smile--he seemed rather subdued, to Harry\rquote s eyes--and then turned and strode toward the small dock, booming out, \'93Firs\rquote -years, follow me! All firs\rquote -years! Attention--\'94 
\par The five of them left the platform and scrambled into a horseless carriage to Hogwarts. Harry watched the castle gro
w nearer, the windows glowing with light, the most beautiful sight he knew. When they walked into the Great Hall, the myriad candles floating over the tables and the ceiling a perfect image of the starry night sky, Harry truly felt that all was well with 
the world. He knew there were problems in the wizarding world still (not the least of which was the reason for Roger\rquote s and Alicia\rquote 
s wedding), but somehow the unchanging reliability of Hogwarts gave him faith that it would all work out in the end. 
\par The retur
ning students were seated and after a little while the new first-years finally entered, some of them slightly damp (the trip across the lake was sometimes a bit choppy). Hagrid nodded at Harry again without smiling as he made his way to the front table, a
nd Harry watched very carefully as each first-year was sorted, knowing this was the last time he was going to be seeing this ritual. 
\par One of the first students to be sorted was Gabrielle Delacour. When Harry saw her, his face fell. Her sister\rquote s mind is gone and she\rquote s sitting in St. Mungo\rquote s, where she\rquote 
ll eventually deliver her child with no understanding of what is happening to her... 
\par Gabrielle was a good deal taller as a first-year than she was as an eight-year-old. She was one of the tallest, in fact. She advanced on the Sorting Hat, her gait stately as a queen\rquote 
s, and Harry could see that her veela charms were affecting some of the boys, in spite of her youth. He noticed, for instance, that Orion Pierson was standing on his toes to peer over some of the other first years to watch her. 
\par \'93Gryffindor!\'94 the hat decided after it had been on her head for a very brief time. A roar of approval went up from the Gryffindor table and Harry smiled at her as she approach
ed it, remembering how grateful her sister had been for his not wanting anyone under the water to be left behind during the Second Task, regardless of whose hostage was whose. However, unlike many of the first-years who were over the moon about finally be
ing at Hogwarts, Gabrielle looked back at Harry briefly with a flat, dead expression in her blue eyes. She seated herself well away from him, but whether this was intentional or accidental, he could not tell. 
\par When Orion Pierson was finally walking forward to be sorted, he gave Harry a sideways glance, his dark eyes very large, and Harry grinned at him. Orion hadn\rquote 
t been at Ascog the night before; he and his dad had gone to London the previous evening, taking the last ferry to the mainland, and then getting the Knight Bus to the city. (They couldn\rquote t get the Knight Bus on the Isle of Bute as it didn\rquote 
t travel across water.) They\rquote d stayed at the Leaky Cauldron overnight before getting a taxi to the station. Harry watched Sirius\rquote  nephew approach the Sorting Hat, looking very nervous, but soon after it was on his head, it was crying, \'93
Gryffindor!\'94 Orion took it off, a thrilled grin splitting his face, as the Gryffindor table burst into cheers and applause yet again. 
\par Dumbledore stood to speak when the sorting was finished, but before he had even opened his mouth, Harry\rquote 
s jaw dropped. He had finally looked at the front table, really looked. He was glad to see Sirius (which meant his trunk had also arrived), as Ron had mentioned the operatives being involved in someth
ing important, and he imagined that he was probably very pleased that his nephew was sorted into Gryffindor. He saw that Snape was present as well, and he had very nearly forgotten about Mrs. Figg being the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. It wa
s so odd to see her dressed in iridescent aquamarine robes and a pointed purple hat, rather than a blue shirtwaist and an ivory cardigan decorated with cat hair. He would have to remember to call her Professor Figg. 
\par But the truly surprising thing was that Maggie Dougherty was sitting with the rest of the staff, wearing robes and a pointed hat for the first time, as far as Harry knew. It was the first time he\rquote 
d seen her dressed this way, at any rate. She was seated between Snape and--Harry did another take--Professor Trelawney, who almost never came down from her tower. Trelawney didn\rquote 
t seem very pleased, he thought. In fact, she looked downright rebellious. 
\par Dumbledore greeted them all cheerfully and bade them to eat up. The food appeared on the tables soon after that, and when the last crumb from the last pudding had disappeared, the headmaster stood again and smiled benignly at them all. 
\par \'93Welcome, one and all! I know you are all looking forward to a new term! I need to give out some notices now, but be pat
ient and you will soon all be in your common rooms. I have some exciting developments to tell you about! I am pleased to say that the Ministry of Magic has authorized Hogwarts to give instruction in Apparition to all seventh-year students during the autum
n
 term, the goal being for those students to take their Apparition tests during the Christmas holidays. These lessons will take place in Hogsmeade at the village hall, as it is not possible to Apparate or Disapparate on the school grounds. The Apparition l
essons will be taught by Sirius Black.\'94
 He waved his hand toward Sirius, who half-rose out of his chair, smiling and nodding at the students. Some of them stared openly at him, wide-eyed and horrified. Obviously most of them still remembered him as Sirius-B
lack-the-escaped-murderer, Harry thought, despite the recent news that he\rquote 
d been framed. Harry wondered how many students would actually opt to learn Apparition with Sirius for a teacher. He saw that Orion was shrinking down in his seat a little, and then Harry wondered whether the boy would admit to being Sirius Black\rquote 
s nephew. 
\par \'93During the spring term,\'94 Dumbledore went on, \'93those sixth-years who have had their seventeenth birthdays during October, November and December will begin their Apparition lessons,
 with the goal of their taking their tests during the Easter holidays. During the summer term, sixth years who have had their seventeenth birthdays before the Easter holidays or right after will have their turn. If you do not pass your test during the Chr
istmas or Easter holidays, you will have the opportunity to keep plugging away until the end of the summer term. 
\par \'93Any sixth- or seventh-years who do not wish to learn Apparition need not attend the lessons. A student who wishes to cease attending the Appar
ition lessons may do so at any time. Not everyone finds they have a knack for it. Why, I had an uncle who once splinched himself so spectacularly that ever after, when he blew his nose--\'94
 Next to him, Professor McGonagall cleared her throat noisily and raised her eyebrows. He smiled ruefully and continued. \'93
But I digress. Let me stress again that this is not mandatory. It is merely an opportunity which I, the Board of Governors, and the Ministry of Magic wished to extend to Hogwarts students who are of-age and who wish to avail themselves of it.\'94 
\par There had been a general buzz of conversation beneath Dumbledore\rquote s voice ever since they all understood what he was saying. Apparition lessons! Despite the trepidation some people seemed to have about Sirius Black 
being the teacher, many students seemed nonetheless to be very excited. Hermione\rquote s face was shining. 
\par \'93Isn\rquote t that wonderful?\'94 she asked Ron and Harry. \'93And here I thought I\rquote d have to wait until after I\rquote m out of school...\'94 She stopped abruptly when she saw Ron\rquote 
s expression, and Harry remembered that Ron would not be attending the lessons, as werewolves could not Apparate. She glanced uncertainly at Harry, at a loss; he pulled his mouth into a line and shook his head at her, hoping she wouldn\rquote 
t say any more. Then suddenly, he jumped; Sandy was moving under his clothing. Now she put her face out of his collar, looking around for a few seconds before retreating again. 
\par "What're you up to, then?" he asked her. 
\par "I just wanted to see the world for once, Harry Potter. Is that permitted?" He didn't have a chance to answer her, however, as Dumbledore was speaking again. 
\par \'93I would also like all of you to welcome Miss Arabella Figg as our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Many of you were taught by Professor Figg\rquote s brother, Alastor Moody, two years ago!\'94
 he said with a smile. Many of those students, Harry noticed, appeared even more alarmed than when they were informed of Sirius\rquote  new role at the school. Harry wondered whether Dumbledore was soon going to be caug
ht in a storm of owls from parents questioning his faculty appointments. 
\par \'93I have just one more new teacher to introduce to you all,\'94 Professor Dumbledore said, after the mumbling about Professors Figg and Moody had died down. \'93Joining our esteemed Profess
or Trelawney in the Divination Tower will be Miss Margaret Dougherty, a fine Seer who will be relieving Professor Trelawney of the third and fourth year students so that she may have more time to work on her nearly-completed book,\'94
 he picked up a piece of parchment and peered through his half-moon spectacles at it, \'93How to Look Death in the Face and Laugh, or Accepting Your Own Grisly Demise with Grace in Twenty-Nine Easy Lessons.\'94
 His blue eyes twinkled behind his spectacles. \'93I am certain we shall all be queuing up to buy Professor Trelawney\rquote s new book when it is published.\'94 
\par There was some amused snorting in the hall. Dumbledore continued, \'93Miss Dougherty is a witch, naturally, but, alas, due to circumstances beyond her control, she did not have access to
 a magical education in her youth. However, she has passed N.E.W.T.-level examinations in Astronomy, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies and Divination with flying colors--\'94 (Ron and Ginny were beaming proudly) \'93
--and is looking forward to joining so
me of you in your classes in order to be able to attain her full magical credentials eventually. I know that you will be quite respectful of her admirable ambition to finish her magical education, even though you are not accustomed to having an older stud
ent present during your classes.\'94 He was smiling when he said this, but he also presented a very stern visage, and Harry knew that anyone giving Maggie a hard time would hear about it from Dumbledore himself. 
\par "So, you didn't see that coming, eh Sandy?" he hissed softly toward his arm. 
\par Sandy sniffed disdainfully. "Of course I did. That's what I was checking." 
\par "Why didn't you say something, then?" 
\par "I See many things, Harry Potter. Why should I tell you about something that you can see for yourself? With eyes, I mean, rather than with the Sight. She was sitting right there. You couldn't have guessed why?" 
\par Harry was going to ask her what else she wasn't telling him because she assumed he knew, but the notices continued. 
\par \'93Now, then, on to other issues beside
s the staff. I am sorry to say that with the exception of the prefects and those seventh-year students who choose to take advantage of the Apparition lessons, no students will be permitted to visit Hogsmeade this term, on the weekend or otherwise. Prefect
s below seventh-year will only be permitted to go when they are on school business, sent either by me or another professor. It saddens me to make this decision, especially as I am certain the third-year students were looking forward to going....\'94 

\par \'93Too right!\'94
 Jules Quinn said grumpily, and Harry saw Will Flitwick gazing desperately at Jamaica Thomas, who raised her eyebrows and shrugged in a hopeless sort of way. (Dean Thomas, on the other hand, seemed quite pleased.) Had Will been hoping to take Jamaica to
 Hogsmeade on a date? Harry wondered. It was too bad for the third-years; he remembered how crushed he\rquote d been by the Dursleys not giving him permission to go. 
\par \'93Well,\'94 Harry said feebly to Gillian Lockley, who was sitting across from him; \'93at least none of you can go. It\rquote s not just one of you.\'94 
\par He was trying to put a good spin on the situation. This, however, was no help at all, evidently. Gillian actually broke into tears and started crying on Natalie McDonald\rquote s shoulder. She wasn\rquote t the only one in the Gr
eat Hall responding this way; Harry could see and hear the disappointment emanating from the other house tables. Some of the Slytherin third-years were grumbling rather loudly, and one struck the table forcibly. Natalie, who was a fourth year now, had jus
t been able to start going to Hogsmeade the previous year and clearly also felt the loss. She patted Gillian\rquote s back and said softly, \'93As Head Boy, of course, you\rquote ll be able to go.\'94
 It was impossible not to hear the slight edge of bitterness in her voice. 
\par He cleared his throat awkwardly. \'93Well, erm, only on school business, of course,\'94 he said weakly. \'93And for Apparition lessons.\'94 
\par Natalie continued to pat Gillian\rquote s back and say, \'93There, there,\'94 in a comforting sort of way, but she still looked a bit disgruntled herself. 
\par \'93--and finally,\'94 Dumbledore was saying now, ignoring the general grumbling in the hall, \'93Mr. Filch has made a recommendation which, in light of last term\rquote 
s tragic events, I think is highly prudent. Every evening, all students must be in their houses by nine o\rquote 
clock. After that hour you may only venture forth accompanied by a prefect and with a note from your head-of-house concerning your reasons for being out and about in the castle. I do not intend to keep students from visiting the hospital
 wing when they need to, nor retrieving books from classrooms which were left accidentally and are needed for completing assignments. But you will need to have proper clearances to do these things. To prevent students attempting to circumvent this rule, a
ll prefects and teachers will be assigned times to patrol the corridors of the castle in the evenings, and believe me when I say that if you leave your house without the proper permissions, it will be known.\'94 
\par Harry felt like Dumbledore's eyes were boring into his, and he wondered whether he had his own version of the Marauders\rquote 
 Map. He had never seen Dumbledore look more stern while giving out notices; he was usually rather jovial on the first day of term. No one was laughing now. He went on, very gravely. \'93
Last term a group of students took the teachers prisoner in one of the common rooms.\'94 He did not say that it was the Slytherin common room, perhaps to avoid alarming the first-years. \'93
While it eventually came to light that those students were victims themselves of the Imperius Curse, it never should have been possible for someone to curse those students and force them to imprison their professors. Expect,\'94
 he said now, his voice steely, his face quite uncompromising, \'93to suffer very dire consequences if yo
u are out-of-bounds this term. One infraction will warrant not one but three detentions; after that I will not hesitate to suspend students, even prefects,\'94
 he said, this time looking at Draco Malfoy, Harry thought. Harry could see Malfoy swallow, and thought of the way he\rquote d recklessly flown off to the Forbidden Forest. \'93
If suspension does not convince a wayward student to mend his or her ways, I shall have just one more avenue open to me.\'94 
\par The Great Hall had never been quieter as everyone digested the meaning of his words. It was very clear what he meant. It was Hermione\rquote s worst nightmare: 
\par Expulsion. 
\par Suddenly, Dumbledore clapped his hands and smiled, abruptly cheerful and upbeat. \'93And as usual, Quidditch trials will begin next week and anyone interested should speak to Madam Hooch. So! Let\rquote s all have a good term, shall we?\'94 
\par The students sang the school song to over two-hundred different tunes, but all rather half-heartedly, as everyone was
 still reeling from the news about the canceled Hogsmeade weekends and the nightly patrols. (Every tune being used sounded like a dirge, to Harry, each more depressing than the last.) Harry wondered how much time he and Hermione were going to need to dedi
cate to patrolling. He was glad they were both done their Animagus training. 
\par Harry and Hermione led the Gryffindor students up the stairs to Gryffindor Tower. Hermione asked Ginny and Lucy Bailey, one of the fifth-year prefects, to take the first- and seco
nd-year girls upstairs, while Harry asked Karl Fauth, the other fifth-year prefect, to take first-year boys and Tony Perugia to take the second-years. He and Hermione handled the third years. Before they separated to go up the curving stairs to the girls
\rquote  and boys\rquote  dormitories, Harry whispered to Hermione, \'93I think our worst risk of out-of-bounds students may be the third years. They were expecting more freedom this year.\'94 
\par She nodded grimly. \'93I saw Gillian crying on Natalie. Amy Donegal wasn\rquote t too pleased, either.\'94 
\par \'93On the way up here,\'94 Harry told her quietly, \'93I think I already heard Andy Donegal and Jules Quinn plotting something.\'94 He sighed. He didn\rquote 
t relish the disciplinarian role in which he found himself. He would have found himself in this position 
even if he had still been just a prefect, as he would be the senior prefect in the house this year, but it was far worse to be Head Boy. His own behavior had to be beyond reproach. He hadn\rquote 
t counted on what kind of pressure he would be under as a result. 
\par \'93And then there\rquote s Will and Jamaica,\'94 she whispered, pursing her lips and glancing at the pair of them, chatting near the fireplace, clearly completely absorbed by each other. 
\par \'93What? At their age? You don\rquote t think--\'94 
\par \'93No, Harry, of course not. Not that. Bu
t--well, some students do start snogging at that age. A little. Nothing more than that, but I still get the impression that Dean would throw a wobbly if anyone laid a lip on his sister. That means they might feel the need to do some sneaking around....
\'94 
\par Harry rolled his eyes. \'93I\rquote ve got N.E.W.T.s, Voldemort, the safety of the operatives and a million other things to worry about, and now I\rquote ve got to stay on top of third-years sneaking around to snog. Brilliant. Just what I need.\'94 

\par Orion Pierson waved to Harr
y as the first-year boys trooped up the stairs after Karl; he waved feebly back. He noticed Gabrielle Delacour following Lucy and the first-year girls, a listless expression on her face. He remembered Fleur in her fury, and made a mental note never to ang
er her little sister. Gabrielle might only be eleven years old, but she was still one-quarter veela, and his memories of what kind of danger that represented were still very vividly etched in his mind. 
\par After the first-years had gone, Ginny and Tony led the second-years off to their dorms. Harry leaned close to Hermione and said, \'93
I think we should also keep an eye on Gabrielle Delacour. Do you think--do you think Dumbledore will let her visit her sister in hospital? Especially after--after the baby\rquote s born?\'94 
\par \'93I don\rquote t know. He was very stern tonight. But Fleur\rquote s circumstances are rather extraordinary. I think we should make sure Gabrielle doesn\rquote t get anywhere near Malfoy.\'94 
\par Harry opened his eyes wide. \'93I hadn\rquote t thought of that. You think she\rquote d try to get revenge for what he did to Fleur?\'94 
\par She shrugged. \'93Right now she just seems depressed. I don\rquote t see how she\rquote s going to get anything done in this state. She\rquote ll have no focus to her magic.\'94 
\par \'93Yeah, well right now I prefer veelas with no focus. Much safer, in my opinion.\'94 
\par She laughed and stood on her tiptoes to kiss his cheek. \'93Goodnight, Harry. I\rquote m glad you\rquote re well again. Get some rest.\'94 
\par \'93Here, now, what\rquote s this?\'94 Ron said, striding across the room alarmingly quickly from where he\rquote d been discussing Quidditch with
 Seamus and Neville. (Dean was standing with them, but not participating, choosing instead to glare at Will Flitwick.) 
\par Hermione laughed and put her arms around his waist. \'93You wait here. I\rquote ll be back down to give you a proper goodnight.\'94 
\par A chorus of prurient ooooohs went up from the others in the room, making Hermione blush into her hair. Ron\rquote s ears turned bright red, but he was also grinning. \'93Come on, third year girls!\'94
 she said impatiently; Ginny and the second years having already disappeared, Hermione led the older girls to the staircase. Jamaica glanced over her shoulder at Will, who gave her a small wave and a smile. 
\par \'93Can\rquote t you put a spell on his bed so it turns into a bed of nails in the middle of the night?\'94 came a harsh whisper in Harry\rquote s ear. 
\par He turned suddenly; Dean was standing very close to him, and he shouted in surprise; after he\rquote d calmed down he said angrily, \'93Don\rquote t do that!\'94 Now that he knew it was Dean talking, he had no doubt he\rquote 
d been asking Harry to put a hex on Will Flitwick\rquote s bed. \'93I am not going to hex Will\rquote s bed, Dean! Get a grip!\'94 he whispered fiercely. 
\par He was feeling very irked, not having expected one of his friends to try to get him to abuse his authority. \'93Come on, third-year boys!\'94 he said impatiently, wanting to get to bed
 himself. He herded them up the stairs and remembered doing the same with them when they were first-years, on their first night at Hogwarts. It seemed a lifetime ago. They were little boys at the time; now they already seemed quite grown up. Will Flitwick
 was almost as tall as Harry and Andy Donegal had grown a surprising amount, too. He towered over his twin sister Amy now. 
\par Soon they had reached the dormitory. \'93Well, I won\rquote t hang over you all,\'94 he told them casually, not wanting to get into another conversation about Hogsmeade visits. \'93G\rquote night, lads.\'94 
\par There was a half-hearted chorus of \lquote g\rquote nights,\rquote  and Harry shut the door, glad he was done with his work for the night. He climbed the steps to the top tower room, which now had a sign on the door reading Seve
nth-Years. He paused to stare at it for a moment. My last year. It was such a strange feeling. It seemed like yesterday he was shopping in Diagon Alley for the first time with Hagrid. He traced his fingers idly over the words. Then he heard his dorm mates
 coming up the stairs and hastily turned the knob and entered the room. He was already in his pajamas when the Seamus, Dean and Neville entered. Harry started to get into bed when he realized Ron still hadn\rquote 
t come up. He lay back in the darkness after the other boys had extinguished the candles, falling asleep before Ron came upstairs, despite his best intentions.

mon room to meet the others. Ron was already dressed, stretching on the hearthrug beside Ginny, Tony and Ruth. (Tony and Ruth were now officially a couple.) Hermione came downstairs right after Harry. Annika wasn\rquote 
t coming running, Ginny informed them, but 
Ruth was. Harry thought Annika might only have been participating to try to interest Ron, who was now spoken-for. Apparently Tony had convinced Ruth to start participating in the morning run. Harry smiled at her; he preferred her company to Annika\rquote 
s, anyway. 
\par They met Draco Malfoy and Mariah Kirkner in the entrance hall, as before, and the eight of them set off for the Quidditch pitch for their morning run. However, just as they reached the pitch, a booming voice rang out, \'93Stop right there!\'94 
\par Harry whirled in surprise, just as Fang leapt on him with joy. The huge dog knocked him to the ground and began licking his face so enthusiastically that his glasses were completely covered with dog-saliva. Harry laughed and grimaced at the same time, say
ing, \'93Geroff, Fang,\'94 even while he was affectionately scratching the dog behind his ears. Fang\rquote s welcome notwithstanding, Harry had to admit to himself that Hagrid\rquote 
s tone had been quite worrying; the last time he had heard Hagrid use that voice was when he\rquote d been throttling Karkaroff for insulting Dumbledore, just before the third task of the tournament. \'93Hagrid!\'94
 he said, trying to smile, although he could see that the half-giant wasn\rquote t very happy. He stood and started cleaning his glasses on his shirt while Fang sat next to him, panting happily. \'93I didn\rquote 
t get to talk to you much last night. How are--\'94 
\par \'93You lot are out-of-bounds,\'94 he said gruffly, pulling a piece of parchment out of his pocket. He behaved as though he\rquote d never seen Harry, Ron and Hermione in his entire life, let alone any of the others. 
\par \'93What?\'94 Harry said indignantly. \'93Since when is the Quidditch pitch out of bounds?\'94 Feeling more irritated now than pleased about Fang\rquote s welcome, he wiped his face with his sleeve quickly before replacing his glasses on his nose. 
\par \'93Well, er,\'94 Hagrid waffled, squinting at the parchment now. \'93Not out-of-bounds as far as location, see,\'94 he said uncertainly now, holding the parchment closer still. \'93More like--time-wise, see....\'94 
\par \'93How are we out-of-bounds time-wise?\'94 Draco Malfoy said now, a sneer in his voice, as though he doubted Hagrid could actually tell time. He\rquote d never liked Hagrid, and clearly nothing had changed about that. 
\par \'93Er, let me see--after nine-o\rquote clock, all students must remain in their houses unless they have permission from their head of house to venture forth.... No, that\rquote s not it. Er--\'94
 he said, moving his eyes further down the page, searching for something and not finding it. 
\par \'93Hagrid,\'94 Hermione said reasonably now. \'93The headmaster didn\rquote t say there was anything wrong with being out at seven o\rquote 
clock, nor doing exercise on the Quidditch pitch. I doubt that parchment says anything of the sort. I received a parchment with all of the new rules and regulations, and I recall it saying that the patrols we
re going to take place each night starting at nine o\rquote clock and going until seven in the morning. I read it through twice before going to bed last night.\'94
 Harry realized now that his parchment--the one Hagrid had given him at the station--was probably the same. He hadn\rquote t even glanced at it yet. 
\par Hagrid stared at it some more before admitting, \'93No, I serpose not, if you say so, Hermione. I just--blimey, I\rquote m so jumpy with all these new rules. I didn\rquote  expec\rquote  ter see you lot out here and I was surprised--reckoned it couldn
\rquote t be right for students to be on the pitch two hours b\rquote fore classes...I\rquote m not usually up this early meself, but Fang took on so I reckoned I should check....\'94 
\par Fang had be anxious to see him, Harry knew, grinning at Hagrid. \'93Well, Ron and Ruth are the only ones who aren\rquote t prefects, so don\rquote 
t you think their being accompanied by the Head Boy, Head Girl and four other prefects is certainly adequate to allow them out of Gryffindor House?\'94 Hagrid saw how his eyes were laughing and now he laughed too. 
\par \'93Yeh got me there, Harry. I\rquote m sorry. I\rquote m not lookin\rquote  forward ter doin\rquote  them castle patrols, either. Prob\rquote ly be jumpin\rquote  at ever\rquote  little noise. And Fang\rquote ll be worse.\'94
 He patted the large dog affectionately and Fang lifted his head and whined for a moment. 
\par \'93Well,\'94 Draco Malfoy said, sounding rather impatient. \'93Can we go running now that it\rquote s been determined we\rquote re not out-of-bounds?\'94 Hagrid eyed him distastefully. 
\par \'93I\rquote ll be keepin\rquote  an eye on you, Malfoy,\'94 Hagrid said ominously, his voice softer. \'93I\rquote m not one of\rquote em what believes that Imperius rot. I remember being locked up in yer excuse for a common room last term.\'94 
\par \'93That wasn\rquote t me!\'94 Malfoy said indignantly. \'93I went off to the forest to try to rescue my head-of-house!\'94 
\par \'93Aye, and \lquote twas Harry who wound up doin\rquote  it. Wound up savin\rquote  you, too.\'94
 The unspoken words hung in the air, the words which questioned the wisdom of Harry doing this. Harry could tell Hagrid was itching to say them, but he was a teacher, besides being Harry\rquote s friend, and dared not. 
\par \'93That\rquote s enough, Malfoy,\'94 Harry said sharply. \'93It\rquote s time we started running.\'94 
\par Draco Malfoy allowed himself to be led away from Hagrid by Ginny. \'93I already said,\'94 he commented, sounding petty. Ginny pursed her lips and met Harry\rquote s eyes. She looked very troubled. He hoped he\rquote 
d get a chance to talk to her alone soon. He still had her amulet, and there were other issues to deal with as well. 
\par Under Hagrid\rquote s watchful gaze (he went up into the Quidditch stands with Fang and seemed to be glaring at Malfoy the entire time) t
hey did their running, then returned to the castle to shower and dress for breakfast. When they were seated at the Gryffindor table, Hermione passed out the timetables to the seventh-years. Harry examined it while spooning eggs into his mouth. The morning
 promised to be relatively uneventful, with Charms followed by History of Magic. Then he groaned; after lunch they had Double Divination. That would more than make up for the morning. 
\par He was surprised when he arrived at the Charms classroom and discovered 
that it appeared larger than usual; a wall appeared to have been removed between it and the next room. Hermione, however, did not seem to notice anything out of the ordinary. Another unusual thing was that all of the seventh-year students were present, fr
om all four houses. 
\par \'93Sit, everyone, sit, sit,\'94 Professor Flitwick bade them, grinning happily. There were not quite forty students; desks were arrayed around the edge of the room in two rows, and Professor Flitwick stood on a dais in the centre, while they
, predictably, segregated themselves according to house. Harry grimaced when he saw the Slytherins sitting clockwise from the Gryffindors. The Ravenclaws were across from Gryffindor, and the Hufflepuffs across from Slytherin. 
\par \'93Welcome to Advanced Charms!\'94 Flitwick crowed delightedly. \'93
As you can see, at this level you take classes with all of the other students in your year. This class meets first thing on Tuesday and Thursday, and I expect prefects and those who are members of the Dueling Club to assist m
e in my instruction, so that we can sometimes break up into smaller groups for practical lessons.\'94 His eyes twinkled at Harry especially, as the captain of the Dueling Club. 
\par On this first day, Flitwick restricted himself to lecturing about the charms they
 would be mastering in preparation for their N.E.W.T.s at the end of the summer term. He spoke from memory, without notes, pacing back and forth on his platform, and over three-dozen students diligently wrote down everything he said, the room silent excep
t for his high-pitched voice and the sound of quills scratching on parchment. 
\par When the bell rang, Harry flexed his hand, feeling like it was going to fall off. He followed Ron and Hermione down the stairs and out into a courtyard, thankful for the morning break. He collapsed onto the grass, groaning. Ron joined him. 
\par \'93God, has he been taking lessons from Binns about how to be boring?\'94 Ron whinged, while Hermione ignored the pair of them and pored over her Charms notes, making corrections here and there. 
\par \'93Don\rquote t forget, Ron,\'94 Harry reminded him, \'93we\rquote ve got the real thing now. Binns, that is. Another hour-and-a-half of writing, writing, writing....\'94 
\par Ron groaned and closed his eyes. \'93I\rquote m going to be snoring about ten minutes in, if that.\'94 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93Well, Binns generally doesn\rquote t notice people sleeping. What disturbs him is someone actually paying attention,\'94
 he added, remembering how shocked Binns had been in second year when Hermione had tried to ask him about the Chamber of Secrets. 
\par Harry was, in fact
, looking forward to History of Magic, as he felt he could do with a little nap. However, they had no sooner reached the classroom after the end of break, than Filch stopped him and Hermione and told them, sneering the entire time, that the headmaster nee
ded to speak to them. Before following Filch away from the room, he saw that History of Magic was also much fuller than usual, again being populated by the entire complement of seventh-year students. Draco Malfoy\rquote 
s mouth was twisting when he saw that Harry and Hermione were being called away; he looked more than a little jealous that they didn\rquote t have to sit through an hour-and-a-half of Binns. 
\par Hermione, on the other hand was very grumpy as they walked in Filch\rquote s wake. She was the only person Harry knew who liked History of Magic, having read Hogwarts, A History numerous times (more times than the authors, Harry suspected). 
\par When they reached the stone gargoyle that guarded the entrance to Dumbledore\rquote s office, Filch croaked out, \'93Chocolate Frogs.\'94 
\par The passage slid open and Filch stepped aside, after saying belligerently, \'93Did\rquote ja both hear what I said?\'94 They nodded mutely. \'93Good. Remember it. As Head Boy and Girl you\rquote ll need it. But--don\rquote t tell anyone else,\'94
 he growled, \'93if you know what\rquote s good for you.\'94 
\par The hair was standing up on the back of Harry\rquote s neck. Hermione had gone pale beneath her tan. They both nodded, still not speaking, before turning away from him. The wall closed behind them and the rising spiral stairs brought them up to Dumbledore
\rquote s office door quickly. Before they could knock, they heard the headmaster\rquote s voice saying, \'93Come in, come in, Harry and Hermione.\'94 
\par Harry opened the heavy oak door, smiling as he saw the September sunshine pouring in the windows of the tower room, seeing all
 of the familiar acoutrements--the model of the solar system, the Sorting Hat, the portraits of former headmasters and headmistresses, dozing peacefully in their frames, and Fawkes, Dumbledore\rquote 
s pet phoenix, dozing on his perch near an open window. 
\par Dumbledore was not alone in the room; Maggie Dougherty already sat in a chair in front of the headmaster\rquote 
s desk, and Severus Snape stood next to her. The headmaster smiled at Harry and Hermione as they entered. Maggie beamed, then spoke as though she could no longer restrain herself. 
\par \'93Harry! Hermione! I\rquote ve just been Sorted. I\rquote m a Gryffindor!\'94 
\par Hermione rushed forward and hugged her. \'93Oh! That\rquote s wonderful!\'94 Then she noticed Snape standing nearby. \'93I mean--er, well, that is--\'94 
\par \'93You are allowed to be glad that someone of Miss Dougherty\rquote s calibre is in your house, Miss Granger,\'94 he informed her stiffly. \'93
She will not, however, be actually living in Gryffindor House, as she is also on the staff. She will be living in the staff quarters.\'94 
\par Harry raised his eyebrows. He remembered living in the staff quarters himself. That meant Maggie and Snape wouldn\rquote 
t be that far apart. He wondered whether they would continue to have some kind of relationship now that they were both at Hogwarts, since Maggie was going to be studying 
Potions, among other things, meaning that she had dated her professor. This could get complicated, he realized. He wondered whether Dumbledore had spoken to the Sorting Hat to make sure she would not be in Slytherin House (not that there was probably any 
danger of that) so that the authority Snape would have over her would only be during Potions classes. 
\par \'93If you have any problems, you may take them to Harry and Hermione, as the senior prefects in your house,\'94 Dumbledore told Maggie now, \'93or to your head-of-house, Professor McGonagall.\'94 
\par Maggie nodded deferentially to him. \'93Yes, sir. I\rquote ll remember that.\'94 Dumbledore waved her \'93sir\'94 away impatiently. 
\par \'93Now, now, you are a grown woman and also a teacher. You may call me Albus, as the other teachers do. You know, two of your brothers were Head Boys? And your sister is a prefect?\'94 
\par She smiled. \'93Yes, I know. Do--do the staff and students know that I am actually a Weasley?\'94 
\par Dumbledore sighed. \'93No, that is not generally known. Some people who see a resemblance betwe
en you and your sister may guess, but I would prefer not to have it be general knowledge that you are actually Peggy Weasley. There was a reason why Peter Pettigrew was told to kill you and your sister, and while I do not believe either of you is the Daug
h
ter of War in the Prophecy, that will not prevent others from trying to please Voldemort by eliminating all those who may be viable candidates. I do not discount the possibility that, even with all of the precautions that we have taken, Voldemort may have
 
many eyes and ears here at the school. While I generally feel that Hogwarts is a very safe place, we were shown last term how easily breached it could be. I do not wish to see you endangered, my dear. The students shall call you Miss Dougherty when you ar
e teaching them and Maggie when you are a fellow student, and the staff shall call you Miss Dougherty when they are teaching you and Maggie when you are in the staff room and other venues in which you are their peer.\'94 
\par Harry met Dumbledore's gaze now. \'93Won\rquote t that get a little confusing? Some of the students may be taught by her and then sitting next to her in class.\'94 
\par \'93Not as yet. She will be teaching third and fourth year Divination students, and attending a number of first year classes. However, I am count
ing on the pair of you to intervene if there should be any--complications resulting from this arrangement. Maggie has a very full schedule. She will be teaching three mornings and one afternoon, and taking Transfiguration, Potions, Defense Against the Dar
k
 Arts, Charms, History of Magic and Herbology during the other class periods, although she has the option of simply reading the material for History of Magic and taking the tests, so that she will have something of a break in her schedule. Severus has als
o offered to tutor her in Potions on the weekend, so that she may advance more quickly and perhaps join the second-year students in the spring term.\'94 Harry raised his eyebrows, but Dumbledore did not seem to see any possible problem with this plan. 

\par \'93Speaking of potions, sir, who, um, is tending to the class right now?\'94 Harry asked uncertainly. Snape bristled. 
\par \'93Thank you for being so concerned for my students\rquote  well-being, Mr. Potter, but I asked the fifth-year Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw prefects to stay after
 the morning lesson, and they are currently overseeing the class. Miss Dougherty--er, Maggie--and I will be returning to the dungeons shortly for the first-year Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws to have their class. Which classes she attends will have no connect
ion to the fact that she is a Gryffindor.\'94 
\par Harry felt his face grow warm. \'93Is that all for now, sir?\'94 Harry asked Dumbledore. 
\par \'93Yes and no. I must ask you to convey to Ginny, Ron and Draco Malfoy the importance of not broadcasting Maggie\rquote s Weasley background. If anyone else knows--actually, does anyone else know?\'94 
\par Harry thought, his brow furrowed. \'93There\rquote s Sirius and Remus. The rest of the Weasleys--which might also include Lee Jordan and Angelina Johnson, since they live at Hog\rquote s End with Percy and the tw
ins. And Katie Bell. She just started Auror training.\'94 
\par Dumbledore tented his fingers and looked thoughtful. \'93Hmm. That puts her out of reach for the moment. Trainees are sequestered. As for Sirius and Remus, they know not to say anything. I\rquote ll pay a visit to the Burrow and to Hog\rquote 
s End to speak to the other people involved.\'94 He gazed seriously at Maggie. \'93I\rquote m sure Harry never intended for you to be in any danger, my dear, when he set out to find you. His intentions were good. He merely wanted to reunite yo
u with your family. We will endeavor to make certain that you are perfectly safe here, and that you receive the magical education you should have had when you were younger.\'94 
\par Harry felt a bit uncomfortable. His intentions were good. That had gotten him in trouble before. But Maggie simply smiled broadly at him. \'93I can never thank Harry enough for finding me, Albus. Since that day I feel like I\rquote 
ve been living a dream I don\rquote t want to wake up from. I know I\rquote ll be safe here.\'94 
\par Harry looked at Dumbledore, who, disturbingly enough, did not seem so sure himself. But he nodded at the fireplace and said, \'93You two should probably be off to the dungeons. Have a good class, Maggie,\'94
 he said kindly, before she and Snape threw Floo powder into the fire and said, \'93Severus Snape\rquote s office!\'94 
\par When they had gone, Dumbledore motioned to the chairs in front of him. \'93Now, we have one or two other things to discuss, so make yourselves comfortable.\'94 Harry and Hermione sat obediently, and Dumbledore opened his desk drawer and removed
 a sheaf of parchments. Harry took them awkwardly; it was a large bundle. 
\par \'93What\rquote s this?\'94 he asked Dumbledore, trying not to drop any of the parchments. 
\par \'93Patrol timetables. You and Hermione should distribute them to the other prefects during lunch. Students are only patrolling four nights a week, staff are on six nights a week. Take a look so you know when you need to be on deck.\'94 
\par Harry unrolled one of the parchments and scanned down it for the name \'93Potter\'94 while Hermione took another and did the same. The first shift started every night at nine o\rquote clock, the second at eleven-thirty, third at two o\rquote 
clock and fourth at four-thirty in the morning until seven. The castle would be patrolled by twenty-four people for ten hours a night, six people per shift. 
\par \'93Here we go, Harry,\'94 Hermione said, having scanned it quickly. \'93On Sunday, I\rquote m the first shift and you\rquote re the second; then I\rquote m on third shift on Wednesday while you\rquote re on the fourth; we\rquote 
re both on second shift Thursday; then you\rquote re fourth shift again on Friday and I\rquote m on third shift again Saturday.\'94 
\par Harry noticed that he was on duty with Ginny on Sundays at eleven-thirty until two in the morning, and swallowed. And he was with Malfoy on the fourth shift Fridays, from four-thirty to seven in the morning. Lovely, he thought. Then he noticed that Ginny 
was never patrolling at the same time as Malfoy, whereas Malfoy was patrolling at the same time as Mariah Kirkner on Monday from four-thirty to seven o\rquote clock. 
\par \'93So, I trust you will take care of that. Also, the pair of you will hold prefects\rquote  meetings on Sunday evenings between seven and eight o\rquote clock, which is when I am also conducting a staff meeting. Just before eight o\rquote 
clock you will adjourn the prefects\rquote  meeting so that you can come to the staff room and join that meeting, as you are the liaison between the student patrollers and the staff. Any questions?\'94
 They shook their heads, still perusing the timetables. He nodded. \'93Good.\'94 He opened another desk drawer now and took out a plain white envelope, which he handed to Harry. He awkwardly transferred the b
undle of parchments to Hermione so he could take what Dumbledore was handing him. It didn\rquote t look at all like parchment, but the sort of envelope typically sold by a Muggle stationer. He frowned questioningly at the headmaster. 
\par \'93Your aunt sent this to me with Arabella, Harry. I thought you should see it.\'94 
\par He opened the envelope and a piece of yellowed paper fell out of it; Harry bent to pick it up. It was his birth certificate. \'93I\rquote ve been waiting for this! Can I--can I try out for the Welsh national team, Professor? I mean--may I?\'94 
\par But Dumbledore was already chuckling. \'93Of course, of course. I will arrange your transportation. The trials are at a lovely castle in Wales, where the final is to be played later this year. And Ron has already received my permission to try for England.
\'94 
\par Harry couldn\rquote t have stopped smiling if he\rquote d wanted to. \'93Oh, thank you, Professor! Thank you so much!\'94 
\par Dumbledore\rquote s eyes were twinkling. \'93You\rquote re welcome, Harry. But I think before you say anything else, you should read the letter in that envelope.\'94 
\par Harry unfolded it, and as he read, he felt the color drain from his face. He looked up at the headmaster, expecting him at any moment to be replaced by some monster, to have the Polyjuice Potion wear off and reveal his true form, as Vo
ldemort or Peter Pettigrew or Lucius Malfoy. No, Harry thought, it couldn\rquote t be.... 
\par Hermione stared at him, concerned. \'93What is it, Harry?\'94 
\par He turned to her slowly, letting the letter slip from his hands as he whispered, \'93Aunt Petunia is coming to Hogwarts.\'94

s most barbed remarks went unnoticed by him during Divination. (Sandy had made some barbed remarks of her own about Trelawney--Harry thought her tongue was def
initely sharper than it had been--but he chose not to share these with Ron.) After classes were finally over, he threw himself into an armchair near the fireplace in the Gryffindor common room. Aunt Petunia at Hogwarts. He still couldn\rquote 
t believe it. Ron collapsed into the next chair, moaning about the homework Trelawney had already given them. Harry had told him about his aunt at lunch, but it seemed he\rquote d already forgotten (or it just didn\rquote 
t have the impact on him that it had on Harry, which was to be expec
ted). Hermione was sitting near the windows with a variety of books spread out on the table in front of her; she had had the last period of the day free, as the second period of Arithmancy met on Wednesday after lunch, when Harry and Ron had a free period
. When she noticed Harry and Ron, she closed her books and went to join them. She rose and walked to them, kissed Ron on the forehead and perched on the arm of his chair, fixing Harry with a stern gaze that made him uncomfortable. 
\par Finally, he burst out, \'93All right, tell me what I\rquote ve done now....\'94 
\par \'93It\rquote s not what you\rquote ve done; it\rquote s what you haven\rquote t done. While I was waiting for you two, I realized that there\rquote s still something you haven\rquote t told Ron at all, and something you haven\rquote 
t told me in full--just a little, at Alicia\rquote s house.\'94 She raised her eyebrows meaningfully while Harry stared, perplexed. When he failed to catch on, she rolled her eyes. \'93You know, the reason for your being so distracted last year--\'94 

\par \'93Oooohh!\'94 Harry said suddenly, his eyes wide. \'93Yes, of course! I\rquote m sorry. You\rquote re right. I forgot!\'94 He had way too much to think about just now. 
\par Ron eyes went back and forth between the two of them. \'93What the--\'94 
\par \'93Let\rquote s not do this here,\'94 Hermione whispered, standing and walking toward the boys\rquote  stairs. Harry nodded, then stopped short. 
\par \'93Wait--I\rquote d rather not risk someone walking in, and it\rquote s impossible to put a fool-proof lock on the dorm door. We\rquote ll need someone to be a guard.\'94 
\par \'93But who?\'94 Hermione said quietly. \'93Anyone you ask is sure to want to know why.\'94 
\par Then Harry spotted Ginny sitting with Ruth and Zoey. \'93Yeah, I know. But it\rquote s all right. I\rquote ll ask Ginny. She already knows.\'94 
\par \'93She already knows!\'94 Ron said indignantly. \'93I don\rquote t even know what she knows that I don\rquote t know, but I know that I think I should have known before she knew! I mean--\'94 
\par Hermione smiled and patted his arm. \'93That\rquote s all right, we understand. I\rquote m sure there was a good reason Harry told her--\'94 
\par \'93Er, yeah. I\rquote ll have to explain that too, I reckon,\'94 Harry said. \'93Wait a minute.\'94 
\par He went to Ginny, Ruth and Zoey and leaned over to whisper in Ginny\rquote s ear. \'93Ron and Hermione and I need your help. Do you have about an hour to spare?\'94 
\par She frowned up at him, puzzled, but nodded and prepared to stand, putting her Transfiguration text down. \'93Bring a book,\'94 he advised her. \'93You may want something to read.\'94 
\par Now she appeared more confused than ever, but she picked up the text and followed him to where Ron and Hermione stood waiting. Harry led them all up the stairs and into the seventh-year dorm. 
\par When they had closed the door, he turned to them all and said, \'93All right. The girls already know, and now you will too, Ron.\'94 He launched into the story about the previous September first quickly, having gotten into a pattern now that he\rquote 
d already told Ginny and Hermione. Ron\rquote s eyes went wide when Harry explained to him why he\rquote d seemed so odd when he\rquote 
d gotten on the Hogwarts Express the previous September. As he spoke, Harry could hardly believe that all that had happened a whole year ago. It seemed like yesterday.... 
\par \'93And I\rquote m going to explain some other things about that life to you too, Ron, and you, Hermione, but I\rquote m going to use my Pensieve to do it, so we can\rquote t afford to be disturbed. That\rquote 
s where you come in, Ginny. Can you--do you think you could sit on the landing and stop anyone who wants to come in? Once we\rquote re in the Pensieve, we can\rquote t know what\rquote s happening outside it, and we couldn\rquote 
t stop someone from looking in to see what\rquote s happening. Do you mind terribly?\'94 
\par Harry saw at once that she did, and he felt dreadful. Her face closed up. Harry grimaced, then took her hand. \'93Will you excuse us for a moment?\'94 he said to Ron and Hermione, leading Ginny out of the room and closing the door. 
\par \'93Is that why you asked me to come up here? So I could be a glorified guard?\'94 
\par He drew his lips into a line. \'93There wasn\rquote t anyone else I could ask, Ginny. You\rquote re the only other student who knows about the time change. Professor Dumbledore and Professor Snape know, but I can\rquote t very well
 ask them, now can I? Please, Ginny?\'94 he pleaded, touching her arm lightly. He could feel a shiver shudder through her under his fingers. \'93I\rquote m so glad you\rquote re the first person I told after Dumbledore and Snape, I am. I\rquote 
m so glad we had that night at Hog\rquote s End, talking....But I\rquote ve only told Hermione a very small part so far, and until now Ron hasn\rquote t heard anything at all, and they\rquote re my best friends. You know far more than they do....\'94 

\par \'93Will you tell Ron about me?\'94 
\par \'93What?\'94 
\par \'93About--about what we were to each other in your other life.\'94 
\par Harry clamped his mouth shut, thinking about this. \'93I--I didn\rquote t include anything in the Pensieve that would upset him, concerning that. I don\rquote t think he--he wants to see me kissing you like you\rquote re my girlfriend--\'94 Let alone sh
agging, he thought, which even Ginny didn\rquote t know about. He wondered whether she suspected it, though. \'93
I think I should tell him you were my girlfriend, though. I am going to be a little selective. There are things which would really upset him if he knew, and there\rquote s no reason to do that that I can see. So you\rquote ll do it? You\rquote 
ll guard the door?\'94 
\par She grimaced, as though she were doing it against her better judgment. \'93All right. Yes, I\rquote ll do it.\'94 
\par Then Harry remembered something else. \'93Oh! I just realized something. There\rquote s a way you could see a bit of what\rquote s happening from out here. Even though you wouldn\rquote t be able to hear.\'94 
\par She frowned. \'93What?\'94 
\par He removed the basilisk amulet from his robe pocket. \'93I\rquote ve been meaning to give this back to you since the day before the wedding. It\rquote s how I knew you were in danger when you were out riding.\'94 
\par She took it from him, wonderment on her face. \'93Oh! I wondered what I\rquote d done with that. I thought maybe it came off while I was riding, but I obviously never put it on that day....\'94 
\par Harry fastened it around her neck, then leant in to kiss her on the cheek. \'93You\rquote ll be able to see me in the Pensieve if you hold it. All right? Will that do for now?\'94 
\par She smiled and nodded. \'93You go. You\rquote re right; Ron\rquote s your best friend. You should tell him what you can. What won\rquote t send him over the edge, anyway,\'94
 she grinned. He resisted the urge to kiss her properly and returned to the dorm, where his friends were waiting. 
\par Of course, he wasn\rquote t prepared for how they were passing the time while they were waiting. When he reentered the room, Ron and Hermione were on Ron\rquote 
s bed. Hermione was lying full-length on top of him, her lips traveling down his throat to where she\rquote d begun unbuttoning his shirt. His robes were already open, and his hands were rubbi
ng her back and lacing into her hair as he made agonized but happy sounds, his eyes closed. Harry cleared his throat noisily, then said, \'93Shall I go? Would you rather do something else than--\'94 
\par \'93Harry!\'94 Hermione cried out, rolling off of Ron too quickly, a
nd then rolling right onto the floor with a thud that made both boys wince and cry out her name. She, however, sprang to her feet quickly, trying to be dignified as she brushed off her robes and smoothed her unsmoothable hair. She had probably never looke
d less dignified. Harry had to fight the urge to burst out laughing. 
\par \'93Erm, are you two ready?\'94 
\par Hermione was very red and Ron was buttoning his robes again, his ears bright pink. \'93Didn\rquote t know how long you were going to take,\'94 Ron mumbled. Harry went to his
 wardrobe and removed his Pensieve, placing it on his bedside table and pulling out his wand. \'93You\rquote ll both need your wands, too,\'94
 he informed them. He knew Hermione knew what to do, but he was fairly certain that Ron had never been inside anyone\rquote s Pensieve before. Soon then had all fallen into Harry\rquote s room in Hog\rquote 
s End on the day he had asked it to be his room, when he was a little boy, before they\rquote d bought the house. His best friends stared around the room, then at Harry, then at the Lily Evans and little 
Harry who were already there, oblivious to their presence. Ron\rquote s jaw had dropped and Hermione gazed in disbelief, perhaps not expecting to see this kind of evidence that Harry really had had a childhood with his mother. 
\par He began to tell his best friends about his other life.

s face was ashen and Hermione was sobbing. She threw herself on Harry, crying in earnest, and he patted her back, silent tears running down his face as w
ell. Ron sat apart from them, his eyes swollen, an unmistakably guilty expression on his face. Harry separated himself from Hermione with some difficulty and said to his friend, \'93It wasn\rquote t your fault, Ron.\'94 
\par Ron\rquote s blue eyes were dark with pain. \'93You killed your mum for me,\'94 he whispered hoarsely. Harry shook his head. 
\par \'93No. For her. How could I--how could I let my own mother become a murderer for me? I couldn\rquote t let Sirius and Remus do it when I was in third year. How could I let her?\'94 
\par They had sat on the cave floor watching the Harry and Ron in the Pensieve walk to the still form of Lily Evans on the dusty ground before Harry decided they\rquote d seen enough for one day; it had been bad enough when he\rquote 
d removed these thoughts from his mind and placed them in the 
Pensieve. Seeing them again with Ron and Hermione had put him on an emotional roller-coaster. Harry had guided them up and out of the Pensieve after that. He felt empty inside, seeing himself disarm his mother again, seeing her fly backwards through the a
ir, seeing the last expression she wore on her face before striking her head on the hard outcropping of rock that killed her. 
\par He lifted up his glasses and wiped his eyes impatiently. He\rquote d managed to leave out the part about his sleeping with Ginny; Ron only knew that they\rquote d spent the night in the Quidditch changing rooms. He didn\rquote 
t seem to think this meant they\rquote d slept together, so Harry didn\rquote t enlighten him. Hermione was giving him knowing looks, but she didn\rquote t say anything. She appeared to be a little hurt, and trying to hide it. 
\par He had enjoyed showing them Jamie, though. Hermione had exclaimed, \'93Oh! She\rquote s so pretty, Harry!\'94 
\par Ron had stood, staring, saying only, \'93Yeah....\'94 Hermione had hit him impatiently with the back of her hand. \'93I was only trying to be agreeable,\'94
 he said quickly, making Harry laugh. When Harry informed him that his girlfriend had actually been Cho Chang, the Head Girl, and that he was a prefect and considered the most likely person to be Head Boy the next year, Ron\rquote s jaw dropped. 
\par However, after a few more displays of Harry/Ron interactions from his other life, Ron found himself grimacing and saying, \'93
Well, a fat lot of good it did me to have a dad with more influence in the Ministry and to be a prefect if it made me such a prat. I\rquote d have hated me too, Harry.\'94 
\par Harry shook his head. \'93I didn\rquote t hate you, Ron. It\rquote s just--well, in that life I was a Slytherin....\'94 
\par It was Ron\rquote s turn to shake his head now. \'93I still can\rquote t imagine you as a Slytherin....and with Malfoy for your best mate....\'94 
\par They sat silently on the cold stone floor of the dormitory. Ron wouldn\rquote t look at Harry. \'93What--what happened after that?\'94 he wanted to know. 
\par Harry swallowed. \'93The Longbottoms came to get me. I had a trial and I was convicted and sent to Azkaban.\'94 
\par Hermione gazed at him sadly. \'93That\rquote s why you didn\rquote t want to tell me how you wound up in Azkaban....\'94 
\par \'93Right. Somehow I didn\rquote t think I should start with, \lquote You see, I killed my mum....\rquote \'94 
\par Ron shook his head. \'93That\rquote s just stupid. That law should be changed. Didn\rquote t you tell me that\rquote s why Katie Bell\rquote s dad went to prison? Killing his wife by disarming her? A person shouldn\rquote t go to prison for that. If you
\rquote re protecting someone else, you should be considered a hero.\'94 
\par Harry sighed. \'93Sam didn\rquote t feel like a hero for killing his wife, Ron. And I sure didn\rquote t feel like one for killing my mum. I do wish I could have gone to her funeral, though....\'94
 he managed to say before the sobs unexpectedly started pushing themselves out of him. Where had that come from? he wondered abruptly as he continued to cry, helpless to stop it. He hadn\rquote t been to his mother\rquote 
s funeral. Why did this suddenly matter so much? Then the door burst open and Ginny rushed in. 
\par \'93Oh, Harry!\'94 she cried before sinking to her knees and taking him in her arms, as he sobbed on her uncontrollably and clutched at her back. \'93I saw. I saw!\'94 she said, and she didn\rquote t need to explain any more than that. Then suddenly, \'93
Get out, you two!\'94 he heard her snap to Ron and Hermione. They scrambled to their feet and he heard the door slam behind them. He knew they would wonder what on earth was going on between them, but he no longer cared; they could have stayed if they
\rquote d wanted to see him have a complete breakdown. It wouldn\rquote t matter. He held her tightly and sobbed, his tears wetting her hair and robes. He didn\rquote t care if Draco Malfoy saw them in the amulet. He didn\rquote 
t care about anything else just now. He just clutched at her and let himself go, and she was there for him, warm and solid and loving him. 
\par That was all that mattered.

Harry had been greatly comforted by having Ginny with him while he mourned his mother again, but he knew it had been risky. He needed to talk to her about Draco Malfoy anyway, who also needed her right now. They were going to meet in the common ro
om at midnight. They weren\rquote t scheduled to patrol on Tuesday nights, and no one doing the patrolling would care as long as they didn\rquote t leave Gryffindor Tower. 
\par When he saw her face as she sat by the fire, it was all he could do not to take her in his arms again. She had seen where he and her brother and Hermione had been, in the amulet. She had seen him disarm his mother when Lily Evans\rquote 
 wand was pointed at Ron and her lips were forming the words of the Killing Curse. She had seen him drag her out of the lak
e and take her to the Quidditch changing rooms. (The next thing they all had seen was the two of them emerging from the changing rooms the following morning.) 
\par \'93Ginny,\'94 he said softly. 
\par She raised her head, completely unsurprised, and smiled at him, making his heart turn over. She\rquote d been clutching the amulet as she waited for him, wearing her old grey dressing gown and a simple white nightdress under that. 
\par \'93Harry. I\rquote ve had an idea,\'94 she said before he could say what he needed to. \'93I was watching you, in the amulet. At first I was worried, because I couldn\rquote 
t see anything, although I could feel your presence. But all I could see was black. Then suddenly, I could see you leaving the dorm, standing on the landing in the light from the torches on the walls. And I realized: I couldn\rquote 
t see you in the dorm because it was completely dark. I couldn\rquote t see you at all when you weren\rquote t where there was light. Do you understand?\'94 
\par He furrowed his brow, but suddenly, she pulled out her wand and pointed it at the candles arou
nd the room, putting each one out, until the fire in the grate was the only light. At last, she extinguished that too, and Harry found himself standing in pitch darkness. He felt at sea, unable to remember how close any of the furniture was to him, or how
 far away she was. He held out his arms in the darkness and said uncertainly, \'93Ginny? Ginny, where are you?\'94 
\par Then his fingertips touched soft cloth, and the next thing he knew she was in his arms and he was holding her, holding her closely enough to make h
er part of him, as he buried his face in her hair and felt his heart leap within him. They just stood there, holding each other and rocking back and forth, when he realized that her left ear was against his cheek. He turned his head and kissed it gently, 
t
hen breathed into it, making her shiver. He nipped at the lobe with his teeth, and although he would have liked to see her, he was enjoying this dark exploration, the fact that of necessity he had to find his way like a blind man, with touch and taste and
 smell. He pulled her earlobe into his mouth again, then slid his lips down the side of her neck, pausing to suck gently at the pulse point, while she clung to him and sighed. 
\par \'93Oh, Ginny,\'94 he whispered in her ear before kissing it again. \'93I love you so much....\'94 
\par She turned her head suddenly, her fingers fluttering over his face, tracing his lips, and then she had pulled his mouth to hers and he pushed her lips open with the tip of his tongue. Force was hardly required, though, as she was wide open to him, 
drinking him in. Her hands moved deftly as they kissed, and when Harry realized this, he started moving his own hands. Soon they had each slipped off the other\rquote s dressing gown; both garments were heard falling softly to the floor. Harry\rquote 
s legs wouldn\rquote t support him anymore and he gently sank to the floor, taking her with him. They knelt, facing each other, kissing brows, cheeks, mouths, necks.... 
\par Harry wore only his pajama pants now--Sandy had disengaged herself and slithered off--and he felt Ginny slowly m
ove her mouth down his neck, then onto his chest, her tongue creating a wet trail that was driving him mad. He reached out a shaking hand and unbuttoned her nightdress as she did this, removing it from her shoulders until it was around her waist. 
\par When he lowered his mouth and took the tip of one breast in his mouth, she cried out his name with joy, and he thought he\rquote 
d never heard anything so wonderful in his life. When she pulled his mouth up to hers again and placed his hands on her chest, she whispered against his lips, \'93I love you, Harry....I always have done....\'94 
\par He moved his hands down to her waist, feeling the firm flesh there, and on her ribcage, rather than actually being able to count her ribs, as he could in his other life. There would be no poss
ibility in this time and place, he suspected, of mistaking poor eating habits for a pregnancy. She wasn\rquote t fat, certainly, but not skeletally thin, either. She had some nice flesh on her, a healthy amount, enough to-- 
\par A pregnancy. 
\par \'93Ginny,\'94 he said suddenly, desperately, trying not to touch her now. He needed her so....and yet, if it wasn\rquote t safe for reasons having nothing to do with Draco Malfoy.... 
\par \'93What?\'94 she whispered, drawing her finger down his arm to his hand, which she tried to guide to her breast again. He was tempted to let her, but pulled it back before he could make contact. 
\par \'93Have--have you taken the Prophylaxis Potion?\'94 
\par Silence. \'93I--I was going to ask you whether you might have something--something Muggle. You know, from an apothecary.\'94 
\par \'93Chemist,\'94 he corrected her. \'93And no, I don\rquote t have anything Muggles use. If we--if we don\rquote t have any protection, we can\rquote t do this.\'94
 Then he thought of something else, the thing he needed to talk to her about, which had flown clean out of his head after her first touch. There were other reasons they couldn\rquote 
t do this besides Harry not having been to a chemist and Ginny not taking the potion. One reason, anyway. A reason called Draco Malfoy. 
\par \'93I--I never intended for this to happen tonight, Ginny. I just wanted to talk to you. About Draco. Please--please get dressed.\'94 
\par He found his dressing gown and pulled it on, tying the belt impatiently, trying to calm down. She\rquote d gotten him very worked up, but this just wasn\rquote t the time. He tried not to think of her soft skin
, of the warm weight of her breasts in his hands, the salty taste of her skin.... 
\par He attempted to make his way to a chair and barked his shins on a low table, swearing loudly. Pulling out his wand, he started to wave it, but stopped, not knowing whether she was dressed again. 
\par \'93Are you decent?\'94 
\par \'93You--you don\rquote t want to see me?\'94 she asked softly, sounding hurt. 
\par \'93Of course I want to see you!\'94 he responded without thinking, then tried to squelch that thought. \'93I didn\rquote t think you wanted him to see you. What do you do to avoid that, anyway? Shower in the dark?\'94 
\par \'93No, just very quickly. And we\rquote re usually doing it at the same time, after running, so I was hoping he might be a bit preoccupied and not trying to see me with the amulet just then.\'94 
\par Harry remembered that that very morning, when he\rquote d been coming out of the showers in the boys\rquote  prefects\rquote  bath, he\rquote 
d seen Malfoy in the large tub still, holding the amulet tightly, one corner of his mouth twisted upward slightly. He was getting an eyeful, he realized now, feeling conflicted about whether he should tell Ginny this. 
\par \'93Anyway, are you dressed again?\'94 he asked her once more, after hearing some rustling that might indicate this. She answered in the affirmative and he pointed his wand around him at random to get so
me candles to light. When three sprang to life, he found his way to the fireplace and lit the fire. Sandy was sitting on the still-warm hearth, and he picked her up and let her slither into his sleeve and around his arm once more. 
\par "Are you done now?" she asked softly. 
\par "Yeah," he said briefly, before sitting in a chair before the hearth, his heart still beating quickly from the encounter in the darkness. 
\par He motioned for Ginny to sit in the chair furthest from his, which should make it impossible for Draco Malfoy to see Harry using the amulet. \'93Ginny, I need to talk to you about Draco Malfoy.\'94 She nodded. \'93You need to break up with him if we
\rquote re going to be together. I--I didn\rquote t mean for--for that to happen just now. I don\rquote t want to be that sort of person. I\rquote ve been that sort of person, and I don\rquote 
t want to do it again. I mean, when we--when we were meeting on top of the Astronomy Tower to go flying, I was still with Hermione. I wasn\rquote t in love with her, but I do love her, as my friend. I should have shown her 
more respect. I should have been honest with her and broken up with her. But--but I didn\rquote t see that until I fixed the timelines, until I could remember my other life. 
\par \'93You see, in my other life, my mother was cheating on my stepfather.\'94 
\par Her jaw dropped. \'93Your mum was cheating on Professor Snape! Why?\'94 
\par He sighed. \'93I was never sure. It seemed that she felt tired and overwhelmed, taking care of my twin brothers. They had porphyria, inherited from my dad--I mean, Snape. I don\rquote t know whether she originally tu
rned away from him because she blamed him for giving her sons the disease, or she decided she was more attracted to Sirius--\'94 
\par \'93Sirius! She was cheating on her husband with Sirius!\'94 
\par \'93Yeah, well, there\rquote s no love lost between him and Snape, now is there?\'94 
\par Ginny swallowed. \'93What if--what if my sister married him and the same thing happened? What if they had a child with this disease and she resented him for it?\'94 
\par Harry looked at her levelly. \'93Then she should do what my mother should have done, what I should have done, and end the relationship cleanly. Except--well, in a way I understand why my mother didn\rquote 
t. She wanted the twins to have the two of them, united, supporting them. But still--I think that in the long run, if there had been a long run, the best th
ing would have been for her and Sirius to come clean about their relationship. Actually--my dad did know about them. He had accepted that their marriage was over and maintained the facade for my brothers\rquote 
 sake. I had to see all of this happening to other people before I realized I didn\rquote t want to do that again.... 
\par \'93When we\rquote re together, Ginny--and I believe that we will be, eventually--I don\rquote t want it to be the two of us sneaking around in the dark, behind Draco\rquote s back. I want to walk down the corridors of t
he castle holding your hand. I want to go to Christmas at the Burrow as your boyfriend. I want to make love to you in a sunny field in the middle of summer. I want--I want to see you. I want to see your face when--\'94 He choked; he couldn\rquote 
t continue that train of thought; the memory of her was still too vivid. It hadn\rquote t even been a few minutes....\'93I--I know you think you can\rquote t break up with him, but you can. Only--not yet. You can\rquote 
t possibly do it just now. He--he needs you too much right now.\'94 
\par She frowned, sitting up a little more. \'93How do you mean?\'94 
\par \'93I mean--I\rquote ve only seen him like this one other time. In my other life, after my sister died. Ginny, he tried to throw himself off the parapets. I\rquote m really worried about him. Yes, I know he goes out of his way 
to be a prat at every opportunity. But we can\rquote t let ourselves play his game of pushing people away when he needs them the most. He was a good friend to me once.\'94 
\par She squinted at him. \'93What are you getting at, Harry?\'94 
\par \'93Ginny,\'94 he said slowly, \'93he needs you right now. You know this. Be there for him. In whatever way you can. In whatever way you feel comfortable....\'94 Harry felt himself coloring. Ginny\rquote s jaw dropped. 
\par \'93Are you telling me to sleep with him?\'94 
\par \'93I\rquote m--I\rquote m just saying that--that if you did, I would completely understand. You already said you\rquote d felt tempted. I just think that you need to give him time to heal, and then break up with him when he\rquote 
s no longer a possible danger to himself--\'94 
\par \'93What about a danger to other people? Especially to you?\'94 she said hotly, still evidently upset by the implication that he wouldn\rquote t be insanely jealous if she slept with Draco Malfoy. 
\par \'93I--I don\rquote t think that would happen if you did the break-up in the right way, at the right time. You have to be honest with him when the time comes. You need to tell him you don\rquote t love him, make it about that. That\rquote 
s as good a reason as any, when you think about it. Whether or not you loved anyone else, not loving him means you shouldn\rquote t stay together....\'94 
\par \'93And yet you want me to wait to break up with him. Oh, Harry....On the day of the wedding, we weren\rquote 
t inside when Fleur arrived because we had gone for a walk down to the stableyard. We were sitting on a bench outside the stables, talking, and Draco took my
 hand and apologized for--for making my horse bolt. He told me he loves me more than life itself. He actually said that. And what could I say? Could I say the same thing? No. It would have been a lie. What would I do if he said the same thing again after-
-after making love to me? What kind of person would I be if I couldn\rquote t return his love at such a time? I think--I think that\rquote s actually the biggest thing that\rquote s been keeping me from--from giving in to him. I\rquote 
m not afraid of the act. That doesn\rquote t frighten me. It\rquote s the words that would come after....The words I can\rquote t say.\'94 
\par He sighed and looked down at his hands, unable to bear seeing her in the firelight, flushed with passion and anger both. \'93When I tried to break up with Hermione after Dudley died, Ron insisted that I couldn\rquote 
t. He was in love with Hermione, I know he was. It must have been so hard for him, and yet he went out of his way to show me that I needed her just then, and he was right. I did. Hermione--she let me forget. She let me just--\'94 
\par \'93--just shag her repeatedly. Is that what you want me to do with Draco Malfoy?\'94 She was seething now. 
\par \'93That\rquote s not what--oh, Ginny! I haven\rquote t been a saint, you know I haven\rquote t! I wouldn\rquote t think any less of you if--\'94 
\par \'93Well maybe I would think less of me, did that ever occur to you? Did it ever occur to you that I might be ashamed of the times when I actually wanted a man I don\rquote t love? Do you think I liked feeling that way? You don\rquote t know what you
\rquote re asking me, Harry. I don\rquote t know how you can say you love me and sit there and--and--\'94 
\par She couldn\rquote t finish, but went running up the steps to her dorm. He called her name, but he didn\rquote t want to be too loud, and finally, he turned around and stared at the fire some more, trying to forget holding her in his arms, her soft skin 
under his hands....but she crept into his dreams when he returned to bed, and he woke in the morning to find the sheets wrapped around him as he had dreamt her limbs were, and her name on his lips as he reached for the girl who was not beside him, the gir
l he was sending to another man\rquote s bed.

m going to try to get some work done in the common room when my watch is done; I think if I try to go to sleep again, there\rquote s no way I\rquote ll be up at six-thirty to get ready for running.\'94 
\par \'93Yeah, well can you come pull me out of bed at four-thirty? I don\rquote t know how I\rquote ll get up otherwise.\'94 
\par \'93Go to bed right after dinner, like me. That way you\rquote ll get a good eight hours.\'94 
\par \'93That\rquote s so early, Hermione! I can\rquote t just make myself go to bed at eight o\rquote clock.\'94 
\par She shrugged. \'93Suit yourself. If I have to use force to get you out of bed at four-thirty, I will,\'94 she said, smirking. 
\par He smirked right back. \'93Oh yeah? See what happens to you if you do....\'94 
\par But his first watch went well. He didn\rquote t manage to get to sleep until ten o\rquote 
clock, after tossing for two hours, but when he awoke at four, without help, he dressed quickly in the cold room and trod softly down to the common room. He sat by the fire, shivering, and Hermione was surprised to see him when she returned. He was not aw
ake enough to trust his voice, so he nodded at her as she plodded to the armchair where he\rquote d been sitting, collapsing with exhaustion. He thought it unlikely she was going to get any work done. 
\par He met Draco Malfoy in the entrance hall, along with Hagrid, M
aggie and Professors Sprout and McGonagall. They agreed on a way to split up the castle and began their rounds. Harry held his wand out as he walked, when he saw that Malfoy did too. What was truly disconcerting was that Draco Malfoy seemed to be behaving
 as though he\rquote 
d never met him before. No insults, no snide remarks. Harry had wanted to try to draw him out, to find out how he was doing since the wedding, but there were no opportunities for introducing the topic. When their shift drew to a close, Malfoy 
revealed that he\rquote 
d worn his running clothes under his robes; he waited for Harry to return to Gryffindor Tower to change. Harry came back to the entrance hall a little while later with Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Tony and Ruth, finding Draco and Mariah waiting. 
Draco left his robes in a bundle on the edge of the pitch while they ran and continued the not-talking to such an extent that even Ron appeared disconcerted, and like he might like to counter an insult or two about Weasleys. 
\par Classes were finally getting m
ore interesting. They had another Charms lesson, but this time they broke up into small groups for a practical lesson, with the prefects in each group leading the way. After that, they had their first Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson with Professor Fi
gg, who reminded Harry so eerily of her brother that he kept expecting her to shout CONSTANT VIGILANCE any moment. (Crouch really had done a good Moody impression.) 
\par And then, after lunch, they were to mount their broomsticks and fly to Hogsmeade for their first Apparition lesson. Only the Slytherins were joining them; the Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaw would have their lessons at different times. 
\par Harry noticed how fiercely Hermione clutched her broomstick handle as she flew, remembering how nervous she\rquote d been before flying into the forest to rescue Professor Snape and Draco Malfoy. She was using a school broom, as she still didn\rquote 
t have one of her own. He suspected it would be even harder to convince her to get a broom once she\rquote d mastered Apparition. She really wouldn\rquote t see the point, then. 
\par All of the Gryffindor and Slytherin students attended the first lesson, except for Draco Malfoy and Ron. Sirius introduced himself, smiling at them all, but looking very nervous, as though everyone might start screaming and cr
inging from him any minute. Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil did seem to avoid getting too close to him, and Seamus\rquote  eyes were rather round the entire time. Pansy Parkinson, on the other hand, simpered and flirted shamelessly. (\'93He\rquote 
s a teacher!\'94 Hermione hissed at Harry and Neville, indignant, while she glared at Pansy.) 
\par After the class, Harry knew he had to finally speak to Sirius about the things he\rquote d told Ron and Hermione. He\rquote d told Snape before Sirius, and he just knew he shouldn\rquote t leave Sirius in the dark any more. He didn\rquote t think he
\rquote d need the Pensieve to convince him, and he didn\rquote t want to show it to him, anyway, lest any unflattering images of the Sirius in his other life crept in. His godfather let him talk and talk, as they sat in the echoing, emp
ty village hall, and when the sun was going down, he pulled Harry to him in a hug, then released him, searching his face. 
\par \'93You\rquote re not a child anymore, Harry,\'94 he said suddenly. Harry hadn\rquote t held anything back from Sirius except the other Sirius\rquote  involveme
nt with his mother. He knew all about the pregnancy scare, and the Quidditch changing rooms. Harry shook his head. 
\par \'93How could I be?\'94 he choked out, trying not to cry again. Sirius clapped him on the shoulder. 
\par \'93Well, I think you\rquote ve made some mistakes you\rquote re never likely to make again. That\rquote s the important thing.\'94 
\par Harry nodded and they left the hall and mounted their broomsticks to return to the castle. He felt like a great weight had been lifted from him as he flew. He still missed his \lquote dad,\rquote  Severus Snape, but as Snape hadn\rquote 
t shown any interest in being a father-figure to him, even after seeing the Pensieve, Harry knew he had to give Sirius a chance. Sirius had wanted to be a kind of father to him since his third year. He found himself in the awkward posi
tion now of trying to be a father to a man, not a boy, but Harry wanted to let him know he still needed parenting, still needed someone to talk to, someone to advise him. He smiled at the dark man flying next to him, and Sirius nodded back with understand
ing. For once, Harry had no doubt that he\rquote d done the right thing.

t have any classes first thing on Friday. They had History of Magic before lunch, but the other runners allowed him and Hermione to sleep late. They ate breakfast with everyone else and then went running during the first period, showering before Binns
\rquote  class. All day, Harry was very excited, sin
ce Saturday was drawing nearer, when he would go to Wales to try out for the national team. He tried not to think about his falling-out with Ginny, but it was difficult. When he had no control over his thoughts, in his dreams, she was in his arms again, e
vaporating when he awoke. 
\par After spending the afternoon out-of-doors at Herbology (it was still good weather, so they were working in the gardens, not the greenhouses) and Care of Magical Creatures, they returned to the common room, where everyone seemed to
 be in a party mood. Someone produced some butterbeers and crisps, and Ron and Seamus went to the kitchens, returning with more substantial food and pitchers of pumpkin juice. Harry managed to relax and forget his troubles for once, but when he rose to re
fill his goblet at one point, a piece of paper fell from his robes, and it was Ginny who picked it up. 
\par \'93Harry,\'94 she called to him, as though being helpful against her better judgment. \'93You dropped something.\'94 She unfolded it. \'93Oh! It\rquote s your birth certificate. Are you carrying this around for tomorrow?\'94 
\par Annika and Zoey had been standing near her, and they pounced on the piece of paper now. \'93Oooh!\'94 Zoey cried out, looking over Ginny\rquote s shoulder. \'93Look at Harry\rquote s little footprints! So cute!\'94 
\par \'93Give me that--\'94 he started to say irritably, but now Ginny was looking at the back of the paper, where his parents\rquote  birth dates were given. 
\par \'93Funny,\'94 she said. \'93Your dad\rquote s birthday is less than a week after yours. The fifth of August, 1960.\'94 
\par Hermione\rquote s head swung round. \'93Really? Are you sure, Ginny?\'94 He could practically see the wheels were turning in her head again. 
\par \'93Very. It\rquote s right here.\'94 She showed Hermione while Harry made a swipe for the paper and missed. 
\par \'93Oh, and look,\'94 Hermione said now, pointing to Harry\rquote s mother\rquote s birth date. \'93Harry--your mum\rquote s birthday is less than a week after Ginny\rquote s.\'94 
\par Harry stopped reaching for it and frowned at her. \'93Um, no it isn\rquote t Hermione. It\rquote s exactly a week. Has Arithmancy destroyed your ability to add? One plus seven is eight.\'94 
\par Hermione grimaced at him. \'93I know that, Harry. Why are you saying that?\'94 
\par \'93Because my mum\rquote s birthday was the eighth of April, that\rquote s why.\'94 
\par Hermione opened her eyes wide. She glanced down at Harry\rquote s birth certificate, then back up at him. \'93Not according to this.\'94 
\par She handed the paper to him and he stared at it, wondering whether it was a simple clerical error at the hospital. How could his own mother not know when her birthday was, after all? He remembered her being very adamant about its being on the eighth,
 when he was small and had been eavesdropping on the adults in Lucius Malfoy\rquote s study, during the Christmas party. 
\par He stared down at the paper again. And then he noticed something else. Not only was his mother not born on April the eighth, according to his birth certificate, but where it gave her place of birth, it said very clearly, \'93Appleby Magna, Leicestershire.

per; for some reason, the hair on the back of his neck was standing up. It was a perfectly ordinary birth certificate, but it wasn\rquote t the one from the British government. His aunt had said in her terse letter that she didn\rquote 
t trust him not to lose it (some things, he thought, would never change). Instead, she\rquote d sent him the hospital certificate, which had an old-fashioned-looking engraving of St. Dawyd\rquote s Hospital on the front, where he\rquote 
d been born, in addition to his name, birth date and place of birth writte
n in elegant script (Harry James Potter, born 31 July, 1980, Cardiff, Wales), his weight at birth (seven pounds, four ounces), length (twenty-one inches), and the name of the doctor who\rquote d delivered him (F.X. O\rquote Sullivan). 
\par The back of the document bore his mother\rquote s thumb-prints, his very small newborn footprints, his parents\rquote  names, and the places and dates of their births. He stared thoughtfully at his father\rquote 
s information for a moment, never having really looked at it. James Godric Potter, it turned out, h
ad been born 5 August, 1960 in Bath. Why Bath? he wondered. But his mother....his mother, according to this, had been born exactly four months before, on 5 April, 1960, in Appleby Magna, Leicestershire. 
\par He wandered to a chair and sat with a thump, staring
 at the paper. Then he almost immediately sprang out of the chair again and ran to his dorm; he flung open his trunk and rifled through it until he found the shoebox where he saved his correspondence. Unfortunately, that was as far as his organization wen
t; the letters he\rquote d received over the previous years since he\rquote 
d gotten his Hogwarts letter (which was at the bottom) were piled higgledy-piggledy in the box, parchments mixed with the Muggle stationery Hermione usually used when she wrote, and the occasiona
l post card and birthday card. He finally found what he was looking for and raced back down to the common room. 
\par \'93You already knew all about it, Hermione!\'94 he told her breathlessly, waving the letter at her that she\rquote d written to him earlier in the summer. He\rquote d found it on his desk on the day he\rquote 
d returned home from work and found Yvonne Martin watching his Aunt Petunia using magic to clean the kitchen. He pulled it out now and read portions of it. 
\par \'93Both of her parents were also teachers. They\rquote re retired. They moved to Leicestershire in 1973, after their daughter Valerie died from leukemia. Evidently, when they were in London at St. Michael\rquote 
s hospital, they met a family from Appleby Magna--the mother also had cancer, so they were in the same unit rather a lot--and they wanted to move to London so she\rquote d be closer to St. Michael\rquote 
s. The Doughertys wanted to move away from London, to try to put the loss of their daughter behind them, so they moved into the Leicestershire house and paid the other family rent....\'94 
\par He raised his face to Hermione\rquote s, grinning. \'93Don\rquote t you see? The family that they were paying rent to--it was my mother\rquote s parents! Maggie grew up in the same house as my mother and aunt!\'94 Hermione looked back at him 
in amazement, her eyes very large. 
\par \'93I don\rquote t understand, Harry. Why do you think--\'94 
\par \'93Snape\rquote s Pensieve!\'94 he hissed to her under his breath. \'93When we saw him visiting my mum in Godric\rquote s Hollow,\'94 he reminded her, whispering, \'93my Aunt Petunia also visited, re
member? She was reaming out my mum for not saving my grandmother--\'94 
\par Hermione\rquote s eyes were now wide with understanding. \'93That\rquote s right! I\rquote d forgotten!\'94 She frowned. \'93But that still doesn\rquote t mean--\'94 
\par Harry was the one staring into space now. \'93And there\rquote s something else....\'94 he said slowly. \'93When you first told me where the house was, at number ten Highgrove, I\rquote ve been trying to work out where I\rquote 
ve heard that address before.\'94 He reached through his troubled, crowded memory and remembered many, mornings, as a small boy, waking up to the sound of rude pounding on his cupboard door....

\par (This despite the fact that he did most of the cleaning round the house.) 
\par Grumbling, he stumbled out from under the stairs and shuffled toward the front door, bending over to pick up the post from the welcome mat as though he were an old man. Bills, adverts, a postcard from Aunt Marge, and an envelope addressed to \'93
Mrs. Vernon Dursley, Number 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey.\'94 He turned it over, and on the back, with no name, was the address of origin for the envelope: Number 10 Highgrove Street, Appleby Magna, Leicestershire. 
\par And then there was the occasional terse question from his uncle to his aunt: \'93Have they paid the rent yet? It\rquote s not my fault they\rquote re teachers, is it? If they did something sensible for a living, maybe they wouldn\rquote 
t fall behind on the rent when they have unexpected expenses suddenly. You\rquote d think I killed her uncle, just so they\rquote d have to pay for the funeral...\'94

t pay particular attention to the financial discussions he heard in the Dursley home. He was frequently reminded--very loudly--of what a financial burden he was on his long-suffering aunt and uncle, but, a
s he saw whenever they were lavishing gifts on Dudley, they were clearly in no danger of being destitute, so he didn\rquote 
t take any of it seriously. He actually would have been quite happy to have the Grunnings drill factory fail and for his aunt, uncle and cousin to experience living in an unsavory place with spiders crawling over their skin all the time, even though he
\rquote d have to live with them under these conditions as well. But then he realized that they\rquote d probably find some way to blame him for a Grunnings failure, and they\rquote 
d probably take their miserable new life-style out on him in some way, and in the end he\rquote d come to the conclusion that they were most harmless when happily getting by with enough money and toys, so that they didn\rquote t need to resort to Harry
-beating for entertainment. 
\par \'93For years, the Doughertys have been paying rent to my Aunt Petunia! I remember seeing the envelopes. Maggie definitely grew up in my mum\rquote s house.\'94 
\par \'93Okay,\'94 Ron said, frowning, trying to process the information. \'93So my sister grew up in the same house where your mother lived. That still doesn\rquote t explain why your mum was born three days earlier than you thought.\'94 
\par Harry narrowed his eyes, thinking. \'93Well, if we add five and four and the numbers in the year 1960...\'94 He paused. \'93We get twenty-five. That reduces to seven, right Hermione? Now, stop me if you think I\rquote 
m wrong, but I think my mum is probably the first Daughter of War in the prophecy. I mean, can you think of any other woman who had more to do with Voldemort\rquote s fall?\'94 He no
ticed that Zoey and Annika winced at the name, but Harry plowed on. Ron, Ginny and Hermione no longer batted an eye when he did this. 
\par \'93Not me,\'94 Ron said, shrugging. \'93I mean--if she hadn\rquote t died--\'94 His voice trailed off, and he swallowed. Harry remembered his reaction to Harry\rquote 
s Pensieve, his finding out first that the world had changed so drastically when his mother hadn\rquote t died, and then that Harry had killed his mother to save Ron\rquote s life, and had gone to Azkaban because of that. 
\par \'93Right. So if we add seven to the lion\rquote s eleven and the Moon Child\rquote 
s five, that gives us twenty-three, which then becomes five after you add the two and three.. If the first triangle is half of the second, that makes the second one ten. Which becomes one when you add the one and zero!\'94
 he said triumphantly. Still grinning he went on, \'93And five and one make six, the total for the two triangles!\'94 
\par Hermione looked uncertain. \'93I don\rquote t know, Harry....I was so sure that Annie Weasley was the second Daughter of War....\'94 
\par Harry stopped and thought again. \'93Well, the second triangle has to total ten, if I\rquote 
m right about this. So we start with eleven and five, which makes sixteen. If the total for the three people is in the twenties, it would have to be twenty-eight for it to break down to ten. Or thirty-seven, if it\rquote 
s in the thirties. Twenty-eight is twelve more than sixteen. Thirty-seven is twenty-one more.\'94 
\par Ron\rquote s face lit up. \'93Those both become three when you break them down! And you missed the teens; nineteen is just three away from sixteen. No matter how you add it, the second Daughter\rquote 
s number has to be three, if the total is going to be ten!\'94 Harry and Hermione looked at him, shocked. He turned pink. \'93What, I can\rquote t learn a little about Arithmancy during the hols?\'94 
\par Then Harry remembered Sandy speaking to him on the shores of Loch Ascog: The Daughter is three. Sandy had already told him. 
\par \'93So,\'94 Ron said now, \'93the question is: was your mum trying to hide that she was in the Prophecy?\'94 Harry remembered her arguing with Lucius Malfoy, in his other life. She\rquote 
d been very adamant about her birthday. If there was anyone she would want to convince about her not being in the Prophecy, it was Lucius Malfoy. Voldemort too, of course, but Malfoy was very nearly as important. Perhaps she had started out s
imply lying to him and that explained everything. And then she had to be consistent about it. Every year on the eighth of April, Harry remembered that they celebrated her birthday. She couldn\rquote 
t afford for one of her children to slip and mention the real date to anyone. Draco Malfoy was Harry\rquote s and Jamie\rquote s best friend. He could have inadvertently mentioned her real birthday to his father and endangered her. 
\par \'93Looks that way,\'94 Harry said quietly, looking down at the certificate again. In his other life, she\rquote d
 married Severus Snape, who had told her about the prophecy before the timelines had changed. Perhaps it had been his idea to pretend that she had a different birthday. Harry knew he would have done anything to protect her, or make her happy. 
\par \'93But,\'94 Hermione said now, an alarmed note in her voice, \'93
if she was hiding her true birthday, does that mean that Voldemort knew what the totals should be for the two triangles? Does that mean he knows what the number should be for the second Daughter of War?\'94 
\par Harry\rquote s heart had leapt into his throat. \'93Could be. Ron--is it at all possible that your older sisters weren\rquote t actually born when they think they were? Well, Maggie definitely wasn\rquote 
t born when she thought. But what about Annie? And you, Ginny--\'94 he said reluctantly, since she was hacked off at him. \'93Have you ever seen your birth certificate?\'94 
\par Ginny shook her head. \'93What you\rquote re saying doesn\rquote t make sense, Harry. My mum is sure to remember very well when each of us was born....\'94 
\par \'93Not if she was memory-charmed. Remember, Pettigrew lived with your family for years, and he didn\rquote t have the nerve to kill your sisters when he was only nineteen, and took them away to protect them.\'94 
\par Harry looked around the common room, at the clusters of students socializing and relaxing. He hated to think of any of the Weasleys being in danger; they were like family to him. Then his eyes opened wide. There was another group that was like family to h
im--and to the Weasleys as well. \'93Wait! The centaur told Bill the Daughter of War would come from his family--\'94 
\par Ron shrugged. \'93I remember. I\rquote m assuming that\rquote s why you want to know my mum\rquote s birthday....\'94 
\par Hermione stood excitedly. \'93And Mrs. Weasley told us about being taken up north during the war, when she was a child. She\rquote s surely a Daughter of War!\'94 
\par \'93No, no,\'94 Harry said, \'93I mean--sure, that\rquote s a possibility. But I just thought--Bill had another family. This family. Gryffindors. All Gryffindors are family,
 really. The centaur might have meant another Gryffindor, not necessarily a blood relation....\'94 
\par \'93Well, then, it could be anyone, Hermione said dejectedly. 
\par \'93It does give us more possible candidates, but that\rquote s better, isn\rquote t it? Rather than running out of people to consider? And it would mean Voldemort has to figure it out still, too. He\rquote s in the same position we are.\'94 
\par \'93Maybe,\'94 Ron intoned ominously. \'93I wouldn\rquote t be so sure. If Pettigrew did know who the other Daughter of War was, he might have told him. Or he could just decide to try to get rid of all Gryffindors.\'94
 Or all Weasleys, Harry thought, shuddering. \'93Or,\'94 Harry added shakily, \'93he might have deliberately told him the wrong person was the Daughter of War, and that\rquote s another reason why he wants to be beyond Voldemort\rquote 
s reach. Can you think of any other reason why he\rquote d turn himself in? Knowing that he\rquote d be going to Azkaban? Whatever he\rquote 
s expecting Voldemort to do to him, it must be far worse than dementors. Which means he must have done something really bad as far as Voldemort\rquote s concerned.\'94 
\par \'93And,\'94 Hermione continued, \'93if you\rquote re right, it would mean Voldemort already knows Wormtail gave him the wrong name.\'94 
\par \'93Maybe. He could just be preparing for the worst,\'94 Harry countered. 
\par The four of them were silent for a few minutes, but then Ron yawned and stretched. \'93Blimey, I could do with some dinner. And bed right after that. Tryouts for the English team tomorrow.\'94 
\par Harry opened his eyes wide. \'93Oh! That\rquote s right! I forgot you were trying out too!\'94 
\par Ron grinned at him. \'93Think you\rquote ll make the Welsh team?\'94 
\par \'93Dunno. How are we getting to the tryouts?\'94 
\par \'93Remus is taking me by Floo from the Three Broomsticks. I\rquote m to fly down to the village in the morning with Professor McGonagall. The place is somewhere in Kent; big wizarding estate. No Muggles around for miles, and they\rquote 
ve got anti-Muggle charms on the perimeter of the property, just in case. Remus said Sirius is meeting you in the entrance hall after breakfast. He has a Portkey for the two of you.\'94 
\par \'93Sirius is coming with me?\'94 Harry said, feeling a little better. 
\par \'93Sure. You don\rquote t think Dumbledore would let you go alone? After you left St. Mungo\rquote s like that, without telling any of us you were all right? As it is, he wasn\rquote t sure he\rquote d let either of us do this. Remus told
 me; it was touch and go, but between the two of them, he and Sirius convinced him. Personally, I think I\rquote ll probably feel terrifically out of practice. I\rquote ll probably stink like an old egg.\'94 
\par Harry grimaced. \'93No you won\rquote t. You\rquote ll run rings around the others. I\rquote m going to make a complete fool of myself....\'94 
\par Hermione was rolling her eyes. \'93All right, all right. Let\rquote s go eat before we get into some kind of who-will-do-worse contest.\'94 She grinned and pulled on both of their hands, and they cheerfully let thems
elves be led to the portrait hole. When they were in the corridor, Harry wistfully looked over his shoulder at Ginny for a second before the portrait banged shut again.

eating breakfast. Or rather, after having tried to eat breakfast; he could barely choke down a piece of toast and some orange juice. His usual nervous loss of appetite was plaguing him, as it did before every Quidditch match, and he hoped he wouldn
\rquote t faint
 from hunger if the Seeker tryouts lasted a very long time. While he was waiting for Sirius to finish breakfast, Professor McGonagall left for the village with Ron, and soon after, Snape emerged from the Great Hall with Maggie beside him. They were deep i
n conversation, but he stopped when he saw Harry in his Gryffindor Quidditch gear, then looked like the reason for this attire had occurred to him; his eyes widened and he nodded. 
\par \'93Good luck, Pot--\'94 He cleared his throat, looking sideways at Maggie. \'93Good luck, Harry,\'94 he corrected himself. Harry wished he could come with them. 
\par Maggie laughed, looking at Harry. \'93Is that how you dress for Quidditch? What is it--like football on broomsticks?\'94 
\par \'93Not quite--\'94 he began, but Sirius was coming out of the Great Hall now, grinning at him. Harry wasn\rquote t sure what else he should wear. He\rquote 
d donned the usual protective equipment under the robes, as well, wondering whether perhaps he would be required to do without it. He had no other Quidditch gear. 
\par \'93You look just like--\'94 Sirius started to say, and Harry hoped he wasn\rquote t going to bring his father up again. It wasn\rquote t the time to get maudlin. He seemed to change his mind and asked Harry, \'93All set?\'94
 Sirius also had a broomstick slung over his back with a sturdy-looking leather strap that was attached to the broom handle at the end and just above where the twigs began. It looked like one of the school brooms. 
\par Harry nodded. Sirius took the Portkey out of his pocket. It was a brown bottle which had once held lager. \'93Hold on, Harry. We\rquote ll be off in a couple of minutes.\'94 
\par Harry clutched his broom firmly in one hand and the neck of the bottle in the other. After waiting only a couple of minutes, he suddenly felt like he couldn\rquote t have removed his hand from the bottle if he\rquote d tried; 
it seemed to be glued in place. And then he felt that distinctive hook behind his navel pulling him into a whirling vortex. Snape, Maggie and the entrance hall were gone, and there was just whirling confusing, his broom, Sirius and his broom, and swirling
 robes.... 
\par They landed with a thump. Harry stumbled a little, but did not fall. Still, he hoped no one was watching him. He felt shaky and nervous and like he just might spew. 
\par They were atop the wall of an enormous grey-stoned castle. It wasn\rquote 
t like Hogwarts castle, a place where you could live and go to school. The castle walls were topped by what could be called an elliptical road, twenty feet wide, bordered by chest-high parapets, and Harry was strongly reminded of pictures he\rquote 
d seen of the 
Great Wall of China, but on a smaller scale. He could see that, enclosed within the curving walls, was a space that was perfectly-sized for playing Quidditch without too many prying Muggles being able to see what was going on. Harry knew that the castle w
as somewhere in Wales, but he wasn\rquote 
t sure where, precisely. Looking down, he saw that the two levels below the parapets seemed to have large openings in the walls all around, looking toward the interior. Most of the openings were covered by heavy tarpaulins
, fastened with ropes laced through rings sunk into the stone masonry. One or two were open, revealing serried rows of benches for the spectators to watch the game. On the ground, very far away, it seemed, Harry could see doors which probably gave onto te
am changing facilities and the like. He\rquote d never seen a Quidditch pitch like this; the seating being below the parapets meant that the spectators were sheltered from the weather, but their view of players flying very high would also be obscured. 

\par He stood at the edge, holding onto the stone barrier with one hand, wondering why there was no one else around. He looked at Sirius momentarily, with alarm, waiting to find out that he wasn\rquote t his godfather at all, but another Death Eater who
\rquote d been taking Polyjuice Potion.... 
\par But moments later, loud pops! starting erupting all over the grassy field far below and on the castle walls as well, as numerous black-robed witches and wizards appeared, wands drawn before they determined that there was no immediate danger. The
y were quickly followed by the players for the Welsh national team, reporting for work, also popping onto the pitch and the walls, wearing red and green robes. Harry reckoned the black-robed people were Aurors. Security. He felt Sirius tense up beside him
.
 The witches and wizards in red and green robes began to gather in small clumps, ignoring the Aurors, smiling and laughing as they greeted each other. Harry noticed some players for the Caerphilly Catapults, the Harpies, and other teams. He looked at Siri
us uncertainly. I don\rquote t belong here, he thought, his stomach in knots. 
\par \'93Harry!\'94 He swung his head around; Owen Aberystwyth was striding toward him, grinning and holding out his hand. Harry felt like his arm might come out of its socket if Owen decided to b
e much more enthusiastic about greeting him. He did his best to grasp the older man\rquote s hand hard, to avoid having his knuckles crushed. \'93Welcome!\'94 Owen said, grinning, once he\rquote d released Harry\rquote 
s sore hand. Then he noticed Sirius, and his eyes opened wide. He went white, and he was already a very pale man. \'93You--you\rquote re--I mean--you must be--\'94 
\par \'93Sirius Black,\'94 Sirius said to him, holding out his hand and giving Owen an ironic half-smile. Owen did not take his hand but continued to stare, wide-eyed, at Sirius, 
who finally put his hands in his pockets, his mouth drawn into a line. Harry wondered how much of that Sirius had experienced since he had been cleared. You\rquote d think he hadn\rquote t been exonerated at all, Harry thought, trying not to feel angry. 

\par Instead, he decided to get some information about where he was. Waving his arm over the rolling wooded landscape outside the castle, he asked Owen, \'93Where are we, exactly?\'94 
\par \'93Well, you could say it\rquote s Tomen Castell. Except it\rquote s not. It\rquote s on the same site, but Tomen was just earth and timber. When Muggles look at this, all they see is a mess of trees growing on what used to be the motte. They don\rquote 
t bother with it. This was actually built by the great Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, who was born at Tomen. He also built the stone castle at Dolwyddelan. That\rquote s the name of the village over yonder.\'94
 He nodded toward a distant cluster of houses that Harry could barely discern through the abundant greenery. \'93It\rquote s not generally known that he was a wizard, you know. At any rate, this was built
 special for Quidditch and has been hidden from the start, with spells and such. This is where the European Cup final is being played, in December,\'94 he said proudly. \'93We\rquote re hoping to be in the final, of course,\'94
 he added, raising his eyebrows at Harry. \'93Best place in all of Britain for the game, in my opinion. Some folk--well, they don\rquote t like having an established place for it. Prefer to move around. But the folk over in our village--\'94 he gestured 
\'93--are the sort of Muggles who are magic-tolerant, so we like it here.\'94 
\par Sirius and Harry looked shocked, so he elaborated. \'93I don\rquote t mean they know about us, per se,\'94 he said quickly. \'93They sort of--well, whenever one of\rquote em maybe sees something he oughtn\rquote 
t, he just tells himself, real sensible-like, that it couldn\rquote 
t be. Goes about his business without anyone needing to throw around any memory charms. Most Muggles whose families have lived in the same place for generations are the same; they have family stories that have been handed down, so they know there are some
 things in certain places which can\rquote t be explained with their logic and science, and they don\rquote t bother trying. They don\rquote t look too close. A bit of superstition, if you like, but it works out for us.\'94 
\par Harry nodded, seeing that Owen, while explaining why the castle seemed so perfect for Quidditch, had relaxed a little about Sirius, who was nodding and looking around at the landscape. \'93This is a good location,\'94 Sirius agreed. \'93
I was afraid it would be at Conwy, a little further north.\'94 
\par \'93We\rquote re in Conwy still,\'94 Owen said, sounding annoyed. 
\par \'93I mean the castle of the same name--\'94 Sirius tried to explain, grimacing. But Owen was relaxing again. 
\par \'93Nah. Too close to the sea. Easier to control access by Muggles from land. If ships are passing, or even small pleasure-craft, we can\rquote t guarantee they wouldn\rquote t see people flying on broomsticks. Not from the sea. Nah, we\rquote 
re well away from the sea here.\'94 
\par Sirius nodded and Harry tried to relax a little. However, he tensed up again when he saw a dark-haired woman in red Quidditch robes walking toward them, carrying a gleaming broomstick that made Harry wish he\rquote 
d taken out his broomstick repair kit that morning and worked on his, so it didn\rquote t look like it had been sitting around for a month, gathering dust. Some of his twigs were a little bent out of shape, even though it was still practically new. 

\par \'93Erica, come here and meet one of the possibilities for new reserve Seeker,\'94 Owen said to her, smiling. Harry recognized her as Erica Welch, the witch who had taken over for Audra Griffiths on the Holyhead Harpies. 
\par Harry nodded as he shook her hand. \'93Nice to meet you.\'94 Her eyes went up to his forehead automatically. 
\par \'93Nice to meet you, too,\'94 she said, her eyes widening when she saw Sirius. Then she turned to Owen abruptly and said, \'93Twenty-five Galleons, right?\'94 
\par Owen gave her a half-smile. \'93Right. Twenty-five Galleons. Or the equivalent in Muggle money, whichever you prefer.\'94 He turned to Harry again. \'93Damned difficult to come by Galleons these days, what with the Gringotts mess.\'94 
\par \'93Right,\'94 Harry said, a bit confused. 
\par When a small, thin man of indeterminate age popped! into existence about six feet away, Owen cried, \'93Jean-Claude!\'94 
\par The small man, who had some grizzled growth on his face but bright brown eyes and sharp cheekbones, stro
de toward Owen and shook his hand. He wore a close-fitting grey T-shirt and carried brown robes over his arm. He had a very worn-looking broom that made Harry feel a little better about his. 
\par \'93I would not meess theess for anyzing, Owain. Zey deed not \lquote ave any openings on ze French team, so....\'94 
\par Owen nodded. \'93So this is your chance to play in the European Cup, if you\rquote re lucky. I know what you mean.\'94 
\par Harry stared at the small thin man, who had a mix of dark and grey hair, but strong, tanned, wiry-looking arms. He couldn\rquote 
t have been over five-feet four inches, and Harry was strongly reminded of some of the jockeys he and Draco Malfoy had seen when they\rquote d gone to the track to watch Alicia ride Granny\rquote s Ghost to victory. 
\par \'93Um,\'94 Harry began awkwardly, speaking to Owen, \'93aren\rquote t you supposed to be from Wales to be on the Welsh team?\'94 His own voice sounded very strange to him. 
\par Owen grinned. \'93Jean-Claude Jones\rquote  dad is as Welsh as you and me, Harry. His mum is French, and he grew up there and went to school there, but he was born a little north of here, where his dad\rquote s from. How is the old trouble-maker, Jean?
\'94 
\par The small man gave them all an ironically Gallic smile, one head cocked to the side. \'93Still makeeng trouble, as you say. Some zings nevair change, n\rquote est ce pas?\'94 
\par \'93Truer words were never spoken, old boy--\'94 Owen said, shaking his head. Harry swallowed. So, he was up against an old friend of Owen\rquote 
s. Brilliant. And he was almost the same size Harry was when he was just starting out as a Seeker. He was the perfect 
build, small and lithe. Harry felt large and awkward. I should have switched to being a Keeper, Harry thought. Look at him; what made me think I could still do this? 
\par Then another man popped onto the wall nearby, and Owen greeted him enthusiastically as well. He was quite pale and his dark hair had some scattered grey in it. He wasn\rquote t much taller than Jones, but even more muscular. Harry didn\rquote 
t catch his last name, but his first name was Neil. 
\par \'93All right, now, listen up, you three,\'94 Owen said when the cursory introductions were over. \'93This is how it is. You see before you,\'94
 he waved at the players now flying about the pitch in their red and green robes, for the most part never going higher than the parapets, \'93our team, both the starters and reserves. There\rquote s a mix on the two teams--red and green--so don\rquote 
t get any ideas that one or the other is better. I\rquote m paying each player on those teams twenty-five Galleons--although that may wind up being in Muggle money--for every ten points they score today. I\rquote m also pa
ying each person on the winning team a bonus of another two-hundred Galleons. You four,\'94 he said, motioning to Harry, Erica, Jean-Claude and Neil, \'93will all be looking for the Snitch. When one of you three catch it,\'94
 he added, pointing at the Harry and the other two men, \'93
the game will be over and whichever team has the most points from goals alone at that point will win. If Erica catches it first, she will release it again and we keep going until one of you three show me which one of you deserves to be my 
new reserve Seeker. Erica will be paid twenty-five Galleons for every time she catches the Snitch and releases it.\'94 
\par He glared at the three would-be Seekers now, his eyes narrowed. \'93In case you don\rquote 
t understand your situation, let me be clearer about it. Every player out there wants to make this stretch on as long as possible, because the longer it does, the more money they make. That means they don\rquote 
t want you three to catch the Snitch. You are not playing for a team today; you\rquote 
re playing for yourself. Usually you have two Beaters hitting Bludgers toward you and two away from you. Today there will be four Beaters hitting Bludgers toward you and no one hitting them away from you. There is no one out th
ere that you can count as a friend, and you\rquote re not just competing against two other people trying out for Seeker, you\rquote 
re also competing against our current Seeker, who, lest you forget, just led the Holyhead Harpies to victory in the League final.\'94 Erica Welch glowed, but also looked a little bashful about this. Harry swallowed. 
\par \'93There will be no fouls called. For any player. The others all know that if one of them needs to stop playing, they will not be paid at all, even if their team wins. If any of you get hurt and need to land, that\rquote 
s too bad. The moment you touch the grass, you\rquote re done, you\rquote re out of the running. Are there any questions?\'94 
\par Harry looked at Neil and Jean-Claude, who ignored him and glared back at Owen stubbornly. 
\par \'93Good,\'94 Owen said in reply to their silence, clapping his hands together once. \'93Oh, and I almost forgot. If one of you three catch the Snitch before Erica, you\rquote 
ll be on the team, but not as reserve Seeker. If that happens--Erica will be the reserve Seeker,\'94 he said, looking at her out of the corner of his eye. Harry noticed the truculent expression she wore, thinking, She\rquote 
s not just playing for money. She\rquote s playing for her job. 
\par Harry swallowed and glanced at Sirius. He\rquote d never felt so nervous in his life. This was unlike any other type of match he\rquote d ever experienced. He thought about just backing out, saying that he\rquote 
d changed his mind....but then he pictured the Daily Prophet headline if that happened....

\par Soon everything was a blur; Owen blew on a whistle and the other Seekers threw on their robes, mounted their brooms and sped to the middle of the pitch. Harry then leapt on his broom and followed, glad his new broom was more obedient that the last one he
\rquote d had. Soon the players were zipping over the field at blinding speeds, the Chasers on the Green team tossing the Quaffle back and forth to each other with pinpoint precision, but failing to get it past the Red team\rquote 
s Keeper anyway. One of the Red Chasers caught the Quaffle when their Keeper hurled it almost the length of the pitch and raced toward the Green team\rquote s hoops. The Chaser feinted and scored, so it was ten points for the Red team. 
\par Harry was admiring the Chaser\rquote s skill a moment too long, though; he turned his head, saw a Bludger only a half-dozen feet away and quickly ducked, feeling his hair move as it swished
 over his head. He sat up again and shook himself, then flew toward the edge of the pitch, resolving to ignore the Chasers, no matter how interesting they were, and concentrate on not being killed by a Bludger. 
\par And look for the Snitch. 
\par He scanned the fie
ld with his eyes; there was so much activity, it was difficult to see what was really going on. The Quaffle and the Bludgers were being hurled or beaten about, the Chasers and Beaters were zooming back and forth, circling each other, looping and rolling..
.. 
\par Then Harry noticed what the other Seekers were doing. Jean-Claude was flying on the tail of a Green Beater for some reason, and Neil was flying in circles near the Red goal. Erica was looping around the Green goal hoops, looking around very avidly. Sudd
enly, she went into a dive and Harry saw a gold flash lower down on the field. He shot toward it, noticing even as he drew nearer that his broom was faster than hers. He was inching ahead of her, bit by bit, seeing the Snitch fluttering down there.... 

\par Har
ry grunted and struggled to keep his grip on his broom as a massive wizard in green collided with him. He looked at Erica with alarm, expecting her to get to the Snitch first, but the Green player had hit her before Harry, and she was hanging from her bro
om by one hand. Harry felt a sharp pain in his side and wondered if he\rquote 
d broken some ribs; it was suddenly quite excruciating to draw breath. He glanced down quickly and no longer saw the flash of gold. He was about to glare at the wizard, but he was already gone, carrying the Quaffle toward the Red Keeper. 
\par Erica scrambled back onto her broom, her face dark with rage. She sped away from Harry, and he turned to see two Red players bearing down on him, looking like they were up to no good. When they were almo
st upon him, he suddenly dove, and then he heard a yell behind him; they\rquote 
d collided with their own teammate, a Beater who had now dropped his bat. Harry watched it fall, not the least bit sorry to see it go. Unfortunately, he left his guard down too long, 
and another Red player flew hard into the tail of his broom while yet another player, coming from the opposite direction, put his hand out and gave his broom handle a hard push. Suddenly, he was spinning counter-clockwise in mid-air, very fast, his ribs a
c
hing, his fingers slipping from the handle, and the world just a blur. He made a concerted effort to hold fast and then jerked the handle up sharply, shooting into the sky above the parapets, breathing quickly, his head still spinning. Each breath felt li
ke he was being stabbed in the chest. 
\par The other players were showing no mercy. I\rquote ll either get onto the team or die trying, he thought. 
\par He decided that perhaps Jean-Claude had had a good idea to pick another player and tail him. He would keep moving that 
way, instead of being virtually a stationary target. And, Harry hoped, perhaps the more he moved around the better his chances of seeing the Snitch again. He looked down at the flurry beneath him for a moment before choosing to latch onto a witch in red, 
b
arreling toward the Green Keeper with the Quaffle. Her reddish-brown hair streamed out behind her and she looked alarmed when she turned around and saw him on her tail. As he flew he watched the other Seekers. Neil was speeding crosswise across the field 
o
f play for some reason, but then he stopped and peered down. Harry looked down too, but there was no gold flutter down there. He turned to face forward again and almost plowed into the center goal hoop; he swerved just in time and decided that following a
 Chaser wasn\rquote t the best idea. He was about to go after a Beater when the wizard who had dropped his bat before maneuvered his broom so that he could use the twigs to hit a Bludger at Neil, who was oblivious. If he didn\rquote 
t move, it would hit him in the back of the head. 
\par Harry sped toward him, yelling, \'93Duck!\'94 Neil either didn\rquote t hear him or disregarded him, Harry couldn\rquote t decide which. The Bludger was very close. Harry would never reach him in time. He tried something else. He pointed down and cried, 
\'93The Snitch!\'94
 going into a dive, hoping Neil would follow. He remembered the way Krum had executed the Wronski Feint at the World Cup, and he tried his best to approximate that now. His breathing was labored and his ribs were a constant dull ache. He looked over hi
s shoulder and Neil was flying in his wake, the Bludger sailing harmlessly over his head. When Harry saw that, he breathed a sigh of relief and jerked his broom handle up again, climbing away from the ground once more. 
\par \'93Just kidding,\'94 he called to Neil shakily. Neil scowled at him, evidently unaware that Harry had saved him from being concussed by a Bludger. 
\par The Chasers on both teams were scoring repeatedly while the four Seekers continued to fly about and get bashed into occasionally. Harry decided to tr
y marking Erica, as she was the one he reckoned he had to beat. She was rather annoyed about this and tried to shake him off. Then he noticed that Neil was marking Jean-Claude, and the French-Welsh wizard was just as annoyed about being followed as Erica.
 
\par Unfortunately, Erica and Harry were near the Red goal hoops and the other two Seekers were near the Green hoops when the Snitch was spotted about six feet off the ground near the Green end of the pitch. Harry turned and sped toward it as soon as the saw t
hat bit of gold, but Neil and Jean-Claude were much closer, having gone into a dive, side by side, elbowing each other so badly that if fouls were being called, both would have been cited for extreme cobbing. Their fighting escalated to such a level that 
t
heir locked bodies plowed right into the Snitch, sending it skittering toward the edge of the field. Finally, Jean-Claude, furious, gave Neil a vicious push that sent him hurtling off his broom. He had only fallen from about eight feet off the ground, and
 was probably not hurt, but Harry could see how disappointed he was. 
\par He was on the ground. Neil was disqualified. 
\par Harry continued to speed toward the Snitch in its new position; he glanced over his shoulder and saw Erica close behind. Jean-Claude was also heading toward it. Then suddenly a Bludger hit Harry\rquote 
s broom twigs and he wobbled off course, right in front of Erica, whose broom handle hit Harry in the left elbow so painfully he had to struggle with all his might not to let go of his own broom. Pain r
adiating up his arm, he looked in the vicinity where the Snitch had been, not seeing it. It was gone again. 
\par Now it was just the three of them. Harry marked Erica and Jean-Claude marked him. Harry scanned the field for the Snitch, but saw nothing. The three of them wove around the other players in a strange sort of train. 
\par \'93You shall beat it.\'94 
\par \'93What?\'94 
\par Sandy didn\rquote t repeat herself. But then Harry thought about her words. The Beater who had dropped his bat earlier was scowling at Harry and started flying str
aight at him. Harry took his broom straight up, only to find that a Bludger was heading directly for him. He halted immediately, letting the Bludger zip past. Scowling at the Beater, Harry looked down at the ground where the dropped bat lay. A thought lit
 up his brain, and he said, \'93Thanks, Sandy!\'94 
\par \'93For what, Harry Potter?\'94 
\par \'93For giving me an idea!\'94 
\par He wondered if he could do what he needed to do. He put his hand out as he flew, concentrating hard. \'93Accio bat!\'94 he cried. 
\par The bat soared up toward him and leapt into his waiting hand, hitting Jean-Claude\rquote s broom twigs on the way; he shook his fist at Harry. When Harry had the bat in hand, he looked for one of the Bludgers and went flying after it. If I can\rquote 
t catch the Snitch myself, I can at least make sure the other Seekers don\rquote 
t get attacked anymore, he thought. He flew toward a Bludger that was flying straight at him and then swung back, grunting loudly, feeling a jolt move through him as he struck it, hearing the ringing s
ound of metal on metal as one of the iron bands on the bat hit the Bludger. It was as if someone had pushed all of his ribs into his lungs. He sent the orb hurtling toward the Beater who\rquote 
d given them so much trouble; he looked shocked and he dove out of the way, glaring at Harry afterward through narrowed eyes. Harry narrowed his own eyes and glared right back, continuing to heft the bat in his right hand. 
\par They were playing a different game now. Every time Harry thought he saw someone coming after one of the other Seekers, he hit a Bludger at the player in question. He didn\rquote 
t aim for the people so much as their brooms, to take them off-course. The other players were getting very annoyed with Harry. Harry was starting to think he might like to be a Beater. 
\par Perhaps to make it more difficult for him to defend his fellow Seekers, the Red Chasers managed to separate Jean-Claude from Erica and one of the Green Chasers grabbed her broom tail and started pulling her toward their goal hoops. Harry scowled, looking 
a
round for Bludgers. One was rounding the Green goal hoops, so he sped there and hit it hard at the Green player harassing Erica, who swerved to avoid it. It went sailing harmlessly past him. Then Harry spotted the other Bludger, high above the center of t
h
e field. He flew upward and swung back hard with the bat, hitting it toward the Red Chasers who were surrounding Jean-Claude, making it impossible for him to choose where to fly. But as soon as Harry hit the Bludger, he saw a golden fluttering that had be
en hidden behind it. Had it been marking the Bludger? he wondered. Could it do that--? 
\par His breathing still enormously painful, he switched the bat to his left hand quickly, wrapping that hand around both bat and broom handle, and reached out and clutched at the tiny thing, hoping that he wasn\rquote 
t dreaming. Harry looked down at it in wonder, the tiny wings now fluttering vainly against his fingers and palm. He swallowed and looked up at the parapets, where many more people than he remembered were watching. He 
thought he also saw some indistinct figures in the stands, under the parapets. He was looking for Sirius, and when he found him, he saw that his godfather had been watching the other players. He grinned at him and held up his hand, trying to get his atten
tion. 
\par \'93I\rquote ve got it!\'94 
\par He thought the other players might be upset with him, but suddenly, realizing what had happened, all of them raced upward, thrilled smiles on their faces. Harry saw that Sirius was punching the air and yelling himself hoarse, his smil
e filling his face, and soon Harry was surrounded in the air by the members of the Welsh national team, being patted on the back while they said things like, \'93Good show, Potter!\'94 and \'93Did you do that Summoning Charm without a wand?\'94 and \'93
Never seen the Seeker take over for one of the Beaters! And you still got the Snitch!\'94 
\par Harry was smiling so much his face hurt. And then his breath caught as the injury to his ribs made his breathing difficult again, and he sailed up above the parapets, then landed near Si
rius, collapsing with exhaustion. Owen Aberystwyth strode over to him, helping him to his feet, taking both the Snitch and the bat from him. By now Harry could barely draw breath. He felt like he was living in a dream. Owen put out his hand and shook Harr
y\rquote s, saying, \'93Congratulations, Harry. You\rquote re on the team.\'94 Harry nodded dumbly, his powers of speech having left him. When Sirius came forward and hugged him enthusiastically, his speech returned in the form of a pained howl. 
\par \'93What\rquote s wrong, Harry?\'94 
\par \'93I--I think I have some broken ribs. Madam Pomfrey can take care of it.\'94 
\par \'93Not right away she can\rquote t. You need immediate attention. We\rquote ll take you down to the team doctor. How long were you playing like that?\'94 
\par \'93Dunno. It happened pretty early.\'94 He looked up and saw that Owen was looking more pleased than ever, that he\rquote d continued playing while injured. Erica had landed nearby and she walked up to Harry now, her hand out. 
\par \'93Congratulations,\'94 she said, just a touch of disappointment in her voice. \'93I suppose this means I\rquote m the reserve Seeker now.\'94 The meaning of her words washed over Harry. He wasn\rquote t a reserve. He was a starter. He remembered Owen
\rquote s words now about what would happen if Erica didn\rquote t catch the Snitch first. To his surprise, Owen put his arm around Erica and gave her a hug. Is that usual? Harry wondered. 
\par \'93Oh, come on, love. You know you\rquote re always a starter to me in other ways....\'94 He was grinning at her and she colored, before they walked off, their arms around each other. \'93I\rquote ll be in touch about practices, Harry!\'94
 Owen called over his shoulder. Harry tried to close his mouth so that he wouldn\rquote t look completely stupid. He turned to Sirius.

\par \'93That they\rquote re seeing each other? No, I didn\rquote t. I can\rquote t believe he\rquote s replacing her! And she\rquote s not hacked off at him, or threatening to break up with him....\'94 
\par Sirius laughed and clapped Harry on the shoulder. \'93No, it\rquote s more than that.\'94 He looked after the retreating pair, grinning. \'93She\rquote s not just his girlfriend, Harry.\'94 
\par Harry frowned. \'93Then what?\'94 
\par Sirius smiled even more broadly and said, \'93Erica\rquote s his wife.\'94

After Harry saw the team physician about his ribs, he felt much better. The boneset was under bandages wrapped around his torso, mending the broken bones, and the p
ainkiller potion he took made him feel rather like he was at the dentist, but the dentist had numbed his torso instead of his gums. He felt odd and awkward, but no longer in pain. 
\par Since the Portkey wasn\rquote t going to activate again until the late afternoon--
just in case the try-outs took all day--they needed to kill time. They walked over the rolling green hills to the village, carrying their brooms. When the houses came in sight, they tucked the brooms, their robes and most of Harry\rquote 
s other Quidditch gear under a tall hedge that was dividing two paddocks, dotted with sheep ranging from dirty cream to dun-colored. Harry\rquote s trousers and Quidditch sweater would pass muster in a Muggle pub, so Sirius didn\rquote 
t need to Transfigure his clothes. Sirius was already wearing black jeans, shirt and boots. 
\par \'93I wish I had my old bike,\'94 he said wistfully as they walked, avoiding piles left by the sheep. 
\par \'93Did I ever tell you I had dreams about a flying motorcycle?\'94 Harry asked him, remembering how irate his uncle had been about Harry mentioning this. Sirius laughed. 
\par \'93No, you never said...\'94 
\par \'93Why did you bring your broom, anyway?\'94 
\par Sirius hesitated. \'93It was just a precaution.\'94 
\par \'93A precaution? What were you going to do, fly onto the pitch?\'94 
\par Sirius frowned. \'93Never mind. Let\rquote s just go to the village....\'94 
\par Then something black flickered just out of Harry\rquote s range of vision; he turned and saw an Auror walking half a field behind them. More precautions, Harry thought. Sirius turned to see what he had noticed; he grimaced. 
\par \'93Stupid things,\'94 he said in an undertone. \'93I know they\rquote re supposed to keep an eye on you, but we\rquote re almost in the village and they\rquote re still wearing their robes....\'94
 He sounded like he thought they might also be along to keep an eye on him. 
\par He waved to them and they stopped, looking alarmed. He picked up the fabric of his sleeve and held it away from his arm, pantomiming. They looked puzzled, so he finally cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted at them, \'93Ditch the bloody robes!\'94
 
\par Understanding dawned on them then, and they removed the robes, carrying them over their arms like overcoats. One of the Aurors was wearing white tie and tails; the other man, a tweedy jacket over a shocking pink woman\rquote 
s blouse and orange plaid trousers. Sirius rolled his eyes. 
\par \'93When are they going to give those blokes training in how to dress like real Muggles?\'94 he muttered to Harry, shaking his head. They turned and continued walking toward the village. 
\par While they ate their lunch in a corner booth in the pub, the Aurors sat at the bar, several stools apart, as though they weren\rquote t together. Harry and Sirius chuckled as they ate their fish and chips, observing the wizards\rquote 
 fascination with the television over the bar, which was showing an advert for toothpaste during a break from an American comedy. Well, Harry thought, at least we don\rquote t have to worry about being the conspicuous ones. 
\par Harry stiffened, however, when he heard the publican say to the Auror in the formal attire, \'93Late for a wedding, are you?\'94 The Auror looked down at his clothes, then back up at the publican behind the bar. 
\par \'93Er, not exactly. Um, it was supposed to be me. She changed her mind.\'94 
\par Everyone in the pub, except for the other Auror, Harry and Sirius immediately started commiserating with the jilted \'93groom\'94 and started telling stories of other couples who hadn\rquote 
t quite made it to the end of the wedding ceremony--or even the beginning. The Auror looked stunned to be the center of attention, and his partner scowled, obviously upset that they weren\rquote t blending seamles
sly (although Harry thought they could have dressed more carefully if that were the goal). Harry and Sirius were having difficulty eating and drinking while stifling their laughter. 
\par As he ate, he thought, It\rquote s been a good day. He hoped Ron\rquote s was going as well.....

\par \'93You made the team, too?\'94 they both responded. 
\par Hermione was looking like it was very hard not to jump around at this news. Harry frowned at her. \'93I thought you were afraid I\rquote d be too much of a target if I did this.\'94 
\par \'93You told me all about the Aurors that were there. It sounds like you were be perfectly safe.\'94 
\par \'93Yeah, well, there were these two....\'94 He told them about going to the village with Sirius. Ron didn\rquote t laugh when Harry described their clothes. Hermione did. 
\par \'93I don\rquote t get it,\'94 Ron said, his face blank. Hermione rolled her eyes and set about explaining it to him, while Harry\rquote s eyes wandered to Ginny, sitting by the common room fire, reading. He wanted her to 
be happy for him, but instead she seemed to be studiously ignoring him, turning pages slowly. He turned away; it hurt too much to be so close to her and yet a million miles apart. 
\par After dinner, Ron and Harry described their trials for the other Gryffindors in the common room. Dean and Seamus were screaming with excitement when he told them about hitting the Bludgers. Ron\rquote s tryout was equally harrowing, but he\rquote 
d passed each test with flying colors. Part of the time he had to specifically only help another Chaser score, no matter how tempting it was to try to score himself. That was the hardest part, for Ron. 
\par \'93And were they trying to knock you off your broom, too?\'94 Harry asked him. 
\par \'93Yeah. When the first bloke ran into me, he didn\rquote t know what hit him,\'94 Ron grinned. 
\par It seemed that it was nine o\rquote clock in no time, and suddenly Draco Malfoy was standing by his elbow. In the Gryffindor common room. When Harry spotted him, he cried out in surprise. 
\par \'93Malfoy! What the hell are you doing here?\'94 
\par Draco Malfoy crossed his arms and glared at Harry. \'93I could ask you the same thing, Potter. We\rquote re supposed to patrol now. You switched with Perugia, remember?\'94 
\par \'93But how did you get in here?\'94 
\par \'93I went to McGonagall. She used the password to open that portrait hole you lot use as a doorway, then let me come in. Oh, don\rquote t look so worried; she wouldn\rquote t let me stand close enough to hear what your bloody password is....\'94 
\par Harry grimaced. \'93Hang on. We can leave in a minute.\'94 
\par He still hadn\rquote t changed his clothes; now he switched to running clothes which were immediately obscured by his school robes. At least I\rquote ll be comfortable. He adjusted his Head Boy badge on his breast and put the Marauders\rquote 
 Map and his wand in his pocket. Malfoy nodded when he returned to the common room, and they left without speaking. Harry glanced over his shoulder at Ron and Hermione, who shrugged. 
\par Professor McGonagall was waiting in the corridor, looking at Harry very disapprovingly. \'93I know that you worked hard tod
ay, Potter, and I appreciate that you are excited about your new job. But you still have duties to perform as a school prefect. Punctuality is expected for all patrollers. Staff as well as students, as I had occasion to tell Professor Snape last night. Ke
eping me waiting...Two in the morning....\'94 she muttered darkly as she strode ahead of them. Harry wondered if the delay had anything to do with Maggie, and he looked at Malfoy with his eyebrows raised. Malfoy scowled at him. 
\par \'93So, Professor McGonagall,\'94 Harry said, trying to converse with his head-of-house instead. \'93Are you patrolling tonight, as well?\'94 
\par She turned and looked at him very sternly again. \'93Not the first shift. I would also be late if that were the case. I am doing the second shift. At the momen
t, I am merely returning to my office, where I was when Mr. Malfoy came looking for you. He was already in the entrance hall with Lewis, MacMillan, Professor Sprout and Professor Trelawney. At nine o\rquote 
clock sharp. As you should have been. It is now--\'94 she checked Harry\rquote s own watch, twisting his arm around slightly more than it was meant to. He tried not to wince. \'93--nine-twenty-five. As Head Boy you are expected to set an example. Don
\rquote t let this happen again.\'94 
\par \'93Yes ma\rquote am,\'94 he said meekly, before she turned and began walking down the corridor that led to her office. He saw that Malfoy was smirking now. 
\par \'93Which way should we go?\'94 he said, trying to ignore the insufferable expression on the blond boy\rquote s face. 
\par \'93So,\'94 Malfoy drawled, ignoring the question. \'93Golden boy is on the Welsh team. Big surprise. Bet they couldn\rquote t wait to have Potty, hero of the wizarding world. Pity you\rquote ll just be a reserve. Won\rquote 
t actually get to play. But they can still say you\rquote re on the team....\'94 
\par Harry felt the anger surging up in him and was helpless to stop it. \'93For your information, the tryout was very rough, and I won fairly. And I\rquote m not a reserve player.\'94 
\par Malfoy\rquote s jaw dropped. \'93Good lord, they\rquote re so desperate they made you a starter?\'94 
\par \'93They didn\rquote t--\'94 he started to say, but bit his tongue. \'93Let\rquote s just patrol, shall we Malfoy? We have a job to do for the next two hours. Let\rquote s just do it and try not to get on each other\rquote s nerves too much, all right?
\'94 
\par Malfoy shrugged. \'93You\rquote re not getting on my nerves. I\rquote ve just learned to accept that no one in the wizarding world actually expects you to be qualified for anything. You just get whatever you want regardless....\'94 
\par Harry stopped in front of him, bellowing in his face. \'93That\rquote s a lie! And even if it were true, how is that different from you ha
ving gotten everything you wanted your whole life because of your father? Talk about not earning anything! I worked damn hard to get on that team, and--\'94 
\par \'93Halt!\'94 screamed a familiar voice. Harry looked up in surprise to see Ernie MacMillan and Trixie Lewi
s, a Ravenclaw sixth-year, come barreling round the corner, their wands drawn, their faces very white. When he saw it was Harry and Malfoy, Ernie lowered his wand. \'93Oh, it\rquote s you. Just scare the shit out of us, while you\rquote 
re at it, Harry! Hell\rquote s bells. Whatchoo have to be shouting all over the place for?\'94 
\par Harry reddened. \'93Sorry, Ernie. Just a simple difference of opinion.\'94 He glared at Malfoy. 
\par \'93Well it\rquote s a damn noisy one. You\rquote re lucky Sprout and Trelawney didn\rquote t come running too.\'94 
\par Malfoy guffawed. \'93As if Sprout could run anywhere. She\rquote s so dumpy--\'94 
\par But this wasn\rquote t the right thing to say to Ernie, who pointed his wand at Malfoy now. \'93You take that back! That\rquote s my head-of-house you\rquote re talking about! I\rquote d rather have her for my head-of-house than that excuse f
or a teacher you\rquote ve got!\'94 
\par \'93That\rquote s enough!\'94 Harry said to Ernie, coming between him and Malfoy, who had also drawn his wand now. He turned to Ernie. \'93I don\rquote t want to hear one more word about Professor Snape, do you hear? He\rquote 
s risked his life doing Dumbledore\rquote s bidding more times than you have, I\rquote ll warrant. And you!\'94 he said, turning to Malfoy. \'93Now that you can\rquote t insult Ginny\rquote s mother any more, you\rquote ve moved on to Sprout?\'94
 He looked back and forth between the two boys. \'93I\rquote m at fault here too, but I say this stops now. We\rquote re all supposed to be patrolling the corridors, not creating trouble in them. I don\rquote 
t want to hear one more disparaging word about a teacher or staff member or the person who says it will lose twenty points for their house. Is that clear?\'94 Ernie and Trixie nodded; Malfoy drew his mouth into a line and gave a smaller nod. \'93Now,\'94
 Harry went on, \'93Malfoy and I will take this corridor; you two go up a flight and do there. And remember, we need to meet the next shift in the entrance hall at eleven-thirty and report any unusual findings. Any questions?\'94 
\par He knew there wouldn\rquote t be. The four of them moved off in their two different directions and it was relatively peaceful for the rest of the shift. Harry tried not to leap to the bait when Malfoy said 
things designed to set him off, and he also tried not to set Malfoy off. Sometimes it was very difficult. 
\par When eleven-thirty finally arrived, they were descending the marble stairs into the entrance hall, where the new patrollers were waiting. Professor M
cGonagall was talking in low tones to Professor Sinistra and Mariah Kirkner was eyeing the other students, who were all fifth-years, somewhat suspiciously. Harry was still getting to know the new prefects, and he remembered that the dark-haired boy was Ha
rrison, a Hufflepuff, but he couldn\rquote t remember his first name. Robert Jensen, a Slytherin prefect, was also waiting, as well as Tamara Katz, a Ravenclaw. 
\par When Mariah spotted Draco Malfoy, Harry saw a slow smile creep over her face that could only be descri
bed by calling it lascivious. He glanced at Malfoy, who was responding with a similar smile. Professors McGonagall and Sinistra were oblivious. Harry watched the two Slytherins carefully. 
\par Moments later, Ernie and Trixie appeared, as well as Professors Sprout and Trelawney, who gave Harry a very wide-eyed look, as though alarmed. 
\par \'93Thank you, all,\'94 McGonagall said to the first shift. \'93We\rquote ll take over now. Students--go straight to your houses, no dawdling in the corridors. Will you be going to your quarters, Professors?\'94 she asked Sprout and Trelawney. 
\par \'93I\rquote m turning in, Minerva,\'94 Sprout said, using a grubby hand to cover her yawn. "I\rquote m up early and down in the greenhouses, you know...\'94 
\par \'93I--I shall be returning to my tower,\'94 Trelawney said mistily, looking at Harry through her enormous, thick spectacles. \'93
I suddenly feel moved to see whether I can find anything in my crystal ball that is of interest. I strongly suspect that I shall....\'94 Her eyes were still on him. Harry tried to keep a blank expression on his 
face, although it was very, very hard not to scowl. Plus, if he said what he thought of her, he\rquote d have to take twenty house points from himself. 
\par As he was starting to ascend the stairs again, he thought he heard Mariah\rquote s low voice say to Malfoy, \'93See you in the common room later.\'94 
\par He froze for a moment, then resumed climbing the stairs. He felt the Marauders\rquote  Map crinkling in his robe pocket and thought about what he\rquote d do if the map showed Malfoy and Mariah together in their common room. Would Ginny care?
 She was still very angry with him. He just wished Malfoy would break up with Ginny if he wanted to be with Mariah. But he seemed determined to keep Ginny unavailable, a prisoner of his so-called love. Harry sighed and resumed moving upward. 
\par He didn\rquote t tell Ron or Hermione about what he\rquote 
d heard Mariah say when he returned to the Gryffindor common room. He went up to bed, even though most of the other students in the common room would probably still be up for hours, as it was Saturday night. He\rquote d had an exha
usting day. Still--if he could bring himself to wake up at two in the morning to look at the map-- 
\par As he set his clock for two in the morning, he glanced over at Neville\rquote s bed; Neville was sitting against his pillows, still fully clothed, reading an Herbology text. Harry didn\rquote 
t recognize it. The title was Creating Hybrids with Magical Herbs Without Running Afoul of the Law by Belladonna Fernrock. 
\par \'93That looks rather advanced,\'94 Harry said to Neville as he removed his robes. 
\par Neville looked up, a very strange expression on his face. Harry had the urge to reach for his wand suddenly, for he had a very bad feeling that this wasn\rquote 
t Neville at all, but an impostor. The feeling was much stronger than it had been with Sirius, when they\rquote d arrived in Wales for the tryouts. For six years, Neville\rquote 
s face had had the look of someone who was never quite sure that he was where he belonged. There was something missing from his features, an assurance that he knew his place in the universe and was in it
. His expression had previously appeared to be thrown together haphazardly and seemed to have the potential to dissolve if a reprimand from McGonagall or Snape was too sharp. 
\par Now his features were knit together by a calm surety; there was a cohesiveness to Neville\rquote s countenance, a maturity, that Harry had never seen before. He realized that he hadn\rquote 
t really spent much time with Neville since the term had started (there were so many students in the seventh-year classes it was hard to keep track of what ever
yone was doing), and now he was shocked by the change that had come over his dormmate. Harry looked at him with narrowed eyes. The last time Neville had looked markedly changed he had become addicted to two dangerous potions. 
\par \'93It is,\'94 Neville said in response to Harry\rquote 
s statement about the book. His voice was deep and even, his face had thinned out and had a slight bit of growth on it, as it was late at night. Harry realized for the first time that Neville was no longer a little boy. It was very, very diff
icult to accept Neville as a man, but that was clearly what he was now. 
\par \'93Er, okay,\'94 Harry said uncertainly. Neville had always taken to Herbology more than any other class, and Harry reckoned he would do something in the field once out of school. He said 
goodnight to Neville but received no response before he pulled his hangings closed around his bed.

t suggested giving her a joint gift this year, as he was now Hermione\rquote 
s boyfriend. She opened a small hinged box at the Gryffindor table, only to shut it again immediately, blushing deeply. She turned to Ron, looking very much like she wanted to kiss him, but she settled for leaning close to him and whispering in his ea
r, and then he was the one blushing. 
\par After lunch, Ron waylaid Hermione on the front steps of the castle and kissed her on the cheek before she left for Hogsmeade for their Apparition lesson. Sirius waited indulgently, grinning at Ron, before kicking off, 
shooting into the air. Harry watched Hermione kick off and he followed, along with the other students. When the village hall was in sight, they set down in the street and waited for Sirius to unlock the heavy front doors with his key, followed by his mutt
ering a countercharm to break the locking charm that was also on the door. Once inside, they settled themselves in the front row of seats and Sirius paced before them, trying to look stern, but somehow managing to look very avuncular instead. 
\par \'93All right! W
e had a good first week. Not much Apparition happening yet, obviously, but I need to make certain that you all understand the limitations of Apparition before you attempt to do it yourself. Apparition can be very, very dangerous. Now, I know I spent a gre
at deal of time telling you splinching stories last week, and yes, some of them can be rather amusing--\'94 He winked at Harry, who tried not to laugh at the memory of some of the stories. \'93--but you\rquote 
ve got to know about the consequences of Apparating for frivolous reasons or when you\rquote re in the wrong frame of mind for whatever reason. The results are nothing to laugh at. So, before we get started--is everyone here?\'94
 He pulled a register out of his pocket and started scanning it, looking up at the assembled students repeatedly as he matched names with faces. 
\par \'93Hmm,\'94 he said after a while. \'93Where is Lavender Brown?\'94 
\par Parvati Patil raised her hand tentatively. \'93She decided she doesn\rquote t want to take the lessons, Professor Black. At least not right now. She said she\rquote ll decide after the autumn term whether she wants to do it.\'94 
\par Sirius nodded. \'93That\rquote s fine. And is Mr. Nott absent for the same reason?\'94 he asked the Slytherins. They looked at each other, baffled, raising eyebrows and shrugging shoulders. 
\par \'93I\rquote ll ask him when we\rquote re back at the castle,\'94 Millicent Bulstrode replied. As Malfoy already had his Apparition test, she was the only Slytherin prefect present. 
\par \'93Right! So. Without looking at your notes,\'94 he said pointedly, causing several students to slam their copybooks shut guiltily, \'93who can tell me some of the basic rules concerning Apparition?\'94 
\par Hermione raised her hand immediately, and Sirius didn\rquote t make her wait long. \'93Yes, Hermione?\'94 
\par \'93Never Apparate or Disapparate where you can be seen by Muggles.\'94 
\par \'93Good,\'94 he said, beaming at her. \'93
However--that rule has been in place for a very long time. It is no longer completely adequate. Or rather, there is a corollary which is unstated in the laws concerning Apparition, but which you must all consider carefully as you dete
rmine whether a particular location is Apparition-safe. Who remembers the corollary?\'94 
\par Hermione\rquote s hand shot up again, and Sirius smiled warmly at her. His words, however, were at odds with his expression. \'93Now, Hermione. Give others a chance. Yours is not the only memory I would like to test.\'94
 It was a gentle reprimand, but it was a reprimand nonetheless, and Harry saw that her face was clouded as she slowly lowered her arm. 
\par \'93Yes, Dean?\'94 Sirius said, looking past her. 
\par \'93Never Apparate or Disapparate where you can be seen by Muggles or be recorded by Muggle devices.\'94 
\par \'93That\rquote s right. Five points for Gryffindor. Just because no people are present does not mean that a location is safe. Muggles have security cameras everywhere these days. What were formerly nice
, deserted corners of the Muggle world, places witches and wizards could usually count on to use for Apparating and Disapparating without problems, have become carefully-monitored potential crime scenes, places that are judged to be dangerous by dint of t
heir isolation. Which is exactly what we need to safe when Apparating--isolation. Muggles, however, view these locations as dangerous because criminals can lurk there and surprise unwary people. It\rquote 
s becoming very, very difficult to find good Apparition points other than wizarding homes or businesses. One can\rquote t be too careful. It is of utmost importance that you do not find yourself being filmed while doing magic. In fact, it\rquote 
s even more difficult a problem to fix than a Muggle seeing you. One person can be 
taken care of with a memory charm. A camera, on the other hand, may be broadcasting a signal to a machine which is filming the view through the lens from many miles away. It could be very difficult to track down that machine and destroy the evidence.\'94 

\par He looked grimly at them all. \'93Now then--who can remember something else I said about who can and cannot Apparate?\'94 
\par Blaise Zabini raised his hand. When Sirius acknowledged him, he said smugly, \'93Pregnant women can\rquote t do it.\'94 Harry thought of Fleur, walking up the drive at the Spinnet estate.... 
\par Sirius nodded but looked dissatisfied. \'93Yes--but. What is the reason for pregnant women not being able to Apparate? Oh, and five points for Slytherin,\'94 he added. 
\par Parvati raised her hand now and he nodded at her. \'93Apparition only affects the person casting the spell, the clothing that person is wearing and the objects that person is carrying, and sym--sym--\'94 
\par \'93Symbionts,\'94 Sirius prompted her. 
\par \'93Symbionts of no more than a few cells in size.\'94 She frowned. \'93I have no idea what I just said.\'94 
\par Sirius laughed, his eyes crinkling up. He looked now like the handsome, laughing man in his parents\rquote  wedding photos. \'93You\rquote re just repeating what I said last week. I understand. Does anyone remember what a symbiont is?\'94 
\par Hermione looked like she was considering raising her hand, but she crossed her arms instead, looking grumpy. Harry was sure she knew, but was trying to be contrary now. He raised his hand. 
\par \'93Harry.\'94 
\par He lowered his hand and spoke. \'93A symbiont is another name for a parasite. Sort of. You said we have bacteria living in us that we have a symbolic--\'94 
\par \'93Symbiotic.\'94 
\par \'93Er, right. We have a symbiotic relationship with them. It. Them. It. What I mean is--the bacteria help us digest food, and things like that. We don\rquote t lose them when we Apparate, even thought they\rquote re actually, um, their own beings. I
\rquote m not sure how to say it. I was going to say independent--\'94 
\par \'93--and yet they\rquote re not independent, are they?\'94 Sirius finished for him. \'93They are quite dependent upon us. A
nd we are dependent upon them. That is what symbiotic means. There is a relationship of mutual benefit and interdependence between us and our bacteria. These organisms are too small to be seen by the human eye. We knew they existed long before Muggles did
, of course, because of magical methods of observing very small objects, and once they invented microscopes with which to see them, Muggles also learned that these organisms exist. We can also do some things that Muggles can\rquote 
t, medically, because we have spells and potions designed to influence these organisms, to do things at a microcosmic level to cure illnesses and repair injuries. Muggles can do a little along these lines, and they\rquote 
re learning more all the time, but they don\rquote t have Pepper-Up potion yet. They can\rquote t heal broken bones in about twenty-four hours. 
\par \'93But tell me, what does all this have to do with why pregnant women cannot Apparate?\'94 
\par Pansy raised her hand and he nodded at her. \'93Even when it\rquote s very small, a baby is too large to be affected by an Apparition spell cast by the mother. And you can\rquote 
t Apparate while carrying a small child or animal in your arms, either. Same reason.\'94 
\par \'93Good point. Five points for Slytherin. That\rquote s right. A baby in its mother--even very soon after conception--a pet, an
other adult--trying to Apparate with any being like this leads to enormous complications. Now, it would be nice if the person casting the spell simply disappeared and the thing which cannot be moved using Apparition simply stayed in the original location.
 But that is not what happens. Some of the worst splinchings in history have been as a result of people trying to do something as seemingly simple as Apparating while holding a cat....\'94 
\par Harry shuddered, then remembered Hermione accidentally giving herself 
many of the attributes of a cat--including whiskers and a tail--for a number of weeks when they were in second year. Using Polyjuice Potion with a cat hair had had very unpredictable results. He had a feeling the results of trying to Apparate with a cat w
ould be similar--or worse. 
\par One of Pansy\rquote s Slytherin girlfriends raised her hand. \'93But then why aren\rquote t we nekkid when we Apparate somewhere else? Why do our clothes go with us?\'94 
\par Many of the boys started whistling and making catcalls. Sirius scowled. \'93Do I need to start giving out detentions?\'94
 he said very loudly, his voice echoing in the hall. The boys stopped, looking abashed. Dean had had his fingers in his mouth (having produced a very loud whistle using this method); he removed them quickly and then sat on his hand. 
\par \'93Miss--er--Tobin asked an excellent question. Does anyone know the answer?\'94 Hermione raised her hand timidly, and Sirius nodded at her. \'93Can you help us out, Hermione?\'94 
\par \'93The clothes aren\rquote t alive. Just about every kind of clothing you can think of that isn\rquote 
t synthetic is made from things that were alive at one time: linen comes from flax and cotton from cotton plants, wool from sheep and silk from silkworms. But the materials are no longer alive. They don\rquote t have a life force. They\rquote re static.
\'94 
\par \'93Five points for Gryffindor! Very good. Yes, good way to put it. They\rquote 
re static. For the most part. As they are no longer alive, they are subject to the ravages of time and will decay and break down, but this sort of change should not be confused with the sort of change that occurs in living, growing creatures. So then--
\'94 
\par \'93But I\rquote m confused about something,\'94 Hermione went on, interrupting Sirius. He didn\rquote t complain. 
\par \'93Yes?\'94 
\par \'93Well, what happens if you Apparate with a plant? You know, what if you want to take your aunt a nice geranium from your greenhouse. What happens if you Apparate while carrying the flower pot with the geranium in it?\'94 
\par Sirius stopped suddenly and stared. After a moment, he shook himself and said. \'93Well, it seems that Hermione has given
 us our first project. Now, before you research this, I want you all to theorize. That means I do not want you to look it up in the library. Use what you know already and tell me what you think might happen. You may cite references to support your hypothe
s
es. Developing hypotheses in this manner will come in handy as you continue in your Charms studies. Later in the year you will be working on creating new charms, and you have to learn how to project the likely outcome of a new and untried piece of magic. 
So! That is your assignment for next Monday: write a two-foot essay outlining what you think would happen if someone Apparated while holding a live geranium. And think about whether the size of the plant would make a difference.\'94
 He looked round at them all. \'93Is anyone writing this down?\'94 
\par The students scrambled to pull out their quills. Harry gave Sirius a small smile as he wrote. He had the feeling that Hermione had reached the limit of his knowledge and that he needed to do more research, but he thought t
hat Sirius had recovered well, giving the class a writing assignment to give him time to get up to speed on the papers that might have been published about Apparating with plants. 
\par \'93So. You all will answer that question in your essays. Moving on--I am looking for someone to tell me who else cannot Apparate....\'94

That evening after dinner, Ron reported to the Potions dungeon. Harry and Hermione went with him. He left them in the classroom, however, and stepped forward alone to knock on Snape\rquote s office door. 
\par \'93Come,\'94 was the terse reply. Ron turned the knob and entered. A steaming goblet was already waiting for him on the desk, Harry saw through the doorway. \'93Drink it all, Weasley,\'94 Snape said quietly. Harry wasn\rquote 
t sure, but he almost sounded sympathetic, and for the first time Harry wondered what Porphyry Potion was like. 
\par Ron nodded and picked up the goblet; he was standing sideways to Harry and Hermione, who could see Ron grimacing even as his Adam\rquote s apple bobbed repeatedly. Ron drained the goblet a
nd wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, then put it back on the desk. 
\par \'93Has Remus had his yet?\'94 he asked quietly. Snape nodded. 
\par \'93He flew to the castle from Hogsmeade after the last class and he has left again. He is working this evening.\'94 Hearing this, Harry realized that Remus must have gone back to his old job as a night watchman at the warehouse. 
\par Ron closed the door behind him as he left and didn\rquote t look at Harry or Hermione. Hermione tried to put her arm around him as they walked, but he squirmed
 out of her embrace and sped up, walking ahead of them, alone. Harry shook his head at Hermione, then saw that she had tears in her eyes. He sighed and reached out for her hand; she took it and he squeezed it sympathetically, feeling her do the same in re
turn. They walked behind Ron like that, holding hands. Harry watched Ron\rquote s back as he loped before them; his shoulders seemed to be bearing more than was fair for a seventeen-year-old boy, even if that boy was also a werewolf. 
\par Ron wasn\rquote t especially sociable in the common room that evening, even though it was Hermione\rquote 
s birthday. He went up to bed early without kissing Hermione good night. Harry had noticed that he was particularly moody starting the week before the full moon, and he wished Ron\rquote s first instinct wasn\rquote 
t to shut them out at that time. He kept Hermione company in the common room for a little while longer, until she claimed she was tired and wanted to sleep. He kissed her on the forehead and wished her a happy birthday, catching Ginny\rquote 
s eye. He missed her so much it was like an ache; he hadn\rquote t even been able to spend time with her the previous evening, when he was supposed to patrol with her, as she\rquote d swapped with Hermione and taken the first shift instead of second. 

\par When they reached the entrance hall the next morning, Draco Malfoy and Mariah Kirkner were not there to meet them as usual. Ginny shrugged and said listlessly, \'93They were doing the third shift last night. I meant this morning. They wouldn\rquote 
t have been done until four-thirty. They probably slept in.\'94 
\par Harry watched her face as she said this; her inflection was flat and toneless and she was starting to worry him; he didn\rquote t want her wasting away, as she\rquote d done in her other life. He wished he had managed to wake up at two
 in the morning and check the map the previous Saturday night; in the morning, Neville had informed him that he had slept straight through the alarm, he was so tired. Neville had had to stumble across the room to get it to stop making noise, as Harry wasn
\rquote t showing any signs of waking up and turning it off. 
\par At breakfast Ginny just picked at her food. A pall seemed to be cast over everything, to Harry. Even receiving a letter from Owen about the first team practice didn\rquote t make him feel differently. 
\par During Double Divination, after lunch, Ron\rquote s mood was worse than ever. Trelawney, of course, wasn\rquote t helping. She kept talking about his \'93melancholy aspect\'94 and how the fate he had suffered (being bitten by a werewolf) was \'93
surely seen in the stars.\'94 
\par \'93If it was bloody well seen in the stars,\'94 he grouched quietly to Harry, \'93it would have been nice for her to say something to me. Even if I couldn\rquote t have stopped it, I\rquote d have known.\'94 
\par Maggie was not present, as she was attending classes herself at that hour. Harry tho
ught he might try to talk to her later, to see whether she could talk to Ron. They got on well; having an older sister seemed to agree with Ron. He took her advice about most things far more seriously than when it came from Bill or Charlie (or, especially
, Percy). 
\par On Wednesday Harry was supposed to do the fourth patrol with Malfoy again, but found that the Slytherin had swapped with a Ravenclaw named Dorian who had been trying to get out of the third shift on Tuesday. Arnold Dorian was a sixth year who loo
ked more like a second year, at best. He seemed to be very sharp but talked a bit too much for Harry\rquote 
s taste. He reminded Harry of what Colin Creevey would be like if he swallowed a dictionary, the Standard Books of Spells for all seven years and Hogwarts, A History, just for good measure. Harry almost missed Malfoy. 
\par After lunch on Friday, they had Herbology and Care of Magical Creatures. Professor Sprout looked very harried when they arrived. 
\par \'93All right, everyone. I know you are seventh years, but I\rquote m afraid I won\rquote t be teaching you anything new today. I\rquote m putting you all to work. This is something you all know how to do. We\rquote 
re going to be repotting Mandrakes. There are one hundred plants, so each of you will be repotting at least five, but if you get six or seven done, you will receive ten house points...\'94 
\par \'93One hundred Mandrakes!\'94 Seamus Finnigan burst out. 
\par \'93Yes, one hundred. There were two hundred, but the sixth year Ravenclaws and Slytherins helped me with those. Now then--the earmuffs are over here. You know what to do. Don\rquote 
t dawdle! The headmaster wants a constant supply of Mandrake Draughts available in the school apothecary this year. I agree with him; we can\rquote t take any chances....\'94 
\par Harry wondered whether there were threats Dumbledore hadn\rquote t reveal
ed to him, threats that explained the need for so many Mandrakes. He retrieved a pair of earmuffs and found a worktable to use. Ron and Hermione were working together, and he saw that Ron seemed to acting a little more naturally around her again. Sunday w
ould be a different story, however; Harry knew Ron was planning to stay holed up in the Shrieking Shack all day and night. Dumbledore had given him permission (and he\rquote d had it rebuilt). On the eve of the full moon, Ron didn\rquote 
t want to take any chances. 
\par Harry was partnered with Justin Finch-Fletchley. They didn\rquote t need to put on their earmuffs right away, so they were able to talk. They stood in a queue to get terra cotta pots, and Harry said to him, \'93So. How was your holiday, Justin?\'94 

\par Justin frowned. \'93I\rquote ve had better.\'94 
\par Harry swallowed while the awkward silence stretched on and on. Finally, they reached the front of the queue and each of them took five pots and returned to their work stations. They donned their gardening gloves (the soft cloth ones that were 
adequate for plants whose touch wasn\rquote 
t lethal) and pulled out the bin under the table which held the potting soil. Justin started shoveling soil into a pot, but it just fell through the hole in the bottom. He swore, something Harry had never heard Justin do. He looked inordinately angry. 

\par \'93Forgot the sherds,\'94 he said tersely. 
\par \'93I\rquote ll get them,\'94 Harry said quickly. He went back to the benches along the back of the greenhouse, where there was a bin containing fragments of broken pots. He scooped up a bunch wit
h his gloved hands to protect him and carried the broken bits back to where Justin was staring into space. Why does everyone seem so changed now that we\rquote 
re in seventh year? he wondered, glancing at Neville briefly when he passed him on the way back. 
\par While they were placing pot sherds in the bottoms of their pots and adding potting soil, Harry thought he\rquote d give a conversation one more try. 
\par \'93How\rquote s Liam?\'94 he asked innocently. Justin raised blazing eyes to his. 
\par \'93Liam!\'94 he spat. Harry guessed this was the worst possible thing to say, but it was too late now. \'93Oh, he\rquote s fine as long as he can shag any bloke he wants. That\rquote s how Liam is.\'94 
\par Harry shoveled the potting soil into his pots and grimaced. After a few moments of silence, he thought Justin was done, but then he started up again. 
\par \'93I told him over and over that it wasn\rquote t his fault. But would he believe me? No; instead he had to start going to Muggle pubs, drinking too much and looking for any bloke who\rquote d have him....\'94 
\par Harry frowned. \'93What wasn\rquote t his fault?\'94 
\par \'93Niamh, of course.\'94 Justin sighed and looked very tired now. He stopped shoveling soil and just stood with his trowel in the air, appearing very forlorn. \'93
We had gone out the night before. I had my seventeenth birthday last November and learned to drive
 during the Christmas holidays. My mum gave me my very own car when I returned home in June. Convertible VW Golf. Not new, but still rather nice. Fantastic for driving along country roads with the top down.....\'94
 Suddenly, Justin had gone from not talking in anything but brief, terse sentences to emitting a stream of information. 
\par \'93Liam was supposed to go to Diagon Alley with his sisters the next morning. I dropped him off at a wizarding pub several miles from my house and he Flooed home from there. We were 
very late, and he was knackered in the morning. Orla said she tried to wake him up and once she could tell he was actually breathing she reckoned he was too tired for shopping and let him sleep. After--after Niamh died, he kept insisting that it was his f
ault. That if he\rquote d been there, he could have saved her, or died in her place....\'94 
\par \'93All right! Is everybody ready for their earmuffs?\'94 Professor Sprout said loudly from the front of the greenhouse. No one in the place could afford to not have their ears pro
tected once people started pulling Mandrakes from their pots. Justin had to stop talking now, to Harry\rquote s relief. He\rquote d forgotten all about Niamh dying in the Diagon Alley attack. And somehow, Liam had convinced himself that his sister\rquote 
s death was his fault, and he was drowning his sorrows in too much drink and too many strangers and pushing away Justin, whom Harry thought he loved.... 
\par When she ascertained that everyone\rquote s ears were covered, they began moving their Mandrakes from the old pots and putting them
 in the new. Harry was rather surprised to find that he had plants that ranged anywhere from infancy to adolescence. Why were they in so many different stages of development? he wondered. And then he wondered again why Dumbledore had been so adamant about
 the Mandrake Draught supply. 
\par Professor Sprout checked on everyone\rquote s repotting and then gave the signal for them to remove their earmuffs. Harry shook his head afterward; it was good to hear things again. The students bustled about, cleaning up, and Harry 
managed to say to Justin. 
\par \'93I\rquote m--I\rquote m sorry about Liam, Justin. You seemed to be good together.\'94 
\par \'93I thought so, too,\'94 Justin replied with a resigned sigh as he wiped down their worktable with a cleaning flannel. \'93But I wish he understood my point of view. Niamh wasn\rquote 
t thrilled about our seeing each other at first. I thought she was upset about Liam having a boyfriend instead of a girlfriend, but it turned out that wasn\rquote t it at all. She was actually against us at first because I\rquote 
m Muggle-born. They have relatives who are very rigid about purity of blood, all that rot. She finally came round, as Orla had fairly early, and then she was just grand, was Niamh. The four of us did a lot together. We even drove to Brighton 
earlier in the summer and spent several days. Fantastic weather. I mean--when I\rquote d heard she\rquote d died, I felt a bit like I\rquote d lost a sister, too--\'94 His voice had become thick and Harry saw that his eyes were shining. \'93Liam didn
\rquote t care about anyone else\rquote s mourning. No one else mattered. The most important thing was for him to beat himself up about it, morning, noon and night.\'94 His voice was a whisper now, but it didn\rquote t seem to be so that people couldn
\rquote t hear; Harry thought he might not have the strength to speak more loudly. 
\par \'93I\rquote m sorry,\'94 he said again, hearing how hollow a sentiment it was. But Justin finally smiled feebly. 
\par \'93Thanks, Harry.\'94 He took off his gloves and put them away, hoisting his rucksack on his shoulder and preparing to walk back to the castle. 
Harry watched him go; somehow, Justin looked very alone. He wondered whether he should ask Remus Lupin to talk to Justin, but changed his mind. Justin would probably just be hacked off if I did that. 
\par He turned and joined the other Gryffindors, who were walking down toward Hagrid\rquote 
s cabin for the Care of Magical Creatures class. Harry saw Neville walking by himself and caught up with him, hoping he could answer a question that was burning within him.. 
\par \'93Oi, Neville! Why do you suppose Sprout had us potting so many different sorts of Mandrakes? I mean, there were babies and toddlers--\'94 
\par He stopped and smiled a strange new smile that Harry had never seen on Neville\rquote s face before. Hermione and Ron, who\rquote d heard Harry\rquote s question, had been walking several feet behi
nd Harry. They practically collided with him and Neville. Neville looked at all three of them, looking very--un-Neville-like. 
\par \'93Can you three keep a secret?\'94 
\par They looked at each other, wide-eyed, before nodding. 
\par \'93I was staying at Professor Sprout\rquote s this 
summer. She has just a small cottage, but an enormous greenhouse. Dumbledore had her start the Mandrakes early in July. Trouble was, they would only have been two months old by the time the term started if they were just grown using normal methods. So he 
procured something from the Ministry that Sprout could use to speed up the growth, and asked her if there was anyone she could think of to help her. She thought of me,\'94 he said proudly. 
\par Hermione frowned. \'93There\rquote s no way to speed up a Mandrake\rquote s growth, as far as I know. What did the headmaster get from the Ministry?\'94 
\par He now looked like the cat that ate the cream. \'93Have you ever heard of--a Time Turner?\'94 
\par The three looked at each other nervously, then at Neville. 
\par \'93No, Neville,\'94 Hermione said innocently, while Harry tried not to laugh and Ron pressed his lips together and nudged her in the ribs. \'93What is it?\'94 
\par Neville told them about it, and the fact that they had used it to prematurely age the plants by actually traveling back in time with them. The trouble
 was, he and Professor Sprout had to travel forward in time again with the plants, so they were aged-up a bit too. 
\par \'93Technically, I should have celebrated my eighteenth birthday sometime in mid-August,\'94 he whispered as they drew nearer to Hagrid\rquote s. \'93And my nineteenth birthday should be around the end of the summer term. I\rquote m glad I\rquote 
m not doing it any more, though. Even though we were sticking to a schedule so that we ate proper meals and slept about six hours for every eighteen we were awake, I\rquote m rather tire
d of living through six days every time the rest of the world goes through one. My summer hols literally lasted a year, for me. It feels like ages since I\rquote ve been in school. Just hope I haven\rquote t forgotten everything. Except Herbology.\'94 

\par \'93No danger of that,\'94 Hermione said happily, seeing how well an extra year of maturity suited him. Having a clear purpose and duty seemed to suit him well too, Harry thought. He now understood the Neville he\rquote 
d noticed in the dorm, reading; he looked like he\rquote d grown up because 
he had. He was almost an entire year older than Harry, technically. It was odd to think this, since it was Neville, who constantly lost his toad and melted his cauldrons. Neville growing up. Well, Harry thought, remembering fixing the timelines. Stranger 
things have happened. Stranger things have certainly happened.

Ginny managed to avoid patrolling with him again on Sunday night, and Harry took on extra shifts over the weekend so that he could spend Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights with Ron 
in his Animagus form. Hermione switched some shifts as well. Harry tried to distract her during the day on Sunday, as Ron was keeping away and Harry didn\rquote 
t feel it was his place to tell Hermione why. After their final class on Monday, Ron drank his last dose of Wolfsbane Potion, the three of them ate in the school kitchens, and then went down to the Whomping Willow together, accompanied by Sirius. 
\par Harry put out his wand, touching the knot he knew would still the frantic branches. Sirius nodded at the three of them and they ducked down into the tunnel. They emerged in the rebuilt Shrieking Shack, sitting down together to wait for the sun to set. 

\par Ron sat alone, a brooding cast to his features. Hermione and Harry were to one side, waiting. Finally, Harry couldn\rquote t take it any more. 
\par \'93Oh, come on, Hermione. Just show me your Animagus form. Don\rquote t make we wait until moonrise....\'94 
\par She grinned and glanced at Ron. \'93Should I, do you think?\'94 
\par Ron shrugged. \'93Why not? This way you can explain it to him tonight, instead of making him wait for the morning.\'94 
\par \'93Oh, but it was going to be such fun to make him wait...\'94 
\par \'93Hermione!\'94 Harry pleaded. She laughed. 
\par \'93All right. Now, Harry, keep an open mind....\'94 She stood up. He nodded and waited. She took a deep breath and then-- 
\par Her paws touched down. Her nose had elongated into a snout and she had a slightly feathery tail. Her coat was a mix of grey and black, and her eyes glowed intelligently, her ears pricked up. Harry laughed. 
\par \'93I don\rquote t believe it!\'94 Then he stopped. \'93Wait a minute,\'94 he said, remembering something. \'93You started training to be an Animagus at the beginning of sixth year....\'94 
\par She changed into her human form again and sat next to him, breathing with difficulty. \'93I know. That\rquote s why, once Professor McGonagal
l and I knew what form I was going to take, I was reluctant to tell you two. I was afraid you might think I was going to be a wolf because of Remus--who was Professor Lupin to us at the time. I thought you would both accuse me of having a crush on a teach
er again.\'94 Harry was surprised; she didn\rquote t usually like to admit to her Lockhart crush. 
\par Harry was puzzled. \'93Then why--?\'94 
\par \'93I did all kinds of research to find out what animals I identified with. I like cats, of course, but after being one temporarily in second year--\'94 She shivered. \'93I didn\rquote 
t want to repeat that again, somehow. And then, in my research, I came across all of these articles in Shaman Monthly about North American shamans and wolves. The Clan of the Wolf is so revered, Harry, and it\rquote s in part be
cause the wolf is regarded as a teacher. When I read that, something in me just clicked. I know you said I was a cellist in your other life, and when I was small I thought about being a doctor--but in recent years, more and more, I\rquote 
ve come to think that what I really feel like, deep down, is a teacher.\'94 
\par Harry patted her hand. \'93Well, you were very good at teaching me Summoning Charms for the Tournament,\'94 he said, smiling. 
\par She nodded. \'93Something about teaching just--just makes me feel completed. I\rquote ve talked to Maggie about it a little, since her parents--I mean, her adoptive parents--were teachers, and she\rquote 
s a teacher. She talks about teaching as a calling, not a job. I know just how she feels! If I trained at St. Mungo\rquote s to be a doctor, it would never be mo
re than a job to me. But teaching....Just look at some of our most dedicated teachers here at Hogwarts! Do you think they do it for the money? The more I read about the attributes of the wolf the more I knew that this was an animal I could bond with, that
 I could learn to become. I felt like the wolf chose me, not the other way around....\'94 
\par Harry nodded. \'93That\rquote s how I felt about the griffin.\'94 
\par \'93Right! But then--well, when Remus bit Ron--\'94 she looked at Ron sadly; \'93--I was no longer worried about you two thi
nking I was attracted to Remus. Instead, I felt like--like I caused Ron to become a werewolf. Which is stupid and superstitious and I should know better. I\rquote ve said all of that to myself countless times, so you don\rquote 
t need to. But I still felt incredibly guilty. Remus finally talked me out of it, and talked me out of going to McGonagall to try to choose a different animal form. I know I wasn\rquote 
t supposed to tell others about my training, but he was a teacher at the time, and I couldn\rquote t think of anyone who would understand better what I was going through. He said that your dad,\'94 she said to Harry, \'93
and Sirius and even Pettigrew were the same way about choosing their animals. Started off thinking that it was their decision, and their animals choosing them sort of 
snuck up on them. He asked me why I chose a wolf and I told him. He asked me whether those things were still true after he bit Ron, about the wolf-as-teacher and so on. I said they were. Finally, he convinced me that it wasn\rquote t my fault he\rquote 
d bitten Ron and that I should go ahead and stick with my wolf form, especially as I was almost done my training. So I did, and to my relief, when I showed Ron for the first time, he didn\rquote t throw a wobbly.\'94 
\par Harry smiled at her, but then he noticed that Ron was looking rat
her ragged around the edges. He nodded at her and changed into his griffin form. Hermione became a grey timber-wolf once more and a few moments later, Harry tensed up, as Ron was screaming in agony from his transformation. When it was finally over, he san
k down onto the floor, resting his jaw on his front paws, looking very tired and dog-like, and not at all dangerous, thanks to the Wolfsbane Potion. Harry and Hermione flanked him and closed their eyes too. Harry felt his cat\rquote 
s motor rumbling through him an
d heard the peaceful snuffling of the wolves next to him. This was as it should be, he thought: the two of them were with Ron, keeping him from spending the night alone in a wooden shack with the wind whistling through the cracks. They\rquote 
d been friends since they\rquote d knocked out a mountain troll together and they weren\rquote t going to stop being friends now just because one of them was a werewolf.

\par The train pulled into the station and slowed to a stop. Passengers began to emerge; it was the usual collection of rather }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 un}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
usual-looking people Harry had almost become accustomed to encountering in the wizarding world. Witches and wizards short and tall, wearing robes and a great variety of hats (
tall, pointed and traditional; squashy top hats, bonnets, and so on) and carrying a variety of luggage or parcels (or levitating them). 
\par Harry scanned the crowd, frowning. He didn't see her anywhere. 
\par Finally, he heard the familiar sharp voice and jerked his head around. 
\par "What does a person have to do to get some service around here? I need my things moved and that means }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 now}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 !" 
\par Harry rushed to the train and peered into the doorway from which the voice was emanating. A conductor was standing in the corridor, looking exasperated. "We don't generally levitate things }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 for}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  people, ma'am, when they can do it themselves..." 
\par "I tried, you ninny! But this thing--" she waved a slim, pale stick at the conductor, "isn't doing what I want it to do--" She pointed it at t
he door to the compartment and it started sliding back and forth rapidly and lethally, like a sideways guillotine. 
\par "I think we can take it from here," the headmaster told the confused conductor. He moved unobtrusively past Harry and onto the train, then p
ut his hand gently on Petunia Dursley's arm and said to her, "You don't need that right now, Mrs. Dursley. Just put it away and Harry will show you to the boat." Harry wasn't sure when she'd acquired the wand; it was possible Mrs. Figg had taken his aunt 
to Diagon Alley for it. He wished he'd been there to see }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par "Boat?" She perked up. "Where? Where? Oh, that sounds lovely," she started babbling at him as Harry led her off the train and toward the small dock. "We went on a lovely cruise last summer to--" 
\par She stammered to a dead stop and stared at the tiny boat bob
bing in the water. Harry climbed in, having some difficulty avoiding stepping on his robes. He stretched his hand out to her to help her board, but she didn't take the proffered hand. She simply stared open-mouthed at the fragile-looking vessel. She looke
d up at the castle across the lake, swallowing, and Harry remembered when he climbed into one of the small boats with Ron, Hermione and Neville six years earlier, gazing awestruck at the vision that was Hogwarts castle. 
\par Dumbledore arrived at the edge of the dock, casually levitating Petunia Dursley's luggage with his wand, including a small dog carrier, from which irate yips were heard. Harry closed his eyes, grimacing. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Bloody hell,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 She's brought Dunkirk.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par His aunt whirled on the headmaster. "I am supposed to get into--into that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 thing}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?" she said disdainfully, pointing at the small craft. "There aren't even any oars!" 
\par Dumbledore levitated the luggage--including Dunkirk's carrier--into a second boat bobbing nearby. "There is no need for oars, dear
 lady, but if they would be reassuring to you--" He waved his hand toward the boats and oars appeared for each one. There were no oarlocks holding them in place, however; the oars merely hovered in position to begin rowing as though unseen persons were in
 fact holding them. He waved his hand toward the boat. 
\par "After you, Mrs. Dursley. Harry, please assist your aunt." 
\par Harry stood again, his legs a bit wobbly as the boat moved under him. He held out his hand to her once more. She still hesitated. 
\par "Do I--do I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 have}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to?" she whined. 
\par Harry felt an unexpected pang of sympathy for her, seeing her chin shake with fright. He didn't know whether she was asking if she had to get in the boat or whether she had to go to Hogwarts--perhaps she had changed her mind. 
\par "I'm afraid so. All who are new to Hogwarts must cross the lake," the headmaster said smoothly. 
\par She nodded, as if she understood something she hadn't before. "Ah, a rite of passage." Now that she had a label she could give to the trip across the lake, she cli
mbed in gingerly, grasping Harry's hand painfully hard, and she was soon settled in the stern, sitting to one side so that the boat was listing rather severely. Once Dumbledore climbed in, the boat was on an even keel again. Harry sat in the prow, facing 
t
he castle. He turned to see what was surely one of the strangest sights the world had ever seen: Petunia Dursley, dressed like a witch, seated next to Albus Dumbledore in a tiny boat. Dumbledore waved his hands casually at the poised oars, and they began 
to move of their own accord, rowing both vessels across the glassy water. 
\par Harry turned to face forward again, shivering as an unbidden memory of approaching Azkaban came to him. The water slapping on wood made his stomach clench, and he remembered the holl
ow, cold feeling he'd had inside as they'd dragged him to his cell... He shook himself and tried to clear his head, thinking about how clear and cool the night air was, and how beautiful the castle looked as they drew nearer to it. 
\par At last, they reached t
he cave under the castle where the boats ran to ground. Harry climbed out first, getting his ankle-high boots a bit wet, and pulled their boat onto higher, drier ground, so that the headmaster and his aunt would not need to tread in the water. 
\par Soon they w
ere in the entrance hall, the luggage following behind. Mrs. Figg was waiting for them amid a flood of students streaming through to go into the Great Hall for the evening meal. Petunia Dursley choked out an anguished yet relieved cry when she saw Mrs. Fi
g
g; Harry noted that, while his old baby sitter was wearing robes, she was wearing them open like an overcoat that hadn't been buttoned, and her Muggle clothes were visible underneath. She wore a nondescript skirt, blouse and cardigan such as Harry had alw
ays known her to wear while he was growing up in Surrey. This seemed to serve to comfort his aunt by dint of its familiarity. She also wasn't wearing a hat, he noticed. 
\par "Arabella! It's so good to see a familiar face!" 
\par Harry grimaced yet again. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 What am I}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? 
He noticed that some students passing by were looking at his aunt apprehensively, perhaps fearing another new teacher. Then Draco Malfoy emerged from the dungeons and Petunia noticed him immediately. 
\par "Yoo-hoo! Draco! Hello!" She waved to him, her voice a 
wavering sing-song. A number of students turned to stare at Draco Malfoy, and he reddened. Harry grinned, glad that he had a perfectly legitimate excuse for being there (his status as Head Boy) other than his familial connection. Caught out, Draco Malfoy 
dutifully strode over to Petunia Dursley to greet her properly. 
\par "Welcome to Hogwarts, Mrs. Dursley. How was your trip?" Harry realized that he hadn't officially welcomed his aunt, nor enquired about the trip. He tried not to feel irked at how }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 smooth}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Draco Malfoy could be. He forced himself to remember that in his other life he'd actually admired this in his best friend. 
\par She smiled at him the way she used to beam at Dudley. "Fine, except--" Now she looked uncertain. "A woman came round selling sweets. Luckily, she accepted }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 real}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 money in payment, but unfortunately she didn't seem to have any real }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 food}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 for me to buy. I tried these 'Chocolate Frogs,' and they started leaping about the compartment! And then the, er," she paused, pulling something out of her pocket, "}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Every Flavor Beans}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  were absolutely }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 vile}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . They seem to have every flavor but }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 food}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 flavor." She held out the remainder to Draco, who put his hand up, politely declining to eat any. Just then, an excited yipping was heard from the dog carrier still floating nearby. 
\par "Oh! Is that who I think it is?" Draco said, looking genuinely happy. He went on his knees to peer inside the small barred window in the door of the carrier. "Hello there, mate! Miss me, did you?" The yipping increased in volume and intensity.
 "Can I let him out?" 
\par "Of course," Harry's aunt said as Dumbledore's mouth was just starting to form a word. 
\par "}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Actually...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 " the headmaster started to say quietly, while Draco Malfoy flicked open the lock on the carrier. Dunkirk leapt out of the door and i
mmediately jumped on Draco, licking his face and wagging his stumpy tail enthusiastically. 
\par Just then, Harry noticed that Filch had entered the hall, followed closely by his eerie cat. Mrs. Norris stopped in mid-step, her luminous eyes focused on Dunkirk a
nd nothing else. Harry felt an electric crackling in the air as the cat's back arched and its fur stood on end. Suddenly, Dunkirk lifted his head and saw the cat, recognizing his natural enemy, and a low growl was the only warning any of them received bef
ore he was off. 
\par Harry had never known such mayhem. Mrs. Norris leapt from person to person, claws sinking deep into flesh, past layers of clothes, while Dunkirk snapped at the air and wove around the myriad legs keeping him from his quarry. More than one s
tudent (and a couple of teachers) tripped over him and fell, panicking, as everyone tried to avoid Mrs. Norris inserting those razor-sharp claws into their skin. Dean Thomas screamed shrilly (Harry thought it was his sister Jamaica at first) as the cat la
nded on his }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 head}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, and Parvati started to take out her wand to help him, but wound up falling backwards over the terrier, looking like her both her bum and her dignity were injured as a result. Sparks flew from her wand and burnt Seamus Finnigan, who had bee
n trying to duck behind a suit of armor. He promptly brought the shell of a knight crashing to the ground in a racket that echoed deafeningly around the entrance hall. And that was just what Harry could see going on near him; farther off in the crowd that
 had been attempting to enter the Great Hall, he heard more screams, saw more sparks above the sea of hats and heads, and heard more swearing than he usually encountered at a Quidditch match (some of it coming from teachers). 
\par "Mrs. Norris!" Filch cried, ge
nuinely concerned, and Harry remembered how distraught he had been when she'd been petrified by the basilisk. He leapt from person to person also (feet staying on the ground, for the most part) until, finally, the cat made a spectacular bound onto the mar
b
le banister, then onto the marble stairs themselves, streaking away up into the shadowy interior of the castle. Dunkirk, with his little legs, tried to follow her up the stairs, but he wasn't designed for this and quickly fell far behind the cat; Mrs. Nor
ris had vanished from sight. 
\par "}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Accio}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
," Dumbledore said calmly, deftly catching the little dog in his large, gnarled hands when he came flying at the old wizard. He petted him briefly, then bent over and reinserted Dunkirk into the carrier, closing the door 
with an air of finality. Harry noted that Dunkirk had not growled at the headmaster. Dumbledore turned to Petunia Dursley, still very calm, ignoring the bleeding casualties of Mrs. Norris' frantic flight. He nodded at her grimly, his mouth every bit as th
i
n as Professor McGonagall's when she was displeased, and Harry was gratified to see that she looked momentarily as cowed as if she had received a scolding. Whimpering students were putting healing charms on each other, while others were skirting Harry, Du
mbledore, Mrs. Figg and Petunia Dursley very cautiously, before bolting into the Great Hall. 
\par "You and I will be sharing a suite of rooms, Petunia," Mrs. Figg told her, patting her arm. "There's a nice little grassy courtyard nearby where Dunkirk can run ab
out and get some exercise while you're busy doing other things. You needn't worry about my cats, either, as my brother Alastor is caring for them. And I'm certain Draco would love to take him for walks on the grounds, when Dunkirk finds the courtyard conf
ining." 
\par Draco straightened up uncertainly at the mention of his name; Harry just realized he'd been cowering behind him while Mrs. Norris was leaping from person to person. The Slytherin was turning quite red. 
\par "And," Dumbledore added to Mrs. Figg's comments, "when, er, Dunkirk is not in your rooms," he nodded at the two women, "he will remain on a lead in the castle and on the grounds. Understood?" He raised one eyebrow at Draco and Petunia. Draco nodded. 

\par "Yes, Professor," he said deferentially, surprising Harry. Petunia Dursley pursed her lips and looked at Harry's Head Boy badge. 
\par "Well! Perhaps the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Head Boy}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  can make himself }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 useful}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  and take my bags to my rooms..." 
\par Harry bristled. Dumbledore had let the luggage drop during the cat-and-dog-chase, but Harry aimed his wand at each piece--including the dog carrier--and levitated it all again. 
\par "Lead on, Arabella. Come along, Harry," his aunt said imperiously, waving her hand at Mrs. Figg, who turned with a fro
wn and began to ascend the marble stairs with a very stiff, straight back, her robes clutched in her hands so she wouldn't trip. Harry was still getting used to seeing her wear robes (even robes worn over Muggle clothes, as she was wearing this evening). 

\par "Yes, Aunt Petunia," Harry muttered miserably. He saw now that his two best friends and Ginny were among the students who had not yet made it into the Great Hall. Hermione and Ron sent him sympathetic looks before they went into dinner. Harry caught Ginny
'
s eye for a moment, feeling hopeful, but she turned slowly away and followed the other students in to dinner. He started moving the luggage up the stairs with his wand, trying not to notice how many other students were still thronging the entrance hall, e
ven though a number had fled into the Great Hall. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 So much for no one knowing we're related,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought. 
\par He perked up his ears when they reached the tapestry that concealed the entrance to the staff wing; Mrs. Figg was explaining to his aunt that a password was required to gain admittance. Then he heard it: }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 palindrome.
}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  That was the password. 
\par "What did you say, Arabella?" his aunt said loudly. "Dromedary? Isn't that like a llama?" 
\par "Camel. I did }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  say }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 dromedary.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry, tell her." She raised an eyebrow at him. 
\par "Er, she said 'palindrome,' Aunt Petunia," he said, reddening, realizing that Mrs. Figg could tell that he'd been trying to hear the word. 
\par "Right! And you're not to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 share}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  that information with anyone, understand, Harry? I think }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 should know, as you're Head Boy, but }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 no one else.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 " 
\par "Not even Hermione?" 
\par "Oh, well--yes, all right. As she's the Head Girl I suppose she should know as well. I'm sure Albus would agree." 
\par They had to walk down more than a few corridors and make a number of turns even after
 entering the staff wing. When they finally reached their suite of rooms, Mrs. Figg took out a large key and unlocked the door. She waved her wand and suddenly, she was holding two keys, one of which she handed to Petunia Dursley. Harry moved the luggage 
into the bedroom that seemed to be unoccupied while Mrs. Figg lit a fire. His aunt let Dunkirk out of his carrier, cooing over him, sitting on the couch in front of the fire, while Dunkirk jumped up on his mistress' lap. 
\par "}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 There's my widdle Dunky-wunky out of that nasty box...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 " she crooned to him in a high-pitched sing-song voice. 
\par Harry sat on a chair adjacent to the couch. He looked down at his hands, frowning. He wanted to ask her about so many things; whether she was in 
good health and rid of the cancer; how his uncle was dealing with her being a witch and coming to Hogwarts; when she bought a wand... But years of conditioning had taken their toll, and he found himself unable to utter these questions right after she had 
d
one such an unimaginable thing as coming to live at Hogwarts. He had been told quite often, when he was young, not to ask nosy questions. Once or twice, when his aunt or uncle was sick with a cold, he had even enquired after their health, but had that imp
ulse drummed out of him by their hostile and suspicious responses. ("}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Oh, we think we can have the run of the house while I'm laid up sick in bed, do we? Well, we'll just see about that..."}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ) So much had changed, and yet--so much had remained the same. Despite Dudley having become his friend and his aunt going to Rodney Jeffries for help.... 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Rodney Jeffries.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  There; that was it. He could ask about Rodney Jeffries. 
\par "Oh, by the way," he said, trying to sound casual. "Have you heard anything about Rodney Jeffrie
s?" He had to bite his tongue to keep from saying that he'd been healed by Jeffries. He remembered the letter Jeffries had left him and wondered whether he had followed through. 
\par She brightened up as though she had learnt of some extremely juicy gossip about her next-door neighbor. "Yes! It was in the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Times}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . He's back and bigger than }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ever}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ! He's had an audience with the queen. Scotland Yard has said that the nutters who wanted to investigate him have been thoroughly reprimanded, }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 and}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  next month he's appearing
 at the Royal Albert Hall! He's going to be traveling round the country--proper venues this time, mind you, no more tents--and the BBC is going to carry it all! Even the Archbishop of Canterbury himself has made a statement in support of what he's doing, 
as well as }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 two}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  medical societies!" 
\par Harry's jaw dropped. "But--what about the Ministry? Aren't they after him for doing magic in front of Muggles?" 
\par Mrs. Figg shrugged. "There was also a statement in the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Prophet}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to the effect that he was just a Muggle charl
atan, that there was no record of him in the wizarding world, and that if wizards and witches want to waste their time going to see him, that's not the Ministry's lookout." 
\par "He's }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  a charlatan..." his aunt began, bristling. 
\par "Witches and wizards are going to see him?" Harry asked Mrs. Figg. 
\par "Harry, these days }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 everyone}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  is. I admit, I'm rather shocked by that in particular," Mrs. Figg said, shaking her head. 
\par He also shook his head in disbelief. "You're not serious! And all of this has happened in the last six weeks? How is that possible?" 
\par Aunt Petunia shrugged happily, petting Dunkirk. "With Rodney Jeffries, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 anything}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  is possible. Why, if it weren't for him, I wouldn't be cancer-free!" 
\par Harry opened his eyes wide in shock. "That's wonderful! Congratulations. But--what does Jeffries have to do with it?" 
\par "If he hadn't turned me into a witch, I doubt that the visualization techniques Arabella taught me would have worked. On my last visit to the doctor, he said he couldn't find a trace of cancer. He called it a 'spontaneous idiopathic cure.'" 
\par He frowned. "What's that mean?" 
\par Mrs. Figg sat in a chair opposite Harry. "A sudden unexplained cure. In other words, he hasn't got the foggiest idea what happened and he's probably worried that he misdiagnosed Petunia. Or someone else." 
\par "Oh." Harry hoped the doctor didn't have a crisis of confidence over this. "Well, Uncle Vernon must have been glad to know you were cured." 
\par His aunt pursed her lips again and let Dunkirk jump onto the floor. He went to the hearth rug and turned around three times, then curled up before the fire. "He--he'll be fine on his own for a while. Marge has moved in, to take care of him--" 
\par Harry made a face. "}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Aunt Marge?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 " 
\par "Well," his aunt said feebly; "Marge isn't so bad. She--just speaks her mind. There's nothing wrong with that." 
\par "Right!" Mrs. Figg affirmed. She pulled out her wand, and, with a flick of the wrist, produced a tray with tea and crumpets. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 She would agree with that,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 Harry thought. But somehow, something just seemed a bit }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 off}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  about what his aunt had said about her husband. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
He'll be fine on his own for a while}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  was worrying him, somehow. Had they parted on good terms? 
\par "We should get down to the Great Hall," he said, feeling awkward, his voice shaking. "They'll be on puddings soon if we don't hurry..." 
\par "You go on, Harry. I think we'll have our tea here tonight. Petunia can see the Great Hall at breakfast." Mrs. Figg was taking charge again. 
\par Harry rose. "Well, goodnight then. See you in the morning, Aunt Petunia." 
\par "Goodnight, Harry," Mrs. Figg said briskly as his aunt busied herself about buttering a crumpet, not saying anything. Remembering the way she also hadn't said goodbye to him befor
e he left for Ascog, he decided that some things would never change. Then, just as he had put his hand on the knob, he turned and looked at the back of her head again, thinking about how Dudley would have been a blubbering mess at the thought of losing hi
s mother. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 It's never going to change if I don't make the first move.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  It had worked with his mother, in his other life. Maybe they didn't }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
have}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to have an adversarial relationship forever... 
\par He strode back to his aunt and said, "I'm glad that you're going to
 be all right. Welcome to Hogwarts, Aunt Petunia." He bent over and kissed her cheek quickly. He was aware of a look of utter shock on his aunt's face (and Mrs. Figg's face) as he returned to the door and let himself out. 
\par Harry started to turn left after 
leaving his aunt and Mrs. Figg, then thought for a moment and turned right instead. He recognized some familiar paintings from his other life and knew that he was walking in the correct direction now. Then, just before he turned a corner, he heard a famil
iar voice in the corridor he was about to enter. 
\par "Why, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Miss}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Dougherty," the smooth, deep voice said with a hint of amusement. "Are you making an improper suggestion to a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 teacher}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? Do I need to take away house points?" 
\par Harry heard a sly laugh that sounded disconcertingly like Ginny's, followed by the unmistakable sound of kissing. "Mmm--you were planning on something that would cost me house points? Sounds nice--" 
\par Harry winced; he wished he were anywhere else on the planet, but no one was miraculously whisking him away, and there was that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 kissing}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  sound again. 
\par "Changed your mind, Miss Dougherty?" Snape said when the kissing sounds ceased. He sounded slightly disappointed. 
\par "Not entirely. It's just that Harry is probably already feeling uncomfortable enough, and he'd also probably like his dinner--" 
\par Harry sheepishly poked his head around the corner and saw Maggie and Snape standing in the corridor, a nearby door slightly ajar, which Harry assumed was Maggie's room or suite of rooms. Or Snape's. Either way, he
 didn't know when he'd felt so embarrassed. "Oh, hello," he said lamely. "I was just helping my aunt settle in--" 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Don't worry, Harry,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  said a voice in his brain. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
I knew you were there the whole time. I was just having a little fun. Sorry if we embarrassed you.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Maggie?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought, confused and alarmed. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 You can talk to me through my mind?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I only did it sometimes, accidentally, when I was young. Since I arrived here I've been reading up on it and practicing more.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Harry was flummoxed. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Can you--can you read my mind?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
I can sense your emotions. That's how I knew you were there, around the corner. But I can't technically read your mind. If you think something at me, I can hear you just as though you'd spoken aloud. You have to mean for me to know what you're thinking.}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par "Er," Harry said awkwardly. "I think I'd like to go back to actually talking. Aloud." 
\par Snape raised one dark eyebrow at her. "Were you doing what I think you were doing?" 
\par She laughed. "Just practicing a little. I've stopped now. We should all get down to dinner." They walked down the last corridor together and left the staff wing, lifting the tapestry out of the way. 
\par As they descended staircase after staircase, Harry glanced nervously at Maggie, wondering whether he was going to start hearing her in his head again. He practically jumped out of his skin when she spoke out loud. 
\par "I thought it would be nice if you and Ron and Ginny and Hermione came to tea in my rooms tomorrow," Maggie said carelessly. "When I ran into Ron earlier, he said that the t
wo of you don't have practice again tomorrow, that you're each having one more during the day on Saturday, before Sunday's match." 
\par "Right. No practice again tomorrow." Several times a week, after classes, Sirius had been taking him by Portkey to Wales and
 Remus had been taking Ron to Kent. Harry and Ron had been trying not to think about the fact that they had to play each other in their first match. Whichever team won would be continuing on to the quarter-finals. Harry was glad that he wasn't playing Kee
p
er for Wales and hoped he caught the Snitch before Ron managed to make the score too unbalanced for the Welsh team to recover. Ron had been beaming every time he returned from practice; Monty Mathers was over the moon about having snagged Ron. Apparently,
 he'd been with the team for over ten years and had had his eye on Charlie for Seeker when Charlie finished school. He'd been sorely disappointed when Charlie had gone off to Romania to study dragons. 
\par "Well," Ron had said rather smugly, "he's finally got a Weasley on the team!" 
\par "Er, yeah," Harry said to Maggie. "Tea tomorrow would be nice." 
\par "Tell the others for me, will you?" she added as they reached the Great Hall. She had been walking arm in arm with Snape until they arrived at the top of the marble stairs; then she disconnected from him and walked next to Harry. She picked up speed, thou
g
h, when they were at the doorway to the Great Hall, walking in ahead of Harry and striding toward the head table. Harry turned, wondering where Snape was, but found him in the shadows at the edge of the doorway, a smile creeping up at the corners of his m
outh as he watched Maggie. 
\par Harry edged over to him, trying not to grin maniacally. 
\par "}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 She makes you happy}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ," he said quietly. 
\par Snape's face closed up at once. "Do I need to take house points for impertinence?" he said in what would be a menacing voice, were 
it not for the fact that Harry could see how his eyes were dancing merrily. He'd never been so thoroughly reminded of his stepfather by the Snape in this life. 
\par "No, no. But aren't you lucky I was leaving the staff wing when I was? See, this way, you can b
e seen walking into the Great Hall conversing with the Head Boy and captain of the Dueling Club, rather than the pretty young Seer who just found out she's a witch..." 
\par Snape smirked. "Well. It turns out that you }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 do}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  have your uses..." 
\par Harry stifled a laugh. "So. We should actually talk about something. The Dueling Club? Or how about--who do you think will win Sunday's match? England or Wales?" 
\par Harry started walking into the hall, and now Snape was beside him, matching him step for step. "That depends. Are you planning to be under the weather so that Erica Welsh will be playing Seeker? If so, then my money would be on Wales." 
\par "Very funny," Harry said, preparing to sit at the Gryffindor table beside Ron. 
\par "You asked, Potter," Snape replied with a perfectly 
straight face, nodding at him and then continuing on to the head table. Harry felt happy for no reason he could explain as he sat next to his best friend. Perhaps it was the prospect of being on better terms with his aunt. Or feeling like he could talk to
 either Snape }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 or}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Sirius, and not feel guilty about either one of them. 
\par He started helping himself to some cold roast chicken and cold boiled carrots (since he didn't fancy cold, glutinous mashed potatoes), but when he lifted his eyes, he was looking direct
ly at Ginny, and the sad expression on her face went right to his heart. She no longer looked angry with him, but as though she were trying to convince herself, as though staying angry with him would make it easier for her to stay away from him. 
\par He forced
 himself to look away form her and turned to Ron, starting to spear some pieces of carrot on the end of his fork. "Well, Aunt Petunia's settling in. She and Mrs. Figg are having their tea in their suite tonight." He put some food into his mouth, trying no
t to meet Ginny's gaze. 
\par It wasn't clear that Ron had noticed he'd said anything. "Oh, good," Ron said, looking up at the head table; "there's Snape. I--" He stopped suddenly when Harry guffawed and almost spit out his food. "What?" Ron demanded indignantly
 as Harry struggled to swallow without choking. 
\par "It's just that--you're the last person I ever expected to say the words, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Oh, good, there's Snape.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 " 
\par Ron picked up Harry's chicken leg, took a large bit out of it, then returned it to Harry's plate. "I 'ave 
t'get more poshun from 'im," Ron said around the bite of chicken he was harboring in his cheek pouch. The full moon was less than a week away and Ron had been taking potion for several days already. 
\par Now Harry decided to pretend Ron hadn't said anything (a
nd studiously ignored the large bite his best friend had taken from his chicken leg). It was as though they were having two different conversations. Harry had noticed that Ron became somewhat distracted during the time leading up to the full moon. He was 
especially worried about making certain that he took his potion every day during the week preceding his change into a werewolf. 
\par "Speaking of tea, Maggie's invited the four of us to tea in her rooms tomorrow after classes." 
\par "The four of who?" Ron asked, having chewed and swallowed the chicken. 
\par "You and me and Hermione and Ginny." He did not look at Ginny when he said her name. 
\par Hermione, sitting on Ron's other side, spoke for the first time. "That'll be nice!" she said brightly. "A very pleasant way to begin the weekend." 
\par "Well, she thought that it would be a good time, since neither Ron nor I have to go to a practice again until Saturday." 
\par "You'll understand, I hope, why Ginny and I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 have}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to cheer for England on Sunday?" Hermione smiled at him. "I mean--even if Ron }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 weren't}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  my boyfriend and Ginny's brother, we }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 are}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  from England--" 
\par "So am I from England! Or at least, I've lived there most of my life." Harry grinned at her. "All the same, prepare to be disappointed..." 
\par Ron laughed. "Oh, don't you know when I'm kidding?" Hermione said, smiling at Harry. "We'll be carefully dividing up our cheering between both sides. You know, cheering for whoever's ahead at the moment..." 
\par "Oh, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  won't get you in any trouble from the spectators sitting around you..." Ron i
ntoned sarcastically, reaching for more food. Harry had also noticed that his appetite was greater near the full moon. 
\par Neville, sitting next to Ginny, pushed his plate away and looked grumpy. "It's not fair that everyone in Gryffindor doesn't get to go. T
wo of our housemates playing in the match! But then--I didn't get to go to the World Cup, either. My gran hates Quidditch. She sent back the permission form, and she'd written across it, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 When pigs fly.}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  I've been of-age for months now. I shouldn't need her permission..." 
\par Hermione looked at him sympathetically. "Everyone needs permission to leave the castle grounds--except for Apparition lessons--whether they're of-age or not. I just hope Professor Dumbledore changes his mind about Hogsmeade weekends..." 
\par "D
on't worry, Neville," Ginny said, patting his hand. "No matter who's in the final, Fred and George are getting us tickets, as they have the concessions contract. We'll make sure they get you a ticket, too. You can say you're visiting some friends during t
he Christmas holiday--which will be true. Surely your gran will let you do that?" 
\par The expression Neville wore as he gazed at Ginny made Harry want to throttle him. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 How dare he look at her like that!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par "That--that would be }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 completely}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 brilliant, Ginny! You--you'd do that?" Suddenly, he seemed like the old Neville again, rather than the rapidly-matured Neville who'd spent the summer using a Time Turner. But a moment later, as he gazed at Ginny intently, the boyishness dropped from his 
f
ace and he seemed suddenly far too serious again. Harry thought he was perhaps uncomfortable with being older without having experienced much during the intervening time. He hadn't gone to school, he hadn't socialized with anyone his own age. He'd just sp
ent what amounted to six months gardening. 
\par She smiled warmly at him, and Harry wondered how she could not see that this was tantamount to leading him on. "Of course." Harry looked at Neville again; his feelings were quite plain on his face, and Harry remem
bered how he'd tricked Ginny into going to the ceilidh, and he remembered Neville and Ginny walking in the snow together in his other life, and going to the Yule Ball together during the Triwizard Tournament. He'd been accused of being in the pining-for-G
inny-Weasley "club," along with Neville. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Neville!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par And now, Neville was so grown-up and--and }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 different.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Sometimes. Harry looked down at his food before anyone asked him why he was gawping at Neville. }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 No,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 This can't be happening.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Soon they were eating their puddings, and Neville took a slice of chocolate cake, saying to Ginny, "I may not be able to finish this, Ginny. Would you like to share it with me?" 
\par Harry tried not to watch them taking turns spearing chocolaty lumps on their forks, talking and laughing as Neville regaled her with some funny things Sirius had said during their last Apparition lesson. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
It's Sirius who's witty, you prat,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry thought resentfully; }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you're just parroting his words.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Suddenly, Harry felt the hair on the back of his
 neck standing on end and a premonitory sensation prickle over his scalp. He turned and looked across the Great Hall. Draco Malfoy wasn't eating anything; he might have done, but he wasn't moving. A spoonful of trifle was in his hand, which seemed to be f
rozen in midair. Harry thought he might be glaring at him, but then he realized that he was actually glaring }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 past}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 Harry. His face was a mask of utter hatred and revulsion as he watched Neville Longbottom and Ginny Weasley.

 their run, the eight of them were cooling down in the corridor outside Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, as the entrance hall was too chilly. Ginny removed the sweatshirt she'd been wearing over a T-shirt, briefly wiping the perspiration from her brow with the 
s
hirt before continuing to do more stretches for the cool-down. Harry tried not to stare, but it was difficult; the basilisk amulet hung down on the fabric right between her breasts, and he felt as though it would take a super-human effort to focus on anyt
hing else in the world. He finally did manage to wrench his eyes away, and saw that Malfoy's gaze had gone to the same place, a lopsided smile on his pale face. Harry grimaced and looked away, seeing Mariah giving Malfoy a somewhat hostile glare. }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 She's jealous,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry realized. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 He's cheating on Ginny with her, and she wants him all to herself.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 Harry wondered how he might turn that to his advantage.... 
\par But suddenly, he realized that Mariah was no longer looking at Draco Malfoy; her attention had been drawn by
 the basilisk amulet as well, though not for the same reason that it attracted Harry and Malfoy. She strode over to Ginny and picked up the amulet, holding it in the flat of her palm. She was wearing those fingerless gloves again. 
\par "Where the haill did ye get }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 this?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 " 
\par Ginny frowned at her, then said, "Oh! You mean 'where the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 hell}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ....'" 
\par Mariah looked openly hostile now. "Stop makin' fun o' my accent. Ye know what I mean." 
\par Ginny shook her head. "No, I'm afraid I don't. I--I bought it and gave it to someone, but he didn't keep it." Her eyes flicked briefly in Harry's direction, then back to Mariah. 
\par "Bought it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 where}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?" Mariah demanded. 
\par Ginny looked nervous; Harry remembered that she'd been in Knockturn Alley to buy the amulet, at Borgin and Burkes, and she looked reluctant to admit this. 
\par "In London," she said quietly, which was technically true. 
\par Mariah didn't question this. She was shaking her head, a disgusted expression on her face. "He had no right. He had }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 no right}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 t'saill it..." she said, as though seven baffled people weren't standing around her, waiting for some explanation. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Who had no right to sell it?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry wondered. 
\par He was surprised when Draco Malfoy stepped forward
 and put his hand gently on her shoulder, saying softly, "Who had no right?" as though he had read Harry's mind. The care he was taking with her made Harry's heart leap with hope; maybe he wasn't just shagging Mariah. Maybe, somewhere deep inside, he had 
actual feelings for her. 
\par She looked into Draco's eyes and spat, "}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Munro}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ." 
\par Tony stepped forward now; he had been helping Ruth do sit-ups when Mariah discovered Ginny's amulet, but they were both standing now. "Isn't that your brother? I think I remember you saying that once, in Potions..." 
\par She looked as though Tony were the one with whom she was angry now. Her dark eyes blazed. "Aye, Munro's m'no-good brither. He had }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 no right}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 to saill that," she said, her eyes looking tearful now, as she nodded at the amulet, which Ginny was holding tightly. "Even if he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  the one who--" 
\par She stopped abruptly, and Harry's brain lit up with the answer. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 In my other life, her brother had never retrieved it from the lake. In this life, some time after 1981, he did.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 But Harry ha
d had Gillyweed to help him breathe under the water. No one who went down that deep into the lake would be able to do so without some way of breathing for longer than a normal human could hold his breath. And it seemed that it was in the safekeeping of th
e merpeople. Had her brother somehow made friends with the merpeople and received it as a gift, as Harry had? 
\par He moved near her now and whispered to her, "How did he get it out of the lake?" 
\par She looked frightened then, her eyes opening wide as she stared 
at Harry. "How did you know--?" she started to say breathlessly, backing up from him, her face a mask of fear. Then she abruptly turned and fled down the corridor, and after that they heard her footsteps pattering down the marble stairs to the entrance ha
l
l, and, presumably, on to the dungeons. The sound echoed into the awkward silence. Before she left, Harry had been able to see the tears on her face. Without a word to any of them, even his girlfriend, Draco Malfoy ran after her, and Harry saw how concern
ed he looked. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Good}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , he thought. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 She needs him. He sees that. Very, very good...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Then he looked up at the others; Ginny, Ron and Hermione were clearly uncomfortable, as they knew how Harry knew that the amulet had been in the lake. Tony and Ruth just looked lost. 
\par "Er," he said to them, "let's just finish stretching. He'll talk to her. I'm sure it'll be fine." His voice shook and he glanced at Ginny, who had stopped grasping the amulet. She picked it up and put it under her shirt, so that it was out of sight
 once more. Harry realized then that Mariah must not know that Draco had an identical amulet. She'd probably be quite baffled by that. Did that mean that he went out of his way not to wear it when they were together? Or--was it actually possible that they
 
weren't sleeping together, that they hadn't done anything that usually involved taking off all of one's clothes? He felt mildly disgruntled about that; if he had some way of knowing the true nature of Draco and Mariah's relationship, that would help treme
ndously. 
\par After he showered (Malfoy wasn't in the tub in the prefects' bath, he noted), Harry went to the staff wing to see his aunt. He managed to find the right corridor and he rapped cautiously on the door to her suite. Mrs. Figg admitted him. 
\par "Oh, good morning Harry. We're almost done here." 
\par He stepped into their sitting room and saw that his aunt was sitting very still on a stool near the fire, wearing the Sorting Hat. He swallowed. Dumbledore was standing nearby, smiling at Harry, his blue eyes twinkling behind his half-moon spectacles. 

\par "Good morning, Harry," he said, nodding, then turned to look at Petunia Dursley. Harry thought he heard some murmured conversation from under the hat, before it opened what passed for its "mouth" and said very clearly, "}{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Slytherin!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 " 
\par His aunt took the hat off, patting her hair back into place, looking rather pleased with herself. Harry grimaced. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I should have known.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Mrs. Figg was smiling at her. "Well done, Petunia, well done," she said, as though his aunt }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 had}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  actually accomplished something. 
\par Harry smiled feebly at her, while Dumbledore said, "I shall inform Professor Snape that he has a new member of Slytherin House. Slytherin has a long and noble tradition of turning out quite skilled witches and wizards," h
e said solemnly, looking at Harry out of the corner of his eye. 
\par "Well, it wanted to put me into some other house, but I would have none of it," his aunt said, and Harry dropped his jaw. 
\par "You had a choice, and you chose Slytherin?" But then he remembered that when }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 he'd}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  had a choice in his other life, he'd done the same thing. Mrs. Figg bristled. 
\par "Well, I asked Arabella which house }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 she'd}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  been in, and she said she and her brother had been in Slytherin. Then I asked her which house Draco was in, and she said
 he was also in Slytherin. It seemed an obvious choice." 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Yeah,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  thought Harry. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 That's what I thought in my other life...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par The odd thing was that he had thought he had a choice of house because of having some of Voldemort's powers. Now he remembered that Jamie had also said she'd had a choice. Perhaps it was something in his family--specifically his }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 mother's}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  family--that had prompted the hat to do this. Then Harry had a sudden realization. 
\par "Professor!" he said to Dumbledore. "Has this ever happened before?" 
\par The headmaster frowned at him. "Has what ever happened before, Harry?" 
\par "A Muggle-born witch or wizard being sorted into Slytherin." 
\par He nodded in understanding. "Ah, I see what you mean. It is rare, true, but it has happened on occasion over the one-tho
usand-year history of the school." He looked up at the ceiling thoughtfully. "Now let me see...the last time I recall it occurring was somewhere in the nineteen-fifties...or was it the twenties...?" 
\par Harry swallowed. Clearly it was a rare thing. He looked 
at his aunt, wondering if she understood the anti-Muggle-born prejudice she was likely to encounter from other Slytherins on the one hand, and the anti-Slytherin prejudice from other witches and wizards on the other hand. Then again, she was one of the mo
st bigoted people he knew. If anyone could hold her own against petty, close-minded people, she could. For a moment, he actually found it touching that she'd opted to be in Slytherin because of Mrs. Figg and Draco Malfoy. 
\par When classes ended that day, Harry
 was exhausted and half-wished he hadn't accepted Maggie's invitation to tea. The four of them went to the staff wing together; Harry gave the password, then lifted the tapestry, revealing the opening in the wall that was not visible before he'd said the 
w
ord. Once they were in the entrance corridor and had let the tapestry drop again, Harry looked at the closed doors in confusion; he realized that he didn't know where Maggie's room was. There were no plaques on any of the doors, indicating which professor
 
lived where, and Harry wasn't certain whether he had come upon Snape and Maggie when they were outside his rooms or hers. (He also didn't want to talk about this with Ron around.) He started to walk down the corridor uncertainly, looking from side to side
. Then they turned a corner and saw golden light spilling into the corridor from an open door, where Maggie was standing, waiting for them. 
\par "There you are! Come on, then. Severus has everything ready. He's shown me some wonderful spells...." 
\par Ron raised hi
s eyebrows at the mention of Snape's first name, and Harry hoped he would keep a civil tongue in his head and not get hot under the collar at the idea of Snape and his sister being together. They entered Maggie's sitting room and Harry realized immediatel
y
 that she was staying in the exact same suite of rooms where his parents had lived in his other life, and where he and Jamie had lived when they were small, before moving to Hogsmeade. While the others chose seats on the couch or one of the chairs near th
e
 fire, Harry wandered to the window, which looked out over the grassy courtyard where he and Jamie had played. He was surprised to find that it wasn't empty; Dunkirk was gamboling happily across the grass, chasing a stick arching through the air, attackin
g
 it almost the second it landed on the ground. He trotted back in the direction from which he'd come, and when Harry moved his head to the left, he could see that the dog was bringing the stick to the person who'd thrown it: Draco Malfoy. When Dunkirk sat
,
 tail wagging madly, and Draco removed the stick from his jaws, the blond boy was grinning broadly. Harry thought he had probably never seen him looking happier, in this life. He patted the Yorkshire terrier on the head playfully and Dunkirk lost his comp
o
sure and leapt on Draco, licking his face happily, as Draco grinned and let him, laughing and closing his eyes. Harry's throat hurt as he remembered his best friend romping with some of the dogs that populated the grounds of Malfoy Manor....He saw in his 
mind's eye a nine-year-old boy, skinny and pale, his fair hair waving as he ran with the pack, laughing so hard he had a stitch in his side, then rolling on the ground with the animals, while they licked his face and nuzzled him.... 
\par He turned to the others, who had no idea what he was looking at. He walked back to the fire and said, "Er, Draco is outside. In the courtyard. My aunt must have let him into the staff wing so he could walk Dunkirk. Maybe he'd like to have some tea too?" 

\par Ginny looked up at him i
n surprise, and so did Maggie. She started to open her mouth to say something, then caught Severus Snape's eye and closed her mouth again. However, as Harry found out soon after, she didn't really decide not to ask a question--she just didn't want her boy
friend to hear it. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Harry,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he heard Maggie's voice in his brain now. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Are you sure you want to invite him?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par He thought of how unguarded Draco Malfoy's face had been, not knowing anyone could see his simple pleasure in the little dog. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I'm sure,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought back at her. She nodded. 

\par "Why don't you go ask him if he'd like to do that?" she said aloud. "The way you get to the courtyard is--" 
\par But Harry was already striding back to the outer wall, touching a carved pineapple on the window frame, causing it to open into the room like a door. 
\par "--or," Maggie said, looking unusually flustered, "you could turn the wall into a door I didn't even know existed. Thanks ever so much," she added sarcastically. Harry grimaced. She was the only one present who still didn't know 
about his other life, although Draco Malfoy might soon be joining her in her ignorance. He stepped out into the courtyard and Draco jerked his head up in surprise. 
\par "Potter! What the hell--? That's a door? What's going on here?" 
\par "Erm, yeah. I just came fr
om Maggie's sitting room. She's invited some of us to tea, and we were just wondering whether you'd like to join us." He nodded at the dog. "Without Dunkirk, I think. Although you could bring him a crumpet or something. He always likes it when Aunt Petuni
a gives him one." 
\par Draco Malfoy no longer looked like the carelessly happy young man who had been playing with a dog, having it fetch a stick. A mask went up before his grey eyes once more and he looked at Harry suspiciously. Harry's stomach felt both empty
 and queasy as an overwhelming sense of loss threatened to paralyze his faculties; he suddenly missed his best friend from his other life so badly that it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 hurt.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 He remembered feeling the same way about Ron when Ron had been a Gryffindor prefect on the fast track to Head Boy and Harry had been the captain and Keeper of the Slytherin Quidditch team. 
\par "I told your aunt that I was going to give Dunkirk some exercise," he said slowly. He looked up at what sky was visible above the confines of the courtyard. "It gets dark a lot earlier these days..." 
\par "You can still give him some exercise. We're not going to be having tea forever." And then he thought of something that might make him respond positively. "Ginny's here," he said simply. To his surprise, Draco Malfoy frowned. 
\par "Oh, I see. You've only come out here to fetch me because Ginny asked you to. Should've known that it wouldn't be }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  actually inviting me to tea." 
\par Harry swallowed. Actually, now that he thought about it, Ginny would probably not be very pleased at all to see her boyfriend. He should have thought of that. But somehow, the way Draco had l
ooked while playing with the dog...both happy and also very alone... 
\par "Yeah, well, do you want to come in or not?" Harry asked, trying to sound more irritated that he was, and unwilling to tell the other boy that he really was the one inviting him into the cozy sitting room. If Draco Malfoy suspected that }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 he}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , Harry, had been feeling kindly toward him, not his girlfriend, he would never hear the end of it. And it also wouldn't look good for Ginny. 
\par "Yeah, I think I might. I could do with a cuppa." 
\par He starte
d to follow Harry toward the door to Maggie's sitting room, but Dunkirk trotted toward him with the stick in his jaws, whining piteously. Draco turned and sighed. He looked down at the anxious dog, appearing resigned. "I'm going to have to trick you, aren
't I? All right then..." 
\par He bent over and gently took the stick from Dunkirk, who willingly released it. Draco reared back and threw it across the courtyard, then made a mad dash for the door Harry was holding open. Harry closed it when they were both insi
de, and, seconds later, he heard the dog's frantic scrabbling, followed by more whining. 
\par This prompted Maggie to come to the door. "Aaaaw," she said sympathetically when she saw Dunkirk looking up at Draco through the window, eyes large and dark and pleading. 
\par "How do you open this again?" she asked Harry, pressing on the window frame. He showed her where the pineapple was--grateful that no one was asking him how he knew this--and she opened the door and let the dog in. 
\par He immediately ran to Draco Malfoy,
 who picked him up, letting the dog lick his face for a moment before saying, "All right, all right, that's enough." He was looking at the other people in the room, clearly slightly embarrassed. Harry couldn't help notice that Ginny was looking at Draco r
a
ther sadly, and even Hermione seemed to be regarding him sympathetically for once. Ron clearly didn't care for the girls' reactions to the Draco-Dunkirk bonding; he was scowling. Snape looked as though he was trying to hide his amusement, and Harry marvel
ed at the way he was reminding him more and more of his stepfather in his other life. Perhaps it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  possible for this Severus Snape to be happy. 
\par When Draco sat down, Dunkirk settled himself obediently at his feet while they went through the ritual of pouring the tea and passing the plates of biscuits and crumpets round the group. 
\par "What do you like better so far?" Ginny asked her older sister as she poured milk into her tea. "Teaching or going to classes as a student?" 
\par Maggie looked thoughtful. "Hmm. Well
, I adore Transfiguration with Professor McGonagall. And Professor Flitwick is very pleasant and always so cheerful, plus I feel like I'm really learning so many useful things with him. Potions, on the other hand," she gave an exaggerated shrug and sigh, 
"
I could take or leave..." A smile was pulling at the corner of her mouth and Snape raised one eyebrow, although Harry could tell he wasn't upset at her playfulness. Then she tapped a Tarot deck on the table with her finger. "And when it comes to teaching-
-well, let's just say I'm glad I'm doing the third and fourth years and not the older students." 
\par Ginny looked saddened. "Really? Why not? What about us is so dreadful?" 
\par Maggie looked alarmed. "Oh, Ginny! I'm sorry. That didn't come out very well. It's jus
t that--well, I'm finding with the fourth-year students that there are a number of things that Professor Trelawney taught that--" She pressed her lips together. "Well, I don't want to criticize, but let's just say I would have--and I am doing--some things
 
differently. Tarot, for instance. Nothing is discussed in third and fourth year concerning Tarot, usually, and then, near the beginning of fifth year, Sybill has the students doing readings. You can't just start off doing readings after looking at a book 
f
or an afternoon. You have to consider each and every card in the deck and meditate on it, really attempt to understand it on its own before you try to do a reading for anyone. You have to think of all of the good and bad things about it, so that you can i
m
agine what it may mean for someone who's having a reading done where it turns up in a positive position, and in a negative position. And also, by understanding your own reaction to a card, you can attempt to filter out your own relationship with the card 
when you are doing a reading for someone else, to avoid muddling up the reading with your own issues..." 
\par She looked around at them all and blushed. "Oh, listen to me. As if anyone cares about this. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--" 
\par "No, no," Harry said sudde
nly, remembering that Trelawney had done a reading for him near the beginning of his fifth year, on the day he'd worn Sandy to class and predicted that Parvati would set herself afire. "So, you're having the third and fourth years meditate on the cards?" 

\par "And write essays about what the cards make them think about. That should keep them occupied for about half the year, as I've been assigning one essay a week, and then we discuss the essays in class, and the symbology of various things on the cards. They'
r
e coming out with some amazing insights. I've really been enjoying that. Some of them are rather impatient, of course, thinking from what they'd heard from older students that they would be reading tea leaves and seeing things in crystal balls the first w
e
ek. I think some of them think I'm a bit slow. And the third-year Gryffindors are such pranksters! They think it's so funny to see how gullible I am, telling me ridiculous tales about what you can and cannot do with magic...Amy and Andy Donegal are the wo
rst of the lot. But then, that's often true with twins." 
\par Ron and Ginny burst out laughing, and then Maggie did too. "Oh, my! I forgot that I have brothers who are twins. And you've told me what scamps they were in school," she said to Ginny. "I'll bet they would put Amy and Andy to shame." 
\par Ron nodded with feeling. "You haven't had any of their sweets yet, have you?" 
\par Maggie frowned. "I started to, the first time I went--I mean went back--to the Burrow, but Molly snatched it out of my hand. It looked like a
n ordinary toffee...." Harry was confused for a moment, but then he realized that it would make sense for Maggie to call Molly Weasley by her first name, when she already had someone in her life she had called "Mum" for almost twenty years. 
\par Hermione's eyes went wide. "Oh, good Lord. It's a good thing you didn't. Harry's cousin had one of those Ton-Tongue Toffees once. They're a nightmare!" 
\par Ron shrugged. "Plenty of people think they're a hoot. Sales have been brilliant, Lee says." 
\par The conversation went on
, but somehow Harry had a hard time really hearing it. He drank his tea, but over the rim of his cup, he saw Ginny gazing at him, looking so heartbroken and forlorn that he wanted to do anything in the world to cheer her up. The words the others were spea
king swirled around him, but they didn't penetrate his brain. At least, until Maggie spoke to him }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 through}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  his brain. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Are you all right, Harry?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par He almost dropped his teacup and saucer, fumbling with them for a moment, so that he spilled some tea down his front. Draco Malfoy guffawed and shook his head, but Harry ignored him. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Well, truthfully--no, I'm not.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 It's Ginny, isn't it?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par He looked furtively at Maggie, who was quietly buttering a scone, not looking at anyone. Then she looked up for a moment and caught Harry's eye, before turning her eyes on her little sister, who was gazing into the depths of her cup and stirring her tea i
ncessantly without actually drinking it. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Yes.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Maggie didn't respond right away. Then, while she was chewing a bite of food, she thought at Harry, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I could tell, the way you look at her whenever the two of you are in the same room. And I sensed your feeling
s toward her, as well. I'm sorry, Harry. It must be very difficult to have feelings for someone who already has a boyfriend...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 She does, but--but she doesn't love him!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 But--I've felt feelings of love coming from her. I just assumed they were for him.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Harry was silent. Was it true? Did she really love Draco Malfoy? He glanced at the other boy out of the corner of his eye. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
She told me that she doesn't love him. She said she loves me. And I love her. She said she's--afraid for me. Afraid of what he might do if she breaks up with him.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 A split second after he thought this at Maggie, he realized that he shouldn't have admitted all of these things, but then he realized that Maggie, though she was seeing Severus Snape, was not going to be blindly loyal to everyon
e in Slytherin. And he had a feeling that Maggie was more than capable of keeping this information to herself. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I see. Will you excuse me a moment, Harry?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Harry finished his tea and set his cup down, looking furtively at Ginny, whom he saw had a startled expression in her eyes. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Maggie must be talking to her,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 he realized. The two of them seemed to be communicating without spoken words for some time. Harry tried to pay attention to what Hermione and Ron and Draco were saying; as usual, Draco was being disagr
eeable and baiting Hermione about something, and Ron was on the verge of throttling the Slytherin. 
\par "I just think that Ireland have a much better chance in the European Cup than either Wales or England. I'd like to see England do well as much as the next man, but let's say that my hopes for England were recently }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
dashed,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 " he said pointedly, glaring at Ron as he chewed a biscuit with an insufferably smug expression. Ron was gripping the edge of his chair so that his knuckles were turning white, and Hermione w
as slowly turning red. 
\par "They haven't seen a player as good as Ron in donkey's years! You're just jealous that--" 
\par Harry tuned them out again. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Same old same old.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Malfoy knew how to set off both Ron and Hermione and they leapt at the bait. He sighed inwardl
y. Suddenly, Maggie's voice was in his head again. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Harry.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Er, what?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 As you may have guessed, I've been speaking to Ginny. She confirms what you said.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par His heart leapt within him. That meant that--that she must have told her sister that she loved him. Sh
e still loved him! He looked at Ginny with his heart overflowing, trying not to reveal too much in his expression. Fortunately, Draco, Ron and Hermione were still consumed with their argument. 
\par "I can't believe old Monty Mathers is still running things. I mean, shouldn't he have been put out to pasture by now? I think his hiring you, Weasley, just confirms that he's growing senile..." 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Harry,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Maggie said again, trying to get his attention back; Ron had raised his voice and it was hard for Harry to concentrate on anything else. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Right. I'm here.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
I've been doing some reading about this, and--I'd like to try something. I'm going to attempt to be a medium for you and Ginny, so you can talk. Not the usual kind of medium, to be sure, but--I'm going to allow what 
Ginny says to me to pass directly to you, and what you say to me to pass to her. I'm going to try to stay out of it utterly. I don't want to eavesdrop or anything. She said the two of you can't really talk freely, so perhaps this will help a bit? You can 
just think of my brain as a passage allowing you to reach each other temporarily....}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Harry felt like saying thanks a thousand times would never be sufficient for what Maggie was doing for them. She turned to Severus Snape, sitting quietly next to her, list
ening to Ron and Hermione and Draco argue with a bemused expression on his face. She said to him, "I don't wish to be rude, but I'm feeling a little migraine coming on and I'm just going to close my eyes for a few minutes and do a visualization exercise I
 know that often helps me a great deal. I've been doing this for years. I don't want anyone to think I've been so rude as to fall asleep or anything. Carry on; I'll be fine." 
\par And with that, she leaned back and closed her eyes, looking very peaceful. Harry poured himself some more tea, trying to look very casual about it and not look at Ginny. Then Ron picked that moment to begin talking to him. 
\par "Harry--has Ludo Bagman been hanging about when you have practice? He's been down in Kent with us a slew of times. Talks to Monty a lot. Think I should worry?" 
\par Harry shrugged. "Only if he asks you to throw the game and you see a gaggle of goblins following him about...He's been at our practices a few times too. I just thought it was because of his Ministry job, with
 the Department of Magical Games and Sports. You know." 
\par Draco Malfoy frowned. "Fix the game? Surely not. I mean--that would be unethical. Think of his position." 
\par Hermione looked at him shrewdly. "Considering who your father is, you say some rather naive things at times, Malfoy." 
\par Now the Slytherin looked like he'd just woken up. "You mean--" 
\par "You didn't know!" Ron crowed. "Why, all through the Triwizard Tournament--" 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Harry.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par He started; the voice in his brain was like Maggie's and yet not like Maggie's. He glanced briefly at Ginny, who was studying the inside of the bottom of her teacup. He looked away from her again. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Ginny? Is that you? Is this actually working?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par There seemed to be a little bit of a delay as his words were filtered through Maggie and back to Ginny. Finally, a voice in his head said, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 It's me. Oh, Harry! I've missed you so much...}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I've missed you too. But I thought--I thought you were hacked off at me. Because--because I said Malfoy needed you after what he did to Fleur. I thought perhaps you never wanted to talk to me again.}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I wanted to talk to you every moment of every day. But I was afraid. What happened the last time we were alone together--}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Right,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 he thought at her, drawing his lips into a line and taking a biscuit. He glanced at Maggie, leaning against the back of the couch with her eyes closed, two small vertical lines appearing and disappearing between her brows as she concentrated on help
ing Harry and Ginny communicate wordlessly. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 So you let me think you were still cross so that we--we wouldn't lose control and--}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Right,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  she said, echoing him. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 But technically, I am still cross about what you said.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par He grimaced, then tried to smooth his fea
tures out again, so no one looking at him would think he was mad. Ron and Hermione were still regaling Draco Malfoy with the tale of the almost-blackmail scheme that the twins had tried with Ludo Bagman, and Bagman trying to help Harry win the tournament 
because of his other debts to the goblins. The three of them actually seemed to be getting along now, however briefly. He was vaguely aware of Snape participating in the conversation as well, giving his opinion of Bagman (they knew each other in school). 

\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I
'm sorry about that Ginny. Sometimes--sometimes I think I'm just a selfish person at heart. I want you, and I want to have my former best friend back, behaving the way he did when he was my best friend. And I want to have my sister in this life, so she ca
n
 be with him, and I want Ron to be my best friend too, and I want him and Hermione to be happy....And I want for Voldemort never to have gotten his body back, I want Cedric to walk in the room and start talking about the job his dad got him at the Ministr

\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Harry, Harry, I know. Oh, I know. So many dreadful things have happened.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par He looked at her now; she was idly shuffling through the Tarot cards, looking at the pictures, moving on to the next one and the next one...He glanced out of the corner of his eye at the others, engrossed in speculations about corruption. 
\par "Fudge? Oh, yeah. He was always kissing up to my dad. He could be rather funny, actually..." Draco Malfoy was saying. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Ginny,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought at her. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Look at me.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

ifted her eyes to his and he swallowed, glad that he didn't have to try to get his throat to work, as he didn't think it would be likely to cooperate. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I love you. What I said in the common room--forget about that. I was--I was trying not to be selfish, fo

\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Oh, Harry. That's all I wanted to hear you say...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Well, technically I still haven't said it...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par He heard a laugh in his head. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I do love you, Harry...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

\par She opened her eyes and sat up. Severus Snape put his hand lightly on her upper back, looking concerned. "Feeling better?" 
\par She smiled at him and Harry. "Much. Never fails." 
\par Harry jumped into a lull in the conversation. "Anyway, I remember Rita Skeeter saying to me that she knew things about Ludo Bagman that would curl my hair...." 
\par They all stared at him. 
\par Ron cleared his throat. "Erm, Harry we're talking about Charms class now. Where've you been?" 
\par "And it was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 my}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  hair Rita said would curl. She turned it into a crack about my appearance, naturally..." Hermione said, sounding 
miffed, as though it had just occurred. Ron grinned and mussed her curls with his large hand. 
\par "I love your hair..." 
\par Hermione swatted his hand away, but a small smile was pulling at the corners of her mouth. Harry felt himself redden. "Oh. I, er, was listening to something Sandy was saying to me. Sorry. Distracted." 
\par This meant, of course that Sandy actually did speak up. "Why are you lying, Harry Potter?" she asked him now. 
\par He smiled feebly at them all. "Heh. Hear that? There she goes again. She's quite the chatty snake." 
\par "But I didn't hear anything before," Hermione said, frowning. 
\par "She may not think much of Seers," Sandy said to him now, "but that girl isn't stupid." Harry thought it probably would not be a good idea to take her out and throttle her. 
\par "You all were talking so noisily you wouldn't have heard a little hissing..." he said hurriedly. 
\par "So," Hermione said, raising her eyebrows. "Did she have anything }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 interesting}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to say?" Harry knew what she meant. She was wondering whether Sandy was giving a prediction. 

\par "Er, no. She was just asking a question about something. The human world still confuses her a bit, so she asks me questions about things." 
\par "I am frequently confused, for instance, by your need to lie," Sandy said archly. Harry forced himself not to scowl. 
\par Hermione was looking at him shrewdly. "But I didn't hear you answering her. You were just staring at your tea." 
\par Harry didn't care for the way they were all staring at }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . (Except for Ginny and Maggie.) "Well--I--" 
\par "I'm afraid you haven't done a very good job, Potter, of covering up," Snape said now in his usual smooth way. Harry looked at him in panic. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Covering up. He said covering up. Oh, bugger, he's going
 to spoil everything...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 "You're making a habit of this. Last week when you were staring into space during my class, you nearly added an extra star anise to your Credulo Potion, which would have turned it into such deadly poison that a single drop on your }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 skin}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  could have killed you. If Miss Granger hadn't noticed what you were about to do, you might not be among the living now." 
\par Harry smiled feebly at him, grateful. Had Maggie said something to him, without words? }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Fine}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , he thought. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I'll be a lazy dunderhead}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . He glanced at Draco Malfoy, who was rolling his eyes. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Why can't you be like the Draco who was my friend for fourteen years?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought. }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Why do you have to be such a git?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par "You caught me. I'm just knackered..." 
\par Ron laughed and slapped him rather too hard
 on the back. "Wondered why you were being so quiet." He nodded at Ginny. "And you've been uncharacteristically quiet, too. What's your story?" Harry couldn't tell whether he was suspicious. Luckily, as far as Harry knew, even his werewolf hearing shouldn
't be able to pick up on telepathic conversations. 
\par Ginny was still shuffling through the Tarot cards. "Oh, I was just looking at Maggie's deck. Her cards have different pictures than mine. See?" she said feebly, holding up one of the cards, swallowing, hoping she would be believed. 
\par Harry noticed that the one she just happened to be holding up was the winged lion card that Trelawney had said represented }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 when she was doing the reading for him. He didn't remember much of the reading--not having put much credence in what she was saying at the time--but he remembered }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that card}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . 

\par He looked at Maggie. "Which card is that?" he asked her disingenuously. "I can't see the number from here." 
\par She picked the card gently out of Ginny's hand. "That's number five: the 
Hierophant. Also called the Priest. Usually one of the Priest cards shows someone looking like a king or emperor, enthroned. But this is a deck Sybill told me she bought in Venice. Probably some Venetian witch or wizard made the deck with the priest looki
n
g like this because the winged lion is the symbol of St. Mark, the patron saint of Venice. See the book under his paw? That's on the Venetian flag. The flag is quite lovely, really, all scarlet and gold. Very much like the Gryffindor banners I've seen in 
the castle, except that on the Venetian flag the lion has the wings and the book." 
\par Harry frowned. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Venice?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Was there some connection to Godric Gryffindor--who'd also been a golden griffin Animagus--and Venice? He knew someone who had relatives from Venice, 
he knew he did, but who was it? As he wracked his brain, trying to remember, the conversation whirled around him again....

y yielded to temptation and looked behind him, seeing Mariah Kirkner's gaze fixed firmly on him. He swallowed, wondering whether she had perhaps been reciting an incantation to jinx him so that he became ill from his dinner. He had some food in his throat
 at that moment, too, and was now finding it very hard to swallow. He tried to fight a tide of panic rising in him as she got to her feet and approached the Gryffindor table. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
What if she asks me how I knew the amulet had been in the lake?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par "Can I talk to ye fer a minute, Harry?" she said with her lilting accent. He nodded, and she motioned with her head to the entrance hall. "In private." 
\par Dean and Seamus decided at that moment to act like a pair of ten-year-olds; next to him, Dean started putting his elbow in Harry's ribs and saying, "Go get 'er, Harry." 
\par "Harry the girl-magnet strikes again," Seamus said, trying to sound like an American comedian he liked. Harry didn't especially like the comedian he was imitating, and he frowned as he rose and followed her
, while Dean and Seamus got some of the younger students involved in cat-calls and whistles. Harry glanced momentarily at Ginny, who was clearly not happy about this. 
\par Once they were in the entrance hall, Harry turned irritably to Mariah. "What is it?" he snapped. Then he relented, remembering how distraught she'd been when she'd discovered Ginny wearing the amulet. 
\par "Not here," she said, glancing at the Great Hall. "A little farther away..." She climbed the marble stairs and Harry followed her up to the co
rridor outside Myrtle's bath, where they'd been stretching when Mariah had noticed Ginny's amulet. She twisted her robes nervously once they stopped. "It's nothing, really," she said, her voice quaking as though she'd meant to say the opposite. "I just--I
 
have a taist to prepare fer in Potions. It's on Tuesday. Trouble is--I have fourth watch Monday night, which is really Tuesday mornin' at four-thairty. I was won'drin' whaither ye could switch shifts with me. Ye have fourth watch t'night. Ye could sleep i
n a bit t'morrow and I'll take yer shift at four-thairty. Ye'd take mine on the mornin' o'my taist so I can be waill-raisted fer it." 
\par Harry scrutinized her. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 That's why she had to drag him up the stairs? To ask him to switch a shift with him?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  "That's it? We
 switch fourth shifts? You do tonight and I do Monday for you?" She nodded. He nodded back. "All right. It's a deal. I have practice tomorrow anyway, for Sunday's match; getting up at four o'clock for a four-thirty shift is probably the last thing I need.
" 
\par She smiled at him and he noticed that she had a dimple in each cheek when she did this. "See? It wairks oot fer us both." He felt strange and light-headed, looking at her, and didn't notice that she was standing very close to him until she suddenly put o
ne of her hands--in a fingerless glove--on his arm. He was aware of how dark her shining eyes were, how artfully messy her dark wiry hair was, how nicely her robes hung on her frame, far more developed and mature than when she'd asked him to the ceilidh w
hen she was only in fourth year.... 
\par He shook his head suddenly, as if to clear it, and she backed up from him, laughing. "Thanks, Harry. Enjoy yer lie-in." 
\par He watched her go down the stairs, wondering why he'd felt so strange and floaty. It was almost like when he'd been under the Imperius Curse, but not quite. And why should she try to curse him to get him to switch shifts with him? He was very confused. He
 didn't }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 think}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  she had cursed him, but then why did his head feel so strange? 
\par He turned, surprised to see Ginny standing at the foot of the stairs looking up at him; her face appeared to be on the verge of collapsing into tears at any moment. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 She thinks I'm
 going to start carrying on with Mariah now,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought. He had no words; he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 had}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 been looking at Mariah and thinking about how pretty she was, beautiful even, not having any idea why these thoughts had entered his brain when he was completely and utterly i
n love with Ginny. She wouldn't look at him but hurried up the marble steps, her robes gathered in both fists. As she turned into the corridor where he was, she streaked past him as though he wasn't there, and he thought he saw the torches reflecting off 
a wet patch of skin on her cheek...

Harry was feeling at loose ends. It was Friday night, and he had previously planned to go to bed early, since he was going to get up at four o'clock. Now that he didn't have to, he felt odd and random, sitting 
by the fire in the common room, wishing he knew what Mariah's story was. Hermione was busy doing revision, as usual, but she looked up suddenly and frowned at Harry. 
\par "What are you still doing down here, Harry? Oughtn't you to get some sleep? You have the four-thirty shift." 
\par "No I don't. Mariah switched with me. I'm doing hers on Monday night. Er, Tuesday morning. You know what I mean." 
\par "Oh. I wish people would do this properly..." she said, sounding irked as she pulled a parchment out of her rucksack and
 scanned down it, making the correction with her favorite quill. "That means that Mariah and Draco Malfoy are the fourth watch tonight..." 
\par Harry frowned. "Draco Malfoy? That isn't his usual shift, is it? He's usually on fourth watch with me on Wednesday night. Or Thursday morning. Whatever." 
\par "He switched. And }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 again}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  I had to find out second hand." 
\par "I was going to tell you," he said quickly. "I just did, didn't I? That's what Mariah was asking me about," he added a little more loudly, for Ginny's benefit. 
She seemed to be ignoring him, though, and also hadn't shown any signs of hearing Hermione say that Draco and Mariah were going to be on the same shift. 
\par Hermione sighed as she put her parchment away. "People around here have no sense of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 order}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ..." 
\par Ron grinned at her, and Harry felt a leap in his stomach. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 They were so lucky.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Ron was clearly finding her need for }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 order}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  endearing (even though he'd once been irked by it). He and Ginny were playing chess nearby, and Harry was trying not to stare at Ginny, who st
ill seemed to be more miffed than distraught with him after finding him talking to Mariah, even though he'd just said why she had wanted to talk to him. Dean and Seamus' antics at the Gryffindor table had also probably not helped, he thought. He wished th
at Maggie was there so they could talk without the others hearing them. 
\par Then he thought about Draco Malfoy and Mariah Kirkner both being on the pre-dawn shift together, and the fact that they'd switched shifts to do it. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 They were planning something,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 he thought, sighing. Surely they weren't just going to be wandering up and down corridors. If only he could arrange for Ginny to actually catch them together! Not just spotting them on the map, but }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
actually seeing them together,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  witnessed by Draco and Mariah, so that they }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 knew}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 she knew. Harry thought of how proud she was; if she were caught out that way, she'd }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 have}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 to break up with Malfoy on the spot. He hated the idea of humiliating her, but it would be far more humiliating for her to see the clear evidence of M
alfoy's unfaithfulness and forgive him and stay with him. Besides, he reasoned, Malfoy could hardly blame }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 for a breakup if it came about because Ginny caught her boyfriend and Mariah red-handed (so to speak). }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Yeah, unless he spots that I've made it possible for her to "stumble" on their tryst...}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par He sighed, staring into the fire, vaguely aware of what was happening in Ginny and Ron's chess game. Hermione, in the chair opposite Harry's before the fire, had put the parchment away and was reading once more. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
I need some way of finding out their patterns,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought. Unfortunately, there didn't seem to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 be}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 a pattern. It came rather out of the blue that Mariah wanted to swap shifts with him. He also wasn't certain how many other times the two of them might have
 conspired to be on the same shift together. He tended to let Hermione oversee the patrol schedule, and any changes made to it. 
\par He glanced at Ginny again; she had just taken Ron's knight with her queen. He didn't realize that his heart was on his face unt
il Ron made his move and then happened to look up and meet Harry's eyes. Harry's stomach leapt when he saw Ron's expression of comprehension; he glanced back and forth, back and forth, between Harry and Ginny. 
\par "Ginny," he said suddenly, "I have to talk to Harry about something. We'll continue this when I get back." He stood and grabbed Harry's arm. "C'mon, Harry." 
\par Harry staggered to his feet, stumbling after Ron. He couldn't have stopped him if he'd tried. He didn't dare look at Ginny as Ron pulled him up the spiral stairs to their dorm. 
\par Ron slammed the door and turned to face his best friend. He didn't speak at first, but then finally he began pacing and running his fingers through his orange hair, making it stand on end. 
\par "When were you going to tell me, Harry?" 
\par Harry didn't have to wonder what he was talking about. He sat on the edge of his bed and looked at his hands. "I don't know. Should I have told you when you were holding me upside down that morning at Hog's End?" 
\par "Wh--what?" Ron sputtered. "So you two really were--" 
\par "No, Ron! I told you later that that's when I first told Ginny about my other life, and that's true. But there's something else we talked about as well--keeping our distance from each other the entire time, I might add." 
\par Ron surveyed him shrewdly. "Why do I think that wasn't for my benefit?" 
\par Harry grinned. "You're right. It wasn't. I'll explain about that in a minute." 
\par "So what else did you two talk about?" 
\par Harry swallowed, remembering how happy he'd been to hear her say the words. "She told me that she doesn't love Draco Malfoy. She loves me." 
\par Ron's jaw dropped. Then he leapt up, a grin splitting his face, and he gave Harry a sudden crushing hug. "No more Malfoy! That's fantastic! I was afraid we'd be putting up with that sod fo
r years to come! You know, Harry, that all joking aside, I'd rather you were with Ginny any day. You know that, don't you?" 
\par Harry felt incredibly grateful to have Ron as a friend. He slapped Ron on the back and smiled grimly. "I know, Ron. And at other times, I know you're being protective of Ginny because you love her and don't want her to be hurt. It's natural. I had the sam
e impulses toward my sister." 
\par Ron laughed. "Except that your sister only had three brothers. Ginny has six. Plus, there's Maggie; she and Ginny have really bonded now, too." 
\par "So I have to stand up to the scrutiny of all seven of you, plus your parents, in other words." 
\par "No pressure, though." Then Ron's smile faded and he looked at Harry with a hostile frown. "Wait a minute. That was almost two months ago. Why's she still with Malfoy? And she was so worried about you when you were showing me and Hermione y
our Pensieve, and she came running in here...I just thought--she called you a friend--" 
\par Then suddenly, he picked Harry up by the front of his robes and pushed him against the wall. "Did my sister spill her heart out to you and then get it stomped on? And now you're having second thoughts?" 
\par Harry glared at him. "Put me down, Ron," he said evenly, trying not to be reminded of giving Fang orders. Reluctantly, his friend complied, still looking at him suspiciously. "Do you think that Ginny would have called m
e her friend the next morning when we were in Hogsmeade if she had told me she loved me and I said nothing? Of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 course}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 I told her I love her. And that wasn't the first time. She knew how I felt about her. She's known for almost a year." 
\par "A year! But--you didn't break up with Hermione until my birthday!" 
\par Harry looked at him, arms crossed. "And you and Hermione were snuggling in the common room late at night." 
\par "We were not snogging--" 
\par "I said }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 snuggling.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 Yes, yes, I told Ginny I loved her when I was still with Hermione. I should have broken up with her. But I didn't do it because you told me I should, remember? I was being contrary and you were being a prat. I thought we'd already covered this." 
\par "Yeah, yeah, all right." 
\par Harry sighed. "See, we started flying together. I would go up to the Astronomy Tower after classes and Ginny would ride on me in my griffin form. We used to come down in a clearing in the forest and talk or lie back and look at the clouds
...and one day she was attacked by that Lethifold that escaped from Hagrid. I conjured a Patronus and we escaped back to the castle. After we landed, I was so glad she was safe, and--and I kissed her. And she kissed me back." Harry was glad to see that Ro
n
 was too shocked to hit him. "I--I was so sure she loved me. But she pulled back from me and said she couldn't meet me any more. Then, after I told her about my other life--you see, that was the reason why I walked into her room at three in the morning. I
t used to be }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 my}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 room. Anyway, after I told her all that, she said she didn't want to lie to me anymore. She had decided that she couldn't go flying with me any more because she was afraid Draco Malfoy would find out and retaliate against me in some way. Tha
t's why we couldn't sit too close together, so in case Malfoy was holding his amulet--" 
\par "What? What are you talking about? And why did you give Ginny back the amulet she gave you? Wasn't that a birthday present?" 
\par Harry sighed. "Yes, it was. And I also fo
und it in my other life. I got it from the lake, remember? And then when I was at Godric's Hollow, talking to myself--I also mentioned this to you and Hermione, but you haven't see it yet--I gave it to myself. I mean, the me from the other life gave it to
 
the me who had just arrived there from King's Cross. So when I got on the train with you afterward, I had two of them. One that I already had, and one from--from a time traveler. Me. I tried to give it to her at Christmas, and that's when I first told her
 I love her. She refused to take it. Later, after we rescued Snape, I decided I had to resign myself to her being with Malfoy and I gave the pair of amulets to him, for him and Ginny to wear, as a couple." 
\par "I still don't understand. What does that have to do with the two of you sitting close together?" 
\par Harry sighed. "When Ginny first went to buy the amulet, she said she decided to get it because when she held it, she saw }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . Actually saw me at that moment, on Privet Drive." 

\par "She }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 saw}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  you?" 
\par Harry nodded, h
is lips drawn into a line. "I wish I understood it better. I think she may have seen me because--because she loves me. Now, when I first touched the amulet, I didn't see anyone. But whenever I held it, I felt--better. Contented. Calm. And holding it alway
s reminded me of Ginny, because she'd given it to me. In fact, I think Hermione suspected that it made me think of Ginny, and that's why she didn't want me to be wearing it the first time we--" 
\par Harry took one look at Ron's face and stopped short, swallowin
g. "Um, never mind. Anyway, she's pretty sure that Malfoy can see her when he holds the amulet, so we stayed separated. That night she also told me that she loves me and that she knew Draco Malfoy was cheating on her--" 
\par Ron's eyebrows flew up. "He can see her any time he wants? And that bastard is cheating on my sister?" 
\par "Would you rather he was sleeping with her or someone else?" 
\par Ron faltered. "Er, okay. Good point. But if he's cheating on her, how can he see her with that amulet thing? How can he love her and do that?" 
\par "I don't know..." Harry did his best to explain to his best friend Ginny's reasons for staying with Draco Malfoy. "And it's not like I didn't once have some of the same thoughts. In fifth year, I thought Ginny might be the only thing kee
ping Malfoy on the right side. And he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 did}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  put his dad in prison." 
\par "Self-interest," Ron ruled. "Like everything he does." 
\par "Right. I agree. But--now we know about the Obedience Charm. It complicates things." 
\par Ron made a face. "I'd forgotten about that. Blimey. You're damn lucky you don't have that, too." 
\par "Don't I know it. I felt like I wanted to scream in frustration when I couldn't stun Riddle or anything. I was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 so close}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 to fixing the timelines, and I thought everything I'd gone through to get back to the night my parents died had been for nothing--" 
\par Ron nodded. Harry hadn't shown him and Hermione his encounter with Riddle, but he had described it. Hermione had been horrified when he said he'd tried to perform }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Avada Kedavra}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
--but she had also understood. Ron wasn't horrified at all. He said he would have done the same thing. 
\par He slapped Harry on the back. "Well, you managed to put things right again, and if you hadn't tried and failed to hex Riddle, we wouldn't even know about Malfoy having this Obedience Charm on him." 
\par "No, it was my mum, remember? She told me in the cave, before she tried to kill you. That's }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 why}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 she tried to kill you, because if I received a direct order and refused, I'd die." 
\par "Oh, right..." 
\par "Still. I was starting to think I'd be stuck in that other life forever..." 
\par Ron clapped his hands together purposefully. "What we need to do is to break up my sister and Malfoy without it having anything to do with }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ." 
\par "That's why I was glad that Katie decided to tell Ginny about Felice. I was hoping--" 
\par "Who?" Harry explained the hedge maze incident to him. 
\par "Why, that little--" Ron was fuming. "And then he wrote }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 what}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  in that letter?" Harry told him. 
\par Now his friend was pacing again, running his finger
s through his hair, the grey lock flopping back down onto his brow each time. Harry noticed now that there were a few grey hairs in his beard, as well, making Ron look more like he was in his thirties or forties rather than his teens. 
\par "I can't believe that you didn't tell me Malfoy was shagging every girl in England!" 
\par Harry made a face. "I only knew about the one. Well, and Mariah. Except that I don't know for certain how far that's gone." 
\par More pacing and finger-combing. "We have to find a way to break them up, Harry." 
\par "Don't you think I know that? Why do you think I'm trying to work out a way for Ginny to catch them at it? She's too proud not to break up with him if that happens." 
\par Ron was nodding while he was pacing. "Right. But how to do it? We can't just stay awake twenty-four hours a day, watching the map..." He paced some more, then stopped. "I know! We can do it in shifts. I'll take the days, you can take the nights..." 

\par "Don't be stupid, Ron. Most of the time they can't do anything. We should watc
h it at the obvious times. Like tonight, for instance. Both of them switched their shifts so they'll be on at four-thirty in the morning, when neither one of them is usually patrolling at that time. Only trouble is, I have a hard enough time getting up fo
r one of those fourth shifts. Once I tried setting my clock to check on them during the third shift, and I never heard it go off. Neville told me off the next day because }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 he}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 had to do it. I was sleeping like the dead. What we really need is some sure way to wake up at a particular time..." 
\par Now Ron was pacing the floor saying, "Time, time, time..." He stopped and his face lit up. "I know! Ever since you told us about--what's in the Pensieve--Hermione's been looking up time spells. The one you and Riddle did 
really fascinated her. She got permission from McGonagall to take this book out of the Restricted Section. That }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Tempus Fugit}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 spell is in there too. I'll bet there's some sort of alarm clock spell, if we take the time to look." 
\par Harry was skeptical. "Alarm clock spell? Oh, come on. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Tempus Bonae Voluntatis}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  is a complicated tandem spell, and }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Tempus Fugit}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  is dark magic. I doubt that a simple alarm clock spell would be in the same book." 
\par "Why not? It's a time spell. Can't hurt to ask. I'll ask Hermione about it. I'll just say that my alarm clock broke and I want to make sure I get up on time to go running every day." 
\par "She'll ask you why I can't just wake you up. Which is what I usually do anyway." 
\par "Hmm. All right. We'll say }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 your}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  clock is broken too. Because--b
ecause you accidentally set it for two in the morning and it woke up Neville and he bashed it against the wall because he was hacked off." 
\par "She'll never believe that. Make it Seamus. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 That}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  she'd believe." 
\par Ron shrugged. "All right. But I'll just bet she knows about a time spell in that book that will get us up in plenty of time to catch Draco Malfoy cheating on my sister with Mariah Kirkner." 
\par Harry nodded. "First, we need to verify exactly what they're doing. Then we need to find out a future time when the
y'll be getting together, and make certain Ginny stumbles on them, and that there's absolutely no possibility of their worming their way out of it with some ridiculous story. Mind you, it's Ginny who'd probably make up the story, so she wouldn't have to b
reak up with him and put me at risk. We need to make it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 impossible}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  for her }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 to break up with him." 
\par "Right," Ron agreed. "Fourth shift tonight, you said? That doesn't give us much time to practice the spell, or test it first to see whether we've done it 
right. I'll go talk to Hermione first, to see whether she knows about a spell in that book that could do the trick." 
\par Harry watched him go with trepidation. He thought it was possible that Ron was just a little bit too enthusiastic about trying to break up
 Ginny and Draco Malfoy, which meant that there was a danger that he would fail to be as prudent and circumspect as he needed to be. 
\par Harry thought desperately, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Please please please let this work....}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

 the seventh-year dorm looking gloomy and down at the mouth. "Sorry I took so long, Harry. I actually forgot I was playing chess with Ginny. I took a fall and let her win to cut it short." Harry snorted, knowing what a good player Ginny was, and Ron glare
d at him momentarily before going on. "I looked at Hermione's book." He sighed. "We'll just have to try to stay awake, Harry. The one page that had a clock spell is torn out." 
\par Harry sat with his chin in his hands. "Brilliant. Now what are we going to do?" 
\par Ron sat on his bed and sighed noisily. "I suppose we'll actually have to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 look}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  for what we want ourselves," he said wearily. 
\par "What? In our own books? Instead of just looking in Hermione's head?" 
\par Ron nodded. It would have been nice if Hermione could have handed them the solution, as she had so many other times, such as when she decided that they were going to make Polyjuice potion, but that wasn't going to happen this time, it had become painfully
 obvious. Harry also didn't think it would be prudent to tell Hermione what he and Ron were up to. Harry rose and went to his trunk. He took out }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Seven}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  and handed it to Ron. "Here, you check this." He dug further down into 
his trunk, deciding that the Dark Arts text probably wouldn't have a clock spell, nor the History of Magic text. The Potions text was clearly out. Then, at the very bottom, he found the book that Sirius had given him because he'd found out that Harry had 
a snake for a pet. 
\par "I'll check this one," he said, settling down on his bed with }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Sorcerers, Serpents and Snakes}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 by Colleen Colubra. Opening it, he saw again the inscription that Sirius had written: \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Dear Harry--Happy Fifteenth Birthday! From your godfather,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94
 and the illegible scrawl that seemed to contain something resembling an }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 S}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  and a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 B}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . 
\par He and Ron had been reading for some time when Harry turned a page and saw just what he needed. "Ron! Look at this! C'mere, you. I've found it. We can use Sandy. I can put a spell on her..." 
\par "What?" Sandy hissed at him from under his shirtsleeve, sounding slightly alarmed. 
\par "Oh, don't worry, Sandy. Remember when I put an Engorgement Charm on you during the dueling? It's nothing, you won't be inconvenienced a bit," he said, directing this at his left arm. 
\par "Perhaps }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  should be the judge of that..." she sniffed at him from under the shirt. Ron looked baffled. 
\par "What are you two going on about? Are you going to tell me or not?" 
\par "Right. See here? It's not a clock spell, precisely, but it does have a time element. You cast the spell to last a specific amount of time, and when it wears off--" 
\par "I see. But--what's the spell actually do?" 
\par "Let me see...I'm not really clear about that yet..." 
\par He read some more, then realized what he had. "It turns the snake into a woman for a pre-set time period, up to a day." He grimaced at Ron, who shrugged. 
\par "So?" 
\par "So? You realize what this spell is used for, don't you?" 
\par Ron looked blank for a moment, then, when realization dawned, his eyes were very wide. "I see," was all he could choke out. 
\par Harry slumped again. "You're right, Sandy. You should be the judge of whether you want to help me," he hissed at her. "I don't want to subject you to being a woman if you'd rather not. And I don't know how we'd explain you to the other blokes..." 
\par Ron looked like he was deep in thought. "She could hide under the Invisibility Cloak," he suggested. 
\par "Let me understand this, Harry Potter," Sandy's unseen voice said to him now. "I would be a woman for a time?" 
\par "Yes. So that you could wake me when the spell ends. I think that when you change back into a snake, even if you were asleep in your human form, you'd be sort of jolted. Then, being awake yourself, you could wake me. I'm sorry, Sandy. It's a stupid ide
a..." 
\par "That is all I would have to do? When I turn back into a snake I wake you up?" 
\par "Er--yeah." 
\par There was silence. Ron raised his eyebrows at Harry as if to say }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 So? Will she do it?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Even before Harry could ask, Sandy was hissing at him, "I will do it." 
\par Harry took her out of his sleeve and held her before his face, gazing into her inscrutable eyes. "You're sure?" he asked her. 
\par "Yes, Harry Potter. I am sure." 
\par He swallowed. "All right. Now, this is a Transfiguration spell. Like when I change into a golden griffin. You've withstood that before." 
\par "Yes. I trust you, Harry." 
\par Harry swallowed. She had used just his first name. He didn't know what to say. Her simple statement had utterly undone him. "All right," he told her. "Let me check on everything I need to do to perform the spell." 
\par According to the book, he was supposed to imagine a specific woman's appearance to give to the snake when in its human form. "A specific woman?" Ron asked. 
\par "Seems like it," he answered, trying to imagine who Sandy should look like in her human form. It was certainly nothing he'd ever considered before. 
\par "You realize," Ron said ominously, "that if you make her look like Hermione, I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 will}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  have to kill you. You'r
e forewarned. Oh, and if you make her look like Ginny, and she ever finds out, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 she'll}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  probably kill you. Actually, if you do that, I'll also have to kill you." 
\par "Ron! What do you think I'm going to do with her? She's still going to be Sandy, my snake! And have you forgotten why we're doing this?" 
\par "No. I'm just saying...I mean, she }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 will}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  have to be in your bed, won't she? So that she can wake you when the spell wears off?" 
\par "Yeah. I reckon," he said, feeling uncomfortable. "I'll make certain that I turn her into someone I'd never consider sleeping with, all right? Will that make you happy?" 
\par "All right then. Lavender it is." Harry swatted Ron's arm, laughing. "Or did you mean Millicent Bulstrode?" 
\par "Or Pansy Parkinson?" 
\par "Or Professor McGonagall?" 
\par They were laughing uproariously now, each suggestion more absurd than the last. Finally, Harry calmed down and looked at the book again. 
\par "All right, we need to get serious here. Let me look at the incantation..." After some time, he felt ready to try it. He put San
dy onto the bed and backed up. He checked his watch; it was a little after eleven o'clock, so they wanted the spell to last for five hours. Harry took out his wand and tried to concentrate. He raised his wand and opened his mouth... 
\par "So, who's it to be then?" 
\par Harry clamped his mouth shut again. He'd lost his concentration. He turned to glare at Ron. 
\par "If you must know, my mum." He couldn't explain. He just couldn't explain it to Ron. The most prominent images he had in his mind of his mother were of her w
hen he was young, like the day at the seaside, or lying dead on the cave floor, or in the front garden at Godric's Hollow. He could see her alive at other times, in his Pensieve, but most of those memories weren't especially good. Reprimanding him in Poti
o
ns class, or upbraiding him for fighting with Simon and Stuart. He just felt like he needed to see his mum looking at him without that cloud of disappointment behind her eyes, the eyes that, for years and years, saw only a future Death Eater when she look
ed at him, and even after she knew he didn't want to be that person, he was the one responsible for Stuarts's death, and then he saw that thinly-veiled accusation behind her eyes instead... 
\par Ron made a face. "I wouldn't much fancy seeing my mum without clothes..." 
\par Harry's eyes opened wide. He stared at the small green snake, realizing why Ron had said this. He ran for his wardrobe, muttering, "}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Damn, damn damn}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
..." while he searched for some clothes she could wear. He put a shirt, sweater and jeans on the bed, turned the blanket so that it was covering Sandy except for her head, and moved back into position. 
\par "Now, Sandy," he hissed at her. "When you become human--you won't have any clothes on," he said, having trouble getting the words out. "I'll pull the curtains round the bed and you can put these on, all right? Do you think you can do that?" 
\par "Is that why I am under a blanket?" 
\par "Yes." 
\par To Harry's relief, she didn't try to squirm out from under the blanket. Her slightly argumentative nature was starting to 
remind him of his sister, and he struggled to maintain his concentration. He tried to hold his mother's image in his head very clearly, pointed his wand at Sandy and said, "}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Serpentigena per horam quinque effemino!}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 " 
\par But--he couldn't quite hold onto the ima
ge of his mother, as they soon saw. When the smoke had cleared, He saw bright green eyes, just like his own, gazing through the haze. It took him a moment to realize, however, that they weren't his mothers eyes, but his sister's. They could see, lying und
er the blanket on his bed, on her stomach, looking more than a little dazed, the image of Jamie Potter. 
\par "It worked," Sandy hissed at him, lifting his sister's head and using his sister's mouth. She started to rise, but Harry put his hand on her back and pu
shed her into the mattress before he or Ron could see too much, then pulled the curtains around the bed hurriedly. 
\par "You--you're supposed to put those clothes on now. Re-remember?" he stuttered. 
\par "Yes, Harry Potter," she hissed. 
\par He heard her rustling around then within the confines of the bed. It seemed to take quite a while, and before she emerged, the door to the room swung open and Dean, Neville and Seamus entered, yawning and tired. Harry and Ron whirled guiltily. 
\par "What're you two up to, then?" Seamus said suspiciously, seeing the pair of them standing before the drawn curtains of Harry's bed. Then a hissing noise emerged from behind the curtains and the three boys who had just entered the room frowned. 
\par "What's that, a balloon with a slow leak?" Dean 
asked. Harry had heard what Sandy said, but he didn't dare hiss an answer to her at this moment; he was somewhat self-conscious about using Parseltongue in front of others, anyway. He was starting to realize that she probably could not speak English. Then
,
 to their dismay, Harry and Ron heard a thud as Sandy's bare feet landed on the stone floor on the other side of the bed. She came walking around it, hissing at him, "I do not understand these fastenings, Harry Potter. I am not accustomed to having limbs.
 Or digits. I require assistance." 
\par She was wearing Harry's jeans, which were rather baggy and not buttoned, although Harry was glad to see that she'd gotten them zipped. She was also, thankfully, wearing the shirt, although she was holding it closed with h
er hands. It was obvious that she wasn't wearing anything under it. Seamus, Dean and Neville dropped their jaws.

\par Harry immediately whirled Sandy around and pulled her back to the far side of the bed, swiftly buttoning the open shirt (managing somehow to do so with his eyes barely open, since he hadn\rquote t been able to furnish her wi
th a bra) and then pulling the sweater over her head and getting her arms into the sleeves. She was a bit awkward about managing her limbs, not surprisingly. When they came round the bed again, the facsimile of Jamie Potter, who was really a transfigured 
garden snake named Sandy, was wearing slightly baggy jeans, a white shirt and one of Mrs. Weasley\rquote s patented Weasley jumpers in a vivid shade of green that matched Harry\rquote s eyes (and his sister\rquote s eyes, as well). 
\par Ron\rquote s ears were redder than he\rquote d ever seen th

e girl in their room. 
\par Harry decided to go out on a limb and tell the truth. Most of it, anyway. 
\par \'93Um, you\rquote re probably wondering who this girl in our room is,\'94 he began slowly, speaking very clearly, as though they perhaps didn\rquote t speak English. Mostly, he w
as worried that it would come out as Parseltongue, but as he was trying to concentrate very hard on addressing the boys, and they didn\rquote t look baffled about his actual words, it seemed that they were hearing it as English. 
\par Seamus crossed his arms and eyed Sandy in a rather annoying fashion. \'93You could say that, Harry. I don\rquote t even recognize her as a Hogwarts student, and she doesn\rquote t look old enough to be out of school. So she\rquote 
s either a witch from another country or a Muggle. Either way, you\rquote re in a bit of trouble, aren\rquote t you, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Head Boy}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par For a moment, Harry wondered whether Seamus was trying to blackmail him, but he shook himself and went on with his explanation. 
\par \'93Actually, there\rquote s a third explanation. The truth. I was practicing some spells from a book on doing magic with snakes. Sirius gave it to me after I got Sandy. Anyway, there\rquote s a spell to transfigure a snake into a woman, and that\rquote 
s just what I did. This is my snake, Sandy. That\rquote s why you heard us hissing at each other. We were both speaking Parseltongue. You\rquote ve seen her a thousand times. You\rquote 
ve just usually seen her wrapped around my arm, or warming herself on the hearth downstairs.\'94 
\par Dean snorted. \'93She looked a hell of a lot different then. Smaller. Greener. Less hair. Fewer arms and legs.\'94 
\par Seamus also snorted in laughter, and even Neville joined in. Harry could see that Ron was stifling his own laughter and suddenly felt quite alone. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Blimey. I wish I }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 had}{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  managed to turn her into my mum. They wouldn\rquote t be laughing at her....}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par \'93You expect us to believe that, Harry?\'94 Seamus said when he could speak again. \'93How do we know that when you\rquote re hissing at each other you\rquote re not--just hissing? How do we know you\rquote re speaking Parseltongue?\'94 
\par \'93It\rquote s the truth. Wait a minute--\'94 He turned to his bedside cabinet and picked up the heavy book with the snake eating its own tail on the cover. He showed the three boys the exact spell he\rquote 
d used, and they had to admit that it sounded like he wasn\rquote t lying--the book was open to that page, after all. However, after reading about how to do the spell, Neville looked at Ron and Harry shrewdly. 
\par \'93That\rquote s a pretty thick book. Why, of all the spells you could have tried, did you decide on }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  one?\'94 
\par Ron and Harry glanced guiltily at each other, swallowing. Harry had even said to Ron, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 You know what this was used for, don\rquote t you?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 Clearly, even Neville had worked this out. 
\par Seamus, Dean and Neville were now laughing fit to kill. \'93We wondered why you were so attached to that snake, Harry!\'94 Seamus choked out, almost helpless with laughter. \'93H
ow convenient to be a Parseltongue! You can chat up any girl you can conjure from a snake!\'94 
\par The three of them were leaning on each other, tears flowing from their eyes, they were laughing so hard. Harry felt very, very annoyed, and resisted the urge to th
row around detentions or deduct house points. The last thing he needed was for McGonagall to get wind of this. (Although it was possible that he might get points for a well-done and complicated Transfiguration, he somehow doubted that she would fail to wo
rk out the usual purpose of the spell also.) 
\par \'93That\rquote s enough!\'94 he finally bellowed. \'93I cast the spell to last five hours. Ron and Jam--er--Sandy and I are going down to the common room to wait for the spell to wear off. Good night!\'94 
\par He pulled Sandy to the door, her hand limp in his (did she not know how to use her mind to control her fingers? he wondered), and as Ron followed them out, he heard Dean say, \'93Weird. If I didn\rquote t know better, I\rquote d say she\rquote 
s exactly what a sister of Harry\rquote s would look like.\'94 
\par \'93Maybe that\rquote s because Harry cast the spell,\'94 Neville suggested. 
\par \'93Still--it\rquote s kind of weird,\'94 Dean said softly. 
\par \'93Weird,\'94 Seamus agreed. 
\par Harry groaned inwardly as they descended the stairs. If the other boys were saying anything else about this, he could no longer hear them, and he was glad that he didn\rquote t have Ron\rquote 
s super-sensitive werewolf hearing abilities. When the three of them reached the common room, it was deserted, for which Harry was grateful. He flung himself into a chair by the fire. Ron followed, an
d Sandy tried to, but she tripped over the rug and went sprawling. 
\par \'93Ow,\'94 she groaned, as Harry and Ron helped her into an armchair. 
\par \'93I am not accustomed to limbs,\'94 she told the two of them, awkwardly folding her legs under herself. \'93And having my eyes on the front of my head.\'94 
\par Harry ran his hand over his face after removing his glasses; he felt very weary. \'93Damn the three of them!\'94
 he said, then proceeded to use a number of choice profanities to describe what he thought of their interference. Harry put his glasses back on and saw that Ron was staring at both him and Sandy. 
\par \'93What\rquote s the matter, Ron? I know, I know, you don\rquote t usually hear me using language quite like that....Somehow the occasion seems to warrant it....It isn\rquote t like }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  haven\rquote t got a foul mouth at times, you know....\'94 
\par \'93You should hear what Harry says when others are not present,\'94 Sandy informed Ron. Ron\rquote s eyes went even wider. Harry frowned at him and wondered whether Sandy was going to make a habit of only using his first name. He wasn\rquote 
t used to it, and it sounded odd to him (although not quite as odd as looking at his sister and thinking of her as Sandy). 
\par \'93What\rquote s with you, Ron? There\rquote s no way that you understood what she--\'94 
\par \'93But that\rquote s just it, Harry! I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 can}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  understand her! Everything she\rquote s said since we came downstairs has sounded like English!\'94 His eyes were very round. 
\par Harry looked at Sandy with his jaw dropped. \'93You can speak English!\'94 
\par She put her hand to her throat. \'93I have a human\rquote s body, and it seems I can produce human speech.\'94 
\par \'93But you were speaking Parseltongue to me upstairs,\'94 Harry said, confused. 
\par \'93You were speaking Parseltongue to me before that,\'94 she replied. \'93I was answering in kind.\'94 
\par Ron was shaking his head, smiling. \'93Wow! I finally get to hear Sandy speak. After all this time. Do you know what\rquote s going to happen soon?\'94 he asked her eagerly. 
\par She frowned. \'93I have the Sight because I am a snake, and all snakes have the Sight. But I am not in my snake form at the moment, so I do not know whether I have the Sight right now.\'94 
\par Harry was feeling even more irritated; now Ron was treating Sandy like a sideshow act. \'93How would you like it if I started talking to Maggie like that?\'94 he said grumpily. \'93Bothering her morning, noon and night with, \lquote }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Read my fortune, Maggie, read my tea-leaves, Maggie, check out my aura, Maggie....}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \rquote \'94 
\par Ron grimaced. \'93All right, all right. You\rquote ve made your point. What are we going to do now?\'94 
\par Harry leaned back in his chair. \'93I\rquote m going to get some sleep. I\rquote m tired enough that sleeping while sitting up will be no trouble. Sandy, when the spell wears off and you\rquote re a snake again, can you do something to wake me?\'94 

\par \'93I am sure I can think of something. Would it be acceptable if I also go to sleep now?\'94 
\par Harry smiled at her. \'93Yes, Sandy, of course.\'94 She actually seemed to slither down the chair onto the floor (Harry reckoned that she didn\rquote t know how to move like a human) and stretched out on the rug before the fire. \'93
What are you doing, Sandy?\'94 
\par She looked up at him with his sister\rquote s glittering green eyes. \'93Going to sleep. This is how I am accustomed to sleeping when I am in this room.\'94 Harry nodded; it was true. He\rquote d put her on the hearth many times for just that purpose. 
\'93However,\'94 she added, \'93I am }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  accustomed to being warm blooded. I am feeling perhaps a bit }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 too}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  warm....\'94 In a trice, she had removed Mrs. Weasley\rquote s handiwork, and started to fumble at the buttons of the shirt. Harry was glad that she hadn\rquote t yet completely mastered how to use her fingers. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 No}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 !\'94 Harry cried out, jumping down onto the floor and putting his hands around her wrists so that she couldn\rquote t do anything. He glared at Ron, who 
had been watching her prepare to remove the shirt, his jaw hanging open again. 
\par \'93Er,\'94 Ron said awkwardly. \'93Yeah! I mean--No! Don\rquote t take off the clothes.\'94 He sounded like he wanted to say this as much as he wanted to say, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 No, please don\rquote t give me a million
 Galleons and tell me I\rquote m the greatest Quidditch player who\rquote s ever lived.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93Thanks for your support, Ron,\'94 Harry said dryly. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 What}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 Ron whined at him. 
\par Harry frowned at Sandy. He had to keep reminding himself that she wasn\rquote t his sister. \'93All right, you don\rquote t have to wear this,\'94 he said, brandishing the pile of knitted green yarn. \'93
But keep the shirt and jeans on. Okay? Otherwise--well, Ron and I could both get in quite a lot of trouble, and plus, I\rquote d have to use that poker to blind myself, right after I beat the piss out of Ron with it.\'94
 He tried to sound more light-hearted than he felt. 
\par She frowned; she hadn't understood this kind of dark humor when she was a snake, either; she was ever the literalist. \'93Why would you beat your best friend, Harry? Why would you have to blind yourself?\'94
 She put her hand on his brow solicitously, and Harry felt alarmed and disturbed; she was suddenly reminding him of Jamie a great deal, and he had to tell himself sternly that she }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 wasn\rquote t}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Jamie, that as much as he liked talking to Sandy sometimes, he couldn\rquote t quite talk to her in the same way he used to talk to his sister, and he they all needed to just get some rest. 
\par \'93Never mind. I wasn\rquote t being serious. Well, not completely,\'94 he added, not wanting her--or Ron--to think that it would be all right for her to disrobe. 
\par She curled up before the fire, her head on her arm, and soon he heard the sound of his sister\rquote s deep, measured breaths, the way he had been accustomed to seeing her in repose in his other life. It was so strange t
o have someone who appeared to be Jamie sleeping on the floor near his feet, and yet--so }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Jamie. 
\par Harry stared into the fire for a while; he\rquote d thought he was exhausted, but now, suddenly, his eyes wouldn\rquote t close. He looked over at Ron, and he wasn\rquote t ver
y happy when he discovered that Ron seemed to be watching the way the clothing strained over certain parts of Sandy\rquote s borrowed body when she moved in her sleep. 
\par \'93Hey!\'94 Harry said softly, so he wouldn\rquote t wake her. \'93Put your eyes back in your head!\'94 he whispered fiercely. 
\par Ron jerked his head up. \'93Oh. I didn\rquote t realize you were still awake. I was just--}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 blimey}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , Harry. You really had yourself a pretty sister,\'94
 he said weakly. Harry grinned and looked at her fondly. 
\par \'93Yes, I did. You made as big a fool of yourself over her in my other life, you know. I didn\rquote t put that in the Pensieve,\'94 he grinned, \'93but it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  rather funny.
\'94 
\par \'93Oh, I\rquote m glad my appreciating a pretty girl is so amusing to you.\'94 
\par \'93Yes, and it might be quite amusing to Hermione, as well. Shall I go fetch her--?\'94 
\par Ron started to get up. \'93No! No! Totally unnecessary!\'94 Harry laughed. \'93You bloody sod,\'94 he groused. \'93Don\rquote t do that.\'94 
\par Harry was still laughing. \'93Sorry. It\rquote s too much fun.\'94 
\par He and Ron stared at the fire silently for a few minutes, before Harry dared to ask him, \'93So--how are you and Hermione doing?\'94 
\par Ron grimaced and stretched his long legs toward the fire. \'93She\rquote s not happy, Harry. I keep telling her that she shouldn\rquote t take it as an insult or anything, that we haven\rquote t--well--\'94 
\par \'93Consummated?\'94 Harry ventured cautiously, not entirely certain he should be prying, now that Ron was revealing this to him. 
\par Ron nodded miserably. \'93Yeah. I mean--it\rquote s not as though I don\rquote t want her. She }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 knows}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  I do. And I realize it\rquote 
s frustrating for her too. She tried to lecture me about that. \lquote Do you think it\rquote s just for the man, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 blah blah blah}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\rquote \'94 He sighed. \'93But when I, er--\'94
 He looked uncertainly at Harry. \'93Okay, Harry--I think it\rquote ll be helpful to me to talk about this, but don\rquote t take it the wrong way if I look at the fire right now and not you, okay?\'94 
\par Harry tried not to laugh. \'93Okay. No offense taken. What did you want to say?\'94 
\par Ron gazed at the dancing flames. \'93Well, a couple of weeks ago--well away from the full moon--I--I offered to help her. With the--the frustration she\rquote s probably feeling. But she started to--well, to try to take things further, and I bolted. I
\rquote m just not ready for her to get me all worked up. Not that I don\rquote t start to get worked up when I\rquote m getting }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 her}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  worked up...I mean...I don\rquote 
t know what I\rquote ll do. To her. And it\rquote s getting close to the full moon, now. It\rquote s worst the day before, but it\rquote s progressively worse every day leading up to that. Right now, I feel pretty--agitated,\'94 he admitt
ed, and Harry saw his eyes flick toward Sandy. \'93It\rquote s a pity }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  don\rquote t have a snake...\'94 
\par Harry looked at him, trying to determine whether he was serious. \'93You'd better not mean that. Do you want me to pick up that poker right now and--?\'94 
\par Ron laughed. \'93Get a grip, Harry. I was just joking. I just--I just feel so }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 crazed.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  It\rquote s only been a few months since I was bitten, too. I don\rquote 
t know how Remus has put up with this month after month, year after year. I can\rquote t describe it. Feeling like you want to shag anything and everything--you may think you\rquote ve felt that way since you were thirteen--\'94 
\par \'93--well, I wouldn\rquote t go }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  far--\'94 
\par \'93--but your typical teenage hormone-fest is nothing compared to this. And I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 know}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  she would want to help me if she knew about it, which is precisely why I haven\rquote 
t told her. I\rquote d lose all control and take her up on the offer, and then I\rquote d probably lose all control while I\rquote m with her and she\rquote d land in the hospital wing...\'94 
\par \'93Oh, come on, Ron, you don\rquote t know that. And you\rquote re right--she }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 would}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  want to help you. You really ought to tell her, even if she doesn\rquote 
t spend the night with you. She\rquote s }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Hermione}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . You know what she does; she hits the books. If she knew you had this problem, she wouldn\rquote t rest until she\rquote 
d found a solution. A spell, or a potion or--something.\'94 
\par \'93Something like shagging me...\'94 
\par \'93Ron! Give her some credit! She\rquote s been running for over two years, she\rquote s been learning karate since the beginning of the summer, and she\rquote s put herself through the physical rigor of Animagus training. There\rquote s a co
nsiderable amount of pain involved in }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , let me tell you. She\rquote s tougher--physically--than you think. You don\rquote t need to act like she\rquote 
s made of bone china. You never know--she might give as good as she gets.\'94 
\par Ron\rquote s eyebrows flew up. \'93Are you saying that she--she ever got a little }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 rough}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  with you, Harry? Or asked you to get rough with her?\'94
 A split second later, his eyes opened wide in alarm. \'93Wait! Forget I said that! Bugger! I\rquote m so tired I don\rquote t know what I\rquote m saying. If I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ever}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 do that again, remind me that you have been instructed by me, on pain of death, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 never}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to reveal anything that went on between the two of you physically....\'94 
\par Harry smirked. \'93No problem. You don\rquote t think I would have }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 told}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  you, do you? Just because you asked? I\rquote m not }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  stupid.\'94 
\par Ron started to smile at this too, but then the smile disappeared from his face and he said to his best friend. \'93Oh. My. God. If you and Ginny do get together, you--you'll eventually want to--to--\'94 
\par Harry leaned back and groaned. He was afraid of this. \'93What\rquote s wrong, Ron? Train took a while to pull into the station?\'94 Harry tapped his temple with his forefinger. \'93
Are you shocked that I would want to do this? Or did you think that Ginny and I were going to be having knitting parties? At any rate, it\rquote s not like it\rquote s going to happen any time soon...\'94 
\par \'93You\rquote re damn right. But we }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 are}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  trying to break up Draco Malfoy and my sister so you two can--can--\'94 He sputtered to a stop, then ran his hand through his hair. \'93
Bloody hell. Now you almost have me wanting her to stay with Malfoy.\'94 
\par \'93Oh, yes, that would be a brilliant idea. Then she could lose her will power again, as she almost did at the end of last term, and sleep with }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  instead of me.\'94 
\par Ron shot to his feet. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 What}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? They almost--}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 what}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par Harry shrugged, trying to be nonchalant. \'93She was excited about her O.W.L. results. They went to the greenhouses to celebrate--you figure it out. If Professor Sprout hadn\rquote t caught them in time--\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Sprout}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  caught them? Bloody hell, I have to make sure I send her a Christmas card.\'94 
\par Harry laughed at that, and then Ron had to laugh too, and sat again, shaking his head and running his hand through his hair some more. Then he froze. He lifted his head and sniffed, and cocked his head, clearly listening to something. 
\par \'93You hear that?\'94 he whispered. 
\par Harry frowned. \'93Of course I don\rquote t, you prat. What is it?\'94 
\par Ron cocked his head to the side again. \'93Someone\rquote s been listening to us,\'94 he whispered. \'93They\rquote re on the girls\rquote  stairs.\'94 
\par He crept toward the opening to the stairwell, and a moment later, Harry }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 did}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 hear something; he heard footsteps pattering on the stone steps, making Ron leap through the arched doorway and dash up the stairs after the eavesdropper. Harry ran for the stairs 
too, but he was far behind Ron, not having his speed, and when he discovered Ron on one of the landings outside a dormitory, he stopped and whispered frantically, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Do you know who it is?}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Ron turned around, a dreadful expression on his face. He swallowed. \'93No,\'94 he whispered. \'93But I know what year they\rquote re in.\'94 He pointed with his thumb toward the sign on the door. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Seventh Years.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Now Harry swallowed. \'93C\rquote mon, Ron,\'94 he whispered. \'93We--we should go back down.\'94 
\par When they were seated before the fire again, Harry tried to reassure Ron. \'93It\rquote ll be okay, really...\'94 
\par \'93No, it won\rquote t, Harry! She knows now. Oh, god, she\rquote ll try to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 help}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ....\'94 
\par \'93Will that be so bad? So she tries to help? You\rquote d think it was a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 bad}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  thing for you to--to sleep with your own girlfriend when she wants this, too. Remus said--\'94
 he swallowed; \'93--he said it really calmed him down--\'94 Harry tried not to think about the fact that it was sleeping with his own }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 mother}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  that had calmed down Remus Lupin. 

\par \'93Do you think I want to--to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 use}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Hermione that way? }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Oh, darling, time to do it, as it\rquote s that time of month for me}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . Give me credit for being just a bit more romantic than }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ...\'94 
\par Harry lifted his eyebrow at him. \'93Romantic? You? Oh, it was very romantic to sleep with Parvati after you were set off by those Ravenclaw girls...\'94 
\par Ron ignored him. \'93And there\rquote s something Remus didn\rquote t tell }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 that he told me. I mean, he was embarrassed enough that you found out about that at all, and that Sirius found out the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 reason}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  why he was sleeping with--with your mum...\'94 

\par Harry frowned. \'93I thought Sirius didn\rquote t know before he overheard the two of you talking.\'94 
\par Ron nodded. \'93That\rquote s what I thought, too. No; he was saying, that he would have liked to pretend he didn\rquote t hear \lquote that\rquote --or I think he said something like that--because he w
as talking about the whole pre-full-moon madness. He didn\rquote t know that that was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 why}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Remus and your mum had originally--er--}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 done}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  it.\'94 
\par \'93Oh,\'94 Harry said simply, wondering how his godfather could have kept from him for the previous three years that his mother had slept with Remus Lupin while they were in school. Then again--he hadn\rquote t told him that she\rquote d been Snape
\rquote s girlfriend, either. He\rquote d found that out from Snape himself. \'93So, you still haven\rquote t told me what did Remus told you.\'94 
\par Ron sighed and glanced at Sandy. \'93He hurt her. When they--when she helped him. The first time, he bit her and bruised her. He almost always scratched her up pretty badly. And once he--he broke her leg.\'94 
\par \'93He }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 what}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par Ron nodded, miserable. \'93He was pretty upset about it, he said. And she forgave him. He felt even guiltier about }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ....He wasn\rquote 
t trying to scare me or anything. Okay, maybe he was a little. For my own good. And Hermione\rquote s. So I\rquote ll }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 think}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , so I\rquote ll be }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 careful.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  I don\rquote t want to hurt her, Harry. And I could. Really badly.\'94 
\par \'93That\rquote s why you have to tell her about this. So she knows what she\rquote s getting into, or she can go into research mode. Let her be who she is: }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Hermione,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 queen of preparedness. Don\rquote t shut her out.\'94 
\par Ron looked even grumpier. \'93Yeah, well, because of her listening in on what we were saying, she knows now...\'94 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93How do you know? She might not have been out of the dorm for that long, or she might have been going to check on a first year or something. She might not have heard us at all. She can\rquote t hear as well as you, remember.\'94 
\par Ron didn\rquote t look convinced. \'93Trust me; in the morning, she\rquote ll be acting }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 funny}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . She can\rquote t not give away that she knows about this. She\rquote 
s dreadful at that sort of thing.\'94 
\par \'93Just do me a favor, Ron, all right? Don\rquote t be cross with her and don\rquote t have a row over this. Let her tell you she knows. And if }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 she\rquote s}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  cross with }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  for not telling her straight out--just take it. Apologize--as difficult as I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 know}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 you find that to do--and get on with your lives. This shouldn\rquote t be the roadblock you\rquote ve let it become.\'94 
\par Ron made what Harry thought might be a noise of assent, leaning back with his eyes closed. Harry finally closed his eyes as well, hoping that his two best friends would be able to work things out, and before he knew i
t, something sharp was digging into his ankle, making him cry out in pain. His eyes flew open and he looked around, surprised to find himself sitting in a chair by the common room fire; he\rquote d forgotten he wasn\rquote 
t sleeping in his own bed. There was a white shirt and a pair of jeans on the hearth rug, and Harry looked around in panic. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 She\rquote d gotten undressed!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 He swallowed, seeing that Ron was still asleep. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Bloody hell. She just doesn\rquote t get it.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par But then he noticed that the shirt on the floor appeared to be buttoned still, and he felt another sharp pain on his ankle. 
\par \'93Ow!\'94 he said this time, bending over to look down, finding Sandy looking quite like herself again, a small green garden snake. She\rquote d found a way to wake him. He hadn\rquote t realized she had such sharp teeth, as she wasn\rquote 
t a carnivore. 
\par \'93Wake up, Harry Potter,\'94 she hissed, evidently having decided to go back to using his first and last names. He checked his watch before picking her up, then held her before his face. 
\par \'93Thanks, Sandy. All of the trouble about us having a strange girl in the dorm aside, this does seem to have worked. It isn\rquote t four thirty yet and you\rquote ve woken me up in time to do what I need to. Thank you.\'94 
\par \'93You\rquote re welcome, Harry Potter. It was rather interesting to be a human for a little while, but I think I am glad to be a snake again. It is what I know.\'94 
\par Harry nodded. And he\rquote d been a snake for a while--a Slytherin--but now that he was a Gryffindor again, he felt much more comfortable. It was what he knew. 
\par \'93Right. I can put you on my arm again, if you like. To keep you warm.\'94 
\par \'93Thank you, Harry.\'94 
\par There was that first name again. He tried not to reveal to her that this disconcerted him. He let her wind around his upper arm and then left Ron sleeping in the armchair while he crept up the stairs to the dorm, to get his map, since he\rquote 
d forgotten it earlier in his haste to get away from the other boys. When he returned, he shook Ron until he woke. 
\par \'93Wha--? Harry? What the hell--?\'94 
\par \'93We\rquote re going to find out what Malfoy and Mariah Kirkner are up to, remember?\'94 he told his sleepy friend. Ron yawned hugely and rubbed his eyes with his large fists. 
\par \'93Oh. Yeah. Right.\'94 One word sentences seemed to be all Ron could manage at the moment. His eyes were half-lidded and his beard had grown ridiculously thick over the few hours he\rquote 
d been sleeping. He appeared to be waking from a winter-long hibernation. 
\par Harry looked at the map carefully, trying not to let his eyes close from weariness. There were a variety of dots moving on it
--the people who were on for the third shift--and then he saw that there were two dots moving in the Slytherin common room labeled Draco Malfoy and Mariah Kirkner. 
\par \'93There they are!\'94 he said, feeling more awake now. They watched those dots travel through t
he dungeons and up the stairs to the entrance hall, where they were to report for duty. Harry checked his watch and noted that they were right on time--slightly early, even. The collection of dots milled around the entrance hall for a while before dispers
ing; the people from the third shift returning to their quarters, and the people on the fourth shift proceeding to fan out to patrol the castle corridors. 
\par Harry and Ron saw Draco and Mariah go up the stairs to the library. (\'93Figures they\rquote d pair off,\'94 Ron mumbled.) They walked back and forth the corridor outside the library, as though trying to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 appear}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to be patrolling, then went back down to the entrance hall, after which they descended the stairs to the dungeons. 
\par \'93Blimey!\'94 Ron said, indignant. \'93They\rquote re going back to their house! They\rquote re going to duck their patrol shift!\'94 
\par But Harry noticed that they took a turn that didn\rquote t go to the Slytherin common room; he knew it didn\rquote t because he\rquote d actually lived there for almost six years, whereas Ron didn\rquote t pick up on
 this, having only been there once, when he was disguised with Polyjuice Potion. 
\par \'93No, they\rquote re not,\'94 Harry told him, pointing at their route. \'93They veered off here.\'94 
\par They watched the moving dots some more as they proceeded through the maze of the Hogwarts dungeons. \'93Where are they going?\'94
 Ron asked, frowning. A couple of times, Draco Malfoy and Mariah Kirkner appeared to be moving through solid walls; they were walking through passages that were not marked as passages. 
\par And then Harry remembered, when he and Ron and Hermione had been bound to the trees in the forest and they didn\rquote t yet know that Malfoy was laying an elaborate trap for his father, Draco had said, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
My dad was already in the castle, waiting down in the dungeons. He let us out.....you aren\rquote t the only one who knows secret passages out of that place}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ...\'94 
\par \'93Of course! This could either be a passage my dad and the others didn\rquote t know about when they made the map, or else it was created by someone }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 after}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 they made the map. If they made the map in fourth or fifth year, this passage could have been made as early as their sixth or seventh year. It\rquote s a way Slytherins probably use to get out of the castle. Of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
course}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  they\rquote d have ways to sneak about....they\rquote re }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Slytherins.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 Harry wondered why he didn't remember 
these passages from being a Slytherin himself, but he reckoned it was possible that the difference in the time lines may have meant that a crucial person who knew the secret didn't pass it on to the younger Slytherins at some point, and knowledge of the t
unnels was lost. 
\par Ron nodded grimly. \'93You\rquote re right, Harry. It makes perfect sense.\'94 
\par They continued to watch the dots move through what appeared to be solid walls, and then, through what appeared to be solid earth outside the foundations of the castle. \'93Must be a tunnel,\'94
 Harry said, watching intently. The tunnel seemed to be leading to a spot near the lake; Harry could only judge the route it was taking by the movement of the dots, as the passage wasn\rquote t charted on the map. 
\par \'93Huh?\'94 both he and Ron said in unison when the dots appeared to be }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 in}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  the lake. 
\par \'93That must be a pretty deep tunnel,\'94 Ron said, \'93to go }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 under}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  the lake.\'94 
\par They stared and stared at the map, and at length, the dots were under the earth by the shores of the lake again. Draco and Mariah stayed there. And stayed there. 
\par \'93What are they doing? Do you suppose they\rquote re--\'94 
\par \'93I don\rquote t know,\'94 Harry replied, swallowing. Ron paced, his hands combing his hair again. 
\par \'93I wish they weren\rquote t in a damn tunnel. I wish I could just go over to the window here and look out, and know what they\rquote re--\'94 
\par Ron froze, staring out the window at the grounds. Harry frowned. \'93What?\'94 he asked his suddenly-silent best friend. 
\par Ron said, \'93Be right back,\'94 rather abruptly, before sprinting up the boys\rquote  stairs. Harry walked to the window where Ron had been and couldn\rquote t believe his eyes. \'93Here,\'94
 Ron said breathlessly, practically making Harry jump; Ron had been both swift and silent, and he was now thrusting Harry\rquote s Omnioculars at him, raising his own pair to his eyes and adjusting the 
focus. Harry lifted his as well, and now he saw, much more clearly, Draco Malfoy and Mariah Kirkner on the shore of the lake. When he\rquote d thought they were underground again, they were actually on the shore of the lake. 
\par They were just finishing taking off their clothes. 
\par \'93Blimey!\'94 Ron exclaimed, never taking his eyes from his Omnioculars. \'93It\rquote s bloody cold out for that, don\rquote 
t you think? Although I reckon they could have put a warming charm on a area where they are. Like when Hagrid had that golden griffin here. And--oh, my--\'94 
\par Harry wondered whether he\rquote d missed something important now. He scanned the area around the two Slytherins. \'93What? }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 What?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93Oh, it\rquote s just that--you can tell Mariah\rquote s a runner. I mean, that she--she tries to stay fit...\'94 Ron swallowed. The Omnioculars seemed welded to his hands and face. 
\par Harry resisted the urge to threaten to tell Hermione about this comment, as he also found himself (despite his original intent of being dispassionate and clinical about this exercise) mentally cataloguing Mariah\rquote s physical charms and didn\rquote 
t feel like having Ron threatening to tell Ginny. He couldn\rquote t have cared less about Draco Malfoy; Mariah was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 far}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 more interesting....Harry also swallowed. He kept his Omnioculars trained on them so that it would record them and provide proof of what they were up to (he told himself). But as he watched Mariah and Draco, finally seeing them do what he\rquote 
d suspected they\rquote d been doing for some time, it seemed that his heart was beating very loudly. His head was pounding along with it. He noticed that Ron\rquote s breathing had become ra
gged, and Harry reckoned that if he tried to remove the Omnioculars from Ron\rquote  face, he would wind up being put through the wall by a very upset werewolf. 
\par Abruptly, Mariah and Draco stopped kissing and touching each other and stood, picking up their wands and waving them over their clothes. The garments leapt into neat bundles, and appeared to have a sheen on them, as though they\rquote 
d been encased in some clear waterproof material. Each bundle seemed to have a two long ribbons attached to it, and, still naked 
under the three-quarters moon, both Draco and Mariah put their arms through the ribbon loops and walked toward the water holding hands, wearing the bundles of clothes on their backs, as though they were going hiking. Harry and Ron were shocked when the pa
ir leapt into the water, which was sure to be nearly freezing. Some bubbles rose to the surface where they had jumped, but their heads did not reappear immediately. 
\par \'93What the hell are they doing?\'94 Ron exclaimed before Harry hushed him. He sounded far more 
upset about not being able to see Mariah anymore than about the possibility that the two Slytherins could catch their death swimming in the frigid water. Then something occurred to Harry. 
\par \'93Wait a minute, Ron. Where do you suppose the tunnel brought them u
p to the surface? First they were underground, then under the lake, then on the shore of the lake. Are there any bushes near the shore? Something that could conceal an opening to a passage?\'94 
\par Ron scanned the landscape again. \'93Not really. Not where they were, anyway. There are some rocks and shrubbery farther along, though.\'94 
\par They were silent for a while. Harry checked his watch. They waited some more, one of them always watching the water. Harry checked his watch yet again. He swallowed. \'93Ron. I think we\rquote d 
better go find the patrollers. Especially the teachers. Or maybe I should just go straight to Dumbledore...\'94 
\par \'93Why?\'94 Ron said, still looking through the Omnioculars. 
\par \'93Because it\rquote s been over five minutes since I checked my watch the first time after they went into the lake, and it was at least three or four minutes before that that they jumped in. They\rquote 
ve been in there for almost ten minutes, and there aren\rquote t bubbles rising to the surface anymore, like when they first went in. We need to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 do}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  something.\'94 
\par Ron finally tore his eyes away from the Omnioculars and checked the map. \'93Snape and McGonagall are on.\'94 
\par \'93Really?\'94 Harry asked, checking the map. \'93It\rquote s supposed to be Sprout and Vector. Oh, well. I suppose the students aren\rquote t the only ones who change shifts. Where did you see them? 
\par \'93Here, by the library. Wipe the map and put it in your pocket.\'94 
\par \'93Right,\'94 Harry agreed. In a half-minute, they were out of the portrait hole and sprinting toward the library. When they arrived in the corridor they wanted, they spot
ted Professors McGonagall and Snape about to descend the stairs to the entrance hall. 
\par \'93Professors!\'94 Harry cried out breathlessly. They whirled in surprise. Professor McGonagall looked very concerned. 
\par \'93Potter! Whatever is the matter? Are you taking Weasley to the infirmary?\'94 
\par \'93No, Professor,\'94 he panted, trying to get enough air into his lungs. \'93We--we were awake in our dormitory--\'94 His eyes slid toward Ron\rquote s, so he\rquote d know to back him up on this. \'93
--and I happened to walk to the window for a drink of water from the pitcher, and I saw--\'94 
\par McGonagall stepped toward him, concerned. \'93What?\'94 
\par Harry swallowed. \'93Mariah Kirkner and Draco Malfoy jumped into the lake. And they didn\rquote t come up. We waited and waited, but it\rquote s been nearly fifteen minutes now, maybe longer....\'94 
\par Snape actually grew paler, and Professor McGonagall looked horrified. Without a word, they turned to the stairs and started descending rapidly, Ron and Harry right behind them. Snape had already opened the heavy front door of the school and they wer
e all about to run outside when a familiar voice behind them made them freeze. 
\par \'93A bit cold for that, isn\rquote t it?\'94 came the laconic drawl. \'93Are we patrolling outdoors now, as well?\'94 
\par They all turned in surprise. Draco Malfoy and Mariah Kirkner were standing at the top of the dungeon stairs. Snape gave Harry and Ron a sharp look and pushed the front doors closed again. Harry gawped at Malfoy and Mariah. }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 They were alive!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  But--}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 how}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? 
\par McGonagall\rquote s mouth had gone very thin and Harry didn\rquote t like the way it was twisting about one bit. \'93How is everything, Mr. Malfoy, Miss Kirkner?\'94 she asked them, one eyebrow raised. 
\par Draco Malfoy shrugged. \'93We were down in the dungeons. The Slytherins seem to be behaving themselves at the moment, you\rquote ll be glad to know, sir,\'94 he said to his head-of-house. \'93Thought we\rquote d check upstairs next.\'94 
\par Harry\rquote s jaw dropped. \'93But---but you jumped in the lake! The pair of you! We thought you\rquote d drowned!\'94 
\par Malfoy looked at Harry as though he thought he was mad. \'93Um, having a little trouble telling your dreams apart from reality, Potter? Or should I say }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 fantasies}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par Harry turned, wide-eyed, to McGonagall and Snape. \'93It\rquote s true! They--they--\'94 he sputtered, realizing that he couldn\rquote t say in front of McGonagall that they were using the Marauders\rquote  Map to tra
ck Draco Malfoy and Mariah Kirkner. If it had just been Snape, he would have, as Snape knew about the map, but with McGonagall present.... 
\par She raised an eyebrow at Harry and Ron. \'93Yes? Do you have anything remotely plausible to say concerning why you two 
are out of Gryffindor Tower? Because it is starting to appear that you were out of bounds, learned that Professor Snape and I were nearby, and to avoid discovery, decided to feign an emergency.\'94
 Her eyes looked back and forth between them, peering over her square-rimmed spectacles. \'93
Please tell me if there is a legitimate reason for your being here, as Mr. Malfoy and Miss Kirkner both appear to be in the pink of health, as well as being dry as bones.\'94 They were not, however, even close to being as dry as Professor McGonagall
\rquote s comments, Harry thought. 
\par Then he took a good look at them; there wasn\rquote t a drop of water on them, and even their clothes were immaculate, not remotely creased, as they would be after being bundled up. Harry caught Mariah\rquote s eye, which h
e saw had quite a mischievous glint in it. She gave him a half-smile and ran the tip of her tongue over her bottom lip. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 She knew he\rquote d been watching.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Suddenly, a very clear mental image of her body leapt into his mind, and he felt himself grow warm and redden. Professor McGonagall took this as an admission of guilt. 
\par \'93I don\rquote t know what you\rquote ve been up to, but Head Boy or not, I cannot make exceptions to the rules.\'94 She sighed, as though she\rquote 
d dearly love to, but had no choice; she looked at Snape out of the corner of her eye. He had his arms crossed and was looking triumphantly at Harry and Ron, just like when they were younger and he\rquote d caught them in a bit of rule breaking. \'93
It does }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  appear,\'94 McGonagall continued, \'93
that Mr. Weasley needs to go to the hospital wing, as I thought might be the reason for your being out of bounds, and no one else seems to be having a medical emergency either--\'94 she added, glancing at the Slytherins. 
\par \'93--Although when I die, Potter, I\rquote ll make sure you\rquote re the first to know--\'94 Draco Malfoy added with a smirk that faded as soon as Professor McGonagall gave him that gimlet eye. He cleared his throat for a moment and let her continue. 

\par \'93--so I have no choice. Twenty house points will be taken from each of you for being out of bounds, and detentions will be arranged. Now--I will personally escort you up to Gryffindor Tower and I don\rquote 
t want you to come out of there until the last patrol shift is over. Is that understood?\'94 
\par \'93Yes, Professor,\'94 Harry and Ron said in unison. Harry noticed that Ron had been very, very quiet since Malfoy and Mariah had shown up. Now he saw that Ron was looking at Mariah with narrowed eyes, but this time it didn\rquote 
t seem lascivious. His nostrils were flared as well, and Harry saw the wolf\rquote s red glow in his eyes. Harry wished Ron was like Maggie and could project his thoughts into other people\rquote 
s brains; he would have given all the Galleons in his Gringotts vault to know what Ron was thinking. Then Harry noticed Snape looking at Malfoy and Mariah rather suspiciously, and he wished that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 he}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  was the one escorting them upstairs, so he could speak to him privately, let him know about the map, about the secret passages in the dungeons. Harry had no doubt that he\rquote 
d believe him and Ron. But that would have to wait. 
\par When they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady, McGonagall turned to them; she\rquote d been utterly silent while walking upstairs. \'93I don\rquote t know why the two of you were wandering about at this hour, but 
I should think you would both want to be well-rested for your practices today, and for your match tomorrow.\'94 She smiled indulgently now. \'93I know that no matter whether Wales or England win, you will both make us all proud,\'94
 she added quietly. Harry felt very small. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Some Head Boy I am.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Harry and Ron said goodnight to her and reentered the common room. They picked up their Omnioculars from the windowsill and climbed wearily up to their dormitory. Seamus, Dean and Neville were snoring peacefully behind their 
bedhangings. Harry and Ron fell into their beds without disrobing or pulling the hangings closed, and Harry fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow. 
\par The dreams started not long after he fell asleep.... 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 He was swimming in the lake during the second
 task....Mariah Kirkner and Draco Malfoy were the ones tied up and being held hostage, though, not the four who were under the lake during the real task. He tried to untie them, but he couldn\rquote 
t loosen their bonds, and when he put his hands up to his neck, 
his gills were gone, and he felt his lungs swiftly and painfully fill with water, while they grinned at him and laughed and laughed, bubbles emerging from their mouths, their eyes wide with mirth....}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par He awoke, gasping for air, as the morning sun shone in the windows of the tower room.

were out of bounds and busy getting forty points taken away from Gryffindor. You\rquote re not in first year anymore, Harry. You\rquote re Head Boy now--\'94 
\par \'93But Hermione--\'94 Ron started to say. 
\par \'93And you!\'94 she said abruptly, turning to him. 
\par \'93What?\'94 he said, a defensive 
tone in his voice. Hermione looked like she wanted to hit him and kiss him at the same time. She turned back to her plate and stabbed some eggs rather viciously. Harry was feeling a bit off his food and had a full plate that he\rquote d merely picked at. 

\par \'93Oh--nothing,\'94 she bit off, sounding like she had quite a lot to get off her chest to Ron, but that she hadn\rquote t quite been pushed to the breaking point. Harry wasn\rquote t sure Ron would want to be around when she did reach that point. 

\par A number of students around the Great Hall seemed to be looking in Harry\rquote s and Ron\rquote 
s direction, giggling and pointing. Orion Pierson was sniggering behind his hand and then whispering something to a boy sitting next to him, making Harry wish he wasn\rquote t Sirius\rquote  nephew, so he wouldn\rquote t feel g
uilty upbraiding him for being rude. The seventh-year Hufflepuffs were red-faced with laughter, and Hannah Abbott seemed to be making }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 kissing}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 faces at him before turning to her friends, who were hooting and squealing uproariously. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Lovely,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 and she\rquote 
s a prefect, too.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  The Slytherins looked very smug about something whenever he glanced their way, and the Ravenclaws looked even more superior than usual, and yet also highly amused about something he\rquote 
d evidently done, as they were all breaking into grins when they noticed him glancing their way. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 What\rquote s wrong with all of them?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 he wondered. He understood the other houses being gleeful about Gryffindor losing points, but that didn\rquote t explain why the first year Gryffindors were in convulsions, nor why the oth
er students in his own house were also looking like they were going to burst. He met Ginny\rquote s eye for a minute, and was surprised to see that she was looking }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 embarrassed}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, instead of being in convulsions, like the other students. She turned deep red and look
ed away from him, pretending to be interested in something Ruth was saying. Ruth met his eye then, and a secret smile tugged at the corner of her mouth; she looked like she was trying very, very hard not to laugh. 
\par Harry ignored all of them, bending over his plate to speak to Hermione across the table, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 sotto voce.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  \'93
Hermione--we probably should have told you what we were up to last night, but I want to fix that now. Hurry and finish, then come with us so we can tell you how we got forty house points deducted
. I think we need your brain to help us work out a bit of a mystery.\'94 
\par She brightened at bit at that, and Ron gave him an approving smirk. The way to get on Hermione\rquote s good side: flatter her brain. And making a groveling apology for any misdeed was also usually a good move. 
\par The three of them sat in the anteroom off the Great Hall after breakfast, Harry and Ron taking turns explaining the problem with getting Ginny to personally witness some misdeed of Draco Malfoy\rquote s so she\rquote d have to break up with him out o
f pride. Then they explained why they\rquote d turned Sandy into a woman... 
\par \'93Oh, yes! I nearly forgot about that when I heard about the forty points. It\rquote s all over the school this morning, you know. Neville, Dean and Seamus started telling everyone as soon as they came downstairs.\'94
 Harry groaned; that explained all of the tittering in the Great Hall. \'93Apparently you two were still sleeping after your nocturnal jaunt. What is this spell?\'94 she asked grumpily, with a glance at Ron. \'93The wizarding method of not havin
g to go out and buy inflatable dolls?\'94 
\par Both Harry and Ron flushed. \'93She looked like my sister Jamie, if you must know,\'94 he informed her. \'93Although practically no one in this life knows about Jamie, so I can\rquote t very well explain, \lquote Oh, I was missing my siste
r and thinking about her when I cast the spell...\rquote  It wasn\rquote t like I was about to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 do}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  anything with her, even if I weren\rquote 
t interested in Ginny, and even if she looked like someone else. Especially as she\rquote s really }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Sandy}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . What do you take me for?\'94 
\par Hermione waved her hand at him impatiently. \'93Yes, yes, you have a point. It\rquote s just that--well it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 does}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  look very bad, Harry. You can\rquote t deny that.\'94 
\par He grimaced. \'93I know, I know.\'94 He wondered how soon the hubbub about that spell would die down, and whether any teachers would get wind of it. 
\par Ron\rquote s eyes narrowed now, looking at her. \'93You\rquote re saying you didn\rquote t know about this until this morning, when the other blokes came downstairs and told everyone? You weren\rquote t on the girls\rquote 
 stairs last night eavesdropping on us while we were talking?\'94 
\par Hermione looked very confused. \'93Eavesdropping? Last night? I slept the night through. What are you talking about?\'94 
\par Ron was looking at her very intently. Then he turned to Harry with a sigh of relief. \'93She\rquote s telling the truth.\'94 
\par Harry shook his head in wonder. \'93How do you know?\'94 
\par \'93I can see when the blood vessels around a person\rquote s eyes are carrying more blood. I can sense in general the way a person\rquote s blood is flowing through their body. That\rquote s what happens when someone\rquote 
s lying--the thing about the eyes. And there\rquote s no change with her.\'94 
\par Hermione put her hands on her hips. \'93First--stop talking about me like I\rquote m not here. Second--where on earth did you learn that?\'94 
\par Ron shrugged. \'93A Muggle magazine I read when Remus and I went into London to register me as a werewolf. They have medical magazines in the reception area--Muggle ones--so it doesn\rquote 
t look suspicious, in case any Muggles wander in off the street. They can\rquote t use Muggle-repelling charms on the office to keep them out because a number of werewolves }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 are}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 Muggles. It was a very interesting article, about how Muggles are trying to create these machines to work out where people\rquote s blood is flowing when they\rquote re doing various things, like complex calculations or singing or lying. When they
\rquote re lying, it turns out that it goes to the blood vessels around the eyes. Almost as good as Veritaserum, sounds like, if you have a good way to detect that that\rquote s where the blood\rquote s gone.\'94 Hermione looked at him in amazement. 

\par \'93Wait,\'94 Harry said suddenly. \'93We\rquote re getting sidetracked. So--if Hermione wasn\rquote t the one eavesdropping on us, who was?\'94 
\par Ron shrugged. \'93That leaves Parvati or Lavender. Whoever it was ran into the seventh-year dorm.\'94 
\par \'93Did you hear anything last night, Hermione? Hear one of them get up and leave?\'94 Harry asked her. 
\par She widened her eyes and shrugged. \'93I don\rquote t know. Maybe. In the night, one of us will usually get up to use the loo. But not always. I was dead tired last night. I don\rquote t know if one of them got up or not.\'94 
\par \'93Oh!\'94 Ron cried. \'93I almost forgot, Harry. Last night, Malfoy and Mariah were }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 definitely}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  lying.\'94 
\par \'93No surprise there. Blood vessels around the eyes?\'94 Harry asked. 
\par \'93Not only that, but they smelled of the lake. Very strongly. And they smelled of something else, too....\'94 
\par \'93What?\'94 
\par Hermione and Ron both looked at him as though he was daft. \'93What do you think, Harry?\'94 Ron said. \'93They reeked of sex.\'94 
\par \'93Oh,\'94 he said softly. 
\par \'93Poor Ginny!\'94 Hermione said. \'93Explain to me again why she won\rquote t break up with him, when she doesn\rquote t love him, wants to be with you, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 and}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  she knows he
\rquote s cheating on her?\'94 
\par Harry sighed. \'93She\rquote s afraid he\rquote ll go running off to serve Voldemort and try to kill me,\'94 he said in a monotone. Hermione nodded. 
\par \'93And well she might be. This }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 is}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Malfoy we\rquote re talking about. Someone who thinks nothing of putting his own father in prison, even if he }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 did}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  richly deserve it.\'94 
\par \'93But he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 can\rquote t}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  love her,\'94 Ron said, running his hand through his hair. \'93He\rquote s shagging Mariah. He\rquote s a bastard and deserves whatever he gets.\'94 

\par \'93Yes,\'94 Hermione reminded him, \'93but Harry doesn\rquote t deserve to be killed just because Malfoy is cheating on your sister. Don\rquote t be stupid.\'94 Ron bristled, but she went on. \'93
At any rate, it sounds like you two should curb your nocturnal ramblings for a while. I\rquote ll see whether I can manipulate both my own schedule and Malfoy\rquote s and Mariah\rquote s in order to get something incriminating on them at a time when }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  have }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 permission}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to be out of Gryffindor Tower,\'94 she said pointedly. \'93
In the meantime, you might find this interesting, Harry. My parents sent it in the owl post this morning.\'94 
\par She handed him an article cut from the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 London Times}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
; it was about Rodney Jeffries. All sorts of people were interviewed about how much they loved him, from priests to doctors to members of Parliam
ent and several European royal families. Scotland Yard--once investigating him--was even providing protection to Jeffries free of charge. Harry shook his head. There was something not right about this. He wondered now why Jeffries had healed him in St. Mu
ngo\rquote s....Perhaps it had merely been to get Harry on his side? Or perhaps he thought Harry }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 would}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  tell people who had healed him, hoped there\rquote 
d be some good publicity to come out of it. Harry was glad now that he hadn\rquote t told anyone. He\rquote d originally thought Jeffries sounded very well-meaning and altruistic in the letter he\rquote 
d written to Harry, but now he had a rather uneasy feeling at the thought of anyone knowing about that. He thought about telling Ron and Hermione, but decided it wasn\rquote t the right time. 
\par Once \'93time\'94 crossed his mind, he checked his watch. \'93Ron--we have to go. We need to get our gear and meet Sirius and Remus in the Great Hall in half an hour.\'94 
\par \'93While you two are off flying about chasing Quaffles and catching Snitches, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  will do something usefu
l and try to figure out where those tunnels are that you say Malfoy and Mariah used,\'94 Hermione said. \'93Where\rquote s the map now?\'94 
\par Harry withdrew it from his pocket and handed it to her. Then he whirled in surprise as a very smooth and familiar voice said from the doorway, \'93Good. I was half afraid that you had lost that, Mr. Potter, although it }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 does}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  explain why you assumed that Miss Kirkner and Mr. Malfoy were in danger early this morning.\'94 
\par Snape stood in the doorway, his deep voice slightly amused. Harry stuttered. \'93Oh, I--I\rquote m so glad you\rquote re here, Professor! I wanted to tell you last night, but--\'94 
\par He held up his hand. \'93I knew you would not frivolously run about the castle claiming that someone was in danger. When you lie to cover up your rule-breaking, you are not usually very good at it, but you never invent emergencies, I\rquote 
ll give you that,\'94 he added, making Harry flush. \'93Plus--Miss Granger may need some assistance from someone who is intimately acquainted with the dungeon passages....\'94 
\par Ron looked a little hostile about this. \'93You\rquote re going to be wandering around the dungeons with Hermione, looking for secret passages?\'94 Harry wasn\rquote 
t sure whether it was bothering him because Hermione was his girlfriend or because Snape was, technically, his older sister\rquote s boyfrie
nd. Harry had the impression that Ron would have been far more comfortable going back to the way they'd all thought of Snape when they were younger, as some sort of evil neutered Potions-teaching machine. 
\par \'93Well, Miss Granger and Miss Dougherty and I.\'94 Ron looked like he was breathing a little easier, having heard that. \'93It seems--prudent--to have someone with your older sister\rquote s talents along.\'94 
\par Harry nodded. \'93Right. Good idea. But may I ask sir--why?\'94 
\par Snape fixed him with an intent gaze. \'93Mr. Malfoy has a charm on him which could very well make him the most useful weapon the Dark Lord has. And I am not completely certain where Miss Kirkner\rquote 
s loyalties lie, except that they undoubtedly lie with Miss Kirkner--}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 if}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  she is controlling her own actions...\'94 
\par Harry\rquote s eyes opened wide. Of course! Lucius Malfoy had put girls under Imperius to try to control Harry--Voldemort might have had someone put Mariah under Imperius to try to control Malfoy! On the other hand, that might mean that Malfoy wasn
\rquote t completely responsible for his actions, which made it harder for Harry to condemn him....}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Damn,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
If he turns out to be blameless....}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  His thoughts were whirling about this new and unwelcome thought. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Damn.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par \'93If there is a way for either of them to leave the castle undetected, I believe I should know about it, for security reasons. Don\rquote t you?\'94 Snape added, raising an eyebrow. 
\par Harry nodded again. \'93Good point. Well,\'94 he said, not really wanting to leave now, \'93Ron and I can go off to Quidditch practice knowing that the question of the tunnels is in good hands.\'94
 He gave Snape a small smile, feeling inordinately rewarded when one corner of the Potion Master\rquote s mouth lifted in an }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 almost}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  smile. 
\par \'93I\rquote ll take that as a compliment, Mr. Potter. You should go to meet Remus and Sirius now, the pair of you,\'94 he said brusquely. \'93You might also want to inform }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 them}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 of what the three of us will be doing. In addition, I will tell the headmaster, and then he can tell Professor McGonagall what is occurring, and that I am to oversee your detentions,\'94 he added, nodding at Harry and Ron. \'93
That will give us additional time to study the question of the tunnels, if we do not learn all we need to today, and since you will be under my supervision, if anyone else comes across us, you will have adequate alibis this time.\'94
 Snape turned to look at Hermione impassively. 
\par \'93Miss Granger--wait for me here. I will go to fetch Miss Dougherty.\'94 
\par He left immediately, his robes billowing out behind him, and Hermione stood to kiss Ron on the lips and Harry on the cheek. \'93Have a good practice, both of you, and don\rquote t worry. Leave it to us to find out how they left the castle.\'94 
\par \'93Too bad }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you\rquote re}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  going to be in the dungeons with Snape and Maggie,\'94 Harry told her, smirking. \'93They may try to find a 
way to shake you after a while. Use tact; if it seems like they want to sneak off to snog, try to think of a good reason why you have to excuse yourself...\'94 
\par Ron was aghast. \'93That\rquote s my sister you\rquote re talking about!\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Sssh!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 Hermione hissed at him, even though they were the only three in the room. \'93That\rquote s not supposed to be common knowledge, remember?\'94 
\par \'93Snogging }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Snape}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 Ron said with disgust, making Hermione and Harry exchange amused glances; Ron had never been in Snape\rquote s Pensieve and seen Harry\rquote s mother wi
th Snape in the dungeon and under the oak trees that used to grow near the greenhouses. \'93Are you trying to make me get sick right before a practice?\'94 
\par Harry and Hermione laughed, and they were both still laughing as Harry dragged Ron from the room so they could get their equipment and prepare to meet each other on the field of battle.

t been so tired and sore since the day he had tried out for the Welsh team. At least the Bludgers were being hit away from him by his team\rquote s Beaters now.
 The final practice before the match had been a scrimmage with the witches of the Holyhead Harpies, the current League champions. For this, Erica Welsh had played in the Seeker position on the Harpies; Harry had grown to like Erica quite a lot, and Owen a
s well. The two of them were both very sweet together and perfectly able to set their marital relationship aside and be quite businesslike (which sometimes meant quite antagonistic) at a moment\rquote s notice. And yet--their marriage didn\rquote 
t seem to suffer at all for this. From what Harry could tell, it was largely through Erica\rquote s connections that they were able to get the Harpies to come in and play them to give them some formidable practice before the match with England. He\rquote 
d caught the Snitch three times during the practice and Owen was convinced he was ready for the match. Erica had studied the style of the English Seeker and had tried to imitate him as much as possible, so that Harry would know what to expect. She\rquote 
d caught the Snitch twice. 
\par When he and Sirius 
arrived back in the Hogwarts entrance hall just in time for the evening meal, Harry thought it was quite possible that he could eat everything that appeared on the Gryffindor table. Unfortunately, that would mean fighting Ron for all of the food; he seeme
d to have the same sort of rigorous practice experience Harry had had. Harry couldn\rquote t help feeling that that didn\rquote t bode well for the Welsh team. He grimaced while shoveling his food in, watching Ron\rquote 
s face as he chewed nonchalantly. He and Ron had already agreed that there would be no hard feelings no matter whose team won, but the fact remained that only one team was going on to the quarter-finals. 
\par Suddenly, a shriek rent the air in the Great Hall, rising even above the normal hubbub of meal-time. Harry t
urned in alarm to see Pansy Parkinson run screaming from the Slytherin table, her hair afire with magical purple flames. Quicker than thought, Will Flitwick, who was at the far end of the Gryffindor table with the other third years, and closest to Pansy, 
cried, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Fluvius!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94
 and sprayed her head with a stream of water from the end of his wand. By the time Harry reached them, Will had turned off the water, and Pansy was a sopping mess, her singed hair clinging to her head, making it look rather small and accent
uating her piggish turned-up nose. 
\par \'93What--what happened?\'94 Harry asked her, perplexed. 
\par Pansy screamed in frustration. \'93It\rquote s--it\rquote s that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Mudblood harpy}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  again, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that\rquote s}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  what happened!\'94 she cried before turning on her heel and stalking out of the Great Hall, probably to go to the hospital wing. Harry turned to see where she was pointing, and saw-- 
\par His Aunt Petunia. 
\par He groaned inwardly. 
\par \'93Thanks, Will,\'94 he said to the younger boy, who nodded and gave Harry a small two-fingered salute before rejoining his friend
s at the Gryffindor table. Harry thought that perhaps he would suggest to Snape that they relax the rule about the Dueling Club being for fourth years and up; Will seemed to be very good at thinking on his feet, and Harry hadn\rquote 
t been especially happy with the new students who\rquote d been trying for the open positions since the term had begun in September. 
\par He walked to the Slytherin table and stood next to his aunt; she was eating with an ersatz air of calm. There was a no-man\rquote s-land around her where no other Slytherins sat. She did not acknowledge Harry\rquote s presence. 
\par He cleared his throat in a vain attempt to get her attention, and when that failed, he put his hand on her shoulder lightly and said, \'93May I speak to you, please?\'94 He didn\rquote t especially want to call her \'93Aunt Petunia\'94
 in front of the Slytherins, so he didn\rquote t call her anything at all. 
\par He glanced up at Snape, at the head table, and received a small nod; he didn\rquote t want to deal with his new middle-aged student (she was older than he was), and was glad Harry was taking her in hand. Harry hoped he }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 could}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  take her in hand. It was very, very strange how the tables had turned; all of his life, she\rquote 
d had ultimate power over him, the exception being when his uncle was making them all drive across the country to avoid his Hogwarts letters--even Aunt Petunia had had no control over the situation then, Uncle Vernon being utterly in control of the family
\rquote s movements--and yet completely out-of-control at the same time. 
\par She looked up at him with a rather surly expression in her eyes, and Harry was jolted by how much it reminded him of his mother. She\rquote 
d never reminded him much of his mother when he was younger, except when she was singing to Dudley--but then, he hadn\rquote t really known anything about his mother, and now he ha
d fifteen years of memories of her, memories of growing up with her and being disciplined by her, of fighting with her and making up with her. His aunt rose and followed him out the door of the Great Hall. 
\par \'93Aunt Petunia,\'94 he began in a low voice, once they were standing in the entrance hall; \'93did you set Pansy\rquote s hair afire?\'94 He felt it wisest to get straight to the point and not beat around the bush. 
\par She practically pouted. \'93That girl is the stupidest little ninny I\rquote ve ever had the displeasure to know. If she doesn\rquote t have her hair set on fire more often, she\rquote ll be completely insufferable by the time she\rquote s twenty.\'94 

\par Harry sighed, remembering the Pansy in his other life trying to get her father to consider Harry for a job in his department at the Ministry, so she could be near him. \'93Look, I\rquote 
m not the biggest fan of Pansy Parkinson either, but there are a couple of things to consider. First--trying to keep Pansy from being insufferable is probably a lost cause.\'94 He couldn\rquote t stop himself from smirking just a li
ttle, realizing that he and his aunt probably actually agreed on something--a general dislike of Pansy. \'93Second--even if someone }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 is}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  incurably insufferable, you can\rquote 
t just go about setting their hair on fire. I don\rquote t care how many people you dislike--and you\rquote re probably going to dislike a lot of Slytherins, as most of them aren\rquote t at all fond of Muggle-born witches and wizards--you can\rquote 
t just curse or jinx or hex anyone you please. There are }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 rules}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 
\par \'93And you know what I told you last time, Mrs. Dursley,\'94 Hermione said sternly. Harry started; she was standing at his elbow and he hadn\rquote t heard her enter the hall. \'93
I told you that the next time the consequences would be more dire than a scolding.\'94 
\par \'93What you told her }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 last time}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 Harry said to her, bewildered. \'93This has happened before?\'94 
\par Hermione rolled her eyes. \'93Don\rquote t you read those parchments I put by your plate every day at breakfast? What do you think they\rquote re }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 for}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par Harry swallowed, embarrassed. \'93Oh. Sorry. I thought they were just revised patrolling schedules or something.\'94 
\par \'93That\rquote s in there, too. But student incidents are also catalogued. You\rquote re supposed to know what\rquote s going on, Harry.\'94 
\par He was even more embarrassed now, and could see a smug glitter in his aunt\rquote s eye. That galvanized him into action. \'93Well,\'94 he said to her, \'93you heard the Head Girl. Not just a scolding this time,\'94
 he said, trying to sound ominous, and instead sounding to himself like a small child play-acting at being a grown-up. He looked at Hermione out of the corner of his eye, seeing her mouth the word }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 detention}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . 
\par \'93This time, it means a detention!\'94 he said to his aunt, as though he\rquote d just thought of this himself. 
\par \'93Detention!\'94 his aunt exclaimed, evidently not having paid any attention to Hermione. \'93I\rquote m a forty-three-year-old woman! I\rquote m to have a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 detention}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94
 she said indignantly. \'93And }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you\rquote re}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  the one giving it to me?\'94 she added, as though the animals had put all of the zookeepers into the cages at the zoo. 
\par Harry lifted his chin resolutely. \'93Yes. At our last Herbology lesson, Professor Sprout was asking for volunteers for repotting the Mandrakes again. I think I\rquote ll tell her she has a new volunteer--}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 His aunt scowled in a way that was not at all becoming. In fact, he thought, she looked rather like traditional Muggle depictions of witches when she did that. \'93I\rquote 
ll tell Professor Sprout that she is to have the help she needs, and she will tell you when to report to the greenhouses. Is that understood?\'94 He did his best to make his voice very stern now. 
\par She backed down from her defiant stance just a little. \'93Crystal clear,\'94
 she said sharply, her tone also like cut crystal. She turned and walked up the marble stairs to the staff wing with an imperious air, and Harry knew it was going to be an uphill battle to discipline her. 
\par Hermione patted his arm sympathetically. \'93You did all right, Harry. I don\rquote t know what I\rquote d do if I had a disagreeable relative suddenly show up here with magical powers. But }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 do}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  start reading the parchments I give you, all right? I\rquote m not writing out this information for my health.\'94 
\par He looked at her sheepishly. \'93Yes, ma\rquote am,\'94 he replied, unable to keep the corners of his mouth from turning up. She punched him lightly on the arm. 
\par \'93Listen to you. There will be plenty of opportunity to make me feel like an old woman in thirty years. You don\rquote t need to start before we\rquote re even out of school.\'94 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Thirty years}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . Harry wondered for a moment where they\rquote d all be in thirty years. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Where will we all be in one year, for that matter?}
{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  There were times--especially during the Triwizard Tournament--when he wasn\rquote t completely certain he\rquote 
d even survive school. He grinned at Hermione; he was tempted to tell her she was being awfully optimistic to think he\rquote d be alive in thirty years, but he didn\rquote t do this. Instead he repeated the \'93ma\rquote am\'94 in a mischievous
 sing-song all the way back to the Gryffindor table, and when they sat down to eat their puddings, she suddenly flicked her hand toward Harry\rquote 
s lovely piece of apple pie, turning it into--a steaming pile of rotting tripe. Harry paused with a forkful of the
 stuff just in front of his open mouth; he thought he was going to vomit, but he swallowed and put his fork down, pushing the plate away. Orion Pierson, Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown were sitting across from him, and they recoiled as the plate of tripe
 came nearer to them. Orion even stood and backed away from the table, turning green. Harry turned and peered around Ron at a very smug-looking Hermione. 
\par \'93Didn\rquote t you hear me say to her that you can\rquote t just hex anyone who displeases you?\'94 he said, feeling a bit irked, as he\rquote d really been looking forward to the pie. 
\par \'93Oh, did I hex }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 she said in mock-surprise. \'93I though I hexed }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 your pie}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . It\rquote 
s not exactly the same thing, now, is it?\'94 she added with wide-eyed innocence before turning to eat her bread pudding. 
\par Ron helped himself to a slice of cake, shaking his head at the pair of them. \'93I don\rquote t know...Is it going to be up to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 to get the Head Boy and Head Girl to behave themselves? Who would have thought, six years ago, that of the three of us, I\rquote d be the one most likely to be mistaken for an }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 adult}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par But that thought was so ridiculous that everyone in hearing range suddenly erupted into laughter, and with a mouth full of cake, Ron looked about at them all, saying, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Wha}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 --?
\'94 in such a thoroughly bewildered way that it only served to further fuel their laughter. Even the greenish Orion was laughing, and at the Gryffindor table, dinner ended in general hilarity.

Mariah, in place of the Ravenclaw fifth-year, Tamara Katz. He wouldn\rquote 
t be starting until eleven thirty, so he had ample opportunity to tell Ron and Hermione, sitting around the fire in the Gryffindor common room, about what Sirius had told him when they were traveling to and from Wales for his Quidditch practice. 
\par Harry had started off showing Sirius the article from the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Times,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  but Sirius had put up his hand to stop him, saying, \'93Look at the photograph.\'94 
\par Harry peered at the picture accompanying the article; he no longer found Muggle photographs very interesting, since they didn\rquote t move, and he hadn\rquote 
t really paid it much attention. Now he saw that a dark-haired man standing not five feet away from Rodney Jeffries, in a crowd of admirers, was Sirius himself. 
\par \'93That\rquote s you! But what--\'94 
\par \'93I\rquote m only teaching part-time, Harry, remember. What do you think I\rquote ve been doing with myself? There are two other operatives keeping an eye on Jeffries, as well. I have to tell you, though, so far, he seems too good to be true. It\rquote 
s also true that there\rquote s a magical signature in the area every time he\rquote s done a show; it\rquote s like he\rquote s activating all of the magical genes in }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 everyone}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 who\rquote s coming to see him, but in a sort of benign and }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 generous}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  way. I can\rquote t describe it. He makes everyone 
feel better about themselves, and people who are ill feel better as well, but from what I can tell, they\rquote re sort of making }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 themselves}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  better, he\rquote 
s releasing a power in them so that they have control over their own bodies in a way they didn\rquote t before. Maybe he\rquote s causing their bodies to secrete a certain hormone or something. I don\rquote t know what he\rquote 
s doing, precisely. We haven\rquote t encountered any more situations in which he\rquote s creating more wizards and witches, like your aunt. Technically, since Muggles look on what he\rquote s doing as an article of faith, the Ministry isn\rquote 
t classifying it as magic, as something that needs to be covered up with Memory Charms. Apparently there }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 are}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Muggles who\rquote ve done similar things in the past, without }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 technically}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  performing magic. There are things about it in the archives at the Ministry. And he genuinely seems to be helping people....\'94 
\par Harry had nodded, his lips drawn into a line. It would have been a perfect time to tell Sirius about Jeffries healing him at St. Mungo\rquote s, but since he sti
ll suspected Jeffries of being up to something, he refrained from doing so. How could he justify being suspicious of someone who had healed him? He felt petty and small for not being full of gratitude to Jeffries and singing his praises at every turn, as 
his Aunt Petunia tended to do, but he just couldn\rquote t bring himself to do this. He still thought there was something very not-right about Jeffries. 
\par \'93You\rquote re not being--being taken in by him, are you?\'94 Harry said cautiously. Sirius looked thoughtful. 
\par \'93I\rquote m not sure that\rquote s how I\rquote d put it. I\rquote m not completely convinced the Ministry }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 shouldn\rquote t}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  be concerned, so we\rquote 
re observing him and trying to determine his motivation, but I have to say, Harry, that I\rquote m starting to suspect that he\rquote s the least of our problems. We still need to get access to Gringotts and bring some life back to Diagon Alley. There
\rquote s a very real danger at this point that the wizarding economy will never recover from the Diagon Alley attack. Dumbledore has some other people working on that problem, but I\rquote m starting to feel like I\rquote m on a bit of a holiday when I
\rquote m watching Jeffries, when I could actually be doing something useful if I were working on the Gringotts project.\'94 Harry had no response to that; he knew as well as anyone that the inflation in the 
wizarding world had hit crisis levels and that most people were buying anything they could from Muggles with Muggle money these days, instead of from wizards using wizarding money. 
\par \'93And what\rquote s this I hear about you turning your snake into a girl because you\rquote re desperate, Harry?\'94 
\par Harry groaned. \'93That\rquote s not why. Look, it\rquote s all your fault anyway. You\rquote re the one who gave me that book about doing magic with snakes.\'94 
\par Sirius laughed out loud. \'93My fault! Who told you to turn your snake into a girl? And anyway, you\rquote ve had that book for nearly two-and-a-half years and never got into trouble with it before.\'94 
\par Harry rubbed his hand over his face wearily. \'93I never cast any of the spells in it before...\'94 
\par Hermione was able, in turn, to tell him and Ron about what she and Maggie and Snape had discovered about the tunnels in the dungeons. \'93We found it!\'94 she said excitedly, her face glowing in the firelight as the two of them leaned in so she wouldn
\rquote t have to speak very loudly; they were all sitting on the hearth rug, very close to the fire. \'93It\rquote s }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 amazing}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
. We followed it clear to the edge of the Forbidden Forest; it comes up above ground about fifty yards from Hagrid\rquote s, under that fallen chestnut tree that\rquote s been rotting away all these years.\'94 
\par \'93How do you get the tree off the exit, then?\'94 Ron wondered. 
\par It\rquote s not really }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 on}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  the exit, it\rquote s obscuring most of it, though. And it\rquote 
s really like a rabbit warren down there. We could have been quite lost for ages if Maggie hadn\rquote 
t been leading us through. She just had these premonitions about which way we should go. We also used the Four-Points Charm more than a few times, to work out where we were. Terribly confusing. And there are times when it looks like a dead end but it rea
lly isn\rquote t; the continuation of the tunnel is around a sharp corner or under a hole in the wall that\rquote s obscured by a stone....\'94 
\par Harry was shaking his head. \'93That may explain how Lucius Malfoy got Draco and Ron out of the castle in our fifth year, but that can\rquote t be the tunnel Draco and Mariah used last night. The tunnel they used didn\rquote 
t go near the forest; it looked like it went under the lake.\'94 
\par She shrugged. \'93Well, as I said, there\rquote s a huge network down there. The one they used must be one of the other branches we didn\rquote t take. We\rquote 
re probably lucky we found our way out again. The three of us were late to lunch and had to go to the kitchens for something to eat. We wanted to talk, in private, though, so we went up to Maggie\rquote s rooms with the food.\'94 She looked 
at Ron mischievously. \'93But you were right, Harry. Eventually, they }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 did}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  look like they wanted me out of there, like they wanted some }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
privacy}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , so I pleaded massive amounts of revision and left them alone. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 In Maggie\rquote s rooms,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 she added for emphasis, grinning 
mischievously at Ron. 
\par Ron had put his fingers in both ears and started singing the Chuddley Cannons\rquote  fight song rather too loudly. Harry grabbed a cushion he was leaning on and threw it at Ron. 
\par \'93Shut up, you. She\rquote s just winding you up,\'94 he grinned. 
\par Hermione shook her head. \'93It\rquote s }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 far}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  too easy, you know,\'94 she said, also grinning. But then she and Ron had these }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 looks}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  on their faces that suddenly made him feel like }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 he}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  was in the same room with two people who wanted him to disappear.... 
\par There wasn\rquote t anyone e
lse in the common room now, so he excused himself, going up the stairs to the dorms, stopping on the landing outside the third-year dorm. The door was open and the boys were playing Exploding Snap. Harry thought that looked like a good opportunity to enga
ge in an activity that wouldn\rquote t let him fall asleep, and he popped his head in, asking whether he could join them. Will grinned and invited him in, while the other boys looked nervous. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Harry Potter, the Head Boy, was going to play cards with them.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  After a w
hile, though, they had relaxed and were even teasing him for the end of his nose being slightly singed. They were, however, all yawning by eleven o\rquote 
clock, and Harry suggested they turn in. Will smiled and nodded at him before he left, and Harry went back down to the common room. 
\par Ron was in a chair near the fire. Hermione was curled on his lap, her eyes starting to look heavy-lidded as she gazed into the fire. Ron was fast asleep, snoring loudly. She lifted her head in surprise when she saw Harry. 
\par \'93He\rquote s been asleep for about twenty minutes,\'94 she whispered. \'93Totally knackered, poor thing,\'94 she added, pressing her lips to his brow before standing. \'93I\rquote m surprised you\rquote re still on your feet.\'94 
\par He shrugged. \'93I have to be, don\rquote t I, if I\rquote m to patrol with Mariah and try to get her to tell me about the tunnels, or her and Malfoy, or }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 something}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 remotely useful.\'94 They woke Ron with some effort so he could go up to the dorm and sleep in his own bed. Harry thought Hermione looked at him lying in his bed somewhat wistfully 
before she kissed him goodnight and left. Harry looked longingly at his own bed before leaving the dorm again; if he took a short nap, it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 wouldn\rquote t}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 be short, he knew, and he had to be downstairs to patrol in less than half-an-hour, with Mariah Kirkner. 
\par As 
he walked down the stairs and corridors to the entrance hall, an image of her from the Omnioculars came unbidden into his brain; although Hermione had been quite uninhibited at times when they were still having a physical relationship, Mariah was--well, s
he was the most sensual thing he\rquote d ever seen, and he was growing increasingly unsure that anyone in their right mind could blame Draco Malfoy for not resisting her... 
\par Professors Sprout and Trelawney had been on the first shift; McGonagall and Sinistra were
 taking over. Trixie Lewis and Ernie MacMillan turned up next, to sign off for the night, followed by Draco Malfoy and Tony Perugia. Mariah was already there, and Harry saw Malfoy glaring at her. He spoke to her softly while the other newcomers entered th
e hall, Kurt Harrison from Ravenclaw and Robert Jensen, from Slytherin, both fifth years. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I thought you said you were switching to the first shift}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 Harry thought he heard Malfoy say to Mariah, his lips barely moving. Harry realized that Hermione must hav
e told each of them the wrong thing, so they wouldn\rquote t be on together again, allowing Harry to get Mariah alone to pump her for information. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I thought you were switchin\rquote  to the saicont}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 she replied, twirling her hair nonchalantly, looking at Professor McGonagall as though fascinated by her. Harry wasn
\rquote t certain that her lips had moved at }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 all}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  (although it took him a moment to realize that she\rquote d said \'93the second\'94
). She wore those soft leather fingerless gloves on her hands again. Harry realized that, for all that he\rquote d been wondering about those gloves, when he\rquote d seen her in the Omnioculars without them, he hadn\rquote 
t exactly felt moved to refocus on her hands, look at them in close-up so that he could learn the reason for the gloves. He had, unfortunately, been somewhat distracted by the rest of her body.... 
\par \'93I\rquote ll patrol with Mariah,\'94 Harry told Professor McGonagall, who now knew about the reason for Harry\rquote s alarm the previous evening. He jumped in before he could be paired up with one of the fifth years. McGona
gall nodded at him. Mariah looked at Harry, her eyes glittering with--}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 what}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? Harry had seen that look before, in Hermione\rquote s and Katie\rquote 
s eyes, and when Alicia had cornered him in the Quidditch changing rooms to ask him to the ceilidh....For that matter, Mariah had looked very much like that when }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 she\rquote d}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 asked him to the ceilidh, and when he\rquote d encountered her in the corridor to the girls\rquote  Slytherin dorms in his other life. He had only one word for it: 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Lust.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Harry swallowed. He felt his pulse racing as he recalled how difficult it had been to pull away from her, when he\rquote d been standing near her in her thin nightdress. He shook himself as he followed her up the marble stairs, more image
s coming into his brain, images from the night before, Mariah writhing in the heat of passion.... 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Stop it,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he commanded his brain. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I love Ginny, I love Ginny,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought repeatedly. }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 That\rquote s the point--to get her away from Malfoy...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par But it was becoming inc
reasingly difficult to remember that that was the point of the exercise when he was near her, his head spinning, his body rebelliously responding to her presence. Harry practically shook from the war being waged within him, a war for control and dominance
. The trouble was, he was starting to think that there was no way for him to lose, that no matter what happened, he\rquote d come out a winner.... 
\par More than an hour had passed, and they were in the corridor leading to the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom, 
where Remus Lupin had taught him to conjure a Patronus and Barty Crouch put him under Imperius and he learned that he was stronger than that, that he-- 
\par He couldn\rquote t take it any longer; his head was screaming that he had to have her, that he had to touch he
r, and he grabbed her shoulders, whirling her to face him, wondering if this was how Ron felt on the night before the full moon. Before he could say or do anything, however, she had taken one look at him and smiled triumphantly, taking his sweating hand i
n her cool gloved one and dragging him after her. 
\par \'93Come with me,\'94 she said simply, as though he could do anything else, as though he wouldn\rquote t follow her to the ends of the earth. They went down, down, down into the dungeons, then along the passages that He
rmione had told him and Ron led to the tunnel they\rquote d taken to the forest. He thought he would throw her down on the ground at any second as they wound through the tunnels, but he went on, following her, unsure how many turns they\rquote 
d taken or where they were going. The important thing, he thought, is that he was with her.... 
\par Finally, he heard an odd, watery sound in the passage ahead of them. There had been magical torches on the walls the entire time they were in the tunnels; the torches sprang to life as s
oon as they moved to within about twenty feet. Now he saw that the walls of the tunnel they were in had a strange light reflecting on them. The walls were damp stone, and the light danced on the stone in a peculiar way, making Harry frown. When they turne
d
 the corner, he saw the reason for the odd light; they were in an underground cavern which was a hidden entrance to the lake. He could see that the cavern ended about thirty feet away, a wall of stone that went down into the water. They were in a kind of 
air bubble with an underground harbor, the water lapping at their feet. Harry had no doubt that if they went in and swam past the stone wall, they could then go up and up until they reached the surface of the lake, outside in the frigid autumn night.

A thousand years ago, the four greatest witches and wizards of the age fled north from persecution to found a school for young witches and wizards where they could learn about their abilities and hone their
 craft far from prying eyes and free of the peculiar prejudices of Muggle society. Here, in the Grampian Highlands, they found a beautiful valley with a glistening loch and a young forest nearby. They built a castle, very simple at first, with no moat but
 
the loch and no defenses but their magic, and a village grew up nearby, where those who worked on the castle lived with their families. The Founders named their school Hogwarts, and named the village Hogsmeade. They sought out magical children from all ov
e
r Britain, bringing them to the school to learn about who they were and what they could do. The population of the school grew and grew as they found more and more magical children, and the population of Hogsmeade grew as well, as more and more witches and
 wizards learned of the refuge in the north where they could be safe and live peacefully. 
\par The forest offered only a light barrier, however, between the school and the Muggles who lived on the other side of the forest, and soon all four of the Hogwarts foun
ders had met Muggles whom they loved and wanted to marry. Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff had fallen in love with two brothers; they were wed in a double ceremony in the newly-erected village hall, and the entire village of Hogsmeade turned out to c
e
lebrate with them, as well as many Muggles from the other side of the forest. The party lasted for a week. At the celebration, Godric Gryffindor and Salazar Slytherin met twin sisters, childhood friends of the grooms. Each fell in love with one of the sis
ters, and soon another double wedding was being planned. 
\par Gryffindor had a wonderful idea for gifts for their brides; they would each commission the village smith to fashion a protective amulet, a gold alloy for Gryffindor\rquote s bride, a silver alloy for Slytherin\rquote s. 
\par The gold-colored amulet would be in the form of a golden griffin, which was Gryffindor\rquote s Animagus form and the reason for the surname he had taken; no one in his family had previously borne more than one name. When
 the wearer clasped the amulet, a feeling of calm would come over her, and she would feel her courage increase and know that she was loved. 
\par The silver-colored amulet would be in the form of a basilisk, the king of snakes, as Slytherin was a Parselmouth an
d bore a snake on his coat of arms and as the symbol of his house, at the school. In addition to the feeling of love and calm that would come over the wearer of the amulet when she clasped it, Slytherin enchanted the metal of which the amulet was made so 
that, if she was truly in love with someone, she would be able to see that person clearly in her mind\rquote 
s eye, and know that he was safe--and faithful. He never wanted his bride to wonder whether he truly loved her, nor whether he was safe while traveling around Britain, seeking out students under the noses of sometimes-hostile Muggles. 
\par The smith worked on creating molds for the amulets; Slytherin\rquote s would be carved with magic from the blackest, hardest rock that could be found, and Gryffindor\rquote s would be carve
d from the purest, hardest white marble. No human tools could carve with the precision of magic, no Muggle craft could begin to approximate the beauty of the work executed by the wizard smith. When it was time to pour the metal into the molds, Gryffindor 
put his magic into the gold metal, and Slytherin enchanted the silver metal, and when they had cooled, the smith opened the molds to reveal two perfect amulets, two perfect gifts for their brides. 
\par Gryffindor presented his gift to his betrothed, and she loved it, but her sister was jealous; Slytherin had not given her the amulet he\rquote d made for her yet, so she thought he wasn\rquote 
t as fine a catch as Gryffindor. Plus, she had wanted to be with Godric Gryffindor when the sisters had first met him and his friend, bu
t she had settled for Slytherin. Even though she had agreed to marry Salazar, she still pined for Gryffindor, believing that her sister had made the better match, and when she saw the beautiful golden griffin amulet he had given her, she formed a plan to 
win him from her sister. 
\par While her sister slept, she took the golden amulet from her and put it on, and went to see Gryffindor in his quarters at the castle, a luxurious suite draped with red hangings and warmly lit with magical torches. She seduced him, b
ut he believed her to be his betrothed, as she wore the amulet he had given her. However, Slytherin had still not given his betrothed her amulet; he had been quite taken with it when the stone was opened and its craft was revealed to him. He had taken to 
wearing it himself, holding it tightly whenever he wanted to see his beloved, the woman he was to marry. He still planned to give it to her, but he wanted to wait until their wedding night. 
\par The night that his betrothed met Gryffindor and seduced him, he held the amulet as he lay in his bed, and he saw the two of them together, saw them coupling against the blood red background of Gryffindor\rquote 
s suite. He knew it was not her sister he was seeing, even though they were twins; the amulet would only show him the 
woman he loved. He vowed vengeance on both her and Gryffindor, who had been close as a brother to him. He did not tell his bride or his friend what he knew. 
\par More than month went by, and the morning of their wedding day dawned. Slytherin went down to the s
hore of the loch with the black stone and the amulet; he held it one last time, seeing the woman he still loved. However, now he also hated her. It is possible to both love and hate the same person, you know. Weeping for a life he would never know, he put
 
the amulet back into its stone mold and sealed it with magic, then flung it deep into the lake. He spoke to some water snakes and told them what it was, and asked them to tell the merpeople to look after it and to someday give it to someone who needed it,
 at their discretion. 
\par He went to the village hall with Gryffindor; they were both arrayed in their wedding finery, and their brides were waiting for them. However, after the brides\rquote  father brought them to be wed, Slytherin had just reached for his wand, to
 wreak his vengeance, when his bride brought the proceedings to a halt and demanded that they speak in a side chamber, just the four of them. They moved to the chamber, and she revealed that she had a mark of passion that Gryffindor had left on her neck j
ust a fortnight earlier, when she\rquote d gone to him again. As they had already coupled, and she claimed that she was carrying his child, she said by rights she should be the one to marry Gryffindor. 
\par Godric Gryffindor and his intended bride were shocked; he had had no idea that it wasn\rquote t his betrothed who had shared his bed, and she was furious with her sister for stealing her love. She admitted that she hadn\rquote 
t come to meet him, to sleep with him, that it must have been her sister, even though to lie would have 
put an end to it. She and Godric both knew that he should do his duty and marry the mother of his child, so, weeping, they both accepted their lot and agreed that Gryffindor would wed Slytherin\rquote s bride and Slytherin would wed Gryffindor\rquote s. 

\par However--Salazar Slytherin had another idea. 
\par \'93Duplicitous Muggle!\'94 he roared at his betrothed. \'93I saw you with him! I used the amulet which you shall never have; it is now at the bottom of the loch. But do not think you are getting off so easily! As you have had two fac
es in this affair, so shall you have two faces evermore, and your children, and your children\rquote s children, until the end of the world!\'94 
\par And he cursed her and changed her. Gryffindor and his bride were appalled; her sister wept over her, even though she had
 betrayed her and tried to steal her husband. For flopping on the floor at their feet was a sleek brown seal, in deep distress at the lack of water around her. 
\par Slytherin left. 
\par Gryffindor and his bride took her poor sister up north, keeping her as wet as 
possible on the way, and released her into the sea, which was now to be her home. The couple returned to Hogsmeade and wed quietly, and Gryffindor continued to run the school with the other two other Founders. Slytherin did not appear at the school for ma
n
y months, although he regularly continued to send students to the school. However, in his travels around Britain, he only sought out magical children whose parents were also magical. Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff finally noticed this and summoned h
im back to the castle to discuss it. 
\par They insisted that the school should take all magical children regardless of whether their parents were magical, but Slytherin declared that all Muggles and their children were untrustworthy and in turn didn\rquote t trust mag
ical people, so it would be far safer to keep them out of Hogwarts. The others disagreed vehemently; after all, each of them had wed a Muggle. Only Slytherin had been betrayed by one. 
\par The school returned to admitting magical children from all backgrounds,
 but Slytherin knew he could not tolerate this any longer, and he finally left. Legend says he went to France, but no one knows for sure, and those tales belong to another story, another time.... 
\par More than ten years later, a mysterious woman accompanied h
er son to the school after he received a letter inviting him to study at Hogwarts. She remained at the castle for the sorting ceremony, and saw that he became a Gryffindor. Godric noticed the lone, hooded figure standing in the rear of the hall, and he as
ked his wife to go to her and offer her a place at their table. When his wife reached the woman, she threw back her hood and revealed that she was the twin sister who had been cursed by Slytherin. The two sisters embraced in joy, for Gryffindor\rquote 
s wife thought she was never to see her twin again. 
\par \'93The curse has been lifted!\'94 she said to her sister in delight. But her sister shook her head. 
\par \'93No. I am still cursed, and my children, too. But the curse is not what you think it is. He did not change me into a seal, but a selkie. I have never ceased to have a human\rquote 
s mind, even as I swam in the cold sea and fled from whales and sharks and the spears of men. 
\par \'93But sometimes, I felt the need to shed my sealskin and stretch my legs on the shore, to walk as a woman on
ce again, and one of these times, when I was close to giving birth to my son, a man who knows about these things found my selkie skin and took it, and by so doing, he took my soul and I was enslaved to him. 
\par \'93However--what he did not realize was that he wa
s actually my slave. A selkie can make men do things that a mere woman cannot. I had a power over him that even he has never suspected. I am empowered to do almost anything except make him give me my skin and my freedom back. 
\par \'93So, we wed. And soon after, my son was born, the son of Godric Gryffindor. There he sits, in his father\rquote 
s own school, as he should be, and now that I have returned what I have stolen, I give him into the care of his father and relinquish my rights to him. I have a daughter who carrie
s my curse and shall give it to her children as well, and I must return to her. Tell my son that I love him, but now it is his father\rquote s turn....\'94 
\par And with that, she left. Her sister could not convince her to stay. She gazed at her nephew, who looked like 
the son she might have had with Gryffindor. They were happy; they had three healthy daughters. But she knew men, and they were rather silly about wanting sons. Well--now her husband had one. 
\par She went to her husband and told him that it was his own son who had come to the school at last, and he wept for joy, and then sorrow, when his wife told him of her sister\rquote 
s life as a selkie held prisoner by her husband. They raised the boy, having him live with them even during school holidays, and the son of one of the other founders, Rowena Ravenclaw, was one of his best friends. 
\par After he finished school, he and his friend traveled north, to see his mother, whom he missed. He hadn\rquote t seen her since he started school at Hogwarts. He had written to her by owl post and 
she had written back with directions. When he and his friend arrived, his friend was immediately smitten by Gryffindor\rquote 
s half-sister. She fell in love with him as well, and did not need to be enslaved, but gave him her selkie skin of her own free will, whi
ch meant that she could also leave whenever she wished. When a selkie gives her skin of her own volition, out of love, she is not owned. 
\par Young Gryffindor enjoyed visiting with his mother and sister; he used his own selkie skin to swim in the sea with his 
sister, having never known the freedom of leaping through the wild waves in the open sea, just the tame loch at the school. He knew, however, that unlike his sister\rquote 
s children, his would not be selkies, for only the daughters in the family would carry on that curse from generation to generation. 
\par He left his friend there to wed and live with his sister, but before he left, he broke into his stepfather\rquote s secret hiding place and stole back his mother\rquote s selkie skin for her, freeing her. He swam with her back t
o the mainland, and his sister and best friend waved to them from the shore, about to begin their new life together. 
\par Their children were, of course, magic
al, having a wizard for a father. When their children were old enough, they sent them to Hogwarts, and it is a peculiar thing that, in this family, for generations afterward, all of the boys were sorted into Ravenclaw, but all of the girls became Slytheri
ns, and were known for their cleverness and womanly wiles. In each generation, there was at least one girl, so the selkie traits were guaranteed to be passed on again and again and again....

\par \'93Right,\'94 he said, in a daze. He felt so shocked by all of this he wasn\rquote t responding very well, he knew. \'93And you--you\rquote re--\'94 He couldn\rquote t get out the words }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 You\rquote re a selkie.}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  His head was swimming; he was so confused. \'93But--you don\rquote t }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 always}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  wear those gloves....\'94 
\par She shook her head. \'93Me mither trimmed the waibbing when I was wee. I still do it, but there\rquote s always a time when it grows back and I have ta wait. Then I wear the gloves. If ever\rquote one knew...they\rquote 
d think I was a freak. So I hide it.\'94 
\par Harry grimaced, thinking of his scar. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 There was no hiding that, not really.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  \'93I understand,\'94 he said simply. \'93
And you--you can--can attract men when you want to. Like veelas can.\'94 
\par She nodded. \'93Me brither can, too. Attract women, that is. Oh, he was an awful playboy at school. It becomes easier fer a sailkie, male or female, after aboot the age o\rquote  fifteen or sixteen. It\rquote s stronger.\'94 
\par He frowned in thought. \'93How\rquote d he get the amulet?\'94 
\par Her eyes widened. \'93Aye, the amulet. See, after You-Know-Who\rquote s power broke--after }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  defeated\rquote im--there was a gaineral sweep in the wizardin\rquote 
 wairld. Anyone who\rquote d bin in Slytherin in school was suspected o\rquote havin\rquote  bin a Daith Eater. Me mum lost\rquote er job, and we faill on hard times. Me dad wasn\rquote  makin\rquote  vairy much, and we had some daibts to Gringotts....
\'94 Harry\rquote s mind worked quickly, figuring it out. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 In my other life, Voldemort never fell, so his mother never lost her job, and Mariah\rquote 
s brother never felt particularly compelled to go into the lake, seeking the amulet, so it was still there when I rescued Ginny from the lake...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par She sighed. \'93The laigend o\rquote the amulet has been handed doon in our family. Mithers \lquote ave bin taillin\rquote  their wee ones the story feraiver, it seems....\'94
 Harry could picture them, looking like Mariah with their wild dark hair and large, soulful eyes,
 whispering the tale to small, pale, upturned faces gathered round the hearth, while the winter winds scoured the exterior of a stone cottage on a bleak and rocky shore.... \'93After a time, I think parts o\rquote  the story were considered maybe t
\rquote  be invainted by some o\rquote  those who told it. Embroiderin\rquote  on it, ye see, like all oral traditions. To liven it oop. Each gaineration puttin\rquote  their mark on it, like. But Munro believed the pairt aboot the amulet, an\rquote  
\lquote e took it into \lquote is haid to go into the loch to try \lquote n\rquote  gait it, as \lquote e raickoned it\rquote d be daid valuable--if it were real. He used \lquote is sailkie charms on the merking\rquote s daughter--it don\rquote

\par \'93I was only four; Munro\rquote s a dozen years older than me. I\rquote ll naiver fergait whain me mum opened it--it was like a dream, like actually gaittin\rquote  t \lquote see Cinderailla\rquote

der the hearth, where we kaipt our few traisures, and I thought it was safe and hidden....But a little while later, Munro gave me parents a pile of Galleons and wouldn\rquote  say where he\rquote d got it. They were so wairried he\rquote d done somethin
\rquote  that\rquote d land \lquote im in prison, but he swore \lquote e didn\rquote . An\rquote  it hailped us go on, t\rquote survive until me mither found wairk again....\'94 
\par She sighed and looked down at her webbing. \'93He musta sold it. Maybe me mum \lquote n\rquote  dad even knew \lquote e did it, and didn\rquote  lait on t\rquote me. But he shouldnae done it. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I\rquote m}{

\'94 
\par He nodded. \'93Ginny bought it in Knockturn Alley,\'94 he said softly 
\par She lifted her face to him, her brow furrowed. \'93But how did she afford it? The gold Munro got fer it--I\rquote d naiver seen that much in one place b\rquote fore or since--\'94 
\par He thought about the question of how Ginny had afforded it, and this caused him to think about some of the other things he\rquote d seen in Borgin and Burkes, when he\rquote d accidentally landed there the first time he\rquote 
d used Floo powder (he suddenly realized that that was not long before Lucius Malfoy gave Tom Riddle\rquote 
s diary to Ginny, in Flourish and Blotts--he must have been carrying it while he was in Borgin and Burkes....). As he eavesdropped from a cupboard in the dusty dark magic shop, he\rquote d been able to find out a
bout some of the objects in the inventory there...the Hand of Glory....a cursed opal necklace...and now he tried to work out what might have happened. \'94Perhaps someone else bought the amulet before Ginny,\'94
 he said slowly, still formulating his theory. \'93A lot of someone elses. Perhaps it caused those people as much trouble as it caused Slytherin, so they returned it, and the shopkeeper had to keep reducing the price....\'94 
\par She laughed, somewhat bitterly. \'93Aye, he could prob\rquote ly make a lot more on a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 cairsed}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  amulet than one that wasn\rquote t...\'94 She could see Harry was baffled. \'93Lait
\rquote s just say I\rquote ve heard }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 things}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  about Borgin and Burkes. Ye buy something there and bring it back in--ye don\rquote 
t gait yer money back. Ye gait store craidit fer saiventy-five paircent of what ye paid. Now, Ginny may have bin able to afford it \lquote cause it was reduced after bein\rquote  brought back time an\rquote  again, but that don\rquote 
t mean Borgin and Burkes didn\rquote t make quite a lot on it....\'94 
\par There was something still bothering Harry, though. \'93What }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  still don\rquote t understand how Draco didn\rquote t drown when he was in the lake with you. I mean, }{

\par \'93As long as he was touchin\rquote me, he was safe. When yer in the water with a magical water creature, all ye need to do is be touchin\rquote em to be safe.\'94 Harry\rquote s brain lit up with another revelation from his other life. }{

 her from the creature that was spawned from the basilisk\rquote s egg with her hair in it--it was a magical underwater creature, and being touched by it meant that she could breath underwater! Even though it was trying to kill her...}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  He smiled to himself at the irony. 
\par Mariah spread her hands again, staring at them as though this was a luxury, something she did not normally do. Then she looked up at Harry, her gaze very frank. \'93Did ye naiver--do--something--with one o\rquote 
 yer gairlfrainds underwater? In the prefaicts\rquote  bathroom, pairhaps?\'94 
\par Harry felt himself flush as he remembered being with Hermione there--but they hadn\rquote t technically been }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 doing}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 anything while underwater. Slowly, the realization hit him, and he dropped his jaw, his eyes widening. \'93You were--were sleeping with Draco Malfoy }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 underwater}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par She laughed wickedly, looking very pleased with herself. \'93No. We wair wide awake,\'94 she said, her voice dripping with amusement. Her dark eyes glittered and a mischievous grin still curled around the edges of her mouth. 
\par Harry swallowed, remembering how he\rquote d felt when she was doing her best to attract him, the feeling of losing his mind and being a complete and utter slave to his hormones. He hesitated before asking, but finally said, \'93
Did you use your--your selkie charms to get Draco Malfoy to do that?\'94 He wasn\rquote t sure he wanted to hear the answer. 
\par She stopped smiling and looked very serious suddenly. \'93No,\'94 she said, her voice firm. \'93He coulda gone at any time. I swear it. I didn\rquote  want to gait him that way. This--with you--this was the fairst time I aiver--aiver tried that. I--I didn
\rquote t realize how much it wood affaict ye, Harry. I\rquote m sorry, really. Ye looked like ye were goin\rquote  mad. I didn\rquote t plan to torture ye nor anythin\rquote ...\'94 
\par He wasn\rquote t sure what to believe, and shook his head in bewilderment. \'93They--then why did you do it to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? You love }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{

\par Mariah lifted her chin. \'93I\rquote m not stupid. I know she loves ye, and the only reason she don\rquote t leave Draco is \lquote cause she\rquote s afraid he\rquote ll hairt ye. I don\rquote  know who she thinks she\rquote s foolin\rquote .\'94
 Well, Harry thought, I was certainly fooled for a good long time. \'93Aye, he loves \lquote er. More\rquote n he loves me. I know that.\'94 Her voice was softer, sadder now. \'93But I think that cood change. He hates\rquote er, too, fer not feelin

\par Harry swallowed. \'93Have--have you and Draco talked about this?\'94 
\par She shook her haid. \'93He won\rquote t. Refuses. So--I thought, maybe if }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 she}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  thought it was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

\par Harry gasped. \'93You }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 wanted}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Ginny to see me in the amulet? With you? Naked?\'94
 His head spun. Here he thought he and Ron were the only ones trying to break up Draco and Ginny, when Mariah had a plan of her own to accomplish the same end. 
\par She shrugged. \'93Draco being with me don\rquote t make\rquote er jailous. Hacked off, aye, she\rquote s hacked off aboot it. Has \lquote er pride, like anyone. But \lquote er love fer you\rquote s stronger than that, and I kin taill she don\rquote

\par But Harry wished she\rquote d come to him and explained that she had the same goal, so they could have cooperated on a plan--a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 different}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 plan. He hated to think how Ginny would react if she\rquote d been holding the amulet when he and Mariah had been all over each other. The glare she received confirmed that no gratitude would be forthcoming. \'93I just hope to hell that Ginny }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 didn\rquote t}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  see that little display, that she wasn\rquote t touching her amulet! How stupid! If anything, it would be more likely to make her }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 stay}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  with Draco Malfoy! How could you--you--\'94 He sputtered to a stop, at a loss for words. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Stupid stupid stupid.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Mariah shrugged. \'93I think I\rquote m right,\'94 she said calmly, with a trace of smugness. \'93We\rquote ll see.\'94 
\par And she casually stood and put her robes back on over her dress, walking out of the passage, leaving Harry to grab his robes and follow her, so he wouldn\rquote t be lost. 
\par They barely spoke the entire time they continued patrolling. It was disconcerting to continue to be in her presence until two in the morning; despite his best intentions, it was very difficult }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to keep picturing her down in the tunnel again, her skin glistening in the torchlight, her warm breath in his mouth, and on top of that, he still had the images from the Omnioculars in his head (although he hadn
\rquote t looked at it since he\rquote d used them). 
\par At length, they went back to the entrance hall and met the patrollers for the third shift. From what he could tell, no one suspected what he and Mariah had been up to in the tunnels. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
No wonder she and Draco Malfoy get away with this all the time,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought. 
\par Filch and Flitwick were the staff patrollers for the third shift; Filch eyed Harry suspiciously (he\rquote d reacted this way to Harry since his first year, and particularly his second, when he was convinced that Harry had petrified his cat), but 
Flitwick gave Harry his usual bubbly greeting, sounding just a little more tired than he usually did in class. Hermione was on this shift; she descended the broad steps with Karl Fauth, one of the new fifth-year Gryffindor prefects, who was yawning alertl
y
, following her steps and treading on the hem of her robes more than once, making her scowl tiredly. A couple of Ravenclaws who had walked down with Flitwick rounded out the new group, and Harry nodded at Hermione as he trudged up the steps to Gryffindor 
Tower; then he turned back to look at her. She was scowling at }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 instead of Fauth now, and he longed to go back to ask her why, but she and the others were moving off to begin their patrolling. He couldn\rquote t remember when Hermione had looked }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 less}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  happy with him. If he didn\rquote t know better, he would think he was about to be on the receiving end of a very nasty Head Girl hex. 
\par He entered the common room wearily, looking forward to getting some rest before the match the following day, hoping he wouldn\rquote t see Mariah when he closed his eyes.... The match wasn\rquote 
t until the afternoon, so he could sleep late. In fact, he reckoned it would be better for him to play only an hour or two after rising rather than get up early and spend the morning doing }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 things}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  before playing; he wouldn\rquote t have as much time to tire himself out before the game. 
\par But the sight that met his eyes in the common room made him stop in his tracks, frozen just inside the portrait hole. Ron was standing near the windows with his sister in his arms; she wa
s clasping him about his waist and had her face buried on his chest; she was sobbing her heart out, and Harry swallowed, feeling his own heart break. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
She had seen. She had touched the amulet at precisely the wrong time, and she had seen....}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Hermione knew, too, he realized. She must have found out before she left the common room to go patrolling. That was why she
\rquote d been looking at him }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  way.... 
\par His heart constricted within him, and he wanted to go to her, make it all right, but she was clinging desperate
ly to Ron and his feet seemed to be rooted to the spot where he stood. Ron looked up and saw him; thankfully, he did not scowl and frown at Harry, but looked merely baffled. Over Ginny\rquote 
s head, his best friend and brother of the girl he loved mouthed the words, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 What happened?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Ginny hadn\rquote t told him then; perhaps she\rquote d told Hermione, sobbed on her, then Hermione went to get Ron to take over when Hermione had to leave. Harry hit himself on his head; he wished he could do it harder. It didn\rquote 
t hurt enough. He mouthed the words }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I\rquote m stupid,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to Ron. 
\par Ron exaggerated the movements of his mouth, silently responding, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I know. But what happened?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Harry resisted the urge to stick his tongue out at him. Harry looked at Ginny, weeping as though it were the end of the world, and couldn\rquote 
t help the tears that started escaping his own eyes, running freely down his face. Ron noticed. As he patted his sister\rquote s back and rocked her back and forth, he again moved his mouth exaggeratedly, his silent question becoming, }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Harry, what the hell happened?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Harry wiped his eyes under his glasses, but his own tears wouldn\rquote t stop. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Oh, god}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . He\rquote d hurt her incredibly. This was the hurt he\rquote 
d been trying to spare her when he didn\rquote t tell her about Malfoy and Felice, since he\rquote d thought she was still in love with Draco Malfoy at the time. And now he\rquote d hurt her anyway. He couldn\rquote 
t stop himself from sniffling, and then, completely against his will, a sob escaped him and she whirled around. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Her eyes.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Oh, Ginny\rquote s eyes when she was wild with grief and wanting to die...He had never wanted to make her look that way, never imagined he could. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 That\rquote s not true,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 he reminded himself. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 She was also miserable when she realized that she might have gone to the Yule Ball with me, if she hadn\rquote t already accepted Neville\rquote s invitation.}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 But he had been too self-centered and depressed about Cho Chang at the time to pay much attention to her anguish, and although she had been upset then, running from the room in distress, this was a different degree of misery entirely.... 
\par He had no words, standing there facing her, tears streaming down both of their faces. He thought she would curse him, or swear at him, or fly at him and beat him with her fists, as she had at Ascog Castle. But instead, she took a few steps fo
rward and ripped the amulet from her neck, breaking the chain, and flung it onto the floor before her face collapsed again and she fled up the steps to the girls\rquote  dorms. 
\par When her footsteps had receded, Harry looked up at Ron, seeing that he\rquote d been crying in sympathy with his sister, not even knowing the cause of her distress. He wiped his face impatiently and finally spoke aloud. 
\par \'93Damn, Harry. Would you like to explain what that was all about?\'94 
\par Harry swallowed, his face still wet, everything around him slightly out of focus, even with his glasses on. \'93Not especially,\'94
 he croaked, although he wondered momentarily whether he could convince Ron to kill him, put him out of his misery....He looked at the amulet lying on the floor of the common room, and after 
what felt like an eternity, he finally stooped to pick it up. Holding it in his palm and then closing his hand around it for a few seconds, he received an immediate flash of Ginny, lying in her bed fully clothed, too grief-stricken to bother changing, hug
ging a pillow to her midsection and continuing to cry.... 
\par Putting the amulet in his pocket, he turned to climb the stairs to the dorm, not looking back. He remembered how Hermione had reacted to him and wondered whether he was going to lose his two best fr
iends as well as Ginny; it was pretty clear that once Ron knew the full story, they would both take her side. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 As they should,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought, condemning himself. The last time he
\rquote d felt so dreadful was when he\rquote d found out in his other life that Jamie had died, and Ginny too. He felt like he was reliving getting that awful news. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

\par \'93Why?\'94 Harry said groggily, rubbing his eyes. \'93What time is it?\'94 He looked toward the window; the sun was struggling to penetrate a thick, typically Scottish autumnal cloud cover.

\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , and now it was likely that even his stalwart die-hard supporters, like the Creevey brothers, would be cheering for England as well. (Although, to be fair, they }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 were}{

\par Sirius\rquote  search was finally successful, and he starting hurling Harry\rquote 
s Welsh uniform at him carelessly, not noticing where he was throwing things, so that Harry had to duck to avoid the rather hard and heavy shin-guards bashing him in the head. 
\par \'93Sirius! Watch it! I know you used to be a Beater, but I\rquote d rather wait until the match to start dodging Bludgers, if it\rquote s all the same to you.\'94 
\par Sirius laughed then and went to the door. \'93Get dressed like lightning, Harry. I had McGonagall get you a different Portkey on short notice, as the other one expired an hour ago. Most of the
 students who received permission to go have even left already. The last dozen were supposed to depart from the entrance hall with Professor McGonagall fifteen minutes ago. You and I are the last ones left in the castle who are going to be at the match to
day. Assuming you haven\rquote t changed your mind.\'94 
\par Harry was struggling into his jumper and buttoning his trousers at the same time, and his glasses went flying because of this. He sighed, exasperated, abruptly doing a summoning charm to get them back, as they had skidded under Ron\rquote 
s bed. Sirius raised his eyebrows and then nodded as Harry replaced them on his face. 
\par \'93Wandless. Impressive.\'94 
\par \'93Yeah, well it\rquote s one of my specialities. Remember the first task of the Tournament? Anyway, it would be a lot more useful if I could dress by doing a summoning charm.\'94 
\par Sirius shook his head, looking like he was trying not to laugh. \'93Don\rquote t try it. Your dad was good with summoning charms too, and tried that on his wedding day, because he was running ridiculously behind schedul

\par Harry frowned. \'93Um--you mean the cumberbund?\'94 
\par \'93That\rquote s it! He wound up with it wrapped around his head like a turban. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 told him he looked dashing that way, and ought to go through the ceremony wearing it on his head, but he threatened to demote me to mere groomsman and make Remus the best man if I came up with any more \lquote suggestions\rquote  like that....\'94 

\par Harry guffawed as he tied his shoes, grateful to Sirius for making him laugh, for relaxing him, just as he had probably relaxed his jittery father on his wedding day (threats to be demoted notwithstanding). }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Just think about the match. Just think about the match,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he told himself sternly. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 My bloody private life will have to be sorted out later. Right now--I\rquote ve got a job.}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Harry was ready with ten minutes to spare. He and Sirius went down to the common room and then out of the portrait hole to the corridor. Sirius already had his br
oom for him, and when the Portkey took effect five minutes later, Harry felt like he was being whacked on the head with the handle as they hurtled through space, the hook behind his navel pulling him toward a castle in Wales, toward his first professional
 Quidditch match. 
\par They landed in the Welsh changing rooms, which were deserted except for Owen, who looked wide-eyed and frantic at seeing Harry. 
\par \'93Harry! There the hell you are. Erica is all set to play, in case you didn\rquote t show! What were you thinking?\'94 
\par Harry sheepishly ran his hand through his hair. \'93Overslept,\'94 he said feebly. Owen looked at Sirius in disbelief. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Overslept}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 he said his voice squeaking at the end. Harry grimaced. 
\par \'93Sorry. Sirius got me here in time, though, right?\'94 he said hopefully. To his relief, Owen nodded at him. 
\par \'93Only just,\'94 he said grumpily. But he didn\rquote t have time to ream out Harry for tardiness. He immediately became all-business. \'93So Harry--how\rquote s your broom? Did you clean it yesterday? Trim the twigs?\'94 
\par Harry hadn\rquote t, he confessed, but after giving it a cursory examination, Owen declared, \'93It\rquote ll do,\'94
 in a slightly dejected voice, and then the three of them walked down the corridor leading to the grassy pitch. When he reached the arched stone doorway, he was completely unprepare
d for the sounds and sights which met him. Inside the changing rooms, the thick stone walls very effectively shut out the world. Now his ears were assaulted by the dull roar of a crowd that had to be fifty-thousand strong. Above this he heard a voice read
i
ng adverts for various wizarding products in a dull monotone, filling in the time before the match. All of the openings in the walls below the parapets had had their protective canvas coverings raised, like window shades, and he could see row upon row of 
s
pectators there ready to watch England play Wales, white banners with red crosses on one side, white and green banners with red dragons on the other. There were also people sitting in the stands that had been erected behind the parapets, high up on the ca
stle walls themselves, where Harry thought the best views were, even though those seats weren\rquote 
t sheltered from bad weather (should there be any). As he expected, there were numerous Aurors positioned amongst the spectators, as there had been at the game Har
ry had attended during the summer. They looked grim and business-like, and Harry tried not to think about the reason for their presence. 
\par He looked at the other Welsh players, waiting on the painfully-green pitch, wearing the same red jumper and trousers a
s him, the same half-white and half-green robes with the red dragon seeming to climb up the back. Then he glanced across the pitch at the English players, each one wearing a steel-grey jumper and trousers, topped by blindingly bright white robes with the 
r
ed cross of St. George on the back, as though they were all wearing armor and metal mail under voluminous capes, preparing to go off on one of the Crusades, or to fight at Agincourt. But for their weapons, they bore not longbows or heavy broadswords, but 
new state-of-the-art Jupiter 5000 brooms, all of them identically perfect down to the last straw, each gleaming like beacons in the grey autumn afternoon. Ron had told him about the new brooms--Ron could keep his, too, so he\rquote 
d have a beautiful new broom for playing on the house team, as well--but this was the first time Harry had seen them. He tried not to feel a pang of envy for those beautiful new brooms. 
\par Ron was the tallest one on the team, and Harry couldn\rquote t help notice that he looked more like a knight preparing himself for battle than any of the other English players. He\rquote 
d trimmed his red beard quite closely, although Harry knew it would probably grow noticeably during the match (it was only two days before the full moon) and somehow, this only added t
o the illusion that he was a knight from a bygone era about to go into battle, or the joust of his life, perhaps. 
\par Harry had never before gone into a Quidditch match feeling certain that he would lose, but he did so now. He felt utterly outclassed and inti
midated by the English team, with their gleaming new brooms, and it was almost his undoing completely when he saw Remus Lupin slap Ron on the back and grin at him before stepping to the sidelines. Harry ached; Sirius was truly the only one on his side. Ha
rry felt a pat on his shoulder and looked up to find his godfather grinning at him. 
\par \'93Don\rquote t you worry, Harry,\'94 he said. He could have been reading Harry\rquote s mind. Or maybe just picking up on some of his insecurities. \'93Just do what you do best to the best of your ability; no one can ask more of you.\'94 
\par Harry nodded nervously, his stomach flopping about disconcertingly. Sirius left him and the sound of the crowd swelled as they collectively perceived that the game was going to start. Then the world was a blur as 
he flew through the air with his teammates, demonstrating their flying skills, moving in formation along one side of the pitch while the English team flew on the other. A familiar voice read out the names of the English team as the fourteen fliers }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 whooshed}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  through the chilly air, ending with, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ...aaaaaand Weasley!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94
 The English team banked and turned, showing off even more, to the very loud approval of the crowd. The announcement of the Welsh players followed, and Harry seemed to have gone temporarily deaf until he heard his own name in the lineup--\'93}{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Potter!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 --followed by another roar of approval going up from the Welsh side when the list was done. That roar was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 something}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , it was comforting, but as far as he knew there was no one on the Welsh side that gave t
wo figs about him apart from Sirius, who was in the top box on that side, grinning and clapping continuously. As he flew, Harry glanced quickly down at the English side; Ron had gotten tickets in the top box there for Hermione and Ginny, and his older bro
thers were there too, along with his parents. Harry ached inside, thinking of Ginny crying on Ron last night....}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Don\rquote t think of Ginny,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 he told himself sternly. Even Maggie was there, although Harry didn\rquote t see Snape. The entire Weasley family had turned out for Ron, beaming with pride, and Harry ached again, ached that they weren\rquote t cheering for }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Enough}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , he told himself, irritated that he was envying Ron his family yet again. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I thought I\rquote d gotten over that.}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  He tried to focus on the game, on the business at
 hand, and joined the other players around the center of the field, where the Quaffle was going to be released, beginning the action. He glanced up at the Weasleys once, furtively, then forced his eyes away again. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Don\rquote t think of Ginny.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Before Harry knew 
what was happening, one of the English Chasers had the Quaffle and was already racing down the field toward the Welsh goals. The air was thick with players on their brooms in hot pursuit, while the Beaters were already hitting the Bludgers back and forth 
across the field with ear-piercing }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 pings!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  when the metal bands on the bats met the heavy iron balls. Harry shadowed his team\rquote 
s own Chasers, ducking and dodging Bludgers on the way, but to his disappointment, the Quaffle flew into one of the hoops as though magnetically drawn to something on the other side, and the familiar voice he\rquote d noticed earlier cried out, \'93
Montague scores! TEN TO NOTHING, ENGLAND!\'94 
\par Harry glanced up briefly, finally realizing that it was Ludo Bagman\rquote s voice, just like at the Quidditch W
orld Cup. He tore his eyes away just in time to see a Bludger bearing down on him, and he ducked. He swooped down near the ground, a mere six feet up, feeling a breeze as the players overhead moved back and forth. He wasn\rquote 
t watching the first time Ron scored; he was racing toward the English goal posts, thinking he would steer his broom up once he was there and fly above the action to look for the Snitch. He was caught by surprise, in mid-dive, and it was a miracle he didn
\rquote t crash, when he heard Bagman\rquote s magically amplified voice cry, \'93Weasley scores! TWENTY TO NOTHING, ENGLAND!\'94 
\par He jerked his broom up and swished past the English Keeper, a formidable-looking witch who could have been Crabbe or Goyle\rquote s older sister, with her dark hair pulled back into a sev
ere bun and a scowl on her corpulent face. Harry glanced around when he was a good ten feet above her, looking for that glint of gold, the other players a blur of movement at the other end of the pitch. Then he was distracted as the roar of the crowd swel
led yet again and, starting to sound like he was stuck in a rut, Bagman shouted once more, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Weasley scores}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 !\'94 
\par Harry felt like he was struggling to breathe; his lungs felt tight for no reason other than he was scared. He was scared that he was going to lose 
in front of all of these people. And his best friend would be largely responsible. Perhaps it was because he was hovering near the English Keeper--that might be what did it, what made him think of it....In his mind, he suddenly found himself thrown back t
o his other life, when he was the Slytherin Keeper and his nemesis was Ron, captain and star of the Gryffindor team. Well, he reckoned, the lion was a symbol of England, and a dragon was near enough to a snake, the symbol of Slytherin.... 
\par The game was played almost wholly at the Welsh end, goal after goal being racked up by England. Harry wasn\rquote t certain that he\rquote d been keeping an accurate count, but he thought that Ron was responsible for about half of the English points. 

\par He circled the air above the English Keeper, hoping and praying that the Welsh Chasers would manage to get to this end of the pitch soon. He remembered a game from his fifth year when he\rquote d beaten Ron in his other life; during that game he\rquote 
d gotten so tired of Ron continually snagging the Quaffle that he didn\rquote 
t throw it to a Slytherin Chaser after intercepting an attempted Gryffindor goal, but impatiently flew the length of the pitch himself, Slytherin Keeper scoring on the Gryffindor Keeper, before zipping back to his post. The other Keeper 
had been so shocked he\rquote d let the Quaffle fly past him without moving at all. Luckily, there was absolutely nothing in the rules against a player who wasn\rquote t a Chaser doing this. 
\par Harry smiled now, knowing what he would do. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Well, to get this job I took up a Beater\rquote 
s bat; perhaps to win the game--especially against Ron--I need to give my team yet another Chaser. At least, until I spot the Snitch....}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Harry plunged forward, toward the mass of players at the other end of the pitch. England had just scored again--a player other than Ron this time--and the score was one-hundred to nothing. This couldn\rquote 
t go on much longer if they were to have any chance at all. Once England had five more Quaffles through the hoops there\rquote d be almost no chance of beating them. Even if he caught the Snitch at that point, it would be a tie. 
\par The Welsh Keeper had blocked another attempted goal and nervously looked for a Welsh Chaser to throw it to, but the English Chasers and Beaters were blocking them, while the English Seeker, a small w
iry man who seemed to be in his mid-twenties, circled above the fray near the English Keeper, an amused smirk on his face. 
\par Harry dived at the Beater who was blocking one of his Chasers; he was the only man on this bloke, whereas there were two English players blocking each of the other Chasers. Harry had a hard time remembering this Chaser\rquote 
s name at first, and then he remembered that it was a combination of his mother\rquote s name and the name of Roger Davies\rquote  late brother: Evan Evans. 
\par The Beater saw Harry coming, recklessly aiming right for him, and a panic shone in his eyes for a half-minute before he ducked out of the way, avoiding a collision. Harry hadn\rquote 
t really had any intention of colliding with him, knowing that he could swerve at the last minute, but he\rquote d frightened the English Beater sufficiently so that he moved first. Luckily, Harry didn\rquote 
t have a Blatching foul called on him for flying with the intent to collide. (He would have a hard time making anyone think that he just wanted the other player to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 think}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 he was going to hit him.) The referee was busy elsewhere and didn\rquote t see what he\rquote d done. 
\par \'93Thanks, Harry!\'94 Evans shouted to him, and when their Keeper saw that Evans was open, he aimed the Quaffle in his direction. Unfortunately, Ron broke away from the other Welsh Chaser he\rquote 
d been helping block and intercepted the ball, then moved forward, poised to score again. Harry frowned; Evans was supposed to get the Quaffle, not Ron, but Ron\rquote s reflexes were just far and away faster than anyone else\rquote s on the field
. Harry motioned to the Chaser and he followed Harry into the scoring area, where as many Welsh players as wanted could go, but only one English player, or risk a foul being called for Stooging. With three Welsh players thus effectively defending three ho
ops, Ron didn\rquote 
t manage to score. In fact, Harry saw him look right at him before aiming the ball directly at the hoop closest to his best friend. Eyes narrowed, Harry caught the Quaffle and then immediately dove below the crowd of players, streaking toward 
the English goal and the Goyle-and-Crabbish witch waiting there. Evans and one of the other Chasers followed him swiftly, and, not trusting to his ability to actually put the thing through a hoop, as he\rquote d never really practiced this (he\rquote 
d been very lucky t
o score, in his other life), he threw it to Evans when they were close enough, making sure he stayed out of the scoring area. Evans feinted to the left and then scored through the center hoop, sending the Welsh side of the castle-stadium into hysterics. 
\'93ONE HUNDRED TO TEN!\'94 Bagman cried above the roar of the crowd. Harry was glad he hadn\rquote 
t tried to score; catching things he could do, and throwing the Quaffle a good distance after stopping it from going into a hoop, but throwing with accuracy at a goal that was being protected was another story altogether. He knew his limitations. 
\par The problem with the Chasers on his team, he realized, was that they had }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 been adequately prepared for playing against Ron Weasley by scrimmaging with the Harpies. The Harpies were good--the best in the League--but compared to the sort of players to which they were accustomed, Ron was another story entirely. Of all the players
 on the Welsh team, only Harry knew what Ron was thinking, what he was likely to do next, what he was capable of. 
\par This first success seemed to galvanize the Welsh Chasers, and after the English Keeper attempted to hurl the Quaffle to one of her Chasers, one of the Welsh Chasers, Wescoat, intercepted it, and she immediately scored for Wales again. 
\par \'93ONE-HUNDRED TO TWENTY!\'94 
\par Now there was some back and forth between the two ends of the field; Harry thought his teammates might have started getting dejected abo
ut the lopsided score. They seemed to have woken up now, and as his team scored their fourth goal, still holding the English team to one-hundred, Harry was somewhat shocked to feel a jolt as a Bludger collided with his broom twigs, making him fly crazily 
for a moment until he grasped the handle with determination and zoomed straight up, to shake the wobbles out of it. 
\par He looked for the Beater who\rquote d hit it, but oddly, both English Beaters were at the other end of the field, hitting the other Bludger back an
d forth to each other while attempting to keep possession of it, so that they could try to hit any Chaser who attempted to score on their Keeper again. Then Harry looked up and the same Bludger was heading for him again. He waited until the last minute, t
hen dodged to the side, feeling the thing whistle past his ear, it was uncomfortably close. 
\par He continued to watch the six Chasers and the Quaffle with one eye, and the Bludger with the other. He called to his Beaters, \'93Can you do something about this thing? It seems to be following me.\'94 
\par They nodded, flying toward it with their bats poised, and Harry saw that Ron had intercepted a pass between Evans and Wescoat again. Harry zoomed toward Ron, and then was flying right by his side as they both bore down on t
he Welsh goal. Ron turned his head to glance at Harry briefly. 
\par \'93What the hell do you think you\rquote re doing, Harry?\'94 
\par Harry kept an eye on the Quaffle under Ron\rquote s arm. \'93Last time I checked I was playing Quidditch. It\rquote s a game. On broomsticks. See, there are seven people to a team--\'94 
\par \'93Bugger off, Harry!\'94 he swore at him, clearly irritated and distracted, which had been Harry\rquote s goal. 
\par \'93You won\rquote t get rid of me that easy, Weasley,\'94 Harry said, deciding not to be familiar. 
\par \'93Oh, is }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  how it is, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Potter}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? Well, take }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 this}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 --\'94 And he elbowed Harry violently in the ribs, making him catch his breath. Harry wondered how much that was for being irritating while he was trying to score, and how much of it was for Ginny crying last night.... 

\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Don\rquote t think of Ginny, don\rquote t think of Ginny....}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par \'93AND WEASLEY FOULS POTTER! COBBING!\'94 
\par Harry grinned at Ron, flying off before Ron took another shot at him with his elbow. 
\par \'93EVANS WILL TAKE THE FOUL SHOT FOR WALES!\'94 Bagman declared, after seeing the hand signals from the referee. Ron had to give the Quaffle up to Evans. Harry had been trying to set him off, and it had worked. His ribs weren\rquote t too happy, but he
\rquote d played with worse pain before. He knew Ron well, and Ron had behaved very predictably. Harry knew he wouldn\rquote t normally let himself be wound up by something so minor, but Harry also knew Ron\rquote 
s temper was a bit shorter than usual in the days preceding the full moon. It was inside information, but it had worked to his advantage. And then there was Ginny, too... 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Don\rquote t think of Ginny, don\rquote t think of Ginny...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par It was a rough game, and soon fouls were being called on both teams. Blagging (seizing the opponent\rquote s broomtail), Blatching, an epidemic of Cobbing, (suddenly, elbows were everywhere) and two incidents of Stooging by the English pla
yers (once by Ron, who hadn\rquote t been able to stop his broom before he\rquote d strayed into the scoring area, where one of his fellow Chasers was trying to score). 
\par The score had reached a phenomenal level, which Harry had never experienced in school play: eight hu
ndred thirty to seven-hundred. The English Seeker was marking Harry, whether he was adding his presence to guarding the Welsh goals or helping pass the Quaffle between the Chasers, to prevent the English Chasers (which was to say }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Ron}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ) from intercepting it.
 (Ron seemed to be responsible for most of the interceptions during the game.) Harry was enjoying throwing the Quaffle back and forth so much that he almost didn\rquote 
t notice the glimmer of gold out of the corner of his eye. He pretended at first that he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 hadn\rquote t}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 seen it, and turned his head to find out what the English Seeker was up to. Was he aware that the Snitch had appeared? 
\par But the English Seeker was facing the wrong way, and evidently hadn\rquote t seen what Harry had. Now the Snitch was hurtling along in between the two English Beaters, who were also oblivious to this fact, and Harry did a one-eighty, swerving so that he
\rquote d be flying between them, growing closer and closer to the Snitch. Suddenly, the same Bludger that had been plaguing him all game came bearing 
down on him again. He dove, then swerved up again, reaching up to grab the Snitch in his right hand, feeling the strong wings beating against his palm and an exultation ripping through him. He swerved away from the Beaters, one of whom had hit the Bludger
 
toward him before he realized what Harry had done, and, Snitch in hand, Harry ducked the metal sphere once again before hovering near the middle of the field, holding up the Snitch with a triumphant grin. The crowd realized what had happened more quickly 
than Ludo Bagman, and the roar became positively deafening. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 AND IT\rquote S WALES!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 Bagman finally declared, after everyone present already knew. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
POTTER HAS THE SNITCH! WALES WILL PLAY FRANCE IN THE QUARTER-FINALS!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Harry grinned, seeing even the Hogwarts students who\rquote 
d been sitting on the English side erupt in cheers and applause, jumping to their feet, which was probably confounding the other spectators sitting around them. He waved to the Creevey brothers, yelling themselves hoarse, leaning precariously over
 the stone barrier at the front of the \'93window\'94 in the stone wall from where they\rquote 
d been viewing the match. Harry could see Dean and Seamus behind the smaller boys, hopping up and down and waving to Harry as he flew his victory lap with the Snitch over his head. 
\par But this was cut short as the problematic Bludger came round again and hit his broom twigs. He lost his grip on the handle and fell forward, striking his chin painfully on the wood and biting his lip so that it bled. He had his arms wrapped around 
his broom awkwardly, the Snitch still in his right hand, when it came back at him again. He tried to duck, and instead rolled right off his broom, hanging by his left hand while he continued to grasp the Snitch in his right. He heard the crowd gasp and he
 looked down, thinking grimly that soon they\rquote d have something to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 really}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 gasp about. He was up above the parapets, high enough that he could do far worse damage to himself than breaking his legs should he fall. Well, he thought, if I have to I\rquote ll transform in midair and fly; better that people find out I\rquote 
m an Animagus than die to keep it a secret... 
\par Even as he felt his sweaty fingers slipping from the wood, he also felt a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 swishing}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  in the air around him, and the next thing he knew, he was falling--only to be 
stopped short by a large strong arm being wrapped around his chest, making it hard for him to breathe. 
\par It was Ron. He steered his broom up and over the parapets, landing on the Welsh side, depositing Harry on the deck next to the top box before landing and dismounting from his broom. Harry\rquote 
s breathing was labored, and the roar of the crowd was deafening. 
\par \'93AND CHASER WEASLEY PREVENTS POTTER FROM TAKING A BAD FALL!\'94 Bagman bellowed hoarsely. 
\par Harry looked up at Ron and nodded. After he\rquote d gotten his breath back, he managed to choke out, \'93Thanks, mate.\'94 
\par Ron nodded back at him. \'93Well, just because we lost doesn\rquote t mean I want my best friend spattered all over the pitch, now does it?\'94 And then he broke into a very typical Ron grin and thrust his hand at Harry. H
arry grasped it, pulling himself up, and once he was on his feet he hugged Ron roughly, thumping him soundly on the back before releasing him. 
\par \'93You great prat,\'94 he said affectionately. Ron shrugged. 
\par \'93One of us had to be on the losing team.\'94
 Harry saw past the casual dismissal of the loss, saw the disappointment in his eyes, and wished that there had been some way for them both to win. Stupid, really, but he still wished it. He turned when he heard footsteps; Sirius was hurrying down from th
e top box to see him, grinning broadly the entire time. But suddenly, with a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 crash!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  the Bludger that had hit Harry\rquote 
s broom collided with one of the parapets near where he and Ron were standing, taking off a piece of stone roughly the size of Harry\rquote s head. H
e and Sirius and Ron shielded their faces from the flying fragments as the sphere arched up into the air again. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 That could have been my skull,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry thought, swallowing. 
\par This wasn\rquote t funny or merely inconvenient anymore. 
\par Then another familiar black-haired figure was standing near him, saying with a calm gravity, \'93Let it aim for you again, Harry, and then duck as fast as you can.\'94 
\par To his surprise, it was Snape, who, it appeared, had also been sitting on the Welsh side. 
\par \'93You might need help,\'94 Sirius said to him, even though he wasn\rquote t looking at Snape; like Severus Snape, he was watching the Bludger come round for another attempt at decapitating Harry. Snape nodded at him. 
\par \'93Together on three. One, two--THREE!\'94 
\par The two of them pointed their wands at the approaching cannon-ball like projectile, and it slowed to a stop, hovering in the air two feet in front of Harry, who hadn\rquote 
t bothered to duck. He felt like he was holding his breath. And then suddenly, the wind was knocked out of him as a small body flung itself against his midsection. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Harry Potter! Harry Potter! You is all right!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93D--Dobby?\'94 Harry sputtered. More and more people were gathering in the spot where he and Ron had landed. He looked up in shock to see Aberforth Dumbledore grinning at him, looking odd to Harry in old grey wizarding robes that he\rquote 
d thrown over his Muggle clothes rather hurriedly, it seemed. Harry remembered that he\rquote d usually looked rather smart when he was teaching Charms in fifth year, while Flitwick was in the hospital wing. Perhaps he\rquote 
d been borrowing robes from his brother. (Professor Dumbledore had some rather impressive ensembles, usually with matching hats.) And with him was Sam Bell, which really bowled Harry over, as Sam couldn\rquote t do much magic anymore, and the break-up wit
h Katie hadn\rquote t exactly gone well. But that didn\rquote t seem to matter now. Sam and Aberforth came forward and shook his hand, patting him on the back, and Harry\rquote 
s heart felt very full. Now he also noticed Hagrid and Mad-Eye Moody and his sister (whom Harry }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 still}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  had to remember to call Professor Figg). Evidently, Sirius }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 hadn\rquote t}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  been the only supporter he\rquote d had on the Welsh side. He even thought he saw large brown eyes and pointy ears peeking out nervously around the edge of Aberforth
\rquote s robes. 
\par \'93Winky?\'94 he whispered, incredulous. She crept out, her large eyes shining. She wore what appeared to be a little girl\rquote s set of robes, and in stark contrast to when she\rquote 
d been at Hogwarts, in spite of the fact that she was technically wearing }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 clothes}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , and not a tea-towel or o
ld pillowcase, the robes looked immaculately clean and she seemed to be relatively healthy and whole. 
\par \'93Hello, Harry,\'94 she squeaked. \'93Master was wanting me to come with him because he thought I would enjoy it.\'94 }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Master?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  And then Harry remembered that Winky 
had gone to work for \'93the headmaster\rquote s brother.\'94 Somehow, he\rquote 
d managed to forget that this was the same as Aberforth, whom Harry had learnt to call Dick Abernathy in the Muggle world. Harry almost laughed at the thought; somehow, he hadn\rquote t pictured \'93Dick\'94 
going home to a hot meal and a flat cleaned by a house elf, but that was evidently the way he lived now. It was even possible that she was accepting some small payment, since she was wearing clothes. One thing did puzzle him, though. 
\par \'93I thought you were afraid of heights, Winky,\'94 he said to her. 
\par \'93Oh, I am,\'94 she confirmed, her voice going up still higher. \'93Until--until we came up the stairs, we was in the lowest seats....\'94 She clung to Aberforth again, the fabric of his robes clutched frantically in her bo
ny fingers. Aberforth patted her head fondly. 
\par \'93There, there, Winky. I\rquote d never let any harm come to you, you know that...\'94 Harry\rquote s throat was tight; his voice was so like Dumbledore\rquote s. And yet-- 
\par \'93Where\rquote s Professor Dumbledore?\'94 Harry asked, looking around. He noticed that Aberforth looked somewhat uncomfortable. So did Sirius and Snape, who glanced at each other furtively, he saw. 
\par \'93He would have liked to come, Harry,\'94 Aberforth told him. \'93But--it wasn\rquote t possible. He does hope you and Ron will forgive him.\'94 His look seemed to say, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Do not ask any more questions right now.}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Harry nodded. \'93Of course, of course. Just wondering.\'94 
\par Now their number included Owen Aberystwyth, Monty Mathers and Ludo Bagman; Remus Lupin and Ron\rquote s parents and older brothers had come o
ver from the English side, as well. (Harry saw that Hermione, Ginny and Maggie were still on the other side of the pitch.) They were all gawping at the floating Bludger. 
\par \'93What the hell\rquote s going on?\'94 Owen demanded, pointing with his thumb at the Bludger, still hovering in mid-air. Snape looked at him disdainfully. 
\par \'93It would seem that this Bludger was tampered with. It was pursuing Harry rather single-mindedly, even after the match, when it should have returned to the ground. If Mr. Weasley had not caught hi
m, you would have been missing your starting Seeker in the match against France.\'94 
\par Mathers stepped up to Snape, looking truculent. \'93What are you implying? That we cheated?\'94 
\par Snape\rquote s expression did not change. \'93Hardly. It is not necessary for the Bludger-tampering to have anything to do with the game. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Someone}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 might have been trying to hurt Harry for reasons quite apart from altering the outcome of a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Quidditch match,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94
 he said, his opinion of Mathers quite clear from his tone. It was also clear what he meant by }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 someone;}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  everyone knew the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 someone}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  who\rquote d had it in for Harry since he was a one-year-old. 
\par Bagman had de-amplified his voice and stepped forward now, a mock-jovial expression on his face. \'93Now, now, we don\rquote t want to worry any of our--}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 friends,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 he said, m
otioning with his head at an Auror standing about twenty feet away. \'93Next thing you know, the Ministry will think we can\rquote t hold the European Cup here....\'94 
\par \'93Is that all you\rquote re worried about?\'94 Ron yelled at him, surprising Harry. If anyone thought Quidditch was one of the most important things in the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 world}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , it was Ron. 
\'93If I hadn\rquote t caught him, Harry would be a puddle on the ground!\'94 
\par Harry choked for a second. \'93Erm, thanks Ron. A bit vivid, but thanks.\'94 Ron grimaced. 
\par \'93Sorry, Harry. You know, for the first time, I\rquote 
m glad I have werewolf reflexes and instincts for a reason other than playing Quidditch. Even before you started to fall, I had this nagging feeling that I should turn to look in your direction, and--\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 What?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94
 Owen Aberystwyth roared now, interrupting Ron. Harry saw a swish of a robe out of the corner of his eye--he thought someone had ducked behind Aberforth, but he wasn\rquote 
t sure. Winky was still pressed to his side, but she was no longer looking afraid due to the height of the castle walls; her round eyes looked toward where Owen, Mathers and Bagman were standing. Bagman was frowning deeply. 
\par \'93Oh dear, oh dear,\'94 he kept repeating, looking sadly at Ron and shaking his head. 
\par Ron frowned back at him. \'93Oh dear }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 what?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93You\rquote re a werewolf?\'94 Mathers said, looking very pale. 
\par Ron shrugged. \'93Yeah. Are you saying you didn\rquote t know? I thought you got my medical records from Madam Pomfrey. You did }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 read}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  them, didn\rquote t you?\'94 
\par Mathers looked flabbergasted. \'93I--it\rquote s just--usually a formality. I filed them away. I did ask her whether you were in good health, if there was anything we needed to be concerned about. She said you were as healthy as a horse.\'94 
\par Owen broke in, looking as though he didn\rquote t believe for a minute that Mathers was just finding out about Ron\rquote s lycanthropy. \'93What you }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 should}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 have asked her was whether he has any medical conditions which would prevent him from playing professional Quidditch!\'94 
\par Ron\rquote s jaw dropped. \'93Prevent me--\'94 
\par Bagman was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 tsking}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  with his tongue against his teeth. \'93Ah, yes. I\rquote m afraid that there }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 is}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 a rule that was instituted years ago, mostly because of wizard vampires wanting to play. The rule prevents wizard part-humans from participating in the league. A werewolf is also a part-human. I\rquote m sorry to say that you\rquote 
re off the team, Weasley,\'94 Bagman said. Harry looked at Bagman with narrowed eyes. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 He didn\rquote t sound very sorry.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par \'93W--well th--then,\'94 Mathers sputtered, \'93we should play the game over, with one of our reserves....\'94 
\par \'93What\rquote s the point?\'94 Bagman said hurriedly. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Too}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  hurriedly, Harry thought. \'93Wales will play France. England didn\rquote 
t win. If England had won--yes, the match would have to be done over. But it\rquote s rather moot, since you lost, don\rquote t you think?\'94 Mathers was glaring at Bagman; Harry thought Bagman had been rather tactless about the }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 since you lost}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  part. 
\par Ron looked around at them all, speechless. \'93I--I just thought everybody knew. I thought it was in the papers when there was the news about Sirius being cleared and Pettigrew framing him--all that. You know--what happened in the forest last term.\'94 

\par Harry furrowed his brow, thinking. \'93Actually, Ron, now that I think about it--I don\rquote t recall seeing anything in any of the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Prophet}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 stories about you being bitten. After all, you never brought charges against Remus. If you had, there might have been some coverage, but since you didn\rquote t--\'94 
\par Ron shrugged. \'93It wasn\rquote t his fault his hiding place was set on fire.\'94 He shook his head. \'93What a way for this to come out...\'94 He sounded utterly dejected. Bagman was eyeing Mathers suspiciously. 
\par \'93Are you saying that you }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 didn\rquote t}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  know Weasley was a werewolf, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 and}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 you had nothing to do with this Bludger?\'94 
\par Mathers put his face in Bagman\rquote s now. \'93Oh, so now you }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 are}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  accusing me of cheating? Is that it? Is it?\'94 
\par Harry stepped in between them. \'93The game\rquote s over. Let it drop,\'94
 he said to both of them. Bagman gave Harry a penetrating look for a moment, and Harry wondered about something he remembered from his fourth year....Harry looked at Winky now, still clinging to Aberforth Dumbledor
e and looking at Ludo Bagman with wide, frightened eyes.... 
\par \'93And what about the house team?\'94 Ron was saying now, evidently not having noticed what Harry had seen. \'93Does that mean I can\rquote t be Quidditch captain any more?\'94 He looked even more distressed about
 this than not being on the English team any more. 
\par Snape came to the rescue again. \'93I believe,\'94 their Potions Master said now, \'93that there is no rule against part-humans participating in the Inter-House Quidditch Cup. You should have no problems continuing to lead your house team,\'94
 he said dryly, as though he wished this weren\rquote t the case (Slytherin wouldn\rquote t stand a chance against Ron, he probably knew). Harry could see that the full impact of the ruling against Ron was hitting home. }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 He can\rquote t become a professional player after he finishes school. He can\rquote t Apparate, either, which will affect his other job possibilities as well.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 Harry swallowed, watching Remus Lupin\rquote s face, as he put his hand on Ron\rquote s shoulder; Ron looked down at him in fear, as though seeing 
his future and being repulsed by it. Remus let his hand drop and backed away. He seemed to be feeling a fresh wave of guilt for altering the course of Ron\rquote s life in such an irrevocable way. 
\par The crowd on the parapets was remarkably quiet and subdued now. Suddenly, evidently not being able to take it any more, Charlie Weasley strode up to his brother and threw his arm around his shoulder. \'93S\rquote 
all right, Ron, yeah? I have a surprise for you. You said that broom\rquote s yours, right?\'94 he said, nodding at Ron\rquote s beautiful Jupiter. Ron clutched it tightly, looking at Monty Mathers uncertainly. 
\par \'93Well, I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 thought}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  it was...\'94 
\par \'93Yeah, only someone who was too }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 daft}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to actually }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 read}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 your medical records would probably be perfectly }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 happy}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to give it to you as a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 parting}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  gift, don
\rquote t you think?\'94 Charlie said with an edge to his voice; he was ostensibly speaking to Ron, but glaring at Mathers the whole time. Harry remembered how Mathers had longed to have Charlie on his team when he\rquote 
d finished school, before the lure of dragons had drawn Charlie off to Romania. 
\par \'93Yeah,\'94 Mathers said dejectedly. \'93Keep the ruddy broom.\'94 
\par \'93Perfect!\'94 Charlie crowed, tightening his hold around Ron\rquote s shoulders. \'93Just the thing to ride in the annual broom race from Kopparberg to Arjeplog, right along with me! Didn\rquote 
t I tell you I was going to be in the race this year? Some mates of mine from the reservation in Romania have been going up to Sweden to fly in the race every year, and they\rquote 
ve been pestering me forever to join in. We can give them two Weasleys for the price of one! Say you\rquote ll do it, yeah?\'94 
\par Ron looked down at Charlie, half a head shorter than him, his round tanned face grinning broadly. Ron gave in and a slow smile crept across his face. \'93Yeah, I\rquote ll do it. Only--are part-humans allowed?\'94 He glanced a
t Bagman, the smile evaporating. 
\par Ludo Bagman looked at the Weasleys around him with a clear distaste. In addition to Charlie, who was still by Ron\rquote s side, the twins were glaring at Bagman with their arms crossed on their chests and Bill was also giving hi
m a gimlet eye. Harry noticed for the first time that Percy was absent. 
\par He shrugged and said in a rather high-pitched voice, \'93Fine. I can say, as the person who takes registration from British participants in the race, that there are no rules against part-humans.\'94 
\par Sirius stepped forward and put his hand on Harry\rquote s shoulder now. \'93And Harry will probably have his Apparition test by then, so he can come and watch you both. Hermione too.\'94 
\par Harry hadn\rquote t thought about this. He grinned up at Ron. \'93That\rquote ll be brilliant! I can see my best friend win the annual broom race!\'94 
\par Ron was grinning again, looking like he couldn\rquote t possibly find any reason to be angry with Harry now. \'93Right after I get to see you win the European Cup, you mean?\'94 
\par They both laughed; Harry was glad that they\rquote d managed to smooth over the awkwardness of Ron not being allowed to play professional Quidditch any more--for the moment. There was still a slight shadow behind Ron\rquote 
s eyes, despite his putting a good face on things, thanks to Charlie. Ron couldn\rquote 
t exactly make a living, when he was out of school, from flying in an annual broom race, but it was at least something he was uniquely suited for. He was probably better suited than any of the other racers, in fact, who could be in very grave danger
 from some of the dragons on the reservation through which the race course ran. Ron could withstand a lot more in terms of physical rigor and burns, plus his reflexes would put him in a good position to avoid most of the injuries he would probably otherwi
se receive. 
\par But as the crowd dispersed and Harry prepared to return to Hogwarts with Sirius, he couldn\rquote t help notice that Winky continued to peer around Aberforth\rquote s legs at Bagman, watching him very, very fearfully, and trembling the whole time.

There was an insanely gleeful party in the Gryffindor common room when Harry returned; it was as if everyone there had been on the Welsh side during the match, instead of most of them being on the English side. Harry decided that he didn\rquote t mind.
 As time went on, though, and Harry noticed Ron becoming more and more withdrawn, he wished the Creeveys and Seamus and Dean would stop describing every play of the game to the younger students and just go to bed, even though it was barely seven o\rquote 
clock in the evening. (Orion Pierson kept begging to hear more, shooting Harry grins every so often and sometimes mentioning that he and Harry both lived in Ascog Castle. Students below third year hadn\rquote 
t been given the opportunity to ask their parents and guardians permission to go to the match.) 
\par Someone was playing a Wizarding Wireless and couples were dancing lazily to a slow song, but when Hermione tried to coax Ron into a dance, he pulled away from her brusquely and went up the stairs to the boys\rquote  dorms, leavi
ng Hermione looking rather forlorn, staring after him. Harry started to approach her, but she suddenly glared at him and walked over to Neville, pulling him to his feet and leading him to the clutch of other dancing couples rather forcefully, leaning her 
head on Neville\rquote s chest as he led her around the middle of the floor with the other dancers. It seemed that she was very pointedly }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  looking at Harry. 
\par He grimaced and turned away from them, only to see a school owl pounding itself silly on one of the windows. He opened it and the owl promptly entered and dropped a piece of parchment in Harry\rquote 
s hands before leaving again. Harry closed the window and unrolled the parchment; it was very brief:

 had been his mantra throughout the game. Now he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 needed}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to think of Ginny, think of the way she\rquote d been sobbing on Ron last night. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Ron must still not know what had happened, or else he\rquote d be as cold toward me as Hermione is,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought, looking up at her with Neville again. (Neville, he thought, looked far too happy for his own good.) 

\par Harry checked his watch; he had plenty of time to walk to the Trophy Room slowly if he left now. He made his way toward the portrai
t hole, no one noticing his exodus, and was soon walking through the cold corridors of the castle, his heart pounding quickly as he tried to figure out what he was going to say, how he was going to explain to her about Mariah. In his pocket he still carri
ed the amulet she\rquote d abandoned, resisting the temptation to reach in and hold it, to determine what she was doing right now. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 It will be all right, it will be all right,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 he told himself over and over. But he didn\rquote t believe it. 
\par He reached the Trophy room ten minutes early, and found that someone else was already there: Mariah Kirkner and Draco Malfoy. To his relief, they weren\rquote 
t touching, just standing, leaning against one of the trophy cases, talking quietly. Harry glared at them both when he entered. 
\par \'93Clear off. I need to speak to someone here, and you\rquote re the last two people in the world I want around for this....\'94 
\par Mariah frowned. \'93Clear off? But it\rquote s Ginny, isn\rquote t it? She asked us to be here too. Hair note jest said, \lquote We need ta talk.\rquote \'94 
\par Harry licked his lips and swallowed, not liking this. \'93She asked all three of us here? To talk?\'94 
\par \'93Yes.\'94 Ginny\rquote s voice was icy as she entered the room, looking both regal and fragile. Harry could see the purple shadows under her eyes, from crying the night before. It had bee
n impossible to see her face clearly when she was sitting in the stands at the game and he was flying overhead. The three of them stood rather awkwardly while she stopped about six feet from them and put her hands on her hips. She glared at the three of t
hem, and Harry could practically feel the air in the room crackling from her anger. \'93First, congratulations on winning today, Harry. Perhaps you\rquote ll start getting letters from female fans who want to date you, so you won\rquote 
t have to change your snake into a girl any more.\'94 Draco Malfoy guffawed, holding his stomach. Harry winced at the tone in her voice, and even Mariah looked alarmed at the way she was addressing him. Ginny surveyed all three of them now. \'93So,\'94
 she said at last, \'93Now that that\rquote s out of the way--it\rquote s probably about time we all talked, don\rquote t you think?\'94
 She was doing her best to be imperious, to be in charge, but Harry saw her chin give a small wobble, her lip shake momentarily, before she clenched her jaw muscles with fury and continued. 
\par \'93Let\rquote s start with you, Mariah. Could you--oh, I\rquote m not sure just how to put it--possibly be more of a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 tart}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 Ginny\rquote 
s eyes glittered with malice, and Harry hoped her wand wasn\rquote t very handy. 
\par Mariah was the calmest one in the room, for reasons Harry couldn\rquote t fathom. \'93Why do ye say that, Ginny? Because I was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 there}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  for Draco when you got \lquote 
im all wairked up in the greenhooses and then ran off?\'94 
\par Ginny sputtered. \'93Ran off? Sprout caught us together! I\rquote ve never been more embarrassed in my life! I was in just my bra and knickers; but }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 please}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 excuse me for feeling embarrassed by that. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 You}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  obviously wouldn\rquote t understand...\'94 Harry knew then that she was referring to what she\rquote d seen when she\rquote 
d held the amulet Saturday night; she sounded very acerbic, but he looked at her carefully again and saw that chin wobble, and knew that she had to be as hard as ice so that she wouldn\rquote 
t break down as she had in the common room the previous evening. It was her only defense. 
\par Ginny looked around at the three of them. \'93Why do I get the impression that all of us here know why I was staying with Draco and that I shouldn\rquote t go on pretending any more?\'94 
\par Draco Malfoy grimaced. \'93Well, personally, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  was pretending publicly that it was my devastating charm, wit and good looks, but I\rquote m getting a very bad 
feeling that you might be about to say something else.\'94 
\par Ginny sneered at him now. \'93Oh, well spotted, Draco. You finally figured it out. It only took--what? A year? You\rquote re very quick, you are. I can see why you\rquote re top in your year. Oh, wait--that\rquote s not you. That\rquote 
s Hermione. Muggle-born Hermione,\'94 she added, glaring at him. Draco Malfoy, however, wasn\rquote t feeling inclined to let the abuse continue. 
\par \'93I\rquote ll have you know it did }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  take me the better part of a year to figure it out. In my defense, I can say that I was in a little thing called }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 denial}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 He was practically shouting in her face, then abruptly, he grew very quiet. \'93I knew, all right. I just--didn\rquote t want to believe it.\'94
 His emotions seemed to be all over the place; he became truculent again. \'93You know, if you\rquote d fallen out of love with me, you might have just }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 said}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  so and ended it,\'94
 he whinged. \'93Instead, you kept giving me }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 hope}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , when you never bloody intended to follow through at all because you were still panting after }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Potter!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Ginny looked back at him, very level, not denying it. \'93Yes,\'94 she said finally. \'93
I--I still had feelings for Harry. And for a while I had feelings for you too, and I was confused. But the more you pressed me, the less I felt for you....until I knew that I wasn\rquote t in love with you at all, and that I\rquote 
d made a dreadful mistake. Unfortunately, by then, it was too late.\'94 
\par Malfoy frowned. \'93Too late? Too bloody late for }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 what}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par She shrugged. \'93Too late for a lot of things. I thought it was too late for Harry to be interested in me, as he was with Hermione; too late for me to say, \lquote 
Oh, sorry I made you think I was interested in you, which was one of the reasons why you helped put your dad in prison....\rquote \'94 She halted, reddening. \'93I mean--you }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 did}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 do a good thing. And I felt like--like it would be throwing it in your face to leave you. I felt--trapped.\'94 
\par Draco Malfoy grimaced. \'93That\rquote s what a bloke wants to hear--that his girlfriend has felt \lquote trapped\rquote  for a year. Bloody marvelous.\'94 
\par Ginny did in fact look very contrite. \'93I\rquote m--I\rquote m sorry. I did once have feelings for you, but--\'94 
\par He put his hand up. \'93I know, I know. Listen, my ego doesn\rquote t need to hear every blow-by-blow moment of how you fell out of love with me. I rather got the impression that you decided Potter here was supposed to deflower you, not
 me, and no one else would do.\'94 
\par Ginny glanced at Harry furtively and turned bright red. \'93As you can probably guess, even when I had feelings for you, your }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 tact}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  isn\rquote 
t something I found to be your most attractive feature,\'94 she said to Draco acidly. 
\par Malfoy smirked now and posed against the glass trophy case. \'93Oh? And what }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 did}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  you consider to be my most attractive feature? You did }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
almost}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  sleep with me.\'94 
\par Ginny rolled her eyes. \'93Well, it wasn\rquote t your capacity for }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 humility}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , I\rquote ll tell you that. This isn\rquote t }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 all}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  about sex, you know. I was frankly getting quite tired of everything coming down to that; if I cared about you, I\rquote d do it. Do you want to know something? Do you?\'94
 She came very close to him, her mouth a mere inch away from his, her chest pressed against his. Harry could see that Malfoy\rquote s breathing had sped up. \'93I wanted you so badly sometimes it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 hurt}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . But I wasn\rquote t in love with you and didn\rquote t want to sleep with you just because it would be a physical release, and because I had cause to believe I\rquote d enjoy it a great deal. That wasn\rquote 
t the issue for me. I was afraid that if I gave in--not to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , but to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 myself}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
--it would be tantamount to saying that I was still in love with you. And yes, I know I\rquote d said the words. And when I did say it, I really did mean it. But if we--well, I thought you\rquote d take that to mean--\'94
 She reddened and stepped away from him. \'93Believe me, I was trying to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 avoid}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  leading you on as much as possible. That\rquote s why I didn\rquote 
t sleep with you. But it was getting harder and harder...Finally, just before we had to all go into the forest to rescue you and Professor Snape, I was considering just ending it with you and starting my life fresh--\'94 
\par Malfoy didn\rquote t change his pose. \'93--which was after Potter broke up with Granger, if I recall correctly--\'94 
\par \'93--but then I found out--something--which made me think that might not be the best idea in the world...\'94 
\par Malfoy frowned at first, then widened his eyes. Harry wasn\rquote t sure what Ginny meant, but then, just before Malfoy opened his mouth to speak he realized what she meant, and the thought formed in his mind as Draco Malfoy said the words: 
\par \'93The Obedience Charm.\'94 
\par Ginny nodded. \'93Right.\'94 
\par Malfoy ran his fingers through his fine, pale hair, pacing back and forth on the cold, hard stone floor. \'93Bloody hell. You thought that if you left me for Potter, I\rquote d just go off and become You-Know-Who\rquote 
s right hand man and do whatever he wanted me to--like kill your precious Harry. Isn\rquote t that right?\'94 
\par Ginny gave a small shrug. \'93Among other things. I\rquote d be lying if I denied that the thought crossed my mind. Although, to be fair, I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  glad that you didn\rquote 
t become a meal for a giant spider. So--well, you see the position I was in. You had the charm on you, you already hated Harry...It really didn\rquote t take much imagination to think of what you might do if I left you for him.\'94 
\par Malfoy crossed his arms and glared at the two of them. \'93So the two of you cooked up this plan to keep me frustrated as hell? Is that it?\'94 
\par Harry threw up his hands. \'93I didn\rquote t know anything about this yet.\'94 
\par \'93Yet,\'94 Malfoy repeated, looking at Harry with narrowed eyes. 
\par \'93As far as I knew, she was still in love with you,\'94 Harry said, looking sideways at Ginny. \'93I had no reason to believe otherwise.\'94 
\par Malfoy looked at Ginny again. \'93So this was all your idea, then? To be a complete tease?\'94 
\par Ginny looked at him with her arms crossed on her chest, then moved her gaze to Mariah. \'93Oh, yes, I had a great deal of fun teasing }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 myself}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, letting you kiss me and--and touch me, so that Harry might remain safe, while not giving myself permission to just--just give in--\'94 Harry felt his stomach clench as he saw how her breath caught, remembering. \'93But I had a feeling that you wouldn
\rquote t be frustrated for long, that there was someone at hand perfectly willing to help you with your little \lquote problem.\rquote \'94 
\par Mariah glared back at her. \'93Why coodn\rquote t ye have jest lait \lquote im go? I\rquote d have made \lquote im see there was nothing to be gained by his goin\rquote  after Harry....\'94 
\par Ginny rolled her eyes. \'93Oh, yes, right. If You-Know-Who had come after Draco and told him to kill Harry, you really would have told him to disobey the order and die. I\rquote m so sure. What do you take me for? All right, you\rquote 
re not like some of the other Slytherins, but I don\rquote t think for a minute that you would let Draco do something that would be guaranteed to end with his death. You\rquote 
d advise him obey any order You-Know-Who gave him if it meant he would still be safe afterward. At least I had some hope of influencing Draco to do the right thing if You-Know-Who ever tried to use the Obedience Charm to manipulate him.\'94
 She looked at Draco levelly now. \'93No, I\rquote m not saying I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 want}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  you to die. But I don\rquote t want a lot of things to happen that have....\'94 
\par The chin wobble was back, and Harry wondered what she was thinking. Draco Malfoy was looking at her desperately; he seemed to believe her now about being as frustrated as him. It seemed to be some small consolation to him that she wasn\rquote 
t completely immune to his attempts at seduction, while this same knowledge was making Harry feel as though he might go insane. He remembered her writhing in his arms, behind Hagrid\rquote 
s hut on her fifteenth birthday... It also became clear that, no matter how upset he was with her, Draco Malfoy didn\rquote t want to lose her, either. \'93Ginny, please forgive me. I--I didn\rquote t know what was going on in your head.\'94 
\par She crossed her arms and looked dispassionately at him. \'93So that\rquote s why you shagged that Muggle girl in the hedge maze this summer?\'94 
\par His jaw dropped. \'93But--but I thought you believed that letter I wrote--\'94 
\par She laughed loudly. \'93What kind of ninny do you think I am? All right, let me tell you what you did--you felt tempted to sleep with her and did, then realized that Harry or Katie or both of them would tell me about it--\'94 
\par He was looking at her with his fists clenched by his sides. \'93No! I mean, yeah--I felt tempted. But when I did it--it was in a damn public space. And that was on }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 purpose}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
. Because I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 wanted}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Potter and Bell to tell you. To }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 hurt}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  you. To see if you had any feelings }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 left}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to hurt. That was my original intention, anyway....\'94 He stopped, swallowing. \'93But then,\'94 he went on more quietly, \'93
I had second thoughts. About you being hurt. And about you leaving me. I love you, Ginny...\'94 he trailed off softly, and despite the infidelity, Harry believed him. 
\par Ginny looked at him shrewdly. \'93And what about the times last year when you were sneaking around with Mariah in the middle of the night?\'94 
\par Malfoy looked nervously at Mariah now. \'93Well--I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  feeling rather frustrated then....\'94 He reddened. \'93And Mariah said--well, no strings attached--\'94 
\par Harry glanced at her; she\rquote d been lying. She very much wanted there to be strings attached. Ginny could see this too. She sighed. \'93Poor little tart. Fell for the biggest rogue at the school, and thought he\rquote 
d get down on bended knee and propose if you accommodated him, eh?\'94 Ginny\rquote s voice had a nasty edge to it. Mariah bristled. 
\par \'93I thought that after a time he might come to his sainses and see what was right in front o\rquote  him instead o\rquote  hankerin\rquote  after what he couldn\rquote  have,\'94 she told Ginny with her chin in the air. Ginny\rquote 
s glare was utter hatred. 
\par \'93Is that why you seduced Harry, too?\'94 
\par Draco Malfoy\rquote s jaw dropped. \'93What the hell--?\'94 
\par Ginny laughed. \'93Oh, you didn\rquote t know your little mistress was cheating on you? Last night, they were down in the tunnels going at it. Rutting like animals--\'94 
\par \'93We stopped!\'94 Harry said quickly. \'93Erm, what I mean is--\'94 He felt himself reddening. Draco Malfoy was looking rather upset. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 What the hell happened?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 he said to Harry and Mariah, red-faced now from fury, not embarrassment. 
\par Harry swallowed and pointed. \'93I have a perfectly good excuse. She\rquote s a selkie!\'94 he said, pointing an accusatory finger at Mariah. 
\par For the first time, Ginny looked shocked. \'93A }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 what}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par Mariah nodded. \'93Aye,\'94 she said briefly, before removing her fingerless gloves and spreading her fingers, so Ginny could see the webbing there. Harry could see that Ginny didn\rquote t know what to do now. 
\par \'93But,\'94 he said quickly; \'93Mariah said she never used her selkie wiles to get Malfoy to sleep with her. She\rquote d never used them at all until last night--\'94 
\par \'93No!\'94 Draco Malfoy said quickly. \'93No, it\rquote s a lie! She used her selkie charms on me! That\rquote s why we--did stuff--\'94 
\par Ginny looked back and forth between the three of them. \'93Oh, I just do }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  believe this is happening...\'94 
\par Mariah looked very determined. \'93Waill, believe it. You saw us whain you touched the amulet, didn\rquote t ye?\'94 Ginny looked even more shocked, and nodded dumbly. \'93You love }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 she said pointing at Harry. \'93That\rquote s why you can see him when you touch it. I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 wanted}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 ye to see the pair of us, to think that if ye didn\rquote t leave Draco once \lquote n\rquote  fer all ye might lose }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Harry}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ...\'94 
\par Ginny gasped. \'93You }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 what}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par Malfoy looked outraged. \'93Yeah! You }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 what}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par Mariah looked smugly satisfied. \'93Well, here we all are, talkin\rquote  openly about all this, finally. It wairked. And now that you\rquote ve seen me an\rquote  Harry in the amulet, I\rquote d appreciate it if you\rquote d hand it over--\'94
 She walked toward Ginny and put her hand on her neck, looking for the silver chain. Ginny backed away from her, holding her throat with her hand. 
\par \'93I--I don\rquote t have it any more--\'94 
\par Mariah looked very suspicious. \'93Oh, really? Then where the haill is it?\'94 
\par Harry had a sudden inspiration. \'93Why don\rquote t you ask }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Draco}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94
 he said, nodding at him. Mariah looked at him with narrowed eyes, seeing for the first time the silver chain on the back of Draco Malfoy\rquote s neck. She strode to him and swiftly pulled the amulet out of his shirt collar, gasping. 
\par \'93What the haill? Why didn\rquote t ye taill me ye had this?\'94 
\par \'93Erm,\'94 Malfoy said, taking the chain off over his head. \'93It was--it was meant to be a surprise.\'94

\par \'93It wairks,\'94 she said dreamily, looking at Draco with shining eyes. For his part, Draco Malfoy was glaring at Harry and Ginny. 
\par \'93Well, I suppose you two are just off to happy-ever-after-land now...\'94
 he sneered. Harry swallowed. All of his protests to the contrary, he certainly sounded like it would take very little for him to decide to hurt Harry right now. Even if that involved being sucked back into
 the Death Eaters and putting his Dark Mark to some use.

\par \'93But you have to believe me!\'94 he said breathlessly. \'93
I--I realized that the way I felt--it was similar to when the veelas came out on the field at the World Cup, and when I was under Imperius during my fourth year, when I was learning to beat it....\'94

\par \'93No, really, Ginny. It wasn\rquote t like that--\'94 
\par Ginny rolled her eyes. \'93You know, I haven\rquote t the slightest idea why I was ever afraid of anything happening to you should I break up with Draco. I only know one thing now,\'94 she said, her voice tight with rage. \'93

\par She glared at each of them in turn briefly before turning on her heel and striding from the room. They looked at each other uncertainly. Harry stared after her, his heart feeling very strange and slow, as though it were only beating once a minute. 
\par Draco Malfoy wasn\rquote t going to let all of this go without comment, however. 
\par \'93So,\'94 he drawled, smirking at Harry. \'93You\rquote ve been told to go to hell, too, Potter. Ha! I can\rquote t say I\rquote m too happy about finding out about you and Mariah this way--\'94 he said, an edge to his voice now; \'93--but at least you

\par Harry felt an incredible urge to completely forgo magic and just punch Draco Malfoy very hard, as R

 underway to determine whether Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore and the school matron, Poppy Pomphrey, attempted to conceal this information from Mathers. Neither Pomphrey nor Dumbledore were available yesterday for comment; Minerva McGonagall, Hogwar

\par If the records show that Mathers was in fact informed of Weasley\rquote 
s condition, an inquiry will take place under the auspices of the World Quidditch Federation to determine whether Mathers will still lead the English team in future European Cup and World Cup play, as well as to determine whether 
he will retain his position with the Caerphilly Catapults. 
\par If England had won yesterday\rquote s match against Wales, the results would have been null and void, requiring the match to be played over without Weasley. Ironically, it was Weasley\rquote s best friend, Gryf
findor Seeker and Hogwarts Head Boy, Harry Potter, who won the match for Wales. 
\par Soon after Potter caught the Snitch, he slipped from his broom and would surely have fallen to his death had not his friend caught him and carried him to safety. However, duri
ng the match itself, it is a wonder that someone else was not gravely injured due to Weasley\rquote 
s inordinate strength, which arguably gave England an unfair advantage. It is a wonder that England did not, in fact, win, and it gives one pause when one considers whether it is a coincidence that Weasley\rquote 
s best friend caught the Snitch. Weasley certainly did not seem to bear his friend any ill-will after his side\rquote s loss, and as noted before, even saved him from a certain death. 
\par Delving into Ministry records, this
 reporter was able to learn that Ronald Weasley was bitten by Remus Lupin last spring, during the infamous rescue of Severus Snape and Draco Malfoy from the Forbidden Forest on the Hogwarts grounds. During this incident, Ravenclaw prefect Evan Davies was 
k
illed, as well as former Bulgarian Seeker Viktor Krum. Azkaban inmate Peter Pettigrew was also apprehended, which in turn led to the exoneration of Sirius Black, now teaching Apparition at Hogwarts. At the time that he bit Weasley, Lupin was the Defense A
gainst the Dark Arts instructor at the school. He has since been very wisely replaced by Arabella Figg, although Dumbledore\rquote s appointment of Black (a friend of Lupin\rquote 
s) as a teacher shows that he still does not care about outside opinion of his teaching appointments. 
\par Unfortunately, it seems that anyone with knowledge of Weasley\rquote s condition was unlikely to know about the nearly-seventy-year-old rule against part-human players, and anyone who knew of the rule was unlikely to know of Weasley being bitten by Lu
pin. Other magical games and sports have not bothered to ban part-humans from play, and as a result, Weasley plans to participate in the annual broom race from Kopparberg to Arjeplog, Sweden, to take place on New Year\rquote 
s Eve, as always. Normally, when the s
pectators Apparate to Arjeplog to congratulate the survivors, there are numerous wounded players to tend to. This year, one may properly be afraid for the dragons instead, with a werewolf soon to be flying through their midst. The odds are expected to be 
v
ery short on Weasley and reports are already coming in that other racers are viewing his participation as patently unfair. This reporter has already learned that most wizarding bookmakers are not taking any bets on Weasley, and some are despairing of gett
ing any business at all related to the race, thanks to his participation. An emergency meeting of the Brotherhood of the Book is being called for next week to discuss whether to petition the Swedish Department of Magical Games and Sports to forbid Weasley
\rquote s participation. 
\par In related news, one bookmaker reportedly took a large number of bets on England from Hogwarts students who no doubt expected Weasley\rquote s side to win, due to his lycanthropy, and only the defeat of England is preventing an investigation into
 those bets. A separate investigation of that bookmaker is underway because it seems he took most of the bets from underage Hogwarts students.

\par Once again, Albus Dumbledore has a werewolf for a student at Hogwarts. The first time (as far as anyone knows, at any rate) it was Remus Lupin, who attended the school from 1971 to 1978 and was a good friend of Harry Potter\rquote s parents, Ja
mes Potter and Lily Potter (nee Evans), as well as Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew. Lupin\rquote s werewolf status was kept hushed up by Dumbledore, despite his almost killing a student early in his seventh year, according to old rumors. Lupin\rquote 
s werewolf status 
did not become common knowledge until June 1994, when Hogwarts Potions Master Severus Snape revealed to his students in Slytherin House that Professor Lupin (who was teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts that year) was in fact a werewolf. Lupin resigned 
h
is post soon after, under pressure from a large number of parents who petitioned the Board of Governors. It is still unclear why Lupin was reinstated during the previous academic year. (In recent years Dumbledore has had a remarkably difficult time retain
ing professors for this particular class.) Some whispers that have met this reporter\rquote 
s ears say that Snape was also the student Lupin nearly killed while in school, which certainly squares with his telling his students of the danger represented by their werewolf professor. 
\par }\pard \ql \li360\ri360\sb100\sa100\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin360\lin360\itap0 {\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
According to reliable sources, Lupin was already a werewolf when he began attending the school, while Weasley was not bitten until the end of his sixth year. It would probably be far too much to expect of Dumbledore that he expel the Quid
ditch captain for his former house, Gryffindor, which is also the house headed up by his deputy, Minerva McGonagall, especially as a lycanthrope would be virtually impossible to beat in a match and school rules do not preclude participation by part-humans
. However, this reporter has heard of some dangers that accompany living in close proximity with a werewolf that do not usually get much press, dangers that have traditionally been brushed under the carpet. 
\par While Hogwarts\rquote  Snape is an accomplished brewer o
f Wolfsbane Potion, which allows a werewolf to transform but keep his human mind and thus be similar to a tame wolf during the three-night transformation, it does require the subject to cooperate in taking the potion every day for a week preceding the ful
l moon. Teenage boys are not traditionally known for their adherence to routines such as this; one hopes that Dumbledore is making certain that Weasley is taking his potion at the proper time. 
\par The danger that is of greatest concern to this reporter, however, concerns a condition that afflicts werewolves just prior to the full moon and is not ameliorated by Wolfsbane Potion. During the twenty-four hours before the full moon rises, a werewolf fee
l
s an almost uncontrollable mania to engage in sexual activity with anyone--regardless of gender--who comes within close proximity. (Some reports say the proximity does not need to be very close at all.) Ministry records confirm that there are numerous wer
ewolves who have been convicted of aggravated assault and rape on dates that coincide with the eve of the full moon. A werewolf living in a boarding school would seem to be a very bad idea considering this danger to his fellow students. 
\par No information has 
been forthcoming from Albus Dumbledore about steps that have been taken to isolate Ronald Weasley from other students at this dangerous time. However, given that a student was nearly killed by Remus Lupin when he was in school, and he was still not expell
e
d, it is possible that even a student being violently assaulted by Weasley will not be seen as cause for his expulsion by Dumbledore, although even he will not be able to prevent the law from taking action against Weasley if--or when--this seemingly-inevi
table event occurs.

\par Harry looked at her grimly. \'93It\rquote s the dirty little secret of being a werewolf. Except that, thanks to Daisy Furuncle, it\rquote s no secret any more.\'94
 Then he looked at the other Gryffindor students, some of whom were passing other copies of the paper back and forth, their jaws dropping. \'93Come on,\'94 he said to her quietly. \'93This clearly isn\rquote t the place to discuss it.\'94
 She nodded and followed him into the entrance hall, evidently having forgotten her anger with him over what he\rquote d \'93done\'94 to Ginny. 
\par \'93Let\rquote s go up to class early,\'94 he suggested; they had Transfiguration first thing, and the other students wouldn\rquote

\par Hermione swallowed. \'93Oh,\'94 was all she said, in a very small voice. She walked slowly to the window and Harry joined her. 
Suddenly, they saw Ron running across the grounds, heading for the Whomping Willow. He broke a branch off a tree growing about twenty feet away from it and used this to hit the knot on the tree roots that would freeze the branches. They watched him disapp
ear into the tunnel and the willow begin to wave its appendages again. 
\par \'93I don\rquote t think we\rquote ll be seeing much of him today,\'94 Harry said, putting his hand on her arm protectively. \'93This is terribly embarrassing for him. He obviously needs time alone. We can ma

 Hermione seemed to be as reluctant as him to provide Draco Malfoy with a way to explain away his behavior. 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93Who knows, really? Mariah claims she didn\rquote t use her selkie wiles on him. I don\rquote

d still been under the influence of the Imperius Potion. He still wished he\rquote d known all along that it was a potion affecting her behavior that year...

\par She didn\rquote t look at him but continued to face straight ahead, moving purposefully. \'93Do you think you\rquote re the only one who wants to find out why Dumbledore wasn\rquote t at the match?\'94
 she asked him as she picked up speed. Harry smiled and sped up himself, shaking his head, and they reached the gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledore\rquote s office just as the bell rang marking the beginning of the first class of the 
day. Clearly, Hermione had no compunctions about using her Head Girl status to avoid being punished for tardiness. Besides, it wasn\rquote t as though either of them were doing poorly in Transfiguration--they }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 had}{

\par Harry gave the password to the gargoyle, and it moved out of the way, allowing them to enter and move up to Dumbledore\rquote 
s office on the moving spiral stairs. When they reached the door, it was slightly ajar, and they pushed it open uncertainly. The headm
aster was not in his office, but they heard his voice coming from behind another partially-open door on the other side of the room. Feeling rather conspicuous, and trying not to be bothered by some of the portraits of former headmasters and headmistresses
, who had awoken and were frowning deeply at him, he moved cautiously toward the other door, Hermione right behind him. 
\par \'93--wish you would stop this!\'94 they heard Professor McGonagall. They looked at each other, eyebrows raised. McGonagall would be late to class at this rate, which was unheard-of for her. 
\par \'93Minerva,\'94 came a weak-sounding, raspy version of Dumbledore\rquote s voice, \'93you\rquote re the one who\rquote s been telling me for years about the things I haven\rquote t been }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 willing}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to do. I\rquote m willing now, and yet you tell me to stop. You knew that this would have a price, as I did also. If I stop, it will all have been for nought. Hasn\rquote t it been quiet lately? Hasn\rquote

\par They heard McGonagall make a huffing noise. \'93In spite of that, someone }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  trying to hurt Harry yesterday. Someone charmed a Bludger to go after him...\'94 
\par Dumbledore sighed, producing an eerie sound that rattled through his chest. \'93He had people looking out for him there. The operatives, Aurors...I trusted that they would protect him from any dangers. And he\rquote s fine, isn\rquote t he?\'94 
\par \'93You\rquote re not,\'94 she said, speaking more softly; she seemed both to be chiding him and sympathizing. 
\par That painful rattle again. \'93I will be, Minerva. It\rquote s more of a strain than I expected, but it does seem that it has proven somewhat effective...\'94 
\par \'93And how much longer can you go on like this? What if he manages to overcome you? Or worse...\'94 
\par There was a long pause. \'93Then we will be no worse off than we were before, and perhaps better
, as we will know for certain that a particular avenue is no longer open to us. This is not without its risks, Minerva; why do you think I hesitated to take this step the first time he was in power? Don\rquote 
t worry about me. Poppy will be by presently with my potion, and I will feel a little better. You should go teach....the students are unattended....\'94 
\par \'93No, they\rquote ll be fine. Harry and Hermione are in my first class. I daresay the Head Boy and Head Girl, not to mention two Animagi, can find ways to keep the class occupied until I get there.\'94 
\par They looked at each other in alarm and did their best to quietly slip out of the room again, then went as quickly as they could down the spiral stairs and ran with their hearts in their throats back to the Transfiguration 
classroom. When they arrived, they encountered more than a little pandemonium, but soon, with help from the other prefects (Malfoy was oddly helpful, throwing Harry sly looks out of the corner of his eye that Harry didn\rquote 
t like) the class settled down, and they were in small groups, transfiguring their desk chairs, when McGonagall arrived. She nodded with approval at Harry and Hermione, and, as far as Harry knew, no one ever told her that the Head Girl and Boy hadn
\rquote t been present when the bell had rung for the start of class.

\rquote t discuss what they\rquote d heard in the headmaster\rquote s office that morning. 
\par When they were near--but not too near-- the Whomping Willow, Hermione did a banishing charm on a small stone that landed with pinpoint precision on the knot that would freeze the tree\rquote s branches. Harry shook his head, smiling. \'93
Well, I can summon things. I suppose your specialty is banishing...\'94 
\par But this didn\rquote t seem to make her very happy. \'93Yes,\'94 she said miserably. \'93I seem to be very good at banishing }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 boyfriends}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ...\'94

\par She didn\rquote t respond but went ahead of him into the tunnel leading them to the reconstructed Shrieking Shack. As they drew nearer, they heard some very loud bangs and grunts, as though someone was hurling a large dresser about inside the house, a
nd when they reached the interior, which still smelled of new-sawn wood, Ron wasn\rquote t in the first room they came to, and the banging noises were considerably louder. 
\par Hermione looked like she wanted to hold her ears, but as she was holding a large pitcher of pumpkin juice with both hands, she could not, and merely winced at every impact. He was manually carrying a rather heavy picnic hamper, wishing he\rquote 
d thought to levitate it. The noise would make it impossible to concentrate enough now to perform just about any spell. Harry already felt a headache coming on from the racket. 
\par They followed the banging noises up the stairs, staying near the wall and away from the rickety banister, which appeared to have been attacked. Some of the balusters looked like they\rquote d 
been yanked out of the stair treads and used to beat the rest of the railing into submission; there were a number of smashed balusters, sharp splintery bits sticking out at odd angles, the fresh smell of the broken wood starting to make Harry\rquote 
s nose tickle. 
\par They found him in a room at the end of the upstairs corridor; after the fire, the house had been rebuilt, but not refurnished, and they discovered that, with the lack of furniture to attack, Ron had resorted to dissecting the house itself. He was hurlin
g himself at what had been a six-paneled door, kicking it into smithereens, then putting his fist through another door on the opposite side of the room, with moves Harry had only ever seen in martial arts films on television late at night (and probably en
hanced by special effects technology). Ron didn\rquote t need \'93special effects.\'94 The house would be dismantled by morning at this rate. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Ron!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 Harry bellowed, trying to interrupt the Shrieking Shack\rquote s destruction. 
\par Ron stopped, poised to leap again. He turned, but looked unsurprised at seeing them. \'93Smelled you coming,\'94
 he said, panting, sweat dripping off his bare chest. He was wearing only his trousers; his other clothes and his robes were in a pile in the corner. 
Curling red covered his torso, and the hair on his arms was thicker than usual as well, as it was only about thirty hours before the full moon. Harry knew it would grow thicker still as the hours passed. Ron pushed his sweaty hair off his forehead with th
e back of his hand and sniffed the air. \'93Chicken? Didn\rquote t they have any ham? For some reason I feel like ham today. Or rabbit. That would have been good, too. Something gamy.\'94 
\par He seemed determined not to discuss the Daisy Furuncle articles and Harry glanced at Hermione to see what she was going to do. 
\par She set the pitcher down on the floor and sat, saying to him, \'93Come have some lunch, Ron. We brought what we could. The elves were busy getting lunch ready for the rest of the school. We\rquote ll stay and eat with you, keep you company.\'94
 Her voice was shaking a little, and Harry saw her eyes furtively going toward the splintered doors. 
\par Harry set down the hamper and started taking plates out of it for the food. \'93Yeah. Come on. Can\rquote t destroy an entire house on an empty stomach,\'94 he tried to joke. No one laughed. 
\par It was an awkward lunch and Harry and Hermione packed up again as quickly as possible. \'93I\rquote ll leave the hamper here, Ron. There\rquote s some food in it you can have for dinner. I suppose by then--\'94 He swallowed. Ron nodded. 
\par \'93By then I won\rquote t be fit for human company. Somehow--somehow knowing that everyone }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 knows}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  is just making me feel }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 worse.}{

azed at Hermione, his chest heaving. She looked somewhat startled, but did not back away or flee; she continued to gaze back at him. Harry could see a red light in Ron\rquote 
s eyes, and wondered whether, if he lunged for Hermione, he should let him or tear her away from him. And then Ron turned and looked at Harry, not saying anything, and Harry was startled to see lust in the gaze directed at }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  as well. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 This}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he had not been expecting. 
\par Ron shuddered, then sat down abruptly in a lotus position; he closed his ey
es and put his hands palm-up on his knees, emitting a low humming noise, as though he was desperate to do something that would not make him feel like he wanted to attack both of them. He still looked as though his breathing was far too fast, and Harry cou
ld see a vein pulsing quickly in his temple, his nostrils flaring as he continued to breathe in Harry and Hermione\rquote s scents. 
\par Harry stood and took Hermione\rquote s hand, starting to back away; Ron seemed to be attempting to control himself using something Remus Lupin had taught him. Hopefully it would work... 
\par \'93We should go,\'94 Harry croaked out; his throat didn\rquote t seem to be working quite right. Without opening his eyes to look at them, Ron nodded vigorously, still humming and meditating, but still looking like he m
ight jump them at any second. As they left, Harry saw how he was shivering, how much of an effort it was for him not to come after them. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 It\rquote ll only get worse,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 Harry knew. 
\par They pattered quickly down the steps; Harry felt like his own heartbeat was abnormally fast, and he could see that Hermione was looking flushed and panicky as well. When he reached the bottom, Harry yelled up the stairs, \'93We\rquote 
ll come in the morning with some breakfast for you! And Snape will bring your Wolfsbane Potion!\'94 
\par \'93Don\rquote t come without him!\'94 Ron cried. \'93It\rquote s not a good idea!\'94
 Harry thought about this; how had the Potions Master been coping with giving Ron his potion just before the full moon? But then again--Snape was an adult wizard, who probably would have no trouble hexing Ron if he tried to pull anything funny. }{

\par \'93All right! See you then!\'94 
\par \'93Right! Now sod off!\'94 The humming resumed, louder. 
\par \'93We\rquote re going!\'94 Harry called, urging Hermione toward the tunnel. She didn\rquote t need prodding though, and was down under the ground again and running through the passage a good twenty feet ahead of Harry. When they\rquote 
d stopped the branches again and emerged from the tunnel, they both collapsed on the ground just beyond the reach of the willow. Hermione\rquote s face was pale and drawn and she looked up at Harry forlornly. 
\par \'93He looked very bad,\'94 she said simply. He nodded. 
\par \'93I helped him stay away from others at this time last month, but it\rquote s not easy, when you can\rquote t say what the problem is...\'94 
\par She looked at him, her eyes narrowed. \'93So--he\rquote d even--even do it with }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  if you were--\'94 
\par Harry nodded grimly. \'93Yeah. But he doesn\rquote t want to do that, obviously. We don\rquote t have }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that sort}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  of friendship.\'94

\par She swallowed. \'93I see what you mean,\'94 she said softly. She looked back sadly at the tree, the branches waving wildly against the sky. 
\par They needed to go back to
 the castle, to meet Sirius and the other seventh-year Gryffindors and Slytherins to go into the village for their Apparition lesson, which was something Ron could never do. She got to her feet; Harry wrapped an arm around her shoulder protectively, and s
he sighed and leaned her head on him as they walked back to the castle.

, Harry thought as they sat together at a table near the windows in the common room, writing essays about some of the more spectacular
 splinching incidents of the early twentieth century. Sirius had started letting some of them carefully Apparate a short distances--just a yard or two, although soon they would try from one side of the village hall to the other. They all had to make certa
i
n that there was no furniture around them, in case they splinched a chair into their bodies. Some of the Slytherins had laughed about this precaution, so Sirius had testily assigned a three-foot long splinching essay to the entire class, so they would kno
w that it was no laughing matter. 
\par Harry looked up at where Ginny sat near the fire with Ruth Pelta, Zoey Russell and Annika Olafsdottir. They were doing homework for Sprout, also writing essays, and Ginny looked very serious. She raised her eyes to his at 
one point, no longer looking angry with him but just very, very sad. 
\par \'93Oh, bother!\'94 Ruth said, throwing down her quill. \'93I\rquote ll never get this right--Tony!\'94 she called to her boyfriend across the room, where he was playing cards with his dormmate, Colin Creevey. \'93Are you done your homework for Sprout?
\'94 
\par \'93Well, kind of,\'94 Tony said sheepishly. \'93I just wrote some things off the top of my head. I\rquote ll probably get the lowest mark in the class. Just wanted to get it over with....\'94 Ruth rolled her eyes at him. Harry 
tried not to smile; Tony and Ruth were suddenly reminding him of Ron and Hermione (in happier times). \'93Ask Neville for help,\'94 Tony said, nodding at where Neville was cleaning Trevor\rquote s terrarium. \'93He\rquote s Mr. Herbology.\'94 
\par Neville raised his head at the mention of his name. \'93Huh?\'94 he said, holding a box of Mrs. Scower\rquote s magical cleansing powder in one hand and a cleaning flannel in the other. 
\par Ginny smiled warmly at him. \'93You\rquote re the resident expert in Herbology, Neville. Care to help us sixth-year girls with some essays for Sprout?\'94 Harry saw Neville\rquote 
s jaw drop, and then he swallowed. He practically threw down the things in his hands and ran across the room to the girls; Ginny slid down onto the floor in front of her chair and patted the rug next to her. \'93Sit here, Neville. Tell me, is }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 this}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  the proper name of the genus of the Flowering Worrywort, or is }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 this}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 --?\'94
 she said, pointing to her parchment with a long quill. 
\par Harry saw that their heads were very close together, their vo
ices getting lower. He swallowed, then looked down, trying not to jump across the room and throttle Neville. He felt a hand on his then, and looked up, saw Hermione gazing at him sympathetically. He nodded at her. She didn\rquote 
t remove her hand and he turned his over, clasping hers tightly; she was all he had to hold onto right now, and he was all she had. 
\par After dinner, she kissed him goodnight on the cheek and whispered in his ear, \'93She might come round, you know.\'94 She glanced at Ginny, who was sitting with Neville and laughing at something he\rquote 
d said; Neville, for his part, looked rather shocked, and then pleased that he\rquote d amused her. Harry leaned down and kissed her on the cheek.

 Mariah Kirkner there, so after they prepared themselves for running, they left, just the four of them. Harry felt it was far pleasanter than the day before; the four of them chatted amiably and helped each other stretch before and after and do sit-ups, a

 which way Hermione had run, and finally saw that her legs were pumping furiously as she ran flat-out for Hagrid\rquote s hut. He looked around furtively for a moment, decided that it just plain didn\rquote 
t matter if anyone saw him, and changed into his griffin form. He took a couple of running steps and leapt into the air, moving his wings back and forth vigorously, soon overtaking her and spiraling down behind Hagrid\rquote s hut. 
\par Hagrid happened at just that moment to be opening his back door, to do his morning gardening,
 and he yelled out in surprise when he saw a golden griffin landing in his pumpkin patch, folding his gossamer wings against tawny flanks. Harry looked up at his friend, panicking, as he hadn\rquote

\par \'93Huh!\'94 he boomed. \'93A golden griffin! Are ye by any chance that one me mum used to see, flyin\rquote  over the forest?\'94 he asked, as though it could speak. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Well}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , Harry thought, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I might as well admit it.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  He moved his head up and do
wn very distinctly. It was unmistakably a nod. Hagrid looked floored. 
\par \'93Well, I\rquote ll be--\'94 
\par Harry loped forward with his rolling lion\rquote s gait and pushed his wet nose at Hagrid\rquote s hand. Hagrid grinned down at him and stroked his mane, shaking his own head. \'93I\rquote ll jest bet ye\rquote d like a nice joint o\rquote  mutton, eh?
\'94 he said in a gruff, friendly way; Hagrid had met very few magical beasts he didn\rquote t like, and even though he didn\rquote t know that this was Harry, somehow he seemed to know that the griffin was a friend. 
\par Hagrid
 led him into the hut; Harry walked to the hearth rug and sat down on it, his front paws lined up in front of him while Hagrid went to the larder. A moment later, Hermione had evidently reached the hut; Harry heard her pounding on the door. Hagrid checked
 
the clock on his mantel. The first bell was going to ring for the beginning of classes in about ten minutes. He looked like he thought he might be dreaming to have two visitors at this time, when students should be on their way to various classrooms. He s
trode to the front door of the hut and opened it. 
\par \'93Hermione!\'94 he cried in surprise when he saw her, completely flummoxed. Tears were streaming down her face. 
\par \'93Oh--Ha--Ha--}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Hagrid}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 !\'94 she choked. Then she noticed Harry siting decorously on the floor near the fire. \'93Harry!\'94
 she cried gratefully, springing across the room and throwing her arms around his neck. She buried her face in his mane and it was soon wet with her tears; he nuzzled her cheek with his nose and let her hug him and cry on him in his griffin f
orm, thinking that this was probably even more comforting than if he\rquote 
d been his usual human self. Harry looked up at Hagrid with his large green eyes (rather than the usual amber eyes that golden griffins tended to have) and Hagrid opened his own eyes very wide, seeing it now, seeing the truth. 
\par \'93Blimey!\'94 Hagrid cried, sitting down heavily in the oversized leather chair he used by the fireside. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Harry}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94
 he asked tentatively, staring at the griffin. Harry slowly nodded his head again, but soon went back to t
rying to comfort Hermione. He put a paw across her shoulders and felt her cheek on his mane. At length, his inner motor, the constant purr, seemed to quieten her, and they just crouched on the hearth rug together, human and beast, giving and receiving com
fort.

When Hermione was all cried out, Harry changed back into his human form and stood, feeling like his bones would cry out in pain if they had voices. He hadn\rquote t really had time to prepare for the transfiguration, and, as he always did when he 
executed an abrupt change into his Animagus form, he felt it in his joints afterward. He tried to shake out his arms and legs, and when he was done, Hermione was looking at him forlornly, so he found that he had to take her in his arms again and hold her 
and rock her some more. She started to open her mouth, but Harry stopped her with a gentle hand on her arm. 
\par \'93Hagrid,\'94 he said, looking at the half-giant; \'93I know this is your place and all, but do you think--we need to talk for a bit--\'94 
\par Hagrid squinted at him in non-comprehension at first, then his eyes opened wide and he lumbered to his feet. \'93Oh, yeah, o\rquote course ye can have some privvacy. I don\rquote  have a class firs\rquote  thing today, but me third year Hufflepuffs 
\lquote n\rquote  Ravenclaws\rquote ll be along soon for theirs...I\rquote ll just, er--be over in the paddock with the unicorns, if ye need anythin\rquote --\'94 
\par When Hagrid had closed the door behind him, Harry made Hermione sit in the large chair by the fire that Hagrid had vacated (when she sat back all the way her feet didn\rquote t touch the
 floor) and began to heat some water for tea. They were silent as Harry moved about, handing her a cup and saucer, putting the tea leaves in the teapot. When the tea was steeped and poured and Harry had added some milk to his, the white swirling into the 
brown, they still hadn\rquote t spoken. He finally said something, just to fill the silence. \'93We missed Charms. And soon we\rquote ll be missing History of Magic,\'94 he said quietly. Then he wished he hadn\rquote 
t spoken, as these things sounded unbearably banal. 
\par However, Hermione behaved as though the silence were still unbroken. She sipped her tea and then said suddenly, \'93You\rquote re going to tell me it isn\rquote t his fault.\'94 Her voice was still a little thick with tears. 
\par Harry sat next to her chair on the same low stool he\rquote d been using since he first came to Hagrid\rquote s hut when he was eleven. \'93It }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 isn\rquote t}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, Hermione. Okay, he should have told you sooner; you shouldn\rquote t have had to find out through that Daisy Furuncle article...\'94 
\par \'93No, I mean--I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 know}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  it isn\rquote t his fault, Harry.\'94 
\par Harry heaved a sigh of relief. \'93I\rquote m so glad to hear you say that, Hermione. I thought--well, you rather reminded me of Ginny when--well, you know--\'94 
\par Hermione squinted at him as though he were speaking some language other than English. \'93What are you talking about?\'94 
\par Harry stared back at her in mutual noncomprehension. \'93What do you mean, \lquote What are you talking about?\rquote  You know--when Ginny saw me in the amulet with Mariah and was so upset--\'94 
\par Hermione\rquote s eyes widened. \'93Oh--}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that\rquote s}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  what you meant.\'94 Harry was baffled. Why was she acting like it had been ten years or something? 
\par \'93Um, yes. Well anyway, I think clearly the problem lies with Parvati--\'94 
\par Hermione shook her head. \'93Partly, yes. But if Daisy Furuncle hadn\rquote t written that article--\'94 Harry could tell she was seething about
 this now. He almost felt sorry for Daisy Furuncle; Hermione Granger would leave no stone unturned to find out who she was. \'93She has to be stopped.\'94 
\par He nodded in agreement and took a comforting sip of tea. \'93True. But if Sirius and Remus couldn\rquote t find out who she was from all of their spying and snooping this summer, what makes you think you can find out from the confines of Hogwarts?\'94 

\par Hermione looked very smug. Her words, however, did not match her expression. \'93I don\rquote t know,\'94 she said, still oddly smug. \'93But I\rquote ll find a way.\'94
 Harry drew his lips into a line, wondering how much tilting at windmills she would be doing. 
\par \'93Um, you should know that after you left, Snape examined Parvati and he said she had concussion and had lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious.\'94 
\par This seemed to have no affect on her. Hermione sipped her tea; then, staring into the fire, said, \'93She probably reckoned she knew what was involved in being with him. She\rquote d been with him before....\'94 
\par He could tell that it pained her to say this; Harry knew that she tried very hard to forget Ron\rquote s relationship with Parvati. \'93But not when he was a werewolf,\'94 Harry pointed out. \'93She probably just thought--thought that she could help him--
\'94 
\par \'93Or thought that he wouldn\rquote t have the strength to resist her and then she could get back at me for that--that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 name}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  thing!\'94 Hermione spat. 
\par Okay, Harry thought; I reckon she blames Parvati more than just a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 little.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  She sipped her tea some more and frowned into the fire; she seemed to be thinking very hard. \'93There
\rquote s something wrong here, though. I just can\rquote t put my finger on it...\'94
 She drained her cup and continued to hold it before her, watching the flames, her eyes narrowed in thought. Harry also drained his cup and almost dropped it when she suddenly stood and said, \'93I\rquote ve got it!\'94 
\par She whirled on Harry. \'93That wasn\rquote t Parvati getting back at me for the name thing. It was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Padma}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 !\'94 
\par Harry shook his head as though to clear his hearing. Had she said what he thought she had said? \'93Padma? How do you know?\'94 
\par She paced as she spoke, restless, as she often was when working out a problem of some sort. \'93
Last night, Parvati and Lavender and I all went up to bed together. And Parvati was in her bed when I got up this morning. Not just under the covers, snoring; I co
uld see her face and everything. When we found her--or her twin, rather--with Ron in the shack, I completely forgot. I wonder....at one time Ron seemed like he might be interested in either one of them, and then chose Parvati. You think Padma has been res
entful about that all this time, and found a way to get to Ron without his being able to resist her? Is it possible she was doing this because of a rivalry with her own }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 twin}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?
\'94 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93Dunno. Could be. Which means, if you think that was Padma, we s
hould get up to the hospital wing and tell Madam Pomfrey. For the record, you know, in case there are any differences between them in their medical histories, even though they\rquote re identical twins.\'94 
\par \'93Right,\'94 she said. 
\par She strode toward the door, her eyes clear now, although there were purple shadows under them. When she touched the door handle, Harry stopped her, looking into her face with concern. \'93Are you about to go off half-cocked?\'94
 he asked her, quite serious. She frowned at him. 
\par \'93Whatever do you mean?\'94 
\par \'93Well--I suppose what I mean is, are you about to attack a girl--verbally or otherwise--who may be unconscious still because of the injuries she received from Ron? And are you telling me that you feel Ron is }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
completely}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  blameless? This isn\rquote t going to come back to haunt him the next time the two of you have a row? You\rquote re not going to bury your resentment and--\'94 
\par \'93I get it, I get it, Harry.\'94 She turned and leaned heavily on the door, looking very tired. \'93Yes, I suppose I wish with a part of me that Ron had been stronger, that he\rquote 
d been able to resist her, to fight his werewolf urges. Remus has learned to manage. On the other hand, Remus has had years and years to learn how; Ron was only bitten five months ago. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Five months!}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Almost no time at all. How is he expected to cope with this sort of thing already? He\rquote s shown remarkable improvement in dealing with his strength; it\rquote 
s been weeks since I last saw him break a glass just by picking it up. I just--\'94 She let out an uncontrolled sob, and covered her mouth with her hand; \'93I just wish he\rquote d never been bitten,\'94
 she said through her fingers. She tried to collect herself and took her hand down from her mouth, and now she was wringing her hands together. \'93And yes, I know that\rquote s not a useful thought to have, because he }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  bitten. And I can wish Rita Skeeter and Peter Pettigrew dead all I want and nothing will change. The moon will rise full tonight and Ron will become a wolf, which will }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 hurt}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , and he won\rquote t have any control over it the way we do when }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 we}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  transform into an
imals. And it will happen the following two nights, and every month for the rest of Ron\rquote s life. And there\rquote s nothing to be done for it except for him to drink the world\rquote 
s vilest potion and try to stay away from people before the full moon. And even when he tries to do that--some stupid girl who hasn\rquote t any idea what she\rquote 
s doing manages to sneak in to see him and risks her neck, which will wind up being blamed on }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Ron}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , judging from the article that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 cow}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  wrote, and--and--\'94 
\par She started crying again and Harry took her into his arms. She sobbed on his chest while he patted her on the back and shushed her lightly. 
\par When she was done crying this time, she stepped away from him suddenly and opened the door, then strode outdoors and went to the large barrel Hagrid used 
to catch rainwater; she thrust both hands into the barrel and splashed some water on her face, then dried her skin with a handkerchief. She lifted her face to Harry, asking him, \'93How do I look?\'94 
\par Her brown eyes were slightly bloodshot, rimmed with red and underscored by purple. Her nose was a deep rose color (it looked like she\rquote d either been crying or trying to get drunk), her cheeks were sallow, her lips pale and chapped. 
\par \'93Erm,\'94 he said uncertainly, \'93you look fine.\'94 Surely the truth wouldn\rquote t be helpful at this moment. 
\par She nodded and turned briskly. \'93Are you coming?\'94 
\par He walked alongside her. \'93Right. Hospital wing.\'94 
\par She nodded again and walked more quickly, swinging her arms purposefully. Harry kept up with her, although he felt like a world-weariness had seeped into his soul. One thing that he could be glad about was that Hermione didn\rquote 
t blame Ron; it would be difficult, but they }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 could}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  go on after this. She wasn\rquote t going to tell him to go to hell, as Ginny had done with }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . 
\par When they reached the hospital
 wing, Hermione put her hand on the door knob and hesitated just a moment before opening it. Then she took a deep breath, set her jaw and turned the knob. In the infirmary, they found Ron in a bed near the door and Padma in a bed on the opposite side of t
he room, closest to Madam Pomfrey\rquote s office; the matron was nowhere in sight. Harry and Hermione hurried to Ron\rquote 
s bedside; glancing over his shoulder, Harry saw that Padma was unconscious, but her chest was rising and falling with a better rhythm than when he\rquote d seen her in the Shrieking Shack. 
\par Ron was sitting up in bed, bare-chested, with glistening liniment adorning various scratches he bore on his chest and arms. Frankly, Harry thought, it seemed that Padma had gotten a bit rough with Ron, as well. Ron swa
llowed as he looked at the two of them, then practically snarled, \'93What are you two doing here?\'94 
\par Harry grimaced. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Don\rquote t tell me we\rquote re going through this all over again,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought, remembering the way Ron had immediately rejected Hermione after being bitte
n in the spring. \'93What do you think, you prat? We\rquote re only your best friends.\'94 He forced a smile, feeling that it was wiser to lump him and Hermione together at this point, rather than distinguishing her as Ron\rquote s girlfriend. 
\par \'93You really want to be best friends with a monster who would do }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to someone?\'94 he said bitterly, nodding at Padma. \'93
Or who--who would sleep with some other girl when he had the most wonderful--the best--\'94 he choked out, looking at Hermione with tears in his eyes, making them appear very blue. 
\par \'93What do you mean }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 had}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 she demanded suddenly. \'93I--I know it wasn\rquote t your fault, Ron,\'94
 she said softly, her back turned to Padma as though she was determined to forget the other girl existed. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 As though her sanity depended upon it}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , Harry thought. 
\par Ron shook his head bleakly. \'93I should have gone to the dungeons; it would have been a lot harder for someone to get near me if I was properly locked up. She said she followed the two of you when you came to bring me lunch yesterday, so sh
e knew how to get into the tunnel. Hid in the shrubbery and saw you hit the knot. She said she didn\rquote t know where the tunnel would take her and was really surprised when it turned out to be the rebuilt Shrieking Shack. There\rquote 
d been a story put about that it was rebuilt so that the ghosts who lived there wouldn\rquote t try to find new homes in the village, as most people who have household ghosts are comfortable with them and don\rquote t want new ones, and folks who don
\rquote t have \lquote em don\rquote t want to start.\'94 
\par He looked past Harry and Hermione now, gazing at Padma. \'93She let herself in after dinner last night. By then I was going mad, and then--I smelled her. I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 knew}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 it was her. And I felt like--like I was going to go mad. She came into the room and I--I tried not to touch her. I 
really did. I begged her to stun me or something, leave me lying on the floor stupefied all night. It was all I could think of. But--but she just kept coming toward me--\'94 
\par He looked at Hermione, pleading in his eyes. \'93I didn\rquote t want to, Hermione. I really didn\rquote t...\'94 
\par \'93I believe you, Ron! Oh, I do!\'94 She sat on the edge of the bed and put her hand on his cheek. She was crying and then Harry saw, to his shock, that Ron was also, quiet tears running down his cheeks. He put his hand over hers, holding it and kiss
ing the palm briefly; he brought their joined hands down then and laid hers on her lap, looking very sad, as though he were relinquishing his right to it. 
\par \'93Are you sure?\'94 he said with a shake in his voice. \'93Because--if you didn\rquote t--it would be so much easier--easier to--\'94 He couldn\rquote t continue. 
\par \'93What?\'94 she wanted to know. 
\par He pointed at Padma\rquote s prostrate form. \'93Well, just look at her! Apparently when--when she was--I mean when--when I was--\'94 he swallowed; \'93on top of her,\'94 he choked out, \'93I--I was pounding h
er head on the floor; I was holding her head in my hands and--and }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 pounding}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  it on the floorboards--\'94 He covered his eyes with his hand, then whispered, \'93There\rquote 
s--there\rquote s a dent. In the floor. It\rquote s a wonder I didn\rquote t twist her head right off--\'94 
\par Harry\rquote s stomach clenched, and he glanced at Padma, glad that she was alive, that Ron couldn\rquote t be charged with her murder. Ron was looking at her too, shaking his head. \'93I hurt her feelings so badly before, when we broke up, and now I
\rquote ve hurt her like this....She doesn\rquote t deserve it, even if she }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 did}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  sneak in to see me. No one deserves to be treated like that....\'94 
\par He looked at Hermione pointedly, and Harry realized that he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  pushing her away again, the stupid prat. But Hermione was focusing on something else. 
\par \'93But that\rquote s not Parvati, Ron,\'94 she told him, her eyes clear, as though he hadn\rquote t just implied that he had no intention of ever sleeping with her, or even continuing to be her boyfriend. 
\par Ron frowned. \'93What? Of course she is.\'94 
\par Hermione shook her head vigorously. \'93No; when I went to bed last night, Parvati was with me and Lavender. And this morning, when I got up to go running, she was still asleep. That\rquote s Padma!\'94 she exclaimed, pointing at the unconscious girl. 
\'93She wanted you to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 think}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  she was Parvati.\'94 
\par Ron frowned. \'93But why? Why would she do that?\'94 He squinted at the other girl. \'93Are you sure? I thought--I was so certain she was Parvati. She }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 smelled}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 like Parvati...I mean that in a good way....\'94 he started to say, then stopped, clearly realizing that Hermione didn\rquote t want to hear about whether Ron liked the way Parvati smelled. 
\par But suddenly, Harry wasn\rquote t so sure. He paced, as Hermione had, trying to work out what seemed so wrong to him.... 
\par \'93Wait!\'94 he cried suddenly, making the other two goggle at him. \'93You were right, Ron! That }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 is}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Parvati!\'94 
\par Ron looked at him as though he were mad. \'93What? I thought Hermione just said Parvati was in the dorm all night--\'94 
\par \'93--because Padma wanted Hermione to think }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 she}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  was Parvati. It wasn\rquote t }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 Padma was trying to fool, Ron.\'94 He turned to Hermione. \'93It was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 !\'94 
\par \'93Me? Whatever are you talking about, Harry?\'94 Hermione looked utterly baffled, which wasn't an expression Harry could remember seeing on her face very often. 
\par \'93When I was about to go into the tunnel with you and Snape this morning, Sandy said to me, \lquote The fish has come to the wolf.\rquote  See, when we were in fifth year and I took Sandy with me to Divination, she said to me at one point, \lquote 
A fish shall burn.\rquote  And that was the class when Parvati put her sleeve in the candle and her robes caught fire...\'94 
\par \'93Yeah, and you drenched the rest of us putting it out,\'94 Ron added, reminding him of his mistake with the spells--a mistake he hadn\rquote t made since. 
\par \'93So?\'94 Hermione said, shrugging. 
\par \'93So?\'94 Harry echoed her. \'93Parvati is a Pisces; Sandy was referring to her by the symbol of her astrological sign. And then she did it again this morning; \lquote The fish has come to the wolf.\rquote  Parvati\rquote 
s the fish. Sandy does that a lot.\'94 
\par Hermione looked at the other girl. \'93But--but she and her sister are twins. Couldn\rquote t Sandy just as easily have been talking about Padma?\'94 
\par Harry shook his head. \'93No. They don\rquote t even have the same birthday; they\rquote re each born on one side of midnight, on the cusp between Aquarius and Pisces. Padma is Aquarius, the water bearer. Parvati is the fish. }{

 who slept in your dormitory last night, so you wouldn\rquote t wonder where Parvati was and suspect--well, that she\rquote d done what she\rquote d done...\'94 
\par Hermione looked at the girl with her mouth open. Harry\rquote s head felt like it was spinning. He could have sworn that he found Parvati with Ron that morning, then since he\rquote d entered the infirmary, he\rquote 
d been thinking that she was Padma; now he had to switch to thinking of her as Parvati again... 
\par Ron grimaced. \'93It doesn\rquote 
t really matter, though, does it? So Padma helped her sister. Practically helped her into a grave is what she did. Parvati has never been anything but--but good and kind to me since we started seeing each other. Then I hurt 
her dreadfully and she broke up with me. And now I\rquote ve almost killed her.\'94
 Harry could see how it pained Hermione to hear him speak so kindly of Parvati; Harry wondered now whether Ron had had at least some feelings for her when they were still seeing each other; surely the time he\rquote 
d seen them kissing madly in a classroom Ron hadn\rquote t been indifferent to her? And they\rquote d been very close after surviving the collapse of the Three Broomsticks, sweetly protective of each other. He knew that Hermione had noticed thi
s as well; he remembered her watching them at the site of the explosion. After she had flung herself at Ron. But it had been no good; there was no way Ron had been able to forget Hermione, to get her out of his mind, and with a single slip of the tongue, 
he and Parvati were history... 
\par But it was clear now that Parvati had only done that because of her self-respect, her pride. She hadn\rquote t }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 really}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  wanted to give him up. And the previous evening, she
\rquote d tried to take him back. 
\par Ron turned his head, not looking at either one of them. \'93I\rquote m never going to risk that again. Never. I\rquote m not safe.\'94 
\par Harry looked at Hermione and she frowned back at him. \'93Ron, just give it time--\'94 he started to say. His friend turned furious eyes to him, a red glint dancing there. 
\par \'93I\rquote m not changing my mind. I\rquote m a monster and should be treated that way, as dangerous. I let the two of you convince me before that I could live a normal life, that I could be like other people. You meant well, but it\rquote 
s just not possible.\'94 He put his hand over Hermione\rquote s and stroked it. \'93I wish it were, but it\rquote s just not.\'94 He looked Harry in the eye. \'93I\rquote m sorry about the whole thing with Ginny, Harry. But--well, since you\rquote 
re unattached, and Hermione--well, maybe you two should try to make a go of it again. Without having me to worry about. You don\rquote t need to sneak about or anything. You--you have my blessing--\'94
 he tried to say, but the final word half-died in his throat, and he had to look away from them. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 No.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Ron looked up at Hermione, who had stood and was glaring at him with her hands on her hips. \'93You did the same thing right after you were bitten. You will }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  a monster and }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 she}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  brought this on herself. So just--so just }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 shut up}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 !\'94 she cried, turning on her heel and storming out of the infirmary, making the glass in the door rattle when she slammed it behind her. 
\par Ron stared at the door, then looked at Harry. \'93Did she--did she just }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 forbid}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  me to break up with her?\'94 
\par \'93I think so,\'94 he said, still somewhat taken aback by Hermione\rquote s performance. 
\par Ron shook his head. \'93She wants to think she\rquote s in charge, but this is beyond her control.\'94 He looked more serious than Harry had ever seen him. \'93Harry--I want you take good care of Hermione. When I\rquote m gone.\'94
 Harry opened his mouth to protest, but suddenly, Ron was going on, saying, \'93Do you know where Sirius lives? I mean--where his rooms are in the staff wing?\'94 
\par Harry was thrown. \'93I\rquote ve seen the rooms where my aunt and Mrs. Fi--I mean, Professor Figg live. Or at least, I\rquote ve seen the sitting room they share. And Maggie\rquote s, of course, when we had tea there. Don\rquote t know about Sirius. He
\rquote s away a lot, when he\rquote s not teaching, because of--you know.\'94 Harry wondered if Sirius was spying on Rodney Jeffries at that very moment. 
\par Ron nodded. \'93Well, try to find out for me, yeah? There\rquote s--there\rquote s something of his I need to borrow, something I need you to get for me...\'94 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93Just ask him yourself. What did you want }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to do? Steal something from him? You think I would do that?\'94 
\par Ron looked disgruntled. \'93Yes, I\rquote m so certain he will give me his gun with the silver bullets if I just }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ask}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ...\'94 
\par Harry had been sitting in a chair next to Ron\rquote s bedside, but now he stood in shock. \'93No, Ron! I won\rquote t let you do it! That }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 isn\rquote t}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  the answer!\'94 
\par \'93What is? Get you to do it, have you go to prison? Or Hermione? Yeah, I could really convince her to do that...\'94 He shook his head, miserable. \'93It\rquote s the only thing to be done, Harry, the only way...Don\rquote t you think that\rquote

s trial? Right mess, that was. Would you rather it happen when Macnair comes here after I\rquote ve lost the trial? I want it to be on my own terms...\'94 He started to cry quietly again, and Harry looked away from him and at Parvati--}{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Parvati}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , not }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Padma,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he had to remind himself. 
\par When he turned back to Ron again, he\rquote d wiped the tears away. \'93
Parvati's not going to bring charges against you, Ron. And her parents can't, because she's of-age. It has to be her. Listen, Ron--do you think maybe--maybe you ought to take some time off and }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 talk}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to someone about feeling this way? Maybe check into St. Mungo\rquote s?\'94 
\par Ron snorted. \'93I don\rquote t know whether they just }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 let}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  you just check into hospital at St. Mungo\rquote s when you feel suicidal, Harry. And anyway, just because I\rquote 
m feeling like killing myself doesn\rquote t mean it\rquote s not }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 justified}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . I mean, honestly--if--I don\rquote t 
know--someone awful--if Lucius Malfoy, sitting in Azkaban, were feeling suicidal, would anyone care?\'94 
\par Harry raised his eyebrows. \'93He\rquote s been in Azkaban for about a year and a half. I reckon by now he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 does}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  feel suicidal, thanks to the dementors. And no, I don\rquote 
t think anyone would care. Well, okay, maybe Draco Malfoy would care a little, and possibly his mum. And that cousin of his seems to like her uncle all right, even though he\rquote 
s a great bastard. So there you go; bad example. Even Lucius Malfoy has people who\rquote d probably be upset if he snuffed himself out.\'94 
\par \'93I just meant--because of what I am. Wouldn\rquote t the world really be better off without me?\'94 
\par \'93Are you implying that Remus Lupin should have offed himself years ago? For the good of mankind? And yes--I know that would have meant you not getting bitten. But it wasn\rquote t his fault. And he\rquote 
s worked very hard over the years to control himself. He\rquote s a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 brilliant}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  wizard and teacher. If it weren\rquote 
t for him teaching me to conjure a Patronus, I might have been kissed by a
 dementor when I was thirteen. Hermione too, and Sirius and Snape....He saved us all, when you think about it, by teaching me that. It also came in handy during the third task of the tournament and when I was in my other life. I\rquote 
ll always be very grateful to Remus. And, you great git, I doubt that you could have caught me the way you did at the match in Wales if you weren\rquote 
t so freakishly strong now. So basically I owe my life to two werewolves, and if you start talking about silver bullets again, you will be on the receiving end of a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 very}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 nasty hex.\'94 
\par Harry had pulled out his wand and was brandishing it at Ron. Ron lay back in his bed, contemplating the ceiling. \'93All right, all right. No more talk about silver bullets...\'94 
\par Harry put his wand away and sat again. \'93But I still think you should take some time off and talk to someone.\'94 
\par \'93At St. Mungo\rquote s? It\rquote s for magical maladies, Harry, remember? You were burnt by a magic ball of fire, that\rquote s why you were there. Neville\rquote s parents had Cruciatus on them for too long, that\rquote s why they\rquote 
re there. Malfoy put the Hara Kiri curse on Fleur, that\rquote s why she\rquote s there. I doubt that my suicidal depression falls under the heading of \lquote magical malady.\rquote \'94 
\par \'93But it\rquote s }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 because}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  you\rquote re a werewolf. Surely being bitten by a werewolf and becom
ing one yourself is a magical malady? You need some help learning to cope with this, with what it means for the rest of your life. And not just by doing karate and meditation. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Really}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  cope.\'94 
\par Ron looked down and picked at some lint on his blanket. \'93I reckon,\'94 he said reluctantly. 
\par \'93Let me and Hermione help you, Ron. That\rquote s what friends are for.\'94 He paused. \'93You know how Moody lost his leg?\'94 he said suddenly. Ron shook his head. \'93In the Great War. He was in the Muggle army to keep an eye on his best mate, pro
tect him. But in the end, he couldn\rquote t. And then, when his leg was wounded, he was still mourning his friend and just used pain-blocking charms so that the leg wouldn\rquote 
t hurt him so much; turns out that was the worst possible thing he could have done, as he would have known sooner that it was really bad if he could have felt the pain, and he probably wouldn\rquote 
t have gotten gangrene. They had to amputate it in a field hospital. Young Muggle doctor with a saw. No anesthetic.\'94 Ron shuddered and swallowed. \'93But whe
n he told me about this, you know what, Ron? Never once did he blame his mate for his losing that leg. Not once.\'94 
\par Ron shrugged. \'93Well, I suppose you don\rquote t speak ill of the dead. I get your point. But another thing is--I don\rquote t know about going to St. Mungo\rquote s because, well, I don\rquote t know who\rquote d pay for it. I don\rquote 
t even know if I\rquote m going to see any money for the match I was in, since I was basically an illegal player.\'94 
\par Madam Pomfrey had bustled into the room, and after starting to fluff Parvati\rquote s pillow, walked briskly over to Ron\rquote s bed, straightening his blanket compulsively. \'93What\rquote s this I hear about St. Mungo\rquote s?\'94
 she said with an eyebrow raised. 
\par \'93Well,\'94 Harry said, \'93I\rquote m not even sure if it\rquote s a service that\rquote s available--can someone who\rquote s rather depressed check himself into St. Mungo\rquote 
s for treatment? Do they do that sort of thing? And would the treatment consist of actually trying to help the person with their problems, instead of just putting a cheering charm on them?\'94 
\par Madam Pomfrey stopped messing about with the blankets and looked at Ron as though she\rquote d never seen him before. \'93This is about you, then?\'94 
\par He nodded. \'93I was considering eating some of the silver spoons down in the Great Hall for lunch, but Harry talked me out of it. Still--I reckon he\rquote s right that I need to talk to someone.\'94
 Harry heard that Ron was trying to force some levity into his voice--but it was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 very}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  forced. 
\par She nodded, looking sympathetic. \'93They do that, and not just using charms. Not many witches and wizards take advantage of it, mind you, and more probably should, but they do it. And you don\rquote 
t have to worry about paying; it can go on the school bill. We have an agreement with St. Mungo\rquote s; any time we can\rquote t handle a student\rquote s treatment here, we can transfer them to their facilities.\'94 She looked grim for a moment. \'93
You\rquote re probably doing the right thing, to get help coping. I\rquote m ashamed to say that when Remus Lupin was in school, I was one of the few people who knew about him, and I wasn\rquote t always very helpful--or sympathetic. And now that 
that article has come out--well, I understand what he was going through every month. Always in here looking for a sleeping draught, kept saying he had nightmares. Wouldn\rquote t tell me why.\'94 She pointed her finger at Ron. \'93Yes, I know you\rquote 
re embarrassed. But that woman\rquote s article was a blessing. Now that it\rquote s out, the medical community knows about a problem to be solved, and can set about trying to do just that.\'94 
\par Ron grimaced. \'93Maybe. But if it weren\rquote t for that article, Parvati wouldn\rquote t be lying there like that....\'94 
\par Madam Pomfrey pursed her lips together. \'93She was a stupid, silly girl who is very lucky to be alive. You didn\rquote t ask her to meet you, did you?\'94 When he shook his head, she sniffed and said, \'93
I thought not. You were trying to be responsible. She wasn\rquote t. That\rquote s all there is to it. Now, then; when shall I tell the hospital ambulance to come for you? Are you still interested?\'94 
\par Ron looked a little panicked now, and Madam Pomfrey added, \'93If you check yourself in, you can check yourself out at any time. You\rquote re of-age.\'94 
\par He looked a trifle calmed by that, but now Harry said, \'93It probably shouldn\rquote t be until after the full moon--\'94 
\par \'93No, Harry,\'94 Ron interrupted. \'93I\rquote ve been taking my potion.\'94 He looked at Madam Pomfrey. \'93I\rquote d like to go as soon as possible. I can just spend the night as a wolf at St. Mungo\rquote s instead of here. I\rquote 
ll be a tame wolf, because of the potion. I won\rquote t be a bother for the staff.\'94 Madam Pomfrey nodded and returned to her office, presumably to use the fireplace to call for the ambulance. 
\par Harry frowned. \'93But we won\rquote t be able to be with you,\'94 he complained. 
\par Ron grimaced. \'93Not this time, I think, Harry. You know? It\rquote s rather too soon,\'94 he added, nodding at Parvati\rquote s bed again. Harry could tell that he meant it was too soon for Ron to be so close 
to Hermione, all night long. He was trying to push her away, after all. 
\par Harry nodded. \'93All right, then. Hermione and I will make sure you can keep up with your classes, though. How long do you reckon you\rquote ll be away?\'94 
\par He shrugged. \'93Dunno. I suppose that\rquote s a bit unpredictable in my case, isn\rquote t it?\'94 
\par \'93Well, don\rquote t take too long. You need to practice for the broom race, remember. And our first match is in November.\'94 
\par \'93Captain the team for me until I get back, all right, Harry? I reckon if I think of having a schedule, that might help me. Must get out by the time of the first Quidditch match, if not sooner....\'94 
\par \'93And Hermione will make sure we\rquote re ready to take our Apparition tests, so we\rquote ll be ready for the broom--\'94 He stopped abruptly, reddening, remembering again that Ron couldn\rquote t ever Apparate. 
\par Ron rolled his eyes. \'93Will you cut that out, Harry! Stop thinking you can\rquote t use the word \lquote Apparate\rquote  around me! I\rquote ve accepted it, all right?\'94 He grinned at Harry. \'93If you two aren\rquote 
t there to see me begin and end the race, I\rquote ll have to curse you.\'94 
\par Harry grinned back. \'93Get well soon,\'94 he said quietly, putting out his hand; Ron grasped it strongly, then pulled Harry to him in a rough hug, pounding his shoulder painfully. 
\par He released Harry and said, \'93I did mean one thing--take care of her, Harry.\'94 
\par Harry nodded. \'93Of course. We\rquote ll miss you. Both of us.\'94 
\par Ron looked grim. \'93I just hope they know what they\rquote re doing.\'94 
\par As he left the hospital wing, Harry thought, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 So do I, Ron. So do I.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

night. Get some rest. Do you want me to write to Ron about--?\'94 
\par She shook her head. \'93No. Not you. Maybe his doctor can talk some sense into him.\'94 
\par Harry suddenly noticed Ginny on the other side of the room, on the window seat next to Neville; they were both reading, sitting side by side companionably. He swallowed, watching her, and said, not looking at Hermione, \'93All right, then. I\rquote 
ll be going up to bed.\'94 He hoped Ginny would look up and notice him, but she did not; he watched her turn a page, her brow furrowed in concentration, and he tried not to think how he\rquote 
d like to kiss her right there, on the furrow, to smooth it out.... 
\par Shaking himself, he tried to smile at Hermione again before he went up the stairs. After he\rquote 
d changed into his pajama trousers and had climbed into bed with Sandy wrapped around his upper arm, he lay with his hands behind his head, staring up at the canopy of his four-poster and listening to Seamus and Dean breathing, Seamus\rquote 
 breaths starting to sound more like snores. At length, Neville came up to bed too, and Harry hated the spring in his step, even though it was late. Neville hummed lightly to himself as he changed into his pajamas, and Harry fought the urge to hex him. }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 But it\rquote s not his fault,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry reminded himself. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 If Ginny really does like him, he has a perfect right to be happy about it...}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Neville finally climbed into his bed and put out his candle, and the dorm was enveloped in blackness. At 
long last, Harry found himself drifting off to sleep, but unfortunately, his dreams turned into memories of being with Ginny in the common room, except that this time, he could }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 see}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  her, see her body as she removed her dressing gown and nightdress.... He jerked himself awake forcibly. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 That\rquote s not terribly useful, is it?}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he scolded himself. He stared up into the inky blackness again, drumming his fingers on his stomach, but now he was feeling too awake to just drop off again. And even if he did, he feared more
 dreams about Ginny, whether from this life or his other life.... 
\par He\rquote d been unable to get over her, no matter how he tried. And it wasn\rquote t even as though she was being rude to him; on the contrary, she simply behaved toward him now as though what he did was of no consequence to her whatsoever. It didn
\rquote t help that he\rquote d seen Neville, several nights before, kiss her goodnight. He could tell it was supposed to be on the cheek, but Ginny had suddenly turned her head and their lips had met briefly. Neville had pu
lled back in surprise, looking around the common room self-consciously, his face very red. Harry had met Ginny\rquote 
s eye, and saw that she looked a little panicked at first, for some reason, then triumphant. It was damn odd, Harry thought. But somehow, every time he saw her with Neville, it was harder and harder to get her out of his mind. 
\par And for some reason, she was far more demonstrative with Neville in the Great Hall than she was in the common room. She encouraged Neville to sit with his arm across her sho
ulders when they were relaxing and talking to Seamus, Dean and her dormmates after finishing dinner. Dean was now seeing Zoey Russell, and from what he could gather, Seamus was interested in Zoey putting in a good word for him with Annika Olafsdottir. 

\par Harry had glanced across the hall and seen that Draco Malfoy was undergoing a slow burn at these times, glaring at Neville Longbottom so intently it was surprising that his head didn\rquote 
t spontaneously explode. Harry also noticed that Mariah would roll her eyes and tap her fork on her plate impatiently, watching him watch Neville and Ginny. 
\par Harry decided that he wasn\rquote t destined to sleep this evening. He climbed out of bed and wrapped his dressing gown around himself and slid into his running shoes. He crept down
 the stairs to the common room, finding it bleak and deserted. After lighting a fire, he carried the books he\rquote 
d left on a table by the window to the small circle of light and started going over his Apparition notes, practically tingling with anticipation, dying for the day he had his license. 
\par After a time, though, he felt he had stared at the notes long enough. He set his books aside and sat with his arms around his legs, gazing at the flames. \'93Sandy, will I ever get over her?\'94 he asked, not really expecting an answer. He didn\rquote 
t even know whether she was awake; it turned out that she was, but she didn\rquote t answer his question. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 The she-wolf shall approaches.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Oh,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought. Hmm. Not an answer to his question exactly... Perhaps he should go back up to h
is dorm before Hermione came downstairs. He was fairly certain that was who Sandy meant, and she hadn\rquote t predicted that they\rquote d be in the same room together, just that Hermione was approaching. She\rquote 
d called Hermione a she-wolf several times since she\rquote d become an Animagus. 
\par Hermione was sleeping in the sixth-year dorm since the morning they had found Parvati with Ron. She had accused Padma of conspiring to help her sister sleep with Ron, and learned that Padma had been ignorant of Parvati\rquote s plans. Evidently, i
t was all Lavender\rquote s idea. She had put the plan into Parvati\rquote 
s head, including getting Padma to come spend the night in the Gryffindor dorm, where Hermione would naturally assume she was Parvati. Padma thought it was about a boy, but she claimed that she hadn\rquote t known it was about }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Ron.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Hermione was no longer on speaking terms with Lavender, and she was barely civil to Parvati and Padma (since, when she encountered them together she was never completely clear on their identities and it was more efficient to 
snub them both). She asked the sixth-year girls whether any one of them would mind switching with her, and Annika volunteered. Hermione reminded Harry of the fact that Annika had once been interested in Ron, and Harry wondered whether it could just have e
asily been Annika who\rquote d decided to spend a night with him in the sleeping shack. Perhaps Annika identified with Parvati. 
\par Harry supposed it was a better solution than Hermione\rquote s first instinct: to toss both Parvati and Lavender out of the dorm and make them beg for others to take them in. She may have been Head Girl, but Harry didn\rquote 
t think she technically had the authority to do that, just because she wasn\rquote t getting along with her dormmates. The switching had worked fine, so far, and McGonagall wasn\rquote t even a
ware of it, as far as he knew. Hermione and Ginny still got on well, and Ginny shared her letters from Ron with Hermione, which Hermione reported to Harry were more cheerful than the ones to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 her}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , his girlfriend. 
\par But even though he\rquote d had ample warning, he somehow couldn\rquote 
t bring himself to flee just because Hermione was up and about. When she entered the common room, she looked surprised to see him, and hesitated on the threshold. He thought she looked like she\rquote d been crying again. He wondered whether she\rquote d 
had The Dream once more. Something she hadn\rquote t told Ron since the night he was bitten was that she had recurring nightmares about it. Harry had only found out since Ron had checked into St. Mungo\rquote s. It wasn\rquote 
t actually one dream, but a number of variations. 
Sometimes she was the one bitten, instead of Ron; sometimes Ron was completely devoured by the wolf, instead of just bitten; sometimes after devouring Ron, the wolf came after her, too; but in every version, she felt at first that since she knew about the
 wolf coming after Ron, there might be a chance she could stop it. But in each version, she never managed to do it, and the jaws closed over his flesh again and again.... 
\par She still hesitated. He thought she looked like she needed some comforting, so he patted the rug beside him. \'93Come here,\'94
 he said softly. She still wavered, then finally moved across the room and sat down close against him. He wrapped his arms around her and pulled her close, kissing her on the top of the head. \'93Just close your eyes and rest. Don\rquote 
t think, for once,\'94 he whispered. She nodded and snuggled closer to him. 
\par They sat together silently for a few minutes, enjoying the closeness, when suddenly, Hermione said, with a bitter edge to her voice, \'93I\rquote m going to be alone all my life, aren\rquote t I? Ron\rquote s never going to change his mind.\'94 
\par He looked down at her. \'93Don\rquote t be stupid, Hermione.\'94 She bristled; he knew that if there was one thing that would get her attention it would be the word }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 stupid.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  

\par \'93You know I\rquote ll always be there for you, don\rquote t you?\'94 
\par She looked at him; her eyes were very bright but there was a rueful expression lurking there. \'93It\rquote s not the same.\'94 
\par He put his hand on her cheek affectionately. \'93He\rquote ll come round. He\rquote d never dream of hurting you. Eventually you\rquote ll be together, I firmly believe that.\'94 He pulled her head down onto him once more and closed his eyes. \'93
You make a lovely teddy bear, you know. I\rquote ll tell Ron, and then he won\rquote t be able to resist your charms...\'94 he said sleepily, his eyes still closed. 
\par She laughed briefly. \'93Oh, Harry, I never know when you\rquote re being serious.\'94 
\par \'93I\rquote m being completely serious,\'94 he mumbled, finally feeling relaxed enough again that he started to drift off....

\par He landed lightly on the observation deck of the Astronomy Tower. Ginny was waiting for him there, as she was in many of his dreams.

nipped him, a sucking suction against his throat suddenly sent fiery fingers throughout his limbs, responding to this not-unwelcome, gentle assault. He opened his eyes and realized that he was no longer dreaming. And that it wasn\rquote 
t Ginny kissing him. 
\par It was Hermione. 
\par But this realization came just as she covered his mouth with her own again, flicking her tongue out. He wanted to stop her, but somehow he was holding her head in place with his hands, and she wouldn\rquote t have been able to pull away if she\rquote 
d wanted to. Which she clearly didn\rquote 
t. While they kissed he heard rustling and then she took one of his hands from her face and placed it on her chest; she had taken off her dressing gown and was wearing only her thin nightdress. He moaned into her mouth, start
ing to move his hand over the soft flesh that was only separated from him by a very thin layer of fabric, making her moan softly back at him. He pulled back from her, then ran his mouth down her throat, reaching for her other breast now. }{

And I know her weaknesses, too...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

\par That\rquote s all this is, he thought. They were being weak. He stared at her, the flushed cheeks, her chest heaving. Then he could see the epip
hany come over her as well, the widened eyes, and she hastily pulled her dressing gown around her again, shivering as though she was cold, despite the fact that Harry could still feel the heat emanating from her. 
\par \'93I--I should go--um--up to my--\'94 he stuttered. 
\par \'93Yes, yes,\'94 she agreed in a very high voice. \'93Definitely time to go--\'94 
\par Each of them practically ran to their respective stairs, and Harry didn\rquote t breathe easy until he was lying in his four-poster again. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 It\rquote s just too easy,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 for us to slip into our old ways....}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par He had to find some way to bring Ron to his senses, or hope the doctor could do it. But he knew he was mortified by what he\rquote d done to Parvati, and Harry suspected that Hermione was just a little frightened herself. 
\par In the morning, Hermione didn\rquote t speak to him when they went running with Ruth and Tony and Ginny. Even Ginny spoke to him, although it was in an odd and distant way, as though they\rquote d only recently met and she didn\rquote 
t know him very well. At breakfast, Hermione ate silently, looking down at her plate. When she was done her food there were still fifteen minutes to go before the bell would ring for their first class. Harry stood up and grabbed her arm roughly. 
\par \'93We have to talk,\'94 he said in a hard voice. He knew
 he needed to do this before he lost his nerve. She stumbled as she stood, but she had no choice as he was dragging her to the anteroom near the staff table. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Snape raise a quizzical eyebrow, and then Harry realized tha
t the entire silent Great Hall must be watching the Head Boy dragging the Head Girl into the anteroom; the Head Boy and Head Girl who used to be a couple... 
\par It was too late to worry about that now. He opened the door and pulled her into the room, slamming 
the door behind him. He put a locking charm on it, remembering Snape entering the room unexpectedly the time they were discussing Draco Malfoy and Mariah Kirkner. 
\par \'93Harry! What are you thinking? The entire school was watching!\'94 she finally said. \'93Are you ma--?\'94 
\par But he didn\rquote t give her the chance to finish; he pulled her to him and took her mouth suddenly in a kiss that, within moments, had her shivering from head to foot and clutching at him for dear life. But he didn\rquote 
t stop; he deepened it and continued, and when he finally, gently pulled back he could swear her temperature had gone up several degrees. Her eyes were frightened, but she also looked like she was surrendering. 
\par \'93Is that what you want, Hermione?\'94 he whispered fiercely. \'93Because it would be so easy to go back, wouldn\rquote t it? Back to fifth year. No one would question it; Ron already gave us his blessing, didn\rquote t he?\'94 
\par She stared at him, mouth working, but no words coming out. \'93You--you don\rquote t }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 mean}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  that, do you Harry?\'94 she asked finally, sounding more frightened than he expected. 
\'93I mean, Ron wouldn't have said that if he knew about--\'94 
\par But she suddenly stopped herself, and Harry narrowed his eyes. \'93If Ron knew about }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 what}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par \'93Never mind,\'94 she said quickly in a strange, high voice. Harry still thought there was something he was in the dark about, as well as Ron, but she didn\rquote t look like she was in a telling mood. He wished Ron was there, so he\rquote 
d know whether she was lying... 
\par \'93Tell me, Hermione, what was going through your head when we were kissing just now? It went on long enough; don\rquote t tell me your mind didn\rquote t wander just a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 little.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\'94 She bit her lip and looked down. Harry didn\rquote t wait for her answer. \'93You were thinking about Ron, weren\rquote t you?\'94 
\par She nodded guiltily. But Harry had received the expected answer, so he went on. \'93Well, I have to admit that I was thinking about Ginny. Is that what we want to do? Go through the motions, each of us knowing that when we\rquote re together you\rquote 
re thinking of Ron and I\rquote m thinking of Ginny? Because frankly, that sounds pretty pathetic to me.\'94 
\par Hermione shook her head. \'93I\rquote m sorry about last night, Harry, I truly am. I wasn\rquote t thinking! I mean--apart from Ron, there\rquote s Ginny! If she ever found out about last night, she\rquote d think I was as bad as Mariah...\'94
 Hermione looked truly worried about this, and Harry was momentarily confused. 
\par \'93But Ginny told me to go to hell. Why should she care what you do, except as far as it concerns her brother? Who, remember, told you to get back together with me?\'94 
\par She was still biting her lip. \'93Ginny\rquote s my friend. I care what she thinks of me, Harry. And I\rquote m just--I can\rquote t believe, even sleep deprived, that I did that....\'94 
\par She was reddening and holding her crossed arms against her chest, her lips drawn into a stern line. Harry nodded. 
\par \'93Right. So. Our response to Ron is--well, I was going to say \lquote Are you barmy?\rquote  but he\rquote s already in St. Mungo\rquote s....Our response is that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 we are friends.}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Nothing more. Not any more, at any rate. I mean--for two people to be together who are constantly thinking of other people isn\rquote t a very good idea, right?\'94 
\par Hermione nodded. \'93Right,\'94 she said quietly, not looking at him. Then she raised her eyes suddenly. \'93You won\rquote t--you won\rquote t tell either Ginny or Ron about last night or this morning, will you? Ever?\'94 
\par He was confused again; why was she talking about Ginny as though she was his girlfriend or something? Or even someone who cared whether he lived or died? 
\par \'93Of course not. Why should I? In fact, we won\rquote t ever speak of it to each other again, either. Agreed?\'94 
\par She agreed, and when they left, they discovered that the Great Hall was already empty of students; they hadn\rquote t had to worry about the bell because they didn\rquote 
t have a class first thing Friday mornings. They went to the library together, quietly working on opposite sides of the same
 table, and when the bell rang for the second morning class, they left for History of Magic, two friends walking side by side, and no sign that they\rquote d ever been anything more.

 shook the soot out of his hair and robes. Hermione and Gabrielle Delacour had gone before him, and he moved swiftly out of the way so that Remus Lupin, who\rquote 
d come with them, could emerge from the fireplace next. It was a matter of moments before Remus appeared, and as soon as he was out, he started sneezing. 
\par \'93Damn soot. It\rquote s convenient to travel by Floo, sure, but no one seems to be capable of finding a way of getting rid of the dust,\'94 the werewolf complained, waving his wand over his patched robes, which
, despite their age, were at least usually immaculate. He did the same for Harry, Hermione and Gabrielle. Bringing Gabrielle along was Hermione\rquote s idea; she\rquote d talked to Professor McGonagall about the fact that Gabrielle hadn\rquote 
t had an opportunity to visit her sister in hospital once since the term had begun. McGonagall had contacted the girl\rquote 
s mother, who had allowed it. Her large blue eyes roamed around the enormous entry hall now, taking in its gargantuan proportions, as though wondering whether the doctors were all giants. 
\par They approached the security desk, which was being manned by a different wizard than the one Harry had met when he\rquote d come with Hermione to visit the Hogwarts students who\rquote d been wounded in the Diagon Alley attack. They approached one by 
one. 
\par \'93Name,\'94 the wizard said to Hermione in a monotone. When she responded, he said, \'93Wand, please,\'94
 holding out his hand to her. She nervously removed her wand from her robes and handed it over. Rather than testing it to find out about the last spell it had cast, as Harry had expected, the wizard confiscated it. Seeing Hermione\rquote 
s open mouth, he said, \'93Increased security measures. You\rquote ll get it back when you depart. You won\rquote t need it while you\rquote re here.\'94 
\par She closed her mouth again and moved out of the way so Gabrielle could give her name and hand over her wand. Harry did the same; this wizard revealed no reaction to his name, but merely looked for it on his list and took Harry\rquote 
s wand in a very stiff, businesslike fashion. 
\par When Remus Lupin stepped up and gave his name, it was quickly found on the list and he quietly handed over his wand. This time, however, the wizard held onto it briefly, so that both he and Remus were touching it simultaneously. \'93You\rquote 
re the werewolf, aren\rquote t you?\'94 he asked suddenly, his monotone finally varying--but only slightly. 
\par Remus looked him in the eye, nodding, no expression on his face. The wizard didn\rquote t say anything else, but put Remus\rquote 
 wand with the others and waved them through; but when Harry looked over his shoulder at the wizard, he saw him watching Remus Lupin\rquote s back intently. 
\par They went to the matron\rquote s office on the ground floor to ask where to go to see Ron Weasley and Fleur Delacour. The matron raised one eyebrow at them, but if it was because of Ron\rquote s name or Fleur\rquote s--or both--Harry couldn\rquote 
t tell. 
\par \'93They\rquote re both on this level. Don\rquote t want to have patients of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that sort}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  too high up, you know,\'94 she said with a smirk, as though being suicidal or mad were }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 funny}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, Harry thought. Their footsteps echoed in the vast, high corridors with their intersecting Gothic arches and high clerestory windows. Ribbed vaults of monotonous grey stone swept up overhead; at Hogwarts, there were wings where 
Hogwarts castle seemed almost Moorish, with different colors of stone--sand, crimson, lapis--alternated with each other, producing almost as great a rainbow effect as the stained glass windows. Even wings that were built in eras when grey stone was also t
he rule had color in the form of tapestries and banners, or large paintings. It seemed that all such variation in color was against the rules here, and the oversized proportions also made Harry feel very small and insignificant. 
\par They turned and entered a corridor with a much lower coffered ceiling, and the matron herself led them to Ron\rquote s room. Harry and Hermione hesitated. Remus Lupin put his hand on Gabrielle\rquote 
s arm; she was already only a few inches shorter than him, even through she\rquote d just turned twelve the week before. It was still strange for Harry to have to look }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 down}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 to look at Remus, but he wasn\rquote t a very tall man. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Just tall enough,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he\rquote d said to Harry once. 
\par Remus looked grimly at Harry and Hermione. \'93We\rquote ll go to see Fleur now,\'94 he said quietly. The matron led them on to Fleur\rquote 
s room. Harry glanced at Hermione and nodded. They should be happier; Ron was checking out today. He was coming back to Hogwarts. Then why did they both feel so apprehensive? 
\par Harry took a deep breath and knocked on the door, which had no window. He heard Ron\rquote s voice, neither cheerful nor depressed, call out, \'93Come in.\'94 
\par Harry opened the door and found Ron folding his clothes on the bed before placing them in a canvas bag. The room was as austere as a monk\rquote s cell, with a high, nar
row metal bed, whitewashed walls with no artwork, and simple, unadorned furniture. There weren\rquote t even any curtains on the clear leaded windows--although there }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 were}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 bars on them. On the inside. Harry remembered the opulence of the Minister\rquote s room, where he\rquote d been, and wished he\rquote d been in a room like this instead. Unless this was only for--he didn\rquote t want to even }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 think}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  the term \lquote mental patients.\rquote  But that\rquote s precisely what Ron }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, and it was Harry who\rquote d suggested he check himself into St. Mungo\rquote s. 
\par Ron was moving back and forth methodically between a large plain wardrobe and the bed as though he was an automaton. As he moved, he spoke tonelessly to them. \'93Came to see me back? Thanks. Are you all alone?\'94 
\par \'93No,\'94 Harry said, his throat very dry. \'93Remus came with us, although he\rquote s accompanying Gabrielle Delacour to Fleur\rquote s room right now, to visit her. Fleur isn\rquote t going, of course. Gabrielle hasn\rquote 
t seen her sister since the term began.\'94 
\par Ron nodded. \'93We eat our meals in a room down the corridor, next to the common room. We have a common room too,\'94 he said, giving a small smile. \'93Not as nice as the Gryffindor common room, of course. And then there are the }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 smells}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  around here. When I\rquote ve been allowed out on the grounds for walks, I\rquote ve been going without a cloak, and the 
matron scolded me for it. I explained that I was trying to catch a headcold so I couldn\rquote t smell properly while I was here.\'94 
\par Hermione smiled feebly, as did Harry; he wasn\rquote t sure whether he was trying to be funny and they were expected to laugh. This was a Ron Harry hadn\rquote t met before, a Ron with an oddly flat affect. Harry wasn\rquote t sure what to think. 
\par Ron was almost done packing. \'93I ate meals with Fleur a few times. All of the tables in the dining hall seat two people only. At least in our wing; it might be different elsewhere. It was nice to eat with her, actually. Unlike most people, she doesn
\rquote t ask me anything about what it\rquote s like to be a werewolf. Doesn\rquote t talk much at all, in fact. And as smells go, the smell of a pregnant woman isn\rquote t too bad. It\rquote s like--a
 baby. And like warm milk. Not curdled; just--warm. Which is to be expected, I suppose. Anyway, I think she said one thing the entire time we ate. She asked me to pass the salt. I\rquote 
m assuming, anyway. She only spoke French, but she pointed at the salt, so I knew what she wanted. That was it.\'94 
\par He closed his bag and hoisted it onto his shoulder. He\rquote d shaved--or someone else had shaven him--and for the first time in a long while, Harry could see the scar on his cheek that was the legacy of the Three Broomstick
s attack. Harry wondered why he\rquote d gotten rid of the beard. 
\par Somehow, though, asking questions like this of Ron right now didn\rquote t feel right to Harry; he still wasn\rquote t sure }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 who}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 this Ron Weasley was, and even a simple question like \lquote Why did you shave your beard?\rquote  seemed too personal a thing to ask a near-stranger. 
\par They left the room and were surprised to find Remus Lupin and Gabrielle Delacour standing in the corridor, a few doors away, looking like they\rquote d been waiting to talk to the three of them. 
\par \'93What\rquote s wrong?\'94 Hermione said immediately. 
\par Gabrielle shook her head. \'93Nuzzing is wrong. My seestaire weeshes to see \lquote Arry.\'94 
\par Harry frowned. \'93Me? Out of the blue she asked to see }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par Gabrielle shook her head again, her long silky hair floating lightly around her face. \'93No, I told \rquote air zat you \lquote ad come wiz me. She weeshes to see you,\'94
 she repeated, and Harry looked uncertainly at Hermione and Ron. Hermione gestured toward Gabrielle with her head. 
\par \'93Go on, then. We can wait.\'94 
\par Harry turned back toward the tall young girl uncertainly. He was surprised to see Gabrielle give him a small smile; she hadn\rquote t shown much friendliness to him during the term so far. 
\par \'93Fleur reminded me zat you helped save me when she could not get to me in ze lake, when I was \lquote air \lquote ostage. I am sorry I \lquote ave not been more--\'94 She seemed to flounder, looking for the right English word. 
\par \'93That\rquote s all right,\'94 Harry said hurriedly, wondering at Fleur mentioning this, of all things. \'93You\rquote ve had a lot on your mind, I imagine. New school and all that.\'94 
\par She gave him another small smile, and Harry looked at Remus Lupin, who tried to reassure him. \'93She is quite well--physically. About seven months along. The matron says the baby is doing fine, too.\'94 
\par \'93But,\'94 Harry said, \'93how will she give birth? Will she know what\rquote s happening to her? Won\rquote t she be frightened, wondering why she\rquote s in pain?\'94 
\par Remus shook his head. \'93She knows she\rquote s pregnant. She even knows that Draco only made her }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 think}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  she was--hurting the baby. She\rquote 
s just still finding it comforting to retreat into herself a bit. She\rquote s been severely traumatized. But the matron reckons that she\rquote ll be able to have a normal birth, and when she does, there\rquote 
s a chance that once she has real proof that the baby is all right, she\rquote ll have a complete recovery and be able to leave.\'94

 Harry said, still incredulous. Remus stood back and gestured toward the open doorway, as if to usher Harry in. He took a deep breath and walked into Fleur Delacour\rquote s room. He was immediately struck by a wave of--he wasn\rquote t sure what. It didn
\rquote t feel entirely different than when he\rquote d been assaulted by the very strong feeling at the World Cup that he had to dive onto the field--and yet it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 different. He didn\rquote t feel like he needed to brag to her, to do something splendid to make her run off with him. What he felt like was--he felt like }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 protecting}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 her. He suddenly felt an overwhelmingly strong urge to keep her and her child safe. It wasn\rquote t an altogether bad way to feel--at least he didn\rquote t have the urge to claim that he\rquote 
d invented Floo powder or the Wizarding Wireless--but he tried to shake it, nonetheless, as it made him feel like his thinking was a bit fuzzy. 
\par To try to clear his head, he looked away from her thin form with the oddly distended belly, and gazed at the room. It seemed that, originally, the room could have been a mirror image of Ron\rquote 
s. The austerity had been offset here, though, by the addition of some wizarding photographs on the wall with smiling, waving Delacours, and other cozy touches, like a few small
 braided rugs on the tile floor and a quilt on the bed, instead of the plain white sheets and blankets which were all that Ron had. A rocking chair near the window was piled with pillows and topped with another quilt, and a basket stood nearby with what l
o
oked like books with pictures of gardens. Fleur also had some flowers growing in a series of pots on a plant stand on the other side of the window, and she was watering these flowers when Harry entered, using a long-spouted copper watering can; the spout 
ended in a disk with a multitude of tiny holes puncturing it, so that she was able to give the plants something approximating a gentle rain. 
\par She looked very serene, tending to her flowers, brushing her cornsilk hair behind one small, perfect ear, and Harry
, still trying to get his bearings, was startled when she looked up at him suddenly. She put down the watering can on the windowsill and walked to him; he was taller than her now, which was strange to him. He remembered feeling very small when he\rquote 
d entered the room next to the Great Hall and found Fleur, Cedric and Viktor waiting before the hearth, the three champions of Beauxbatons, Hogwarts and Durmstrang having to accept an interloper, all because of Barty Crouch, Jr. Fleur had called him a 
\'93leetle boy.\'94 She looked up at him; he was a \'93leetle boy\'94 no longer. 
\par \'93\rquote Arry,\'94
 she said simply, putting her hands on his arms. She raised her chin and kissed him lightly, once on each cheek, then surveyed him again. He felt positively light-headed as the protective instinct washed over him again, due to her proximity. She waved her
 arm toward the rocking chair, suggesting he sit there, but he shook his head. \'93You take it. I\rquote m fine standing.\'94
 He reckoned that it was a natural and good thing, for women who were all or part veela to induce men around them to want to protect them when they were pregnant. But it was still a bit disorienting to Harry. 
\par Now she shook }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 her}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 head and walked around him, looking grim, touching his shoulders lightly, then pulling her hand back. Suddenly, she had a very determined look on her face and started unbuttoning his shirt, tearing desperately at the buttons. }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 What the hell is she doing?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought. He grabbed her wrists, then shook his head sternly at her. \'93No,\'94 he said, shaking his head slowly, as though she were deaf. }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 What\rquote s gotten into her?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par But she backed up from him and he let go of her. Then she reached over her shoulder with one hand, the opposite shoulder with the other, and Harry finally understood. \'93Oh,\'94 he said in understanding now. \'93You want to see my back. It\rquote 
s okay. I\rquote m fine.\'94 
\par She shook her head
, pointing at herself and frowning, looking like she was going to cry. Then suddenly, she started slapping her left hand with her right, her face crumpled up like a child being scolded. Harry stepped forward and grabbed her wrists again. \'93
No, Fleur, don\rquote t. You can see my back, if you like. So you can see that I\rquote m all right.\'94 
\par She nodded, and he unbuttoned his own shirt after taking off his cloak and robes. When he slid the shirt from his arms, standing with nothing on from the waist up, he felt strange and 
cold; he turned around to show Fleur his back, and she stepped forward tentatively, putting her hands on the skin, pressing her palms flat, running them down from his shoulders to the small of his back, making him shiver; a woman had not touched him like 
that for a long time, it seemed, and he was already having trouble keeping his thoughts straight. She was saying something soft and sibilant under her breath, something that sounded like }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 triste}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , repeated over and over. 
\par He turned around to face her, and suddenly, he felt compelled to tell someone. She seemed unlikely to tell another person, so there didn\rquote t seem to be any harm in it. \'93Do you want to know a secret?\'94
 She looked up at him with tears hanging in her enormous blue eyes. \'93Rodney Jeffries healed me. It\rquote s the truth. He let himself into St. Mungo\rquote s and healed me.\'94 
\par She didn\rquote t respond verbally; she reached for his right hand and, taking it in hers, placed it very deliberately on the upper curve of her belly, holding it there, then looking at the wall as 
though it fascinated her. Harry stood there, shirtless, his hand under hers on her stomach. Suddenly he felt movement; a distinct sort of jolt, then the feeling of something actually }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 pushing}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  against his hand, as though trying to break through her stomach. She raised a teary but smiling face to him and continued to hold his hand in place so he could feel the baby\rquote s acrobatics. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Bebe,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 she said softly. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Bebe.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par He wasn\rquote t certain how long they stood there; Harry felt a strange series of emotions running through him as he felt Fleur\rquote 
s baby move beneath his hand. He felt glad that she was aware of the baby, and sorrowful that the Ginny in his other life hadn\rquote t been carrying his child, and that he would never know what it was like, now, to stand with her, like th
is, his hand on her belly, and feel his child--}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 their}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 child--move beneath his hand....He felt sad and protective and more than a little self-conscious, as he still did not have his shirt on. 
\par Finally, mustering as much will-power as he could, he pulled his 
hand back and swallowed. He turned to pick his shirt up from the bed and buttoned it silently, adding his robes and cloak when he was done. He turned back to Fleur; she had seated herself in the rocker, her hands covering her own belly protectively now, r
ocking back and forth idly and staring through the barred window at the scudding clouds in the late autumn sky. Harry wondered now whether }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 all}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 women (or all witches) emitted something that made the men around them instinctively want to protect them when the
y were expecting babies. But then he thought about his mother, pregnant with his sister when she had died, and decided that perhaps that wasn\rquote t how it worked. It must be a veela thing. 
\par He walked to her and bent over, placing a gentle kiss on her brow. She looked up at him and grasped his hand, placing it on her belly once more; he felt the life move within her and smiled down at her. 
\par \'93Goodbye, Fleur,\'94 he said softly. \'93I mean--bonne soir,\'94 he added uncertainly. She smiled at him. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Au revoir,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 she corrected him. He straightened up and removed his hand. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Au revoir.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par He turned to go, and when he was walking back to the hospital entrance hall with the others, he declined to say anything about what had occurred in the room, saying only that it was between him and Fleur.

This time, on the day of the Wales vs. France game, all of the Hogwarts students with permission to attend were sitting on the Welsh side and cheering for him. He looked with trepidation at the French Seeker, surprised to find that i
t was Jean-Claude Jones, who had tried out for the Welsh team. Evidently, the French team had found themselves in need of a new Seeker, and since Jones qualified for either team, he had tried out and landed the position. 
\par Unfortunately, Harry reckoned with
out the kind of fierce pride Jones brought to the game, as he seemed to be trying to make up for the perceived loss of face that had occurred when Harry had beaten him to become the Welsh Seeker. The French Beaters, in particular, were merciless when it c
ame to hitting the Bludgers his way, and barely ever let the Welsh Beaters near them, which meant that Harry was dodging heavy metal balls when Jones spotted the Snitch and subsequently caught it, winning the game for France. 
\par Although this time, it didn\rquote t 
seem that a rogue Bludger was trying to take his head off, he felt like a leaden weight had settled in his stomach as he landed on the pitch with the rest of his team. They were out of the running for the European Cup. 
\par When he and Sirius returned with Ron, Hermione and Snape to the entrance hall of Hogwarts, using their Portkey, Harry was surprised to find Professor McGonagall already there with Professor Figg and Professor Dumbledore. 
\par \'93Ah, back from the match. We were listening on the wireless. Condolences, Harry, deepest condolences. It would have been nice to see a Hogwarts student in the Cup final, but you can\rquote t always catch the Snitch, unfortunately.\'94
 Harry started to feel a little better, seeing Dumbledore up and around. His eyes didn\rquote t twinkle in qu
ite the same way they used to, through those half-moon spectacles, but seeing him upright and speaking normally was certainly better than hearing him rasp at Professor McGonagall from his sickbed. 
\par \'93Unfortunately, there was something else we were unable to catch. Or keep, rather. Ah, I have erred again; I should have said some}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 one}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . We have some--er, news for you Harry.
\'94 He paused and Harry frowned. 
\par \'93What is it?\'94 
\par Dumbledore looked sideways at McGonagall, then Figg, who finally said. \'93It\rquote s Petunia, Harry. She has decided to leave Hogwarts. She\rquote 
s already gone, as a matter of fact. There was no way to hold her against her will, nor would we. She just felt--out of place, you understand. As a new witch, and as an older student. It wasn\rquote t working.\'94 She seemed to b
e giving Snape a glare, as though it was his fault that a student in his house had felt the need to leave the school. 
\par Harry couldn\rquote t believe it. \'93So--where\rquote s she gone? Back to Surrey?\'94 
\par Dumbledore nodded. \'93So it seems. We will have the ministry check in on her from time to time, especially to monitor whether any magic is being performed. Hopefully we can keep anything the neighbors see to a bare minimum.\'94 
\par Harry swallowed. \'93Well, I reckon Uncle Vernon will be happy for her to be back.\'94 He nodded at Snape and smiled. \'93And I reckon you\rquote re a bit relieved, as well.\'94 
\par To his surprise, Snape actually broke into a smile, ignoring Arabella Figg\rquote s scowl. Dumbledore chuckled. 
\par \'93I daresay you\rquote re right, Harry,\'94 he said, looking at Snape. 
\par To his surprise, Snape suddenly }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 glared}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  at Dumbledore, something Harry had never seen him do, and then he turned on his heel and stalked down the stairs to the dungeons. Then }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 McGonagall}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  also glared at the headmaster and turned, sniffing, climbing the marble
 stairs, holding her robes up decorously. Harry turned to Ron and Hermione, who both shrugged, unsure what to make of this. Harry looked back at Dumbledore, who smiled broadly at him, something else Harry didn\rquote 
t usually see him do. (Small, subtle smiles, yes; broad smiles, no.) 
\par Harry turned to the stairs himself, Ron and Hermione following behind with Sirius, wondering whether Dumbledore had changed because of what he\rquote d been trying to do to Voldemort--and why that should make Snape and McGonagall suddenly 
dislike him. He looked over his shoulder at the headmaster, who met his gaze and winked at him. Harry turned away again, a bad feeling gnawing inside him.

\par \'93Now, wasn\rquote t that pleasant?\'94 
\par A grinning Professor Arabella Figg looked around the large room at the more than three-dozen seventh year students, almost all of whom looked balefully back at her. \'93Would you be a dear and collect the parchments?\'94
 she said to Mandy Brocklehurst, seated in the first row. Mandy rose and began making her way through the rows of desks, taking the curling parchments from her classmates. \'93I do love surprise quizzes, don\rquote t you?\'94
 their professor asked the class rhetorically, an edge to her voice that Harry recognized. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I\rquote ll just bet she\rquote s missing having her television to make sarcastic comments to,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought. 
\par About two-thirds of the way back, Harry sat with Ron and Hermione; he glanced down with satisfaction at his own parchment. A quiz on curses wasn\rquote t a cause for panic for him. If there was one thing he\rquote 
d become familiar with it was curses; painful curses, and avoiding the pain from them, although he hadn\rquote t had to do that in some time. The last time he\rquote d needed to do that was--when he\rquote 
d been burnt. He swallowed and tried not to think about poor Fleur in St. Mungo\rquote s. She\rquote d been very queer when he was visiting with her. Like she wanted him to forgive her for hurting him because she was having a baby. He didn\rquote 
t blame her, not really. It was Roger Davies he blamed. And Draco Malfoy, a little. Although of all the things Malfoy had done, that actually wasn\rquote t the most upsetting to Harry. 
\par He saw Malfoy hand his parchment to Mandy and met his eyes for a moment before looking away. Harry had found out why Draco Malfoy and Mariah Kirkner hadn\rquote 
t been coming running with them in the mornings; they had been running on the road to Hogsmeade instead, as far as they could g
o and still stay on the Hogwarts grounds, then back again, over and over, instead of going round and round the Quidditch pitch with the rest of them. He\rquote d found out quite by accident when he\rquote 
d been especially tired after working on a Potions essay late into the night; he\rquote d waved Ron on, asking him to tell the others that he\rquote 
d be along in about twenty minutes. That meant that he was leaving the entrance hall for the Quidditch pitch late enough that he\rquote d seen them on the Hogsmeade road, jogging back toward th
e castle, but still a good five or ten minutes from reaching it. He didn\rquote t know whether they\rquote d taken any notice of him, standing on the front steps of the castle, before he\rquote d turned and walked round to the pitch. 
\par Malfoy leaned back in his desk chair and looked like he was studiously ignoring Harry; he turned to say something to Crabbe and Goyle, whom he had given permission to follow him around again. They\rquote d latched onto Blaise Zabini for a while, to Zabini
\rquote s chagrin. Zabini didn\rquote t look disappointed to be rid of the two boulder-like boys. However, it was another Gryffindor nearby whom Malfoy was finding harder to ignore. 
\par Neville Longbottom was handing Mandy his parchment, biting his lip nervously and looking like he was going to yank it back any second. Bu
t very quickly, it was too late; Mandy had shoved it into her growing pile of essays and had moved on to some Hufflepuffs who habitually sat together. Harry saw a glare of utter loathing contort Malfoy\rquote 
s face as he beheld Neville, and Harry was certain he would cower before this, but was surprised by Neville instead lifting his head and smiling sunnily at Malfoy, whose scowl intensified. Suddenly, under his robes, Harry heard Sandy\rquote s voice. 

\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 The Dragon shall confront the Gardener.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par The bell rang for lunch
 and about forty teenagers bolted noisily for the door, making it impossible for Harry to ask her whether she had any other information, and also resulting in an immediate bottleneck at the door to the classroom. Harry saw a tempting path he could take to
 cut through the crowd, but he hung back with Ron and Hermione, in part because Hermione was avoiding her former dorm mates, Parvati and Lavender, plus Parvati\rquote 
s sister Padma, who were all directly ahead. Harry grimaced. What a mess their seventh year was turning out to be. He remembered Moody telling them after the Three Broomsticks attack that they were all members of the same house, united, that they\rquote 
d always be there for each other. He was glad that the old Auror wasn\rquote t at the school now to see how splintered the seventh-year Gryffindors had become. 
\par When they finally reached the corridor it was a sea of black robes as students from Charms and Transfiguration also poured into the passage. Harry felt jostled by numerous bodies passing him; Ron and Hermione
 were moving along rather pokily again, and he didn\rquote t dare leave them alone. Ron had begged him not to; any time Hermione managed to get Ron alone, she started in on the argument that she was still his girlfriend, and he couldn\rquote 
t break up with her. She didn\rquote t try it when Harry or other people were around, so Ron required Harry to be with them at all times. Harry was growing quite weary of it. 
\par Then the other students moving forward stopped abruptly; there was a solid wall of bodies in front of them, and Harry frowned at Ron and Hermione, wondering what it was. He didn\rquote 
t need to wonder any longer when a laconic drawl cut through the low murmur of the crowd: 
\par \'93Let\rquote s see what you\rquote ve got, Longbottom. You\rquote re not taking that memory potion anymore. I can guarantee you this won\rquote t be like that time you trounced Potter. Not that I didn\rquote t enjoy }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ...\'94 
\par Now Harry knew exactly what Sandy had been talking about. Harry, Ron and Hermione pushed their way through the crowd, which had left a clear space about ten feet in diameter where Draco Malfoy and Neville Longbottom were facing each other, wands drawn. Ne
v
ille was the one scowling at Malfoy, looking no longer like the little boy who had lost his toad on the Hogwarts Express their first year. Harry was surprised to see how much he resembled his dad now, although he could see some of Gemma Longbottom there, 
too. 
\par Neville and Draco circled each other warily as the crowd became nosier; and suddenly, at the edge of the circle, Seamus Finnigan called out, \'93Wipe up the floor with him, Nev!\'94 
\par A number of other students agreed noisily, and Dean added, \'93You\rquote ll be sorry, Malfoy!\'94 
\par Hermione scowled impatiently. \'93Neville!\'94 she cried indignantly. \'93Just what do you think you\rquote re doing? And you, Malfoy! You\rquote re a prefect! Both of you stop this at once!\'94 
\par For his part, Neville seemed to be ignoring everyone--Hermione and suppor
ters alike. Crabbe and Goyle were grunting in support of Malfoy, but he seemed to be ignoring his erstwhile friends as well. Draco Malfoy and Neville Longbottom looked at no one but each other, circling slowly, white-knuckled hands clenched on their wands
. Harry felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up; there was a crackling in the air as the ambient magic in the area increased with Draco and Neville\rquote s agitation. He wondered whether one of them was about to perform wandless magic. 
\par \'93What\rquote s this about, Malfoy?\'94 Neville finally asked through gritted teeth, although Harry could hear a slight shake in his voice. 
\par \'93What\rquote s this about? What the hell do you think this is about? It\rquote s about Ginny, you idiot!\'94 Malfoy spat at him, still circling slowly, at exactly the same speed as Neville. Harry saw Neville swallow. 
\par \'93What about Ginny? This is such a public place; are you sure you want to dwell on the fact that you weren\rquote t enough man for her?\'94 
\par Harry was shocked; this sounded so strange coming out of Neville\rquote s mouth. And then he thought about the implication of Neville\rquote s words. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 No, surely not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ... 
\par Draco Malfoy was blind with rage now. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Tracheo suo passus--}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 he began without warning, pointing his wand at Neville\rquote s neck. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Expelliarmus!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 Harry cried suddenly, pointing his wand at Malfoy, who went careering back into the crowd, his wand soaring up into the air and then falling into Harry
\rquote s waiting hand. Next to him, Hermione breathed what seemed to be a sigh of relief. He turned to her, saying, \'93You want to take care of the house points, Hermione?\'94 
\par She nodded, glaring at both Malfoy and Neville. \'93Thank you, Harry. But first--\'94 She looked round at the assembled students. \'93Move along! Before I start taking even more house points from anyone left gawping!\'94
 she warned. Suddenly, there was a rush of feet on the floor all around them, until only Harry, Ron, Hermione, Malfoy and Neville remained in the high, echoing corridor. 
\par Malfoy was standing against the wall, still glaring at Neville and Harry. Neville had that strange look in his eyes again. 
\par \'93What\rquote s wrong, Malfoy? Don\rquote t want to duel without an audience?\'94 
\par A glare was his response, followed by, \'93I also don\rquote t seem to have my wand, Longbottom. But wand or no wand, if I find out you and Ginny have done anything, even if it\rquote s just extended snogging, so help me I\rquote ll--\'94 
\par Neville laughed. \'93She told me you\rquote d feel that way.\'94 Harry couldn\rquote t help but think that Neville was more afraid than he was letting on. The frightening thing to Harry was that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 he}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  felt very, very close to joining Malfoy against Neville, two against one, and he\rquote d had to muster every bit of his self-control (plus remind himself that he was Head Boy) when he\rquote d disarmed Malfoy. 
\par Malfoy shook his head now. \'93No, no. I will not believe that she\rquote d stoop that low. Not with you. Potter I could believe; for her to be with }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 would be like calling night day and purple green....It\rquote s just }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 wrong}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 
\par Neville smirked. \'93Then I suppose we shouldn\rquote t invite you to the Astronomy Tower this afternoon for a little show--\'94 
\par But suddenly, Malfoy was the least of Neville\rquote s problems. Ron strode across the corridor and picked Neville up by the front of his robes, banging his back against the stone wall, making a nearby classroom door shudder in its frame. \'93
If I find out you and Ginny--that you two have--\'94 
\par Neville held up his hands, all conciliatory now, smiling feebly. \'93Ron! Ron, old mate! Forgot you were here. Of course Ginny and I haven\rquote t done anything, of course not!\'94 His voice seemed to be
 about an octave higher than usual. Ron glared at him, still not releasing his hold. Finally, Hermione strode up to him. 
\par \'93Ten points from Gryffindor, Ron!\'94 she said sharply. He turned and looked at her in surprise, a little less angry. He slowly lowered Neville\rquote 
s feet to the floor and let go of his robes. Hermione looked like she was biting her tongue painfully, so she wouldn\rquote t say anything else. 
\par \'93You sure?\'94 Ron asked Neville, eyeing him suspiciously. Neville nodded vigorously. 
\par \'93That wasn\rquote t what you were implying a minute ago!\'94 Malfoy whinged. 
\par Neville looked back and forth between the two of them, evidently torn between antagonizing Ginny\rquote s brother or purposefully winding up her former boyfriend. \'93Well, erm, I mean--\'94 he stuttered. 
\par Harry turned to Ron in surprise; something had just struck him. \'93Ron! That\rquote s the most--}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  I\rquote ve seen you be since you got back from hospital.\'94 
\par Ron drew his lips into a line. \'93Yeah, well--I stopped taking my medicine last night. It helps me control my temper and--some other things. But the full moon\rquote 
s in a week and I have to start taking the Wolfsbane Potion again tonight, and the two potions aren\rquote t compatible, so I\rquote m off the other stuff for the next week.\'94 
\par Hermione looked at him with wide eyes. \'93Oooh! }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 That\rquote s}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  why you were acting that way!\'94 
\par Ron turned to her. \'93What way?\'94 But Harry knew just what she meant. He didn\rquote t quite know how to put it into words without insulting his best friend, though. 
\par \'93Like a bleeding zombie, Weasel,\'94 Malfoy drawled, obviously feeling no compunctions about insulting Ron. \'93Like you\rquote d had Cruciatus put on you for too long and what passes for your brain had turned to mush--\'94 
\par Suddenly Neville had sprung into action again and leaped forward, his wand not two inches from Draco Malfoy\rquote s chest. \'93Don\rquote t say another word, Malfoy! Not if you know what\rquote s good for you!\'94
 His voice was low and dangerous, and Harry was shocked. Yet he knew he shouldn\rquote t be; he\rquote d been incensed enough about Aunt Marge insulting his father that he\rquote d accidentally inflated her. If there was 
something that was a better definition of \'93bad form\'94 than making tactless comments about someone\rquote s dead or perpetually hospitalized parents, he couldn\rquote 
t think of it. Harry had never seen Neville look murderous before, and it was a bit of a jolt; he had never been more mindful of the fact that both of his parents had been Aurors. 
\par Draco Malfoy was still unarmed; he backed up against the wall and held up his hands now, his eyes wide. \'93What the hell--? What are you upset about now, you ponce? What did I say?\'94 
Harry could tell that it was the strangest thing in the world to him to be visibly afraid of Neville Longbottom. 
\par And then Harry realized that of course Malfoy didn\rquote t know about Neville\rquote s parents. He moved to stand next to Neville, putting his hand on his wand arm and forcing Neville to lower it. \'93He doesn\rquote t know, Nev. He doesn\rquote t know,
\'94 he said quietly, his hand around the other boy\rquote s wrist now.. 
\par Neville turned to Harry, looking at him blankly, as though he didn\rquote t recognize him. When the vacant expression left Neville\rquote s eyes, he had the good grace to flush as he put his wand back into his robes. \'93Sorry, Harry. You\rquote 
re right, of course. I just--I always feel like }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 everyone}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  knows...\'94 
\par Draco Malfoy threw up his hands. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 What}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  don\rquote t I know? That everyone in Gryffindor should have checked themselves into St. Mungo\rquote 
s, not just Weasley? Sorry to disappoint you all, but }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  I know.\'94 
\par Suddenly, Harry had to push Neville back again, and was surprised by the effort it took; it felt like he was about to go for Malfoy with just his bare hands, his eyes ablaze with fury. \'93What you don\rquote t know, Malfoy,\'94
 he hissed, as he continued to struggle against Harry, \'93is that my parents have been in St. Mungo\rquote s for the last sixteen years because }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Death Eaters}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 put Cruciatus on them for too long, and it turned their brains to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 mush}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , as you like to put it.\'94
 To his credit, Draco Malfoy actually looked shocked and sympathetic--for him. 
\par \'93They\rquote re--they\rquote re }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 what}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 he whispered. \'93Jesus, Longbottom. You\rquote re not serious...\'94
 he breathed, shaking his head. Then he looked like he'd had an epiphany. \'93Oh, is }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  what you were talking about when we came to see you at St. Mungo\rquote 
s, Potter? You said something about Fleur being like the Longbottoms, something about Cruciatus being put on them for a long time...Didn't know what you were on about at the time, but I didn't care enough to ask, frankly.\'94 
\par \'93Actually,\'94 Ron said, stepping forward now. \'93I met your mum and dad while I was in hospital, Nev. Same ward,\'94 he added sheepishly, his ears turning a little pink. \'93And they weren\rquote t doing }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 too}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  badly.\'94 Ron sounded like he was soft-pedaling their condition. \'93Except for the memory thing, of course,\'94 he added feebly. 
\par Malfoy frowned. \'93Memory thing?\'94 
\par Ron nodded. \'93Yeah. No short term memory. I played chess with Neville\rquote s dad in the common room a few times. Every couple of minutes I had to reintroduce myself to him; he\rquote d forgotten who I was, didn\rquote t think he\rquote 
d ever seen me before. And then he\rquote d look down at the chessboard, all surprised that it was there, and say, \lquote Oh, I must be taking over for whoever was playing you, son. Whose turn is it? Am I black?\rquote  And we\rquote 
d go on, make one or two moves, and it would start all over again. A couple of times he decided that he probably }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 shouldn\rquote t}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  be sitting there, that he\rquote 
d probably taken someone\rquote s seat who was in the middle of a chess game, and then I was stuck there with a half-finished game.\'94 He shrugged. \'93He wasn\rquote t being rude; he just didn\rquote t know.\'94 
\par Harry was shocked. Ron hadn\rquote t said anything about meeting the Longbottoms before. But Neville nodded now. \'93Yeah. That\rquote s why ever since I can remember, when Gran takes me to visit, and she tells them who I am, they say, \lquote No, that
\rquote s not Neville; our boy\rquote s a little bloke, not even two...\rquote  That\rquote s how they remember me. And
 to them--it was about five minutes ago that it happened. For the rest of their lives, it will always be five minutes after they were attacked. They remember their earlier lives, and things like the rules to chess. But every time they look up and everythi
ng seems new to them again, someone has to explain where they are and who the people around them are and things like that.\'94
 His voice had grown very soft; he looked down and away from the four of them, while Hermione stepped forward and put her hand gently on his arm. 
\par They were very quiet for a minute; then Harry said, \'93Why don\rquote t you three go down to lunch? I want to talk to Malfoy.\'94 
\par They all looked at him in surprise, except that Malfoy\rquote s expression was also tinged with suspicion. Ron hooked his arm over Neville\rquote s shoulders and started steering him away. \'93Yes, Nev. I do believe we need to have a talk about }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 my little sister}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ...\'94 
\par Harry saw Hermione frown at him before turning and walking with Neville and Ron to the Great Hall. Malfoy was eyeing him distrustfully. 
\par \'93Mind if I have my wand back now, Potter?\'94 
\par Harry had been holding both his wand and Malfoy\rquote s in his right hand. He handed Malfoy\rquote s back to him and, still eyeing each other, they put their wands in their robes. Harry leaned against the wall and crossed his arms. 
\par \'93So--what made you suddenly attack Neville like that?\'94 
\par Malfoy made a face. \'93You have to ask? God, I don\rquote t know how you can stand seeing them together. And don\rquote t tell me what they get up to in your common room; I don\rquote t think my stomach could
 take it. Admit it, Potter--seeing Ginny with Longbottom gets under your skin as much as it does mine.\'94 
\par Harry looked away from him now, knowing that the truth would be seen in his eyes. \'93Maybe it does,\'94 he admitted softly. \'93But I thought you were with Mariah now. Why are you worrying about Ginny when you\rquote ve got a new girlfriend?\'94 
\par Malfoy paced, running his fingers through his hair. \'93I just--the way we split up--well, I didn\rquote t notice that being with Granger kept you from worrying what Ginny was getting up to, when you were still together,\'94 he countered. 
\par Harry nodded, admitting this. \'93That\rquote s true,\'94 he said quietly. \'93But--I don\rquote t know. I saw you and Mariah running on the Hogsmeade Road, and that Crabbe and Goyle are hanging about with you lately, and I just--\'94
 He stopped, not sure how to go on. \'93You had them for friends before, but you still said you\rquote d never had a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 real}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 friend. I just thought--well, having both been told off by Ginny, I guess we have a bit more in common now in addition to the Prophecy...\'94 
\par Draco Malfoy smirked at him. \'93Oh, and you\rquote re offering to be my friend? Let me see--this wouldn\rquote t have anything to do with a certain Obedience Charm, would it? \lquote I\rquote ll just be Draco Malfoy\rquote s friend, so he doesn\rquote 
t decide to murder me.\rquote  I\rquote m not stupid, Potter. Now that I\rquote m not with Ginny, you reckon you\rquote ll be my connection to the goody-goodiness that is Gryffindor. Yeah. As if I need that. And if I }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 did}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  feel the need to hang about with a Gryffindor, I\rquote d rather it were the Head Girl than the Head Boy. At least I\rquote d have something to }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 look}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  at, then. And I reckon as each day passes that neither you nor Weasley agree to shag her--have I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 mentioned}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  what complete }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 idiots}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  the pair of you are?--she may eventually see that she has another, far }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 better}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  option before her...\'94 
\par Harry clenched and unclenched his fists, breathing deeply to keep his cool. \'93First, Malfoy, you do }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  speak about Hermione that way. You }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 have}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  a girlfriend, and Mariah would probably hex you good if she heard you say that. I don\rquote t know why I have to keep telling you how to be a good boyfriend. It\rquote 
s getting pretty tiring. Second--I was offering to be your friend because you said once that you needed a real friend, and technically, we already were friends. I have memories of those times, in a Pensieve, and I wondered whether you\rquote 
d like to see it some time.\'94 
\par Malfoy looked shocked. \'93Did--did Nanny Bella--er, Professor Figg--help you break through the memory charms? Oh, wow. I can\rquote t believe it...\'94 
\par Harry grimaced. \'93Er, no. Not exactly. But--well, I can\rquote t really explain right now. And at the moment we need to get down to lunch. But--I thought it was about time I told you this. I thought you should know, that you should understand....\'94 

\par Malfoy squinted at him. \'93Now you\rquote re being cryptic, Potter. If you\rquote re not going to show this to me now, let\rquote s just go eat.\'94 
\par Harry nodded and they made their way toward the entrance hall. As they descended the broad marble stairs, Draco Malfoy stopped suddenly and asked, \'93Oh, by the way, how\rquote s your aunt? I haven\rquote t seen her at the Slytherin 
table for a while. Is she sick? She hasn\rquote t asked me to walk Dunkirk at all, either.\'94 
\par Harry stopped. No one had told Malfoy. \'93Er, there\rquote s something I need to tell you, Malfoy.\'94 
\par \'93What?\'94 
\par \'93Aunt Petunia\rquote s gone.\'94 
\par \'93Gone?\'94 He frowned. \'93What d\rquote you mean }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 gone}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par \'93She decided to leave Hogwarts.\'94 
\par Malfoy\rquote s mouth hung open in shock. \'93Well--well no one told }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . When the hell did this happen? Did--did she take the dog with her too?\'94
 he asked, a little wistfully. 
\par Harry sighed. \'93Of course she took her dog with her, you git. When I got back from the match against France, Professors Dumbledore, McGonagall and Snape told me. They didn\rquote t tell }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  because you\rquote re not her nephew, just her dog-walker.\'94 
\par Malfoy scowled at him and Harry immediately regretted these words. \'93Oh, how I wish I\rquote d gone to that match when you were trounced by France! Seeing you }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 lose}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Potter, isn
\rquote t something I--\'94 
\par \'93--can do just anytime,\'94 Harry finished smugly, his arms crossed. 
\par They had reached the Great Hall. \'93So,\'94 Malfoy said, \'93can I see this Pensieve thing after lunch?\'94 he asked. Harry thought he was trying to sound casual about it, but suspected that he was very keen. 
\par \'93Today isn\rquote t good. After lunch I have Apparition.\'94 
\par Malfoy looked superior. \'93Oh, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that\rquote s}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  right. You don\rquote t have your license yet. Well, some other time then. And in the meantime, even if you don\rquote 
t mean it--tell Longbottom to sleep with one eye open. Just to unnerve him. I have to go eat now with my back to the Gryffindor table, so I don\rquote t risk seeing the two of them together and spew all over the place.\'94 
\par Some students near them made faces upon hearing him say \'93spew,\'94 and Malfoy moved off toward the Slytherin table, ignoring them and without looking again at Harry. Harry strode toward the Gryffindor table and sat bet
ween Ron and Hermione, grabbing a sandwich and starting to take large bites out of it, as lunch was almost over. He tried not to notice Neville and Ginny sitting together farther down the table, and wondered whether anyone had told her what had happened i
n the upstairs corridor. 
\par Ron looked suspiciously at Harry. \'93What did you want to talk to him about, then?\'94 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93Tell you later. When we\rquote re back from Apparition.\'94 
\par Hermione jogged his elbow as he tried to take another bite of his sandwich. \'93Harry! Ron! Mum and dad sent me a copy of the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Times}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  this morning, and I\rquote 
ve just had the chance to read it. Alicia\rquote s dad is a Member of Parliament now!\'94 She shoved the paper in front of Harry so that he could see the long article about the new MPs, including Alicia Spinnet\rquote s father. 
\par \'93Well, that\rquote s what Roger and Alicia were supposed to be working towards. Now that he\rquote s in, I wonder what they\rquote ll do? Alicia can\rquote t just go back to the village school in Hogsmeade; they\rquote ve probably already replaced her,
\'94 Harry said through a mouthful of food. He set the paper aside without reading it. 
\par Hermione shrugged. \'93He\rquote ll still need a staff. Maybe they\rquote ll work in his office in London. When you\rquote re an MP you need people to answer your phones, do research, deal with the press, schedule meetings with constituents...\'94 
\par Harry swallowed a large bite after minimal chewing. \'93I reckon. And won\rquote t they both need to make sure the press don\rquote t find out that his daughter and son-in-law are a witch and wizard?\'94 
\par Ron took a swig of pumpkin juice. \'93I reckon that\rquote s why they worked for him before he was elected--to hush up that sort of talk, so it wouldn\rquote t come out.\'94 
\par \'93Right,\'94 Hermione agreed. \'93If Fleet Street got hold of that, it might sound more like he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 thought}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  his daughter was a witch, and then he\rquote 
d be discredited, as though he said the sun goes around the earth...\'94 
\par \'93It }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 does}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 Ron said in mock surprise and horror. \'93
I thought it rose in the south and set in the north, carried through the sky on the back of an enormous turtle, and when he burps, that\rquote s when we get hail, and when he...\'94 Ron couldn\rquote 
t go on, he was laughing so hard at his own joke. Hermione rolled her eyes. Harry struggled to swallow another bite of sandwich through his own laughter. 
\par \'93Don\rquote t do that!\'94 he choked out when he could--barely--speak again. \'93Are you two trying to kill me?\'94 
\par They apologized; even Hermione was laughing now (at Harry\rquote s struggles with his food), but Harry couldn\rquote t help but think about the boy sitting on the other side of the Great Hall, his back to the Gryffindor table so he couldn\rquote 
t see Ginny with Neville. No, his two best friends would never really do anything to hurt him. But Draco Malfoy might. Harry hadn\rquote t wanted to tell him how spot-on he was; once he had the thought of being Malfoy\rquote s friend to avoid any possib
le problems with the Obedience Charm, he wondered why he hadn\rquote t thought of it before. He just needed to show him what good friends they\rquote 
d been in his other life, and how awful the world had been with Voldemort virtually in charge. Surely he couldn\rquote t see that without being affected--could he? 
\par He rose to leave for Apparition and glanced at the Slytherin table, remembering when he\rquote d first run over there as an excited first-year, in his other life, ecstatic that he was going to be in the same house as his dad and best mate. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 You\rquote ll see, Malfoy. We can do this--we can be friends. In this life. It\rquote ll just take a little effort...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par As Neville and Ginny left the Great Hall hand in hand, Harry tried not to seethe, and then he saw that Malfoy, also moving toward the door and seeing them, had made a rude gesture behind their backs. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Correction,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry thought, a little wearily. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 A lot of effort...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

n Ron and Hermione, so that he and Neville were standing alone in the corridor with the portrait of the Fat Lady. 
\par Harry felt rather weary. \'93What is it, Neville?\'94 
\par Neville opened his mouth to speak, closed it again, then opened it once more. After two more false starts, Harry said, \'93Well, when you figure out what you actually want to say--don\rquote t contact me. Bye,\'94
 he added, moving toward the portrait and opening his mouth to give the password. 
\par \'93Wait! No, Harry. Sorry, I just--I\rquote m not sure how to talk about this.\'94 
\par Harry turned and frowned, having a sinking feeling he knew what Neville was talking about. \'93Don\rquote t you mean }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 her}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? As in Ginny?\'94 
\par Neville nodded nervously. \'93Listen, Harry, Ginny told me about--about the two of you. And about you and Mariah. And Draco Malfoy and Mariah. I couldn\rquote t believe it. I understand now, and I don\rquote 
t blame you for being upset about the situation. Who wouldn\rquote t be upset? But I just wanted to check--that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 we\rquote re}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  all right.\'94 
\par \'93Huh? We?\'94 
\par \'93You and me. I just...\'94 Neville looked a bit embarrassed now. \'93I don\rquote t want you to hate me, Harry. Since--since you still care for her and all.\'94 
\par Harry didn\rquote t deny Neville\rquote s last statement. He swallowed, looking at the other boy\rquote s earnest face, thinking of his parents not recognizing him, of the cauldrons he\rquote 
d melted over the years (and the points Snape had taken from Gryffindor because of it); he thought of losing the duel to him and then sitting vigil by his bedside when he\rquote d become addicted to the potions that had helped him win the duel. 
\par He felt deflated. \'93No, Neville,\'94 he sighed. \'93I don\rquote t hate you.\'94 
\par Neville peered at him doubtfully. \'93You sure?\'94 
\par Harry rolled his eyes now. \'93Yes, I\rquote m sure. I don\rquote t hate you.\'94 It helped to say it aloud, it actually did; he realized now that he\rquote d been trying to convince himself that he hated Neville, and he also realized why that hadn
\rquote t worked. He couldn\rquote t talk himself into disliking someone he liked any more than he could talk himself into liking someone he disliked. (He\rquote d tried that with Dunkirk, to no avail.) 
\par \'93Oh, that\rquote s great, Harry!\'94 Neville said, bobbing about on the balls of his feet, making Harry fear that a hug was imminent. 
\par He gave the password to the Fat Lady and said, \'93S\rquote okay, Neville. Don\rquote t worry about it,\'94 as he stepped over the th
reshold into the Gryffindor common room. Unfortunately, the first thing that greeted him was a row between Ron and Hermione, which was suddenly reminding him of their row after the Yule Ball in fourth year. 
\par \'93Be reasonable, Ron!\'94 
\par \'93Reasonable! Oh, you want the great hairy animal to be }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 reasonable}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ! Well, I\rquote ll give you reasonable. It\rquote

\par He stopped, biting his lip; Harry saw that he was making it bleed. \'93I--I know he feels bad about that. Worse than bad. And I don\rquote t ever want to feel that way about someone else. I feel dreadful enough about hurting Parvati....\'94 
\par He ran his hand through his hair, the white lock flopping over his brow amidst the red. Hermione backed up from him, then turned and met Harry\rquote s eye; she looked like she\rquote d been 
crying. Luckily, no one else was in the common room. Then he saw that she\rquote d spotted Neville. 
\par \'93Neville!\'94 she cried, sounding triumphant. Ginny came down the stairs from the girls\rquote  dorm. 
\par \'93Neville!\'94 she also said, approaching him. \'93I\rquote ve got my things. Why don\rquote t you get yours, and then we can go to the library and--\'94 
\par \'93Sorry,\'94 Hermione interrupted her. \'93I need Neville right now. Come on, Neville.\'94 She grabbed him by the hand and pulled him back toward the portrait hole. He stumbled after her. 
\par \'93But--but Ginny and I were--\'94 
\par \'93Not anymore. Come on.\'94 She opened the portrait and then suddenly pulled Neville\rquote s mouth to hers. He grunted an inarticulate protest, then stumbled after her again when she pulled on the front of his robes, giving him no choice but to follo
w her. 
\par Ron, Ginny and Harry stood looking at the back of the closed portrait with their mouths open. Ginny turned to Ron and said, \'93But--but Neville--\'94 
\par Harry felt very uncomfortable. Then he noticed that Ginny looked flustered, but not dreadfully jealous. He peered at her, interested in this reaction. \'93Aren\rquote t you going to try to get your boyfriend back, Ginny?\'94
 he asked her suddenly. She jerked her head around as though she\rquote d just woken up, then scowled and strode to the portrait hole and left without a word. 
\par Ron stood looking at Harry with rather pink ears. Finally, he also moved toward the portrait hole. Harry smiled. \'93Good. You\rquote re going after her,\'94 he said with satisfaction. Ron stopped and shook his head without looking at Harry. 
\par Still facing away from him, he corrected Harry\rquote s mistake. \'93Actually, it\rquote s time for my potion.\'94 He continued on, and after that Harry was standing alone in the common room.

taken for a fifth-year Ravenclaw, Kurt Harrison, who was getting very obsessive about O.W.L. revision. (Harry had made the mistake of telling him how many O.W.L.s he\rquote 
d received when he asked.) He was patrolling with the other fifth-year Ravenclaw prefect, Jade Peters, plus both sixth-year Ravenclaws, Trixie Lewis and Walter Word; he reckoned that when he was done, at seven in the morning, he\rquote 
d want to sleep until ten o\rquote clock and then grab some food from the kitchens before going to History of Magic, where he would probably be able to continue sleeping. 
\par On his way back to the Gryffindor common room, he passed Ron, Tony and Ruth, on their way out to go running. Harry frowned. 
\par \'93Where are Ginny and Hermione?\'94 he asked the three of them. 
\par \'93Hermione wanted to talk to Ginny about something,\'94 Ruth told him, gesturing toward Gryffindor Tower. \'93She said they\rquote d be along.\'94 
\par Harry nodded, but when he gave the password to the Fat La
dy and the portrait started to open, some instinct told him to wait before entering; holding the portrait open a crack, he looked into the common room and saw Ginny and Hermione standing facing each other, Ginny with her arms crossed obstinately, Hermione
 flailing her arms in entreaty. 
\par \'93Oh, come on, Ginny! You didn\rquote t see Malfoy in the corridor; he would have hurt Neville if there hadn\rquote t been so many people around. You can\rquote t put him at risk anymore. It\rquote s not fair to him.\'94 
\par Ginny lifted her chin. \'93Neville isn\rquote t afraid of Draco. And that was so }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 obviously}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  for show I\rquote

\rquote t you think if Draco really wanted to hurt Neville he\rquote d find a way to do it as sneakily as possible, so it couldn\rquote 
t ever be traced back to him? No, he was putting on a little show yesterday. It was his This-is-how-much-I-love-you-Ginny-so-please-come-back-to-me show. He knew I\rquote d find out about it. Showing his love and devotion before a crowd. That\rquote 
s what he was trying to do, not hurt Neville. That was just an excuse.\'94 
\par \'93And what makes you think he won\rquote t }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 also}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  try something a bit less public? Neville\rquote s got a huge bullseye on himself right now, and it\rquote 
s just not fair to him, Ginny.\'94 
\par Ginny was sputtering. \'93I can\rquote t believe you! You tell Ron that he shouldn\rquote t be afraid of hurting you like he hurt Parvati, but if I continue to see Neville, I\rquote m putting him in danger from my big bad ex-boyfriend. What you\rquote 
re proposing sounds far more dangerous to me, Hermione. I mean--if I had to choose between fearing Draco Malfoy or--\'94 
\par \'93Erm--\'94 Harry said as he entered, and then cleared his throat; he\rquote d been unable to wait to go up to the dorm any longer--he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 really}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  needed to visit the loo. 
\par \'93Good morning, girls,\'94 he said somewhat stiffly. The both stopped and turned crimson, for some reason. 
\par \'93Ah, good morning, Harry,\'94 Hermione said brightly, after initially hesitating. \'93I think we should go running now,\'94 she added hurriedly, grabbing Ginny\rquote s wrist and dragging her toward the portrait hole. 
\par Harry wasn\rquote t sure whether to try to figure out what the girls had been talking about--was it just that Hermione thought Neville was in danger from Malfoy?--or just wait
 for it to come out later. As he was very tired, he opted for the latter and dragged himself up to bed. 
\par The next morning, he paused before going to the Quidditch pitch with the others for the morning run. \'93I\rquote ll be right there,\'94 he said, watching Hermione,
 Ron, Ginny, Ruth and Tony walk on ahead. Ruth and Tony were holding hands and swinging their arms. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Oh well,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
One happy couple, at least.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par He waited on the top steps of the castle, hands in his pockets, looking at the morning sky, and a few minutes later, the heavy wooden door opened again and Draco Malfoy and Mariah Kirkner emerged in their running clothes. They stopped in their tracks when
 they saw Harry. 
\par Malfoy frowned. \'93What now, Potter? You still haven\rquote t shown me--that thing you were going to show me.\'94 He looked worried that Mariah might figure out what he meant. 
\par \'93I was knackered yesterday. And besides, I had to get it ready. How about after breakfast?\'94 
\par Malfoy regarded him with his arms crossed over his chest. \'93All right,\'94 he said guardedly. \'93Mind if we go running now?\'94 
\par \'93Yeah, actually, I do.\'94 
\par Malfoy dropped his arms and stepped toward Harry. \'93Excuse me?\'94 he said, a challenge in his voice. 
\par \'93I mind you doing it on your own. Stop the self-segregation thing. Come back to the Quidditch pitch with the rest of us.\'94 
\par Mariah looked at Draco as though afraid of what his reaction would be. They she looked shyly at Harry. 
\par \'93Do--do ye forgive me, Harry?\'94 
\par He drew his lips into a line. \'93You\rquote re not the first person who\rquote s done something with good intentions and had it go bad. Yeah, I reckon I forgive you. I--I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 understand}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  what you were trying to do...\'94 
\par She nodded and gave him a small smile. \'93Thank you.\'94 
\par Malfoy looked at him, his chin lifted. \'93Well, I\rquote m not asking for forgiveness from you.\'94 
\par Harry looked at him levelly. \'93I didn\rquote t ask you to. I just asked you to stop playing the martyr and come run with the rest of us.\'94 
\par \'93That\rquote s not what you said the first time.\'94 
\par He shrugged. \'93I didn\rquote t say what I thought the reason was for the self-segregation.\'94 
\par \'93Think I\rquote m playing the martyr, do you?\'94 
\par Harry sighed. \'93Do you really think this is the time to discuss this? We can get into it later. I\rquote m going down to the Quidditch pitch. Are you two coming or not?\'94 
\par Malfoy looked uncertainly at Mariah. She tilted her head in entreaty and he nodded at Harry. \'93All right. You, erm, haven\rquote t said anything to Weasley or Granger about--things I said the other day, have you?\'94 
\par Harry gave him a lopsided smile, to keep him guessing for a moment. \'93Relax. You\rquote re safe,\'94 he finally said, laughing. He turned to go down the steps and they fell in behind him. When they reached the pitch, he wasn\rquote 
t quite prepared for how surprised the others looked. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Damn,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Don\rquote t make me regret doing this,}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought at them, hoping they\rquote d do the right thing. 
\par To their credit, they did. While Hermione and Ron were warming up by doing katas, Tony and Ruth were spotting each other while doing sit-ups; they rose and each offered to do the same for Draco and Mariah. Which left Harry with Ginny. They didn\rquote 
t speak, just did some str
etching next to each other, looking off into the distance. Except that once, Harry turned and caught her eye, and the expression he saw there made him catch his breath with hope. She was completely unguarded, not having expected him to turn his head, and 
after locking eyes with her for what seemed to be a very long moment, he turned away as the others ended their stretching and prepared to start running. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I was just imagining it,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he told himself, trying not to get his hopes up. He glanced at Draco Malfoy, who was scowling at Harry. Harry hoped he\rquote 
d still meet to look at the Pensieve after breakfast. 
\par When they were done, Mariah was spotting Ginny while doing sit-ups this time, and Harry was helping Hermione while Ron did some more kata. \'93Hermione,\'94 he whispered to. \'93Look at Mariah and Ginny. They seem to be getting along now.\'94 
\par Hermione turned her head when she was sitting up, then back when she needed to go back down to the ground. \'93Could be. I expect Ginny had to cool down eventually. They were actually friends for a while...\'94 
\par Harry shook his head. \'93Don\rquote t you think it\rquote s strange? I thought Ginny was going to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 kill}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  her,\'94 he whispered. Hermione didn\rquote 
t respond, just continued to do her sit-ups while he held her ankles and glanced at Ginny and Mariah--especially 
Ginny, who, despite the colder weather, was wearing shorts for running. Following the line of her long legs from the bottoms of her shorts to her ankle was more torture than he could bear, so he tried to focus on something else again, and thought about th
e things he would show Malfoy in his Pensieve; he\rquote d spent his second free period organizing it after lunch the day before. 
\par After the boys showered and bathed in the boy prefects\rquote  bathroom (Ron simply went along with the three others now, no more protesting about his not being a prefect), they all trooped down to the Great Hall for breakfast. There weren\rquote 
t many people present, as it was Saturday and many of the students slept late. Breakfast would remain on the tables in the Great Hall until nearly ten-thirty, to accommodate the late-risers. 
\par When he\rquote d had some eggs, toast and bacon, Harry turned to see what Draco Malfoy was up to; when he turned he found that the Slytherin was already looking at him. Harry nodded and Malfoy nodded back. Harry finished chewin
g and stood, walking toward the anteroom just off the Great Hall. He was gratified when, a minute later, Draco Malfoy understood he was to go in the same room, and he stepped in and closed the door. 
\par \'93Right, Malfoy. You understood...\'94 
\par Malfoy rolled his eyes. \'93Blind beggars in Micronesia understood what you were getting at, Potter. So. Where\rquote s this Pensieve?\'94 
\par \'93Upstairs still. I need to tell you a few things first. To explain.\'94 
\par And so he once again launched into the story of how Voldemort had stopped him from getting onto Platform Nine-and-Three-Quarters at the beginning of his sixth year, how he\rquote d changed time when he saved his mother (he didn\rquote 
t mention the Imperius Curse) and how, when he woke up in his other life, Snape was his stepfather and Draco Malfoy was his best friend. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 What}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 Malfoy said in disbelief. \'93This is ridiculous. I didn\rquote t come here for a fairy-story...\'94 
\par \'93It\rquote s not. It really happened.\'94 He explained the way Snape had never been exposed, the way Lucius Malfoy thought he was still a loyal D
eath Eater, who was now keeping an eye on one of the people in the Prophecy, bringing him up to serve the Dark Lord. \'93He and my mum had to socialize with your mum and dad a lot because of that, and so we were together quite a lot. Well, and Jamie too.
\'94 
\par \'93Your sister,\'94 Malfoy said in a disbelieving monotone. 
\par \'93Right. She became your girlfriend.\'94 
\par Malfoy\rquote s pale eyebrows flew up in surprise. \'93Really! You permitted me to be with your sister!\'94 
\par Harry scuffed the stone floor with his feet. \'93She was in love with you,\'94 he said, addressing the stone flags. When he raised his eyes again, he saw that Malfoy\rquote s expression of disbelief had been replaced by avidness. 
\par \'93All right, all right, so where the hell is it?\'94 
\par Harry checked his watch. \'93It\rquote s late enough now that the other blokes should be out of our dorm. I don\rquote t want to carry it very far; it\rquote s rather full. You have to come upstairs.\'94 
\par Malfoy swallowed and Harry wondered why he was so nervous. \'93Why didn\rquote t you tell me about this before? You said Granger and Weasley know. And Ginny. And even Snape and Dumbledore. Oh, and Sirius.\'94
 Harry was startled for a moment, not having realized that he called Sirius by his first name. 
\par \'93I felt they needed to know. They kept wondering how I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 knew}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  things. Things I learned in my other life. But I didn\rquote t know how to tell }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  some of the things that happened in that life. Things like our being best friends. And things like--\'94
 He paused nervously, trying to get his nerve up. Finally, he just blurted it out. \'93Things like Ginny being my girlfriend.\'94 
\par Malfoy had been turning toward the door; now he turned and faced Harry, his eyes very round. \'93What? Ginny was your girlfriend? Typical,\'94 he snarled. \'93Gryffindors sticking together...\'94 
\par \'93But I wasn\rquote t a Gryffindor. I--I was a Slytherin. Because I wanted to be with you, and Snape. My best friend and my dad.\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Dad,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 Malfoy mouthed, shaking his head. \'93So she was with you even though you were a Slytherin?\'94 Harry nodded, surprised to see a smirk on Malfoy\rquote s face. \'93
I think she\rquote s attracted to the forbiddenness of it. She }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 likes}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  knowing people think it\rquote s wrong,\'94
 he said suggestively. Harry could tell he was just trying to get him wound up. 
\par \'93Maybe,\'94 he conceded. \'93I was also stalking her from the age of eleven.\'94 
\par Malfoy squeaked again. \'93Stalking her! Bloody hell, Potter. And she went for you even after that?\'94 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93It\rquote s rather a long story. Come on. Let\rquote s go now. You\rquote ll see what I mean.\'94 
\par When walked through the Great Hall, very few straggling students were seated at the house tables eating their bre
akfasts and no one took any notice of Harry and Draco Malfoy. However, when, after climbing stair after stair, they were finally outside the Gryffindor common room, Harry hesitated. 
\par \'93Hmm. I don\rquote t know that I should just walk into our common room with you. A few people might think it\rquote s strange, or compromising security. Tell you what, you hide down the corridor there a little ways; I\rquote 
ll give the password and go in, then come back out with my Invisibility Cloak. You can put it on and come in without anyone knowing you\rquote re in Gryffindor Tower. Okay?\'94 
\par Malfoy shrugged and agreed. When he was well away, Harry whispered the password to the Fat Lady and the portrait swung open. Harry saw a few younger students in the common room, plus Seamus and Dean. He didn\rquote 
t see Ron or Hermione anywhere, or Neville and Ginny. He strode up to his dorm and was relieved to find it empty. He was back at the portrait hole a minute later, the cloak tucked under his robes. He opened the portrait, stepped into the corridor while ho
lding it open, hissing, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Come on!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94
 to Malfoy, who came running quickly. Harry draped the cloak over him while they were both in the corridor with the portrait open, and then Harry shoved his unseen form into the common room, crossing to the boys\rquote  stairs aga
in without anyone noticing that he was being rather inconstant in his desire to go or stay. 
\par When they reached the seventh-year dorm, Harry closed the door and reached out to remove the cloak from Malfoy. He suddenly appeared, looking more shocked than Harry had thought he\rquote d be. 
\par \'93Blimey. I\rquote ve seen that common room--late at night, anyway--and I kind of thought it was nicer than ours, but this is }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 really}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 --\'94 
\par Harry grinned. \'93Yeah. When I landed in my other life, it was really hard to get used to the Slytherin dorms. This is so high up and airy. If you didn\rquote 
t have claustrophobia when you started living in Slytherin House, you would have it before long...\'94 
\par He strode to his trunk and put the cloak in, then, still bending over, he gently took the Pensieve in his hands and lifted it out, turning to place it on Ron\rquote s trunk. He closed his own trunk and sat on it. \'93Any other questions before we do this?
\'94 
\par Draco Malfoy looked at the Pensieve and swallowed, but then he also shook his head. \'93What do I do?\'94 
\par \'93Take out your wand.\'94 
\par He did as he was told, stirring the milky substance in the stone bowl with his wand, then bending over, as Harry told him, until his nose touched the cold surface. There was a rushing sound, and then Draco Malfoy was inside Harry\rquote s Pensieve.

s office. They watched the other Harry, the one with no scar and the Scots accent, turn to Ginny. Malfoy had teased mercilessly about the accent when he\rquote d first landed in the Pensieve. Now, after seeing random snatches of y
ears of memories, the accent coming out of the other Harry seemed quite natural, as was the absence of the scar. 
\par The other Harry didn\rquote t have a chance to say anything before she had launched herself at him, throwing her arms around his neck and pulling his mouth down to hers. Harry turned to look at Draco Malfoy; this wasn\rquote t the first time he\rquote 
d shown him kissing Ginny. He\rquote d tried to prepare him, to explain that in }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  life, Draco Malfoy had never been interested in Ginny Weasley. 
\par \'93But weren\rquote t you still seeing Granger on September first, when you sort of crossed over?\'94 
\par Harry looked away. \'93Yeah, I was technically still with Hermione. I know, I know...\'94 
\par Harry hadn\rquote t included any instances that involved clothing being removed, even a little; he didn\rquote t want to invade his and Ginny\rquote s privacy quite to that degree. He didn\rquote 
t include anything from their night in the Quidditch changing rooms, but he indicated obliquely that they\rquote d slept together, partly for warmth. Malfoy gave him a look he couldn\rquote t decipher. 
\par \'93Do you think I\rquote m daft? Of course you slept together! You don\rquote t have to tell me. I\rquote m not Weasley. He doesn\rquote t know, does he?\'94 Harry admitted that he hadn\rquote t told him or Hermione or Ginny. \'93But you\rquote 
re telling me,\'94 he said softly. 
\par Harry nodded. \'93It was another life. It was once. And--it didn\rquote t really go very well...It wasn\rquote t under ideal circumstances or anything...\'94 
\par Malfoy looked conflicted. \'93Is this more of showing me what we have in common? Because last time I checked, I\rquote d never had the chance to actually consummate our relationship.\'94 
\par \'93Shh,\'94 was Harry\rquote s only answer. The other Harry and Ginny were kissing deeply, and Harry could see now that Draco Malfoy was experiencing it vicariously, his jaw open slightly as he watched, his eyes slightly glazed; Harry thought
 he was probably remembering what it was like to kiss Ginny. He shivered with the memory himself, trying not to show how affected he was. 
\par Harry-the-Slytherin opened his lips and drank her in, holding her face up with one hand, bringing his other hand arou
nd to press against the small of her back; he kissed her as though he never would again, and Harry remembered the feeling of her fingers entwined in his hair, her warm body pressed again him. He broke the kiss and pulled her to him even more closely, pres
sing his face into her hair, Harry remembered that he\rquote d had to try very hard not to cry. He pulled back and looked at her, his hands framing her face. \'93I love you, Ginny. I love you so much....\'94 
\par She nodded. \'93I love you, too,\'94 she whispered hoarsely; she so
unded as though her throat were too constricted to function. She started crying first; he tasted the saltiness as he lavished kisses on her forehead, her cheeks, the orbits beneath her brows, her chin, her nose....Finally, he seemed to realize that he had
 to make her go, before he started to weep as well. 
\par \'93Good bye, Ginny,\'94 he said softly. 
\par She moved toward the opening. \'93Good bye, Harry,\'94 she whispered over her shoulder. Ginny turned and walked slowly through the archway, and as soon as she was through, th
e stones reappeared, and both Harrys and Draco Malfoy found themselves staring at a blank, grey stone wall. 
\par Harry was determined that Draco Malfoy should understand. He showed him Ron coming out of hiding, because he thought Ginny was pregnant. The discov
ery by Binns. And then the fateful trip up to the cave with Ron and his mother and the other Draco Malfoy. The first time he saw himself at roughly the age of sixteen, he walked all around himself, eyeing the other version critically. 
\par \'93I didn\rquote t take up running, did I?\'94 
\par \'93No. Thought I was daft for doing it.\'94 
\par \'93Huh.\'94 
\par Harry braced himself, looking away when his mother flew backwards to her death in the cave, feeling the rebel tear streak down his cheek. He looked up at Malfoy, who wore a stricken look on his face. 
\par \'93She was going to kill Ron,\'94 he explained softly. Malfoy nodded, swallowing. As each successively scene swirled into existence around them, Malfoy became quieter and quieter; Harry wasn\rquote 
t sure, but he thought Malfoy might be breaking his own record for longest time without making a snide remark. At the trial, Malfoy was shocked when Harry accused his Inquisitor\rquote 
s own son of being a Death Eater, and even more shocked when the dementor was approaching Harry and his dad released the Patronus in the form of a flock of bats. 
\par \'93All right Snape!\'94 Malfoy said admiringly, a lopsided smile on his face. Harry didn\rquote t show him Azkaban, simply told him he went there. 
\par \'93You--you went to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Azkaban}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 he breathed, incredulous. Harry nodded. 
\par \'93But I broke out, the same way Sirius did, using my Animagus form.\'94 
\par \'93Why? I thought you were only given five years.\'94 
\par Harry drew his lips into a line. \'93My dad sent me a letter. Ginny was dead. And Jamie. And Simon was in hospital. Binns had found them and attacked them.\'94 Harry covered his eyes with his hand. \'93The next time you call me \lquote Perfect Potter,
\rquote  or some other annoying thing like that, just remember--my own life had to go to hell before I realized that I\rquote d created a world that should never have been, before I finally acted to change it back.\'94 He looked at Malfoy again now. \'93
And I never could have done it without you.\'94 
\par Malfoy turned, looked behind himself for a moment as though unsure whom Harry was addressing. \'93Me?\'94 
\par As the scene changed again to Alicia Spinnet\rquote s lodge on her parents\rquote 
 estate, Harry explained how they went on the run, flying by night and walking by day, with some help from the Muggle-born witches. He had already shown him Lucius Malfoy giving his son the diary of Tom Riddle; now he expl
ained that the plan was to get Riddle to emerge from the diary so that Harry could perform the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Tempus Bonae Voluntatis}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 spell with him again and go back to the night his father died and mother }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 should}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  have died. 
\par \'93You agreed to sacrifice yourself. It was only because of you that I was able to put it all right again.\'94 
\par Malfoy looked at him in disbelief, as though Harry were imagining things. Soon the whirling fog deposited them in Hermione\rquote s London flat, paint drop cloths and ladders strewn about. The encounte
r with the cop who wanted to try out her Swedish on Draco; he was chuckling at his own antics, but wincing at the mock-Swedish accent. Then he saw his other self with Hermione up against the wall, his lips on her neck, his hands moving over her, and his j
aw dropped. \'93You--you didn\rquote t show this to Weasley, did you?\'94 he asked. Harry shook his head; Malfoy was ever mindful of self-preservation. 
\par \'93Of course not. Plus, I was showing them the Pensieve at the same time. Hermione would hex me into the middle of the next century if she knew that--well, that this had happened. Even though it was a different life.\'94 
\par Malfoy moved closer to the two now, watching Hermione\rquote s face as she abandoned herself temporarily to the feelings resulting from Draco Malfoy kissing and to
uching her. Harry waited for a crass comment from Malfoy but received nothing more than a very soft, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Wow.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93Except,\'94 Harry cautioned him, \'93that wasn\rquote t really you.\'94 
\par \'93Yeah, yeah, I know. Different life. Damn. Don\rquote t I wish I could hold this over Granger--\'94 
\par \'93That\rquote s not what I mean. Look here. See his eyes?\'94 
\par Draco Malfoy peered into his own eyes, shivering for a moment. \'93Yeah. What is that?\'94 
\par \'93That\rquote s Riddle. He was already experimenting with taking you over. He was in control, not you. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 He}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  was the one carrying on with Hermione.\'94 
\par The swirling greyness engulfed them once more, and Harry warned him, \'93What happens next--are you sure you want to see it?\'94 
\par Malfoy frowned at him through the fog. \'93Why?\'94 
\par \'93It\rquote s your dad dying.\'94 
\par Malfoy\rquote s eyes widened as their feet landed on the painfully green grass on the cliffs at Dover. 
\par \'93We can skip it if you like.\'94 
\par Draco Malfoy looked around. \'93No. You--you saw your mum die again. And you didn\rquote t want her to die. Let me at least enjoy seeing this,\'94 he said, his voice hard. So Harr
y let him watch his father fly backwards off the cliff, and he watched his face, how he set his jaw, and something made Harry shudder. Somehow, seeing Malfoy watch his father die with no emotions revealed was very eerie. 
\par Finally, they were in the tent in Godric\rquote 
s Hollow, and the other Draco was explaining to the other Harry that it was his fault that the sea-basilisk had gone after Ginny. They saw the blond boy fade and slip into unconsciousness; they saw the other Harry meet Tom Riddle. 
\par Harry saw that Malfoy was watching very closely when the other Harry was trying to hex Tom Riddle and failing. 
\par \'93That\rquote s how you knew about it,\'94 he said softly. 
\par Harry nodded. \'93Yeah. I learned about it the hard way.\'94 
\par Nonetheless, Malfoy was shocked when Harry set the diary on fire, causing Riddle to disappear. Harry looked at Malfoy, who was white as a ghost. 
\par \'93Is it--is it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 all}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  here?\'94 
\par \'93What?\'94 
\par Malfoy looked toward the Potter cottage, through the trees. \'93You know. When--when he tried to kill you--\'94 
\par \'93Yeah. We can stay and see it, if you like. But--but I may not watch. I\rquote ve seen it too many times now, you know?\'94 
\par Malfoy nodded, and Harry would have found it very easy to believe that it was his friend from his other life; there was a sympathy in the eyes that wasn\rquote 
t normally there. Harry hung about in the trees while Malfoy went to the edge of the copse to watch. Harry heard the explosion, heard his dad die after telling his mother to flee with their child. He heard his mother offer her life for his, the 
sound of speeding death as her wish was granted, then the inhuman cry of Voldemort being ripped from his body. 
\par He turned and walked toward where Draco was standing, his mouth open slightly, his eyes in what seemed a permanent stare, as though he would never blink again. 
\par \'93That\rquote s enough, I think. Come on,\'94 Harry said, putting his hand on the other boy\rquote 
s elbow. He felt them rising up and out of the Pensieve, and then flipping over and landing on the floor of the dorm. When Draco Malfoy lifted his face, he looked just a bit traumatized. 
\par \'93You all right?\'94 Harry asked him uncertainly. Malfoy nodded. 
\par \'93So that\rquote s how it happened,\'94 he whispered. He looked up at Harry\rquote s scar. \'93How you got the scar.\'94 
\par Harry swallowed. \'93She didn\rquote t just sacrifice herself for me; she did it for us all, even though she had no idea what would happen as a result. And you sacrificed yourself, as well.\'94 
\par Malfoy grimaced. \'93You keep saying that. You heard what he said. What I said. It was selfish. It was so he--I--wouldn\rquote t remember your sister.\'94 He paused, shaking his head. \'93I\rquote 
d ask how the hell you got such a pretty sister, but I saw your mum at the seaside; I don\rquote t need to ask.\'94 
\par Harry decided not to be offended by this; instead he tried to joke about it. \'93Well, you weren\rquote t the only one who noticed her. Ron fancied her, but he wouldn\rquote t admit it. Although technically, Cho was his girlfriend, so he shouldn\rquote 
t have been admitting to fancying someone else....\'94 
\par \'93So,\'94 Malfoy said slowly. \'93You and Ginny. In that life.\'94 
\par Harry braced himself; perhaps Malfoy was experiencing a bit of a delayed reaction. \'93Yeah, about that, Malfoy--\'94 
\par But he nodded instead. \'93I--I think I understand now.\'94 
\par Harry frowned. \'93You do?\'94 
\par Malfoy shrugged. \'93Well--Oh, never mind. What I mean is--We both loved her. And we\rquote ve both lost her.\'94 He looked Harry in the eye. \'93You\rquote re right about that. I mean, about having it in common.\'94 
\par Harry nodded grimly. \'93You\rquote re not angry?\'94 he ventured carefully. 
\par Malfoy looked like he had to think about it. \'93I\rquote m--I\rquote m jealous. And enjoy that while you can--I\rquote m never admitting it again. But--\'94 he sighed. \'93It isn\rquote t like I can\rquote 
t identify. God! If I were sleeping all night with Ginny lying naked on top of me, and having no clothes on myself....Well, let\rquote s just say that the words \lquote self-control\rquote  would }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  be needed to describe what would be going on...\'94 
\par He looked a little wistful then. \'93You mentioned that you two were in the showers. You wouldn\rquote t be interested in showing just a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 little}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  of--\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 No,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 Harry said firmly. \'93Besides, you probably took a look at her in the showers plenty when you had the amulet. Personally, that was why I }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 gave}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  you the amulets--I started seeing the two of you in the greenhouses after she\rquote d received her O.W.L. results. I didn\rquote 
t know about Sprout interrupting you at that time, and I couldn\rquote t stomach the idea of seeing the two of you together whenever I touched it, so I knew I had to get rid of it.\'94 
\par Malfoy frowned, not understanding. \'93You, Harry, are lacking in the necessary curiosity to be a bonafide voyeur. Pity, with that Invisibility Cloak and all.\'94
 He smiled at Draco Malfoy, who looked unnerved by this, looking behind himself in a panic suddenly. \'93What?\'94 he demanded. \'93What\rquote s going on now? Why do you look like that?\'94 
\par Harry grinned more broadly. \'93You just called me Harry.\'94 
\par The other boy looked relieved when he said this. \'93Oh, is that all? Well, it isn\rquote t as though I haven\rquote t done before. And I was seeing myself call you that for--what? The last couple of hours...\'94 He checked his watch. \'93
The last six hours!\'94 he exclaimed. \'93Bloody hell! We missed lunch!\'94 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93It took a while to show you everything. There was all that stuff from our early childhoods--\'94 
\par \'93I know, I know. I don\rquote t want to take another six hours to go over it.\'94 He put his hand on his stomach and Harry actually heard it growl from about six feet away. \'93I\rquote m bloody starving, and dinner won\rquote 
t be for a couple of hours...\'94 
\par Harry grinned. \'93Haven\rquote t you ever nicked food from the kitchens?\'94 
\par Draco Malfoy raised one eyebrow. \'93And it\rquote s Slytherins people are told to watch out for. Meanwhile, the Gryffindors are all involved in grand larceny...\'94 
\par Harry laughed. \'93I hardly think getting some pumpkin juice and a snack from the kitchens is \lquote grand larceny.\rquote  I\rquote ll bet Dobby could dig up some eclairs for us...\'94 
\par Malfoy made a face. \'93Dobby! I forgot about him. He was the worst elf we ever had! Completely insubordinate!\'94 
\par \'93He was miserable, and wanted to be free,\'94 Harry said defensively. \'93Anyway--I wanted to do }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 something}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 to get back at your dad, after he nearly got Ginny killed and practically shut down the school.\'94 Harry grinned more broadly. \'93He was definitely }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 as happy about losing Dobby as you are.\'94 
\par Malfoy guffawed. \'93I\rquote 
ll bet. He was always complaining that it was getting virtually impossible to find a house-elf auction, to get more domestic help. He suspected that some soft-hearted witches and wizards were freeing their elves and depleting the market. Hard to tell thou
gh--anyone who freed an elf would never admit it.\'94 
\par \'93Mr. Crouch did. He dismissed Winky in front of plenty of witnesses. Of course, I think that was the point. He didn\rquote t want to be associated with her if he could help it. As far as anyone there knew, she was the one who\rquote 
d fired the Dark Mark into the sky.\'94 
\par Malfoy shook his head. \'93Oh, sure. An }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 elf}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . That\rquote s really likely,\'94 he drawled, rolling his eyes. \'93
I hope to hell they get some half-decent people applying to be Aurors soon. Right now there are some real idiots on the job.\'94 
\par \'93Katie\rquote s going to be an Auror. Her training should be over soon, in fact.\'94 
\par He shrugged. \'93I reckon Katie will do all right. If she keeps her temper. She\rquote s probably one of the better ones.\'94 
\par They were silent for a minute, then Draco Malfoy looked up hopefully. \'93At any rate, you mentioned eclairs. Care to lead the way to the kitchens?\'94 
\par Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak, smiling. 
\par \'93Don\rquote t forget this,\'94 he said, draping it over Draco. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Draco,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought. It was good to call him that again. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 He knows now. He knows that he\rquote s capable of great things, that he didn
\rquote t just act out of self-interest, that he saved the world, really.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry looked at the place where Draco had been moments before. A disembodied voice floated toward him, making him f
eel nostalgic for his other life. He also felt like perhaps a new, better chapter of this life was beginning. 
\par \'93Lead on, Harry,\'94 Draco whispered; Harry could hear the smile in his voice. \'93Take me to your eclairs.\'94

 elves--Dobby avoiding Draco Malfoy the entire time--they went to the Quidditch pitch to practice catching the Snitch. They took turns releasing it, then each went to the goals at the opposite ends of the pitch before starting to look for it. Harry caught
 it three times to Draco\rquote s one time, but he noted that Draco was remarkably cheerful despite this. (Harry had pretended not to see the Snitch the one time Draco caught it; he\rquote 
d been starting to get worried.) When they returned to the castle, wind-blown and 
hungry yet again, they ran into Ron and Ginny as they were going into the Great Hall for dinner. The two Weasleys stopped short when they saw Harry and Draco entering the castle together, carrying their brooms, obviously having been out for some time, as 
they were quite ruddy-faced. 
\par Ron bristled. \'93What\rquote s going on with you two, then?\'94 
\par Harry halted, at a loss for words. He remembered Draco becoming a bit hostile when he\rquote d started trying to befriend Ron in his other life; now the tables were turned and Ron w
as looking like he was at risk to lose his best friend to one of the people he hated most in the world. 
\par \'93Erm,\'94 Draco Malfoy said, \'93just a little one-on-one Seeker practice. I asked him how he did a couple of the maneuvers I saw him execute in the Hufflepuff match last month.\'94 
\par Ron looked like Harry was an abject traitor. \'93And you }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 showed}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  him?\'94 Ron said, incredulous. \'93
I asked you to captain the team for me while I was away--not give away all of the Gryffindor secrets to the enemy.\'94 
\par It was Draco\rquote s turn to bristle now. \'93Just because I\rquote m a Slytherin--\'94 
\par \'93Oh, shut up, Malfoy. All the other houses are the enemy when it comes to the Quidditch Cup. I\rquote d say the same if Harry started coaching Justin in Seeking, or that little Ravenclaw boy who\rquote s taking over for Cho n
ow. What were you thinking, Harry?\'94 
\par Harry grimaced \'93I was getting in some practice myself. We should probably step up the team practices; soon it\rquote ll be pretty cold, and when the match against Ravenclaw comes in February it\rquote ll be a miracle if we can keep o
ur hands on our brooms without them falling off.\'94 
\par Ron continued to look at them suspiciously. Then Harry saw that Ginny was peering into the Great Hall nervously, looking like she did }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  want to enter. 
\par \'93What\rquote s wrong, Ginny?\'94 
\par She turned to him, biting her lip. \'93Oh, I, um--maybe I\rquote ll just skip dinner....\'94 
\par She whipped around abruptly and started climbing the marble steps. \'93What was that all about?\'94 Harry asked Ron, who rolled his eyes. 
\par \'93Oh, Hermione\rquote s ridiculous ploy to get my attention. She thinks I\rquote ll be jealous of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Neville}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  for some reason,\'94
 he explained, looking sideways at Draco Malfoy, clearly mocking him. 
\par \'93What do you mean?\'94 Harry asked, baffled. 
\par \'93It\rquote s not fair to Neville, either. She\rquote s leading him on. I mean, do you remember back when he asked her to the Yule Ball? Took some nuts to do that; he wasn\rquote t to know that Krum had beaten him to her. Well, he\rquote 
s always had a little thing for her, let\rquote s face it. Never a chance in hell that she\rquote d return it, of course. And now that she\rquote s evidently decided that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 won\rquote t cooperate in making me jealous,\'94 he said to Harry, \'93she\rquote s decided to rope poor Neville into this. And she\rquote s stolen him from Ginny while she\rquote s at it.\'94 He shook his head. \'93Don\rquote t know what she\rquote

m not about to change my mind for any reason, so she should just quit trying.\'94 
\par Draco Malfoy stared into the Great Hall, and Harry saw where he was looking; Hermione and Neville were sitting very close together at the Gryffindor table, and she was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 feeding}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 him. Harry thought he was going to spew. 
\par \'93Are you telling me that that prat just up and left Ginny?\'94 Draco said in disbelief. He turned toward the Gryffindor table, scowling. \'93He will not know what hit him--\'94
 he growled under his breath, pushing up the sleeves of his robe. Harry put out his hand to stop him. 
\par \'93Are you mad? You already lost twenty-five points for Slytherin because of your so-called duel in the corridor on Thursday. And so did Neville lose twenty-five for Gryffindor. Besides--I thought you didn\rquote t want them together.\'94 
\par \'93Yes, but }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 he\rquote s}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  supposed to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 want}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  them to be together. How can that little--\'94 Harry didn

 been panting after Granger for years? Even Weasley here can tell Granger doesn\rquote t really mean it. Does Longbottom actually believe she\rquote s going to let him shag her? Is he really that gullible? And even if he is--I still don\rquote 
t think that\rquote s an excuse to hurt Ginny. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 That}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  is completely unforgivable--\'94 
\par Ron looked tired; he walked to Draco Malfoy and put his hand out on the smaller boy\rquote s chest, holding him in place so he couldn\rquote 
t get around Ron to enter the Great Hall. Draco struggled against him. Ron seemed to expend absolutely no effort at all in preventing him from going anywhere. 
\par \'93As chivalrous as your attitude toward my sister is, Malfoy, I think you should stay out of this. I\rquote ll get some dinner and take some food up to Ginny, see if she wants to talk about it. After all, I reckon she\rquote 
s not having a very good time of it right now. First she finds out Mariah--who she thought was a friend-- is being far too friendly with }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , and now Hermione\rquote 
s stupid stunt means another so-called friend is basically stabbing her in the back. She\rquote d probably be more likely to want to see me, as I\rquote m one of the few people who hasn\rquote t betrayed her in recent memory...\'94 
\par Harry noticed that Ron\rquote s eyes slid sideways and met his; he flushed guiltily. Ron turned from them and entered the Great Hall. Harry started to follow him, but Draco pulled him back into the entrance hall. 
\par \'93So,\'94 he said, his arms crossed. \'93Is this why you were so anxious to recruit me as a friend? You knew this was coming, didn\rquote t you? And now Ginny\rquote s all alone, and needing comforting...\'94 
\par Harry shook his head. \'93I didn\rquote t know about this at all. I would have told Hermione she was mad if I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 had}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  known. And anyway, Ginny doesn\rquote 
t want comforting from me.\'94

\par \'93Because I\rquote ve given you my word,\'94 Harry said stiffly, his jaw set stubbornly. The two glared at each other for a minute, and suddenly Harry had a hard time remembering that they\rquote d actually been behaving like good friends earlier. \'93
You didn\rquote t react this badly to finding out about--about our spending the night together in the changing rooms. Why are you reacting this way now?\'94 
\par Draco shrugged. \'93That was in the past. And in this life, it didn\rquote t technically happen. Ginny doesn\rquote t know anything about it. She has no memory of being with you. It\rquote s not the same as you }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
actually}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  being with her in this life.\'94 
\par Harry crossed his arms. \'93So--what if I were wrong? What if--\'94 his voice caught with hope. \'93What if there }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 were}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 some chance of Ginny ever forgiving me. What if she did decide to make a go of it? What would you do? A friend--and your ex-girlfriend.\'94 
\par Draco Malfoy looked at him very levelly for a moment, then away. He swallowed, then looked at Harry again, unblinking. 
\par \'93I don\rquote t know.\'94 
\par \'93What do you mean, \lquote I don\rquote t know?\rquote \'94 
\par Malfoy scowled. \'93What I said. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I don\rquote t know.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  I\rquote m being perfectly honest, Potter,\'94 Harry winced; going back to last names wasn\rquote t a good sign; \'93I
\rquote m not claiming that I won\rquote t touch you or anything. In fact, I don\rquote t feel like I can be held responsible for my actions if that ever happens...\'94 
\par Harry looked up at the marble steps where Ginny had gone, then turned to enter the Great Hall with Draco Malfoy--who might or might not actually have been his friend. \'93Don\rquote t worry,\'94 he sighed. \'93I doubt it\rquote s anything we\rquote 
ll ever have to worry about. Besides, if we\rquote re friends--well, she\rquote s not exactly thrilled about you doing all that cheating on her. I doubt she\rquote d want to have anything to do with me if the two of us are friendly...\'94 
\par That made the Slytherin brighten up considerably. \'93Good point, good point. Well }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 old mate,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  shall we have some dinner?\'94
 he said grinning, before striding happily into the Great Hall and heading for his house table.

r. When it opened, Ron was revealed, crouched in the corner, his head in his hands. He was sweating and shaking as though he had a fever. Hermione choked on her cry and dashed across the room to him, holding his head in her hands. Harry turned to look gri
m
ly at Sirius, who nodded and closed the door again, shutting the three of them in for the night. Harry looked at the high barred window; from here, it already seemed to be dark out, but Harry knew that was just because the window faced the east. Ron looke
d very bad; despite the fact that he was attempting to go about clean-shaven now, he had what looked like a full beard and the backs of his hands were covered in dense red hair. The red light was in his eyes. Harry went to Hermione. 
\par \'93Come on. We don\rquote t have much time. We should transfigure ourselves. He\rquote s had all the potion he\rquote s supposed to; it should actually be a pretty peaceful night.\'94 
\par Harry knew that he would sleep well; he hadn\rquote t slept at all the night before, working on a Potions essay. He was much mo
re anxious about Potions than he used to be; somehow, he felt that if he earned a less-than-perfect mark from Snape, he was letting his stepfather down. He had labored the entire night through until he thought it was perfect--and he still worried about it
 right up to the moment he handed in his parchment--and right after, as well. 
\par Ron had spent the day before in the cell; Harry had taken him down and locked him in securely. Ron was giving him funny looks all the way down, and he reckoned that if he had to,
 he could transfigure himself into a golden griffin and hold Ron off that way. The idea of having to fend off passes from Ron was very strange, but Ron was able to control himself enough to make that unnecessary. And it was still about twenty-four hours b
efore the full moon; as the rise of the full moon drew nearer, the mania became worse. It wasn\rquote t as bad as it could get yet. Before he\rquote d left him, Harry had asked whether he was all right. Ron had looked at him as though he were mad. 
\par \'93Of course I\rquote m not all right! I\rquote m--I\rquote d shag bloody anything right now!\'94 Harry swallowed, sincerely hoping he didn\rquote 
t mean that. He looked down at his hands, sitting in the corner where he and Hermione would find him the next evening, just before moonrise. \'93And what\rquote s worse is--I know what it\rquote s like }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to feel this way at this time now. I mean, even though I hurt her so badly--Parvati }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 did}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 make me feel better. Afterward--I was so incredibly calm. It was weird. I thought maybe I\rquote d killed us both and we were in heaven. Pretty strange, huh?\'94 He sighed. \'93This will have to do. Make sure you lock the door good, Harry.\'94 
\par Harry nodded to his best friend and slammed the door shut, effectively protecting all of the residents of Hogwarts Castle from the advances of a very frustrated werewolf. 
\par Hermione put her hand on Ron\rquote s cheek and then stood and walked to Harry. They both changed into their animal forms in the blink of an eye. Ron smiled and shook his head. \'93Amazing, you two are. I can\rquote 
t believe--believe you still want to be with me after--after--\'94 
\par Harry loped over to Ron and pushed at his foot with his large moist nose, trying to tell him to shut up, of course they wanted to be with him. Even though Hermione was frustrated with him, she was appalled by the idea that they wouldn\rquote 
t keep Ron company now that he wasn\rquote t in St. Mungo\rquote s any more. 
\par \'93Of course we\rquote ll be there!\'94 she\rquote d said, shocked when Ron had suggested that neither of them might want to be down in the cell with him. 
\par It had been a strange week; Hermione had been going
 into a corner of the common room with Neville quite a lot. They occupied a single armchair turned to the corner, and all that could be heard from that vicinity when they were there were sighs and kissing noises. Ginny\rquote 
s face had been like a thundercloud for days, Harry had been mortally embarrassed and tried to leave the room every time it happened, and others simply pretended, rather red-faced, that it wasn\rquote t happening at all. He\rquote 
d heard Ruth say about her and Tony, rather archly, \'93You don\rquote t see }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 us}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  behaving like that...\'94 }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
If I actually think about it, my brain may self-destruct,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry decided. There was something so very not-right about it. 
\par And in spite of his stating right up-front that he was convinced Hermione was just doing it to get to him, Ron was showing progressive signs of being affected by their behavior anyway. Two days before the full moon Harry had a number of books spread out o
n a table near Neville and Hermione\rquote s favorite corner when they came into the room and headed right for their lair. Groaning, Harry started to gather up his many books, rather irritated that he had to lug them all into the library or his dorm. He
\rquote d just gotten everything set up to get his homework done.... 
\par Ron came down from the dorm and saw what Harry was doing; he walked over to him, frowning. \'93What\rquote s with you? When I went upstairs, you were just arranging all this stuff. Now you\rquote re packing up?\'94 
\par Harry motioned to the corner with his head. Ron\rquote s mouth was open slightly as he listened (and, Harry realized, he could probably hear a lot more than most people). Ron set his jaw stubbornly and glared at the back of the chair. \'93Oh. I see.\'94 

\par Harry tried to get his attention, and Ron finally looked like he was awake. \'93Help me carry this stuff?\'94
 Ron nodded and they had soon transported the lot of it back up to the dorm, where Harry spread it out on his trunk and sat on the floor nearby, scribbling notes on his parchm
ent and feeling vaguely like it was Hermione and Neville who should have to go elsewhere, not }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 Ron sat on his bed to keep him company; Harry was doing extensive research about Apparition for Sirius\rquote  class, as he was giving them a long written test and 
requiring them to write a paper before allowing them to register to take their tests with the Ministry. Since Ron wasn\rquote t taking Apparition, he didn\rquote t have to worry about this particular assignment. 
\par At one point Harry looked up to see Ron glaring at Neville\rquote s bed. 
\par \'93I thought you knew she was just trying to get you wound up, Ron. Thought it wasn\rquote t getting to you.\'94 
\par \'93It\rquote s not,\'94 Ron immediately responded. Harry could tell he was lying without being a werewolf and being able to sense a change in the blood vessels around the eyes. It was eating at him as it wouldn\rquote t have if she\rquote 
d been with Harry--maybe. If he and Hermione had actually taken Ron seriously and gotten back together, he might be every bit as bothered. Harry was reconsidering his original assessment 
that her idea to do this was mad. There seemed indeed to be method in it. 
\par Soon after he and Hermione changed into their Animagus forms, Ron started grunting, then groaning. Harry winced during Ron\rquote s change; he could }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 hear}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 his bones being wrenched and twisted out of shape, and when he saw Ron\rquote s familiar long nose elongate even further and become the wolf\rquote s snout, he swallowed nervously, always prepared for the Wolfsbane Potion to fail to work its magic. 

\par He needn\rquote t have worried; once transformed, Ron stretch
ed, then curled up and relaxed on the cell floor, still breathing shallowly from the pain and exertion of the change. Hermione lowered herself onto the floor next to him, putting her head on one of his paws. Harry hunkered down on his other side and reste
d his chin on his own front paws, already feeling his eyes start to close because of his lack of sleep....

rmione speaking softly. He was lying on his side, too exhausted to move. They were looking human again, about six feet away. But the truly amazing thing was that they were kissing; Ron had pulled Hermione on top of him and he was holding her head with his
 fingers laced in her short curls. When Hermione broke the kiss and moved her lips down to his throat, he moaned lightly and asked her, \'93What\rquote s this potion again?\'94 
\par \'93Aegisthos Potion. It creates a kind of shield, so I can\rquote t be injured. It only lasts a little while, but that\rquote s all it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 has}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to last, right?\'94 
\par He raised his eyebrows and looked at her. \'93Well, give me }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 some}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  credit, Hermione...\'94 
\par She laughed. \'93That\rquote s not what I meant....I\rquote ve been reading and reading, searching for something I can take for }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 months}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . It\rquote s
 not purely frivolous research. This potion is often used by Aurors when they know they\rquote re going into a possibly volatile situation, and it can be useful for the N.E.W.T.s, too. It\rquote s for battle, frankly.\'94 
\par \'93So--are you equating }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 this}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  with doing battle?\'94 
\par \'93It\rquote s certainly been a battle to convince you I\rquote m not going anywhere...\'94 
\par He groaned. \'93I can\rquote t believe I was bloody jealous of Neville, of all people! I knew from the start what you were doing...\'94 
\par She nodded and kissed his neck. \'93I knew you knew. I also knew that wouldn\rquote t necessarily negate its effectiveness. Worked, didn\rquote t it?\'94
 She grinned at him and suddenly he flipped her over. Harry winced, waiting for her head to come into contact with the hard stone floor, but it actually seemed to give a little under their combined weight. 
\par \'93Mmm...such a comfy floor...\'94 Ron leaned down to kiss her neck now, saying between kisses, \'93Are you glorying in being such a clever witch again?\'94 Harry understood now: she\rquote d put a Cushioning Charm on the floor. So, if she couldn\rquote 
t hurt herself on the floor, and Ron couldn\rquote t hurt her because of the shield potion.... 
\par He was appalled as they began kissing again; although they were fully clothed, they moved like they weren\rquote t, touching each other through their clothes and kissing with ab
andon. Harry decided he had pretended to be asleep long enough. He changed to his human form and sat up suddenly. 
\par \'93If you two care anything about me, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 please}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  stop now and wait for me to get out of here before doing anything else...\'94 They looked up with a s
tart, having evidently forgotten he was there. He saw this and grimaced. \'93What did you }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 think}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  I was, a lion-skin rug?\'94 
\par Ron chuckled, rolling off Hermione. He pulled her to him and enfolded her in his arms, where she gladly crept, a smile curling at the corners of her mouth. \'93Sorry, Harry,\'94 Ron said. \'93And--I\rquote m sorry I\rquote 
ve been such a prat about--well, everything.\'94 
\par Harry raised his eyebrows and nodded. \'93That about covers it. Everything.\'94 Then he grinned. \'93So--does this mean--\'94 
\par Hermione looked up adoringly at Ron, who\rquote d already shaved with his wand. \'93We\rquote ve been talking since dawn. I told him I\rquote d been doing my research, that I have a shield potion--\'94 she held up a small vial she\rquote 
d taken from her pocket; \'93--that can be taken internally. And I thought that softening everything around us with cushioning charms should take care of the rest of the problems. Plus there\rquote 
s the timing. Nothing during the week before the full moon, of course.\'94 
\par Harry felt himself flush. He\rquote d slept with Hermione, but talking about her plans to do the same with Ron didn\rquote t exactly make him feel comfortable. \'93Erm,\'94 he said awkwardly; \'93Sirius should be here any minute. I think I\rquote ll--I
\rquote ll tell him you\rquote ll be coming along shortly.\'94 He stopped; he could have bitten his tongue for his choice of words. Ron and Hermione were grinning cheekily at each other. He went on. \'93
Then you can--put an internal locking charm on the door if you like, so you can get out again...\'94 He felt himself getting progressively redder. 
\par Sure enough, a moment later, he heard Sirius start to open the door. Harry leapt to his feet and was squeezing out the opening as soon as it was large enough to admit him. Once in the corridor, Harry was appalled to see that Snape was also there. 
\par \'93Erm, good morning,\'94 he said to them both, his voice squeaking a little. Sirius frowned at his godson. 
\par \'93Harry, why on earth are you bright red?\'94 he wanted to know. Harry caught Snape\rquote s eye and thought he saw a merry twinkle there and an upward turn to one corner of his mouth. 
\par \'93I take it Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger are still in the cell?\'94 
\par \'93Um--yeah. They are. They\rquote ll come up for breakfast soon. They\rquote re just, erm, talking...\'94 He knew he didn\rquote t sound convincing. 
\par Sirius had caught on now, and Harry could see that he was trying very hard not to laugh as he was closing the cell door. \'93Oh, is that what they\rquote re calling it now?\'94 
\par As they walked toward the stairs to the entrance hall, Snape, walking in his characteristic pose with his hands behind his back, said, \'93So, I take it Miss Granger managed to make the Aegisthos Potion?\'94 
\par Harry stopped dead in his tracks. \'93You }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 know}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? And you helped?\'94 
\par \'93Miss Dougherty asked me for advice, actually. She\rquote s rather fond of Miss Granger and it goes without saying that she\rquote s fond of her brother,\'94 he said
 stiffly. Harry nodded; that made sense. Hermione and Maggie had become good friends. It was a little strange to him that he was walking with two teachers who }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 knew}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 what Ron and Hermione were most likely doing back in the cell where they\rquote d spent the night. But then, they were both of age, and Hermione was the Head Girl, and they both knew that she\rquote d taken certain precautions.... 
\par Harry had to stop thinking about it or go mad. He left Snape and Sirius and went up to the prefects\rquote  bathroom, even though he hadn\rquote 
t gone running, and reveled in the hot water, just standing, letting it strike him harshly as he stood under the showerhead. Draco and Tony came in when he was toweling off. 
\par \'93Oh, good morning, Harry,\'94 Tony said cheerfully. \'93Where were you? And Hermione?\'94 He didn\rquote t ask about Ron, knowing full well that there was a full moon the night before. But it wasn\rquote 
t common knowledge that Hermione and Harry stayed with Ron, as it wasn\rquote t known that they were Animagi. 
\par Harry looked at Draco, then away. \'93Sleeping in,\'94 he said, which wasn\rquote t completely untrue. Draco Malfoy stood looking at him suspiciously. When Tony went to the showers, Draco still hadn\rquote t undressed for his bath. He didn\rquote 
t take his gaze from Harry. 
\par \'93All right, Harry. Out with it. What\rquote s up? Perugia can\rquote t hear anything with the shower going. If we\rquote re going to be friends--\'94 
\par Harry tried to shrug nonchalantly. \'93It\rquote s nothing really. Well, that\rquote s not strictly true. It\rquote s not nothing to them....\'94 
\par Draco\rquote s eyebrows flew up. \'93Them? Them who?\'94 
\par Harry swallowed, trying to appear to be very concerned about drying between his toes. \'93Ron and Hermione.\'94 
\par \'93You mean--no. Weasel and Granger are--they\rquote re finally--\'94 
\par \'93Sssh! I shouldn\rquote t have said anything. It\rquote s none of your business...\'94 
\par Draco frowned. \'93Granger wants to wind up in the hospital wing that badly?\'94 
\par \'93No; she has a shield potion she\rquote s taken so she can\rquote t be hurt, and even if she tripped or something, she\rquote s put cushioning charms all over the place...\'94 
\par Draco whistled. \'93I have to admit. She can be clever...\'94 Harry remembered her putting the cushioning charm on the bathroom floor when they met there in the middle of the night... His face must have shown something; Draco Malfoy was frowning again. 
\'93What\rquote s really wrong, Harry?\'94 
\par He looked up. What }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  wrong? That was a good question. He\rquote d been trying to talk sense into Ron for months where Hermione was concerned... 
\par \'93She was your first, wasn\rquote t she?\'94 Draco said now, rather quietly. Harry nodded. 
\par \'93But that\rquote s not it. I reckon--this just changes things. They\rquote re really together now. I guess--I know how he felt now. When Hermione and I were able to be open about the two of us. In some ways it\rquote 
s been rather nice, the last few months, the three of us being friends again in the old way. I reckon I\rquote ll need to check all the time now to see whether they have plans together, that sort of thing.\'94
 He rubbed his feet dry with a vengeance, making the bright pink skin feel like it was burning from the friction. 
\par Draco had turned back to his bath preparations now, shaking his head. \'93I always knew that would be trouble. Two boys and a girl.\'94 
\par \'93It worked fine for our first four years. Well, except for the Yule Ball. And Viktor Krum. But that wasn\rquote t because we were two boys and a girl.\'94 
\par \'93True. That was because Weasley was a great ponce.\'94 
\par Draco slid into the water as Harry finished dressing. \'93See you in Charms,\'94 Harry said, leaving. 
\par \'93Harry,\'94 Draco said suddenly. 
\par \'93Yeah?\'94 
\par \'93If you--if they leave you in the lurch much--\'94 
\par Harry gave him a half smile. \'93Right. I do have another friend.\'94 
\par \'93Just remember that.\'94 
\par \'93After all, I don\rquote t hold any grudges against Neville...\'94 
\par Draco Malfoy made a wave of water splash at him, very nearly reaching the doorway. \'93You prat!\'94 he laughed. Harry also laughed while leaving. When he was standing in the corridor, his hand still on the knob, he shook his head in wonder. }{

\par Harry and Ron helped her open her parcel of Muggle newspapers, spreading them out on the table between them. 
\par \'93Here we go!\'94 Hermione said triumphantly. \'93Front page of the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Times.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 Harry could see, even reading upside down, that the oversized headline said "Malice 
at the Palace." She tapped it. "As in 'malice aforethought.' It's a bit overused, but for once it might be appropriate, instead of just referring to members of the royal family squabbling with each other." She skimmed down the column, frowning, then looke
d up at Ron and Harry. \'93It isn\rquote t good at all. He didn\rquote

re speculating that Roger, who was his clerk, found out something about his plans to kill the whip and the other man--oh, evidently the other bloke was in line to become the whip if anything happened to the first bloke--and the police think

\par \'93No, not right here in the paper. Right here--at Hogwarts.\'94 She nodded toward the doorway of the Great Hall, where Alicia Spinnet--or Alicia Davies, perhaps--was stand

\par \'93No, I know. Hermione got a load of papers from her parents. God! Are you all right? How\rquote s your mum?\'94 
\par She shook her head. \'93You--you know how you said I could come to you, Harry? If I needed help?\'94

\par \'93I\rquote ll do whatever I can, Alicia,\'94 he said, feeling that this would be a safe response. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Which won\rquote t be much,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

\par She nodded. \'93You mean Sirius Black? I keep forgetting that he\rquote s been cleared...\'94 she mused. Finally, she nodded. \'93That sounds good.\'94 She looked more collected now, more like the Head Girl from his fifth year. \'93I couldn\rquote

\par \'93That\rquote s not the problem. The reason I need your help, Harry, is--my father\rquote s been framed.\'94

\par Harry gave the password to the gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledore\rquote s office. He\rquote d decided that rather than just going to Sirius, it would be best to take the problem directly to the headmaster. After all, Alicia had been his H
ead Girl just two years earlier, and Roger had been Head Boy. As they went up the spiraling stairs, Harry glanced at her out of the corner of his eye; her usually-neat blonde hair was rather windblown from her having rushed to the castle from the village,
 and her vivid blue eyes looked bloodshot, as though she hadn\rquote t slept since her father was arrested. Perhaps she hadn\rquote 
t. Harry was starting to think he should have asked Hermione to come along, but after she and Ron had stumbled into the entrance hall to gr
eet Alicia, Hermione had suggested that she and Ron comb through the newspapers some more to find out as much as possible. He\rquote d asked her to send Sirius up to the headmaster\rquote

\par Harry knocked on the heavy oaken door and heard the familiar voice say, \'93Come.\'94 They entered to find Dumbledore sitting at his desk, the former headmasters and headmistresses dozing lightly in their frames. Fawkes was
 sitting on his perch near one of the windows, preening. The headmaster appeared to be looking over the patrol schedule, as revised by Hermione, and seemed surprised to see Harry enter with Alicia. 
\par \'93Harry! What can I do for you?\'94 He clapped his hands together and smiled. 
\par \'93Well, Professor, we have a bit of a problem...\'94 
\par Dumbledore half-stood and waved his hands at the chairs before his desk. \'93Sit, Harry, sit. And you too, my dear.\'94 As Harry and Alicia sat, he also seated himself again and put his hands to
gether in a steeple. Harry turned to look at Alicia, whom he was quite certain had also been crying on the way to the castle, although her eyes were dry now. 
\par \'93Thank you for seeing us, Professor,\'94 she said with a catch in her throat. \'93Before my wedding, in August, Harry said that if I ever needed any help...\'94 
\par \'93Of course, of course, my dear!\'94 he said enthusiastically, making Harry stare. \'93But, er, perhaps you should begin from the beginning. I must ask you, however, to excuse me momentarily,\'94 he said abruptly, jolting Harry. \'93
I shall return shortly.\'94 
\par He rose and opened the door to his private chambers, where Harry and Hermione had been listening to him talking to McGonagall in a weakened state. He certainly appeared to be in good health again. Harry had alm
ost commented upon this when he remembered that he and Hermione weren't supposed to know about--whatever he'd been doing that had McGonagall so concerned. Dumbledore closed the door to the other room behind him when he left, then reappeared very quickly, 
not bothering to close the door again before sitting at his desk and clapping his hands together once. \'93So! You were going to start from the beginning, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Alicia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par Harry wondered why he wasn\rquote t asking after her. Perhaps because she was so obviously in distress, he thought. To exchange pleasant, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 So how are you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94
 banalities wouldn\rquote t be very good form just now. 
\par Alicia swallowed before beginning. \'93It all began, really, in our seventh year. Well, it didn\rquote t begin for me. Not exactly. It began for Roger. He received a recruitment letter...\'94 
\par Harry gasped, but Dumbledore frowned. \'93Recruitment letter?\'94 
\par It was Harry\rquote s turn to frown now. \'93Like I did, remember? A Death Eater recruitment letter. I told you I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 thought}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Roger might have received one also. Sir,\'94
 he added, remembering to be deferential. Perhaps Dumbledore\rquote s memory was affected by whatever he had been doing that made him so weak, Harry thought. It seemed that McGonagall had been successful in convincing him to stop it, whatever it was. \'93
Well, Per--I mean, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 another person}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  received a letter about the same time,\'94 Harry said, very nearly saying Percy Weasley\rquote s name and stopping himself. \'93
But that person didn\rquote t have to turn up, because after Lucius Malfoy went to prison it was all a moot point, as he hadn\rquote t shared with Voldemort the names of the people he was attempting to recruit, apart from mine...\'94
 He noticed that, to her credit, Alicia didn\rquote t flinch at the name, although that might have been because she was Muggle-born and didn\rquote t grow up in the wizarding world. 
\par Alicia sighed. \'93Roger didn\rquote t know that. He said he\rquote d heard about a wizard and witch who\rquote 
d recently left school--Marcus Flint and Penelope Clearwater--and there were whispers that their deaths and the deaths of their family members had occurred because they had been recruited also and had refused. Roger was worried about his family\rquote 
s safety. So, even though Lucius Malfoy went to prison--\'94 She practically choked on the name; \'93--Roger didn\rquote t assume that his family would be safe. He wrote a letter...\'94 
\par Harry frowned. \'93Wrote a letter? But Malfoy was in prison--\'94 She raised her brows and looked at him with wide eyes. Harry\rquote s jaw dropped. \'93You\rquote re joking,\'94 he whispered. \'93He wrote to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Voldemort}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par She nodded grimly, her mouth in a pale line. \'93He was convinced that if he didn\rquote t, he and his entire family would be killed. He had no idea that he needn\rquote t worry, after the trial...\'94
 Alicia reached out her hand and Harry took it, squeezing, to show his support. She looked at him for a moment, then away, reddening. 
\par \'93So,\'94 Harry said, prompting her to continue. \'93What happened after he wrote the letter?\'94 
\par \'93He finished school, and after taking the train to King\rquote s Cross, he met up with a different Death Eater where he was originally supposed to meet Malfoy.\'94 
\par Harry\rquote s ears pricked up at this. \'93Who was it? Someone we don\rquote t know about?\'94 
\par She shook her head. \'93He didn\rquote t find out; the Death Eater was wearing a mask and hood. He said that because Roger had come as ordered, he and his family were safe, but he had to do something to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 prove}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  his loyalty, and he was given an \lquote assignment.\rquote \'94 
\par Harry nodded. \'93Right. That\rquote s standard. So--what was he supposed to do?\'94 
\par She reddened again. \'93He was supposed to get me to marry him.\'94 
\par Dumbledore leaned forward, looking perplexed. \'93Why, my dear?\'94 
\par \'93Well, evidently the Death Eater assumed that because Roger and I had been Head Boy and Head Girl together, we were pretty close.\'94 She allowed herself a small laugh for a moment. \'93Obviously, he\rquote d never seen us at a prefects\rquote 
 meeting...\'94 
\par Harry saw that Dumbledore\rquote s eyebrows had flown up now and wondered why. \'93Ah, yes. Head Boy and Head Girl. He would assume that. Right, right...\'94 
\par \'93Roger explained to him that he had a girlfriend already,\'94 Alicia went on. \'93And he didn\rquote t see why his assignment should be to marry }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , either. He asked }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 why}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he was supposed to do that, but the Death Eater wouldn\rquote t tell him. He just said that he\rquote 
d find out everything he needed to know as the information was needed. And that he should follow orders if he knew what was good for him.\'94 She put her hand up to her mouth, trembling. Speaking through her fingers, she said, \'93
He told Roger to use Imperius to make me go out with him and to do--other things--\'94 
\par Harry squeezed the hand he still held and covered it with his other hand. After having been placed under Imperius by Lucius Malfoy, to be placed under Imperius }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 again}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, and for a similar purpose, must have been a traumatic experience for her. 
\par Dumbledore nodded and gave a small wave to her. \'93Continue when you are ready, my dear,\'94 he said softly. 
\par She nodded, her mouth clamped tightly closed, as though she was struggling to regain her composure. \'93So,\'94 she finally said, \'93Roger did as he was told. He turned up at my parents\rquote  house, surprising me, and said he\rquote 
d been sorry he was such a prat during our seventh year and hoped I would forgive him and let him take me to dinner. I remember at the time that I wanted to tell him off, but instead I heard myself accepting the invitation. 
\par \'93During the rest of the summer, we went out frequently, although it was only in late August that there was finally any--physical contact between us--\'94 she said, looking a little uncomfortable talking about this. Harry patted her hand. 
\par \'93Do you want me to fetch Hermione, so you can talk to her? Would you rather not--\'94 
\par She shook her head. \'93I--I just meant kissing. He finally kissed me after a date. What I should have realized at the time was that it was rather odd that it had taken him so long to do that.\'94
 She paused and took out a handkerchief, holding it tightly, but not using it. \'93
At any rate, when I started teaching at the village school in Hogsmeade, the September after I finished school here, he would sometimes show up after lessons were over, and then take me to a pub, or we\rquote d go to my house or something. I was teachi
ng him to ride, and sometimes we would go riding in the late afternoon.\'94 She smiled a little. \'93That was nice. He\rquote d never ridden before. He wasn\rquote 
t very patient with the horses at first, but eventually he became better about that. I told him that his impatience made them nervous, and he wouldn\rquote t have as good a ride that way.\'94 She sighed. \'93Then, one day when he\rquote 
d come to the school to meet me, Fleur Delacour happened to be coming out of her classroom late and spotted him. She seemed to be very surprised, but that didn\rquote t prevent her from making off with him. I was shocked; I didn\rquote 
t know what to say or do. She just walked off with him, arm in arm, as though he was still }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 her}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  boyfriend. He acted as though I didn\rquote 
t exist and went along with her. I had just assumed that he was pursuing me because he and Fleur had broken up.\'94 
\par She looked down at her hands. \'93Of course, I didn\rquote t realize yet that I was under Imperius. I was quite furious with Roger, and when I went home that day I rode for a couple of hours, hoping I woul
d calm down. When I returned to the stable, Roger was there, looking very contrite. He explained that he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 had}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  broken up with Fleur--that he\rquote d }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 told}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  her that it was over, but that she wasn\rquote t very mentally stable and hadn\rquote t listened. And he\rquote d also heard about 
the way that veelas take rejection--which isn\rquote t very well, to put it lightly. He said that he managed to avoid her, usually, but whenever she spotted him, he had little choice but to go along. If he didn\rquote t, he wasn\rquote 
t sure how she might react. 
\par \'93I believed him completely. We had to pretend, when we were around Fleur, that we weren\rquote t a couple. God, I was such an idiot...\'94 
\par Harry grimaced on her behalf. \'93You were under a spell, Alicia. It wasn\rquote t your fault. And considering the way she reacted to you and Roger 
getting married, he was probably wise to keep her in the dark. It's possible that if he'd told her why he was pursuing you, she wouldn't have been very cooperative.\'94 
\par She looked gratefully at him. \'93Well, in the spring we\rquote d been seeing each other for a while and still, er, just kissing a bit, now and then. Roger had been told, evidently, that he was taking too long and was ordered to--to sleep with me.\'94
 She didn\rquote t look at Dumbledore. \'93So he suggested that I find a place in the village, which I did, since I did whatever I was told, and on the day when you came to read to my class, Harry,\'94 she told him, \'93
Roger arrived after the children were gone for the day, and we went to my flat...\'94 
\par She swallowed and Harry patted her hand again. \'93It\rquote s okay. You don\rquote t have to give details--\'94 He shook his head. Putting someone under Imperius and then sleeping with them was tantamount to rape, as far as he was concerned. }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Poor Alicia!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought. 
\par \'93You don\rquote t understand, Harry. That--that was the day I found out about what had been going on,\'94 she said, her voice no longer shaking. \'93He couldn\rquote 
t do it, you see. Even Roger had his limits, a limit to what he would do to protect his family. We were even--we were pretty far along--\'94 she said softly. \'93But he suddenly threw my clothes at me and started dressing himself, saying over and over, 
\lquote I can\rquote t do this, I just can\rquote t do this...\rquote \'94 
\par Harry breathed a sigh of relief. So Roger }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 hadn\rquote t}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  violated Alicia... 
\par \'93And then--?\'94 Dumbledore prompted gently. 
\par \'93Well, I demanded to know what was going on.
 He told me everything that had happened for the previous year. The recruitment letter, his being told to convince me to marry him. The Death Eater saying he was taking too long, ordering him to sleep with me. Roger said he had only gone along to protect 
his family. He was afraid they would be killed if he refused. He also said that he\rquote d never stopped seeing Fleur. And now Fleur was pregnant with his child, and he didn\rquote t know what to do because he wanted to marry her, but he\rquote 
d been ordered to marry }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . Fleur didn\rquote t know anything about his being recruited or his sneaking around with me. 
\par \'93I saw a side of Roger I\rquote d never seen before--he\rquote d sacrificed his own happiness for others\rquote  safety, and he\rquote d pulled back from the opportunity to--\'94 She swallowed and looked down. \'93
He could have taken advantage of me, and he didn\rquote 
t. He said that apart from the fact that he was in love with Fleur, he respected me too much to do that to me. I was floored. He had already taken the curse off me and I felt so queer without its influ
ence, it was almost like I was--directionless. Having my own will again felt strange after so long...\'94 
\par Dumbledore nodded. \'93People who have been under Imperius for a long time sometimes experience something like a withdrawal afterward...\'94 he said grimly. 
\par \'93Yes. That\rquote s how I felt. Like my inner compass was gone, the thing that had been guiding me. Roger apologized profusely, but I felt that he was losing sight of something. He\rquote d been given an order, and now how was he to carry it out?\'94 

\par Harry frowned. Considering that she }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 had}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  married Roger... But then the answer dawned on him. \'93You said you\rquote d help him, didn\rquote t you? That you\rquote 
d go along and pretend to be in love with him and marry him, so that his family would be safe.\'94 
\par She nodded. \'93I felt--I felt like it was the least I could do. Who was I to say I didn\rquote t want to be in a sham marriage when it might be the difference between life and death for his parents and brother--and maybe him? After he\rquote d--he
\rquote d been rather noble about not taking advantage--\'94 She colored, and Harry was starting to wonder whether Alicia }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 had}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  fallen for Roger, because of this \lquote nobility.
\rquote  How awkward, he thought, if she decided she fancied him after that, knowing that he still loved Fleur, who was to be the mother of his child. Knowing that he wouldn\rquote t touch her, even though they were going to be married. 
\par \'93But the question still remained,\'94 Dumbledore said quietly, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 why}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 was he told to marry you in the first place? The Death Eater told him to do that, then told him to step it up when he was taking too long. Why?\'94 
\par \'93I have my suspicions. And I think Roger knew, but he didn\rquote t tell me. After we started planning the wedding, he insisted that that was all he was told to do: marry me.\'94 
\par Harry sat up straight. \'93Your dad. He was supposed to marry you to get close to your dad, and so that his working to get your dad elected would be a logical thing. He was his son-in-law, after all--\'94 It made perfect sense now...almost. 
\par Alicia nodded. \'93I think so now, too, ever since my dad was framed. I think the idea was to have someone who was a Death Eater be close to a member of Parliament. My dad.\'94 
\par Harry frowned now. \'93But--why did you tell me a wizard framed your dad? Why would someone want Roger to help get your dad elected and then go on working for him--as Roger did--only to frame him for murder, so he\rquote 
d no longer be in Parliament? If the idea was to have influence over someone in government, it wasn\rquote t a very good plan, was it? Your dad was just a junior MP, after all, newly elected.\'94 
\par Alicia sighed. \'93I don\rquote t understand this either. And I can\rquote t ask Roger what\rquote s going on because he\rquote s gone now, too. I\rquote m convinced that someone impersonated my father and killed the whip and tried to kill Clive Metford--
\'94 
\par \'93Who?\'94 
\par \'93The MP who was wounded. He\rquote s going to testify against my dad. At any rate, I think that Roger wasn\rquote 
t doing what he was told to do, so the Death Eater decided to scrap the operation, and did it by framing my dad, to get him out of the way so that that woman, what\rquote s her name--\'94 
\par \'93Who?\'94 Harry said again. 
\par \'93Joan. No, Jane. Jane Hampton-something. So she could be the new MP from Mole Valley. And I think he killed Roger, too, but I\rquote m hoping I\rquote m wrong and Roger is simply on the run. I\rquote 
m rather afraid for his parents; they need to be warned that their lives may be in danger. I\rquote d have done it, but what would I say? Especially after Evan dying....\'94 She dabbed at her eyes with the handkerchief. \'93
Poor Evan! He overheard Roger speaking to the Death Eater once, evidently, when Roger didn\rquote t know his brother was at home, or forgot. It was during the Christmas holiday, and I think Roger may have simply forgotten that Evan wasn\rquote 
t at school. Evan took it into his head that Roger was a Death Eater--which he was, technically--and he decided he was going to
 emulate his big brother. Roger only found out because Evan left a note for Roger amongst his things, explaining this, before going off to the forest with the Dueling Club. He knew it would be dangerous and thought he should write to Roger before leaving,
 to let him know they were on the same side, and how he\rquote d found out about Roger being a Death Eater.\'94 
\par Now Harry was understanding why Evan had come after him in the forest, and why no one else knew about his ambition to be a Death Eater, including any other Death Eaters. He also understood Roger\rquote s reaction--he really blamed himself. He\rquote 
d gone along with the orders he\rquote d received so that his family would be safe; because of that his brother had died. 
\par \'93And now your dad is in prison, awaiting trial,\'94 he said softly. 
\par \'93Yes. He can be positively identified by Metford, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 and}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  his fingerprints are on the gun used to shoot him and the whip. He\rquote 
s also on the security cameras at Whitehall. There\rquote s no jury in the world that wouldn\rquote t convict him with the kind of case the Crown can make. The only problem is--}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 he didn\rquote t do it}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . And we have to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 prove}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  that, somehow.\'94 
\par Harry swallowed. How on earth was anyone going to prove that Mr. Spinnet was innocent when the evidence was stacked against him? \'93Does he have an alibi? Where was he when the murder was taking place? Are there any witnesses?\'94 
\par \'93He says he was in his office, taking a nap on the sofa. Roger saw him. Dad told him he was knackered and needed a lie-down; he felt very tired suddenly--\'94 
\par \'93A potion,\'94 Harry said immediately. \'93I\rquote ll just bet he was drugged. To get him out of the way.\'94 
\par She nodded. \'93Could be. Unfortunately, since he told the police that it was Roger who saw him lie down, that also makes him the last person who saw Roger.\'94 
\par Harry stood and went to the window, looking out at the grounds, deep in thought. \'93You don\rquote t think--could it be that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Roger}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 was the one who framed your dad? That that was the plan all along? And that\rquote s why he\rquote s disappeared now, as he would have been your dad\rquote s only alibi, and now he appears to be another victim? Besides, if Roger }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 had}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  been told to do that and refused, wouldn\rquote t his parents have turned up dead? Do we }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 know}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 how the Davieses are? If they\rquote re alive and healthy, I\rquote d say the suspicion rather falls on Roger, and the tricky job is to convince Scotland Yard, without bringing up magic.\'94 
\par Alicia shook her head vigorously. \'93I refuse to believe that. Roger couldn\rquote t even }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 sleep}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 with me while I was under Imperius, and his family was threatened then, too. I just can\rquote t see him killing someone...\'94 
\par Harry returned to his chair. \'93
What if someone else was threatened this time, though? What if it was Fleur--and his child? Think about it--the timing of the conception. That Death Eater who was his contact must have noticed, after all of the news about what Fleur 
did at your wedding, that the child she was carrying would have been conceived }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 after}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Roger was supposed to have started seeing you. That would tip him off that Roger hadn
\rquote t broken things off with Fleur. He didn\rquote t just have Roger\rquote s Mum and Dad to threaten now, who were the only family members Roger had left after Evan died. There was also Fleur and the baby.\'94
 Harry remembered how Roger had cradled her in his arms, after Draco had cursed her. \'93He wasn\rquote t going to let anything happen to Fleur and his child. I think he framed your dad. It doesn\rquote t make sense for it to be anyone else...\'94 
\par Alicia\rquote s jaw was set stubbornly. \'93No, Harry. I know it has to be }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 someone else,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 she insisted. Harry was more convinced than ever that she had fallen for Roger. \'93
And my dad is going to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 prison}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  if we don\rquote t find some way to prove his innocence...\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 And}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 Harry added, deciding to bypass the Roger issue for the moment, \'93we still don\rquote 
t know the real purpose of the whip being killed, the other man almost being killed, and your dad going to prison to make way for that woman to take his MP position.\'94 
\par A sudden knock at the door made him lose his train of thought. Dumbledore said, \'93Come in,\'94 and when the door opened, Sirius entered, looking rather urgent. He nodded to Harry and Dumbledore. 
\par \'93Hello, Harry, Albus. Hermione and Ron have filled me in on what they found in the Muggle newspapers...\'94 He turned to Alicia then, smiling sympathetically and holding out his hand. \'93And you must be Alicia Spinnet.\'94 
\par \'93Davies,\'94 she said suddenly, surprising Harry. \'93Alicia Davies.\'94 She didn\rquote t rise and take his hand, and he withdrew it. 
\par Dumbledore stood. \'93If you will excuse me for a moment, I will arrange for the house elves to prepare accommodations for }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Mrs. Davies}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 he said pointedly, \'93
in the staff wing. Harry, fill in Sirius for me, will you? And then you can escort Alicia to her rooms.\'94 
\par Dumbledore slipped into the next room again. Harry turned to Sirius and explained quickly what was going on. Alicia didn\rquote t interrupt him or correct him, but sat staring at her hands. When Dumbledore returned he nodded at the three of them. \'93
Go on, then. The house elves are ready for you, my dear. I hope you will be quite comfortable. You\rquote ll be right next door to Sirius. Oh, and I need you to return after that, Sirius.\'94 
\par Sirius hesitated. \'93I can just stay, and Harry can take Alicia to her rooms.\'94 
\par \'93But I don\rquote t know where your rooms are, Sirius. I need you to show me the way,\'94 Harry told him. \'93I\rquote ve only been to Maggie\rquote s and my aunt\rquote s rooms.\'94 Sirius nodded and they left. As he wa
s following them out the door, Harry saw Dumbledore slip into his private chambers again. 
\par They showed Alicia the way to the staff wing; evidently there hadn\rquote t been a reason for her to go there when she was Head Girl. She was surprised that Harry knew the password, but he said that he\rquote 
d learned it when he had helped his aunt to move in. Alicia was surprised by that as well. Sirius put his hand on his arm when he mentioned his Aunt Petunia. 
\par \'93I need to speak to you about that, Harry. In a bit.\'94 
\par Harry frowned, confused. They walked down the winding corridors and finally reached Sirius\rquote 
 rooms; they continued on to the door after that, which was slightly ajar. As soon as they walked in, Harry was aware of a small figure in black zipping out of the sitting room, and then he heard the familiar }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 crack!
}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  of a house elf leaving. Evidently, one of the elves who had been working on Alicia\rquote s rooms hadn\rquote t left until the last moment. 
\par Alicia looked around listlessly at the small, neat room, with its settee and chairs around
 the hearth and the leaded casement windows overlooking the courtyard shared by all of the staff, where Draco Malfoy had given Dunkirk exercise and where Harry and his sister had played, in his other life. A tray sat on a low table before the fire, with a
 steaming pot of tea and some plates of scones and biscuits. 
\par \'93Make yourself comfortable,\'94 Sirius told her. \'93I need to return to the headmaster\rquote s study, but I will be back to check on you later.\'94 
\par \'93I can stay with you for a bit, if you like,\'94 Harry volunteered, but Sirius shook his head. \'93Erm--you can also come back later, Harry. I need to talk to you about a couple of things. If you\rquote ll excuse us, Alicia?\'94 
\par She nodded from the settee, where she was regarding the tea and food listlessly. Harry was worried about her; perhaps she should talk to Hermione, he thought. 
\par In the corridor, Sirius talked to Harry as they walked back to the tapestry leading out of the staff wing. \'93Harry--about your aunt--\'94 
\par \'93Oh, right! You said you wanted to--\'94 
\par \'93She\rquote s with Jeffries.\'94 
\par Harry stood still. \'93What? Why?\'94 
\par Sirius grimaced. \'93She seems to think that he has a more progressive view of magic than we do here at Hogwarts. And he\rquote s the one who made her magical, after all. Plus, she didn\rquote t feel that your uncle would welcome her back.\'94 
\par Harry shook his head. \'93Uncle Vernon just wrote me a letter about how upset he is with me because it\rquote s my fault that she left him. I think he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 does}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  want her back. He
\rquote s all on his own now. What\rquote s she doing with Jeffries?\'94 
\par \'93She\rquote s part of his entourage now. She\rquote s on staff. He has a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 huge}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  staff. There\rquote 
s fan mail to answer and interviews with the press to coordinate and every time they pull up and move to another venue, there are rooms to be booked and transportation to be arranged.\'94 He gave a small smile. \'93
From what I could see, she was in her element, actually. Ordering people around. Move this here and there. Giving reservation clerks a piece of her mind on the telephone....\'94 
\par \'93She used to be my uncle\rquote s secretary. That\rquote s how they met.\'94 
\par Sirius nodded. \'93Well, now she\rquote s practically Jeffries\rquote  right hand. I don\rquote t think he\rquote d sneeze without asking her advice first.\'94 
\par Harry shook his head. \'93I wondered why she didn\rquote t answer my letters. I sent her some owls and I thought they were going to Little Whinging. Then I wrote to my uncle, and he said he didn\rquote 
t know where she is. I never could have imagined this when I was younger...\'94 
\par \'93That isn\rquote t all I have to tell you. After months of pumping Rita Skeeter for information, all we\rquote 
ve received from her are the names of Death Eaters who are already in Ministry custody. Nothing really useful. She still seems to be protecting someone...\'94 
\par Harry nodded. \'93The real Daisy Furuncle, I\rquote m guessing.\'94 
\par Sirius shrugged. \'93Maybe. We\rquote re still repairing the damage she did.\'94 
\par Harry sighed. \'93I wish we\rquote d never trusted her.\'94 He thought of Snape being held prisoner, and having his fingers cut off. He shuddered. 
\par Sirius grimaced. \'93Albus blames himself for that. He wanted to believe that she could be useful and work for the good. But evidently, she decided when Hermione was holding her in that jar that she would never work for the same side as her.\'94 
\par \'93Everything she did was to get back at Hermione? Is she really that petty?\'94 
\par \'93Evidently so. Or at least that\rquote s what she\rquote s told us. Every time she opens her mouth it feels like she's playing with us. We're hoping she'll slip up and give us some truly useful information without meaning to.\'94 
\par When they left the staff wing, Sirius turned to the right and Harry to the left, so he could return to Ron and Hermione and fill them in. Somehow, he thought they would both have quite a lot to say about Alicia and Roger. And Rita Skeeter. 
\par He was right. 
\par The three of them sat on the floor in the seventh-year boys\rquote  dorm in Gryffindor Tower while Harry told them everything Alicia had said, and his own ideas about it. 
\par \'93I agree with you,\'94 Ron said adamantly; he\rquote d been playing with the dials on his Omnioculars while he listened to Harry and he continued to do this as he spoke. \'93Davies framed Alicia\rquote s dad and that\rquote s why he\rquote 
s disappeared. He did just what he was supposed to, or else we\rquote d be hearing about his parents being killed, wouldn\rquote t we?\'94 
\par \'93We still don\rquote t know that they\rquote re safe,\'94 Hermione reminded them. \'93And that\rquote s only one possibility. There\rquote 
s still the possibility that his contact in the Death Eaters did it and offed Roger. Alicia really seems to believe he\rquote s incapable of murder, according to Harry. She }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 did}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 agree to help him by
 marrying him, and she had to work closely with him to get her dad elected. The Death Eater may have realized that by leaving Roger's parents untouched, it would look like he was the guilty party. To people who knew what he was told to do, that is.\'94 

\par Harry drew his lips into a line. \'93Somehow, though, I had the impression that there were some things that Alicia wasn\rquote t saying. Like how she feels about Roger. What she\rquote 
d do to protect him, if she could. And what they did--if anything--involving magic to helped her dad win the election. The Ministry would probably consider that illegal, I\rquote m guessing.\'94 
\par Hermione\rquote s mouth twisted and she looked pensive. \'93I hadn\rquote t thought of that. You know, magic might not have been necessary for him to win. Now, if he\rquote d tried to run as a Conservative in Northamptonshire and he\rquote 
d won, that would be pretty suspicious, in such a predominantly Labour area, but it\rquote s no shock for a Conservative to win in Mole Valley--or anywhere in Surrey, for that matter--\'94 
\par \'93--except in Guildford. I know, I know. You told me already.\'94 Harry shook his head. \'93
Politics. I always avoided thinking about it when I was younger because nothing could get Uncle Vernon hacked off faster than seeing some political confrontation on the news. Even Aunt Petunia couldn\rquote t
 stand it when he started screaming at the telly. All liberals were \lquote stupid bloody farts.\rquote 
 He drove us all barking mad. Dudley probably had it worst, in a way. He had to sit there and parrot every political opinion Uncle Vernon spouted, when he\rquote d much rath
er be blowing things up on his computer. But he wanted his son to be a little version of him--okay, not so little--so that meant Dudley had to have all of the same political opinions, too. I actually pitied him at those times--a bit. I could tell he thoug
h
t it was a ruddy bore. On the other hand, I managed to sneak into his room and use his computer when that was going on downstairs. I always thought I wanted that computer so much, but then after he was gone, I never wanted to touch it really. I only used 
it to try to find Maggie,\'94 he said softly. 
\par Then that made him remember what Sirius had said about his aunt. After he told them, Hermione, to his surprise, merely nodded sagely. \'93I thought that\rquote s where she\rquote d go. Frankly, I was surprised that she went back t
o Surrey. And now it turns out she didn\rquote t. I don\rquote t know why you\rquote re so shocked, Harry. I also had an idea that she was fairly miserable here...\'94 
\par Harry squinted at her. \'93How\rquote d you know that?\'94 
\par \'93Well, remember that time McGonagall asked me to cover her class
 for half-an-hour? Your aunt was in it, along with the Slytherin first years. God, it was awful. Every little supposed slight someone sent in her direction was rewarded with horrible hexes from her. I don\rquote 
t know how many house points I took away from Slytherin before McGonagall returned...\'94 
\par Ron snapped his fingers with a disappointed air. \'93Too bad she left. It would be pretty simple for Gryffindor to win the House Cup this year with your aunt in Slytherin, Harry.\'94 He grinned. Hermione looked like she was trying very hard }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to smile. 
\par \'93Be fair, Ron. It was very difficult for her, to be in her forties, becoming a witch and then going off to school with eleven-year-olds. How would you like it?\'94 
\par Ron shrugged. \'93It probably didn\rquote t help that she was a generally disagreeable person. Maggie\rquote s doing all right, and she\rquote s older than all of the students in the classes she\rquote s taking. And even though she\rquote 
s younger than any of the other teachers, none of the third and fourth years in her Divination classes give her any trouble.\'94 
\par Harry nodded. \'93But that\rquote s probably because they respect her. When it comes to Divination, she really knows what she\rquote s doing. She\rquote s not like Trelawney. Maggie\rquote s the genuine article.\'94 
\par Almost as though she knew he was speaking about a Seer, Sandy suddenly hissed at him, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 She shall See.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93Who, Sandy? See what?\'94 It was one of the more cryptic things she had ever said to him. 
\par She didn\rquote t answer him. \'93What\rquote s going on, Harry?\'94 Hermione asked excitedly; whenever she heard Sandy talking to him, she was always very keen to know what it was about. He shrugged. 
\par \'93Sandy said, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 She shall see}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 he told them. 
\par \'93Oh,\'94 Hermione said. \'93Well, maybe what she meant was this--\'94 And with a swift movement, Hermione snatched Ron\rquote s Omnioculars from him and put them to her eyes. \'93You know, I still haven\rquote 
t seen that Quidditch match from the summer, the one you keep saying I should watch on these things--\'94 
\par Harry stared at Ron, his heart in this throat. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Bloody hell.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  The images of Draco and Mariah down by the lake were still on there, as far as he knew. }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Gosh, Sandy,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought sarcastically. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Thanks for the warning.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Ron swallowed and reached out for the Omnioculars. \'93Um, Hermione, you don\rquote t really want to see that game. I know how bored you are by Quidditch. Just hand me the--\'94 
\par But it was too late. Hermione was staring into the eyepieces with her mouth open in surprise. She had gone very stiff as she continued to watch what was before her, and Harry braced himself. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Oh no oh no oh no. Not again. Now they\rquote re going to have a huge row...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par \'93Ron! Harry!\'94 she said in wonder. \'93Have you seen what\rquote s }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 on}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  here?\'94 
\par They looked at each other guiltily. \'93Look, Hermione, it\rquote s all my fault,\'94 Harry said, his voice shaking. \'93Don\rquote t blame Ron. It was my idea to try to find a way to--\'94 
\par She lowered the Omnioculars from her face and frowned at him. \'93What on earth are you talking about?\'94 
\par Ron and Harry looked at each other and back at her. \'93Erm,\'94 Harry said. \'93What are }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  talking about?\'94 
\par \'93Here. Let me rewind it first,\'94 she mumbled, fiddling with the dials again. Harry wondered how he and Ron were going to get out of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 this}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 one. Hermione checked the position of the Omnioculars and then handed them back to Ron. \'93Now flick the \lquote forward\rquote  switch,\'94 she instructed him. He looke
d at Harry uncertainly, and Harry wondered whether Ron was going to do something like say, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Hermione}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ! I have }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 no idea}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  how that was recorded by my Omnioculars...\'94 
\par Instead, after viewing for a few minutes, Ron\rquote s jaw also dropped. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Bloody hell}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 he breathed, his eyes glued to the eyepieces. \'93So it\rquote s }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 her}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ! I should have known...\'94 
\par Harry frowned. \'93Would one of you care to enlighten me?\'94 he whinged, feeling a bit left out suddenly. 
\par \'93Rewind it and show Harry,\'94 Hermione said to Ron. Ron did, and handed the Omniocul
ars to him. He frowned when he first looked in the eyepieces; the image was frozen, and it appeared to be solid green. He had no idea what he was looking at. Ron reached over and flicked the \lquote forward\rquote 
 switch, and the image started moving. He also heard, very softly, the voices of the people nearby. Evidently, Ron had accidentally had his Omnioculars set on \lquote record\rquote 
 when they were waiting in line to go into the Quidditch game. The green he was seeing was the grass of the pitch, and soon after the image started moving, Harry saw Ron\rquote 
s rather large feet move into view; Harry remembered that Ron had been swinging the Omnioculars around impatiently while he was waiting. As the images jumped around unpredictably, showing his feet and lower robes, Ron\rquote s feet and ro
bes, and then Ginny\rquote s, Harry heard again the conversation they were having while waiting for the Aurors to screen all of the spectators... 
\par He heard a soft thud which was him kicking a piece of turf, followed by his muttering, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Why are they even bothering to hold Quidditch matches if they're so worried about security?}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93Stop it when Ginny mentions getting to the bottom of the Diagon Alley attack,\'94 Ron instructed him loudly. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Blimey, Harry,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 he heard Ron again; this time his voice was faint and faraway, co
ming from the tiny speakers on the Omnioculars, projecting the sound directly at his ears, but so quietly people around him couldn\rquote t hear it. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Do you know how people would panic if the League Cup was canceled? I mean, the attack on Diagon Alley was bad, but they never even canceled the League Cup during You-Know-Who\rquote 
s first reign of terror. Everyone would think it was the end of the world if they did }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 
\par "}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 You}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  mean they wouldn't have a good way to pacify everyone,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 Ginny countered; all Harry could see of
 her was her hand waving impatiently in the air. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 This way, they can simultaneously occupy people with mindless sport--}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Bread and circuses}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 he heard himself mutter. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 --and make it look like the Ministry's really }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 doing}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  something, just because they're checking over everyone who\rquote 
s entering the stadium. I'm sure they\rquote re really going to get to the bottom of the Diagon Alley attack by doing }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that.\'94 
\par Harry flicked the \lquote stop\rquote  switch abruptly and stared at the image before him. In the upper left-hand corner of the picture was part of a woman\rquote 
s face. Ron must really have been swinging the Omnioculars around wildly; Harry was used to his nervous habits and hadn\rquote t though twice about it at the time, but now, because of his having bee
n recording and swinging the Omnioculars around, Ron accidentally documented the presence of someone else standing nearby.... 
\par He lowered the instrument from his face and stared at his best friends. \'93Is that who I think it is?\'94 
\par Hermione nodded. \'93Which means }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 she\rquote s}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  got to be one of the Daisy Furuncles! It had to be someone who was near enough to hear what you were saying, since Ginny\rquote 
s words ended up in that article Daisy Furuncle wrote. Except she was attributing it to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , Harry, not Ginny. So why should \lquote Daisy Furuncle\rquote  protect Ginny?\'94
 Harry furrowed his brow. It was a good question. Hermione, however, evidently didn\rquote t think he wouldn\rquote t know the answer to this. \'93Harry!\'94 she cried, exasperated. \'93She did it because Ginny was still Draco\rquote s girlfriend at the t
ime! Don\rquote t you see? She was protecting Ginny because of Draco...\'94 
\par Harry looked at the image again; the nose, the hair. He flicked \lquote forward\rquote  again and a hood was swiftly pulled over the head and the woman turned away, while Ron\rquote s indignant voice was heard in the background: 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Ginny! Don't say things like that here, all right?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par He heard his own voice then, although all he could see now were Ron\rquote s shoes again. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I agree with Ron, Ginny. You can\rquote t be too careful what you say in public. Rant back at Hog\rquote 
s End, all right?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par He stopped it again and lowered the instrument once more. The three of them looked at each other; Harry saw that Ron and Hermione were frowning at him. He bristled at them. 
\par \'93What? What are you looking at }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  that way for?\'94 
\par \'93Because,\'94 Hermione said, sounding just a little put-out. \'93That\rquote s the mother of your new best friend.\'94 
\par Harry drew his mouth into a line. \'93He\rquote s not my best friend. You two are. And he can\rquote t control his mum. She disowned him, remember?\'94 
\par Ron looked skeptical. \'93Whenever she\rquote s mentioned her son, which wasn\rquote 
t often, it was never too bad. She may be having second thoughts about cutting him off. Maybe she thought they could make up if she wrote nasty articles about all of the people he didn\rquote t like--you, me--\'94 
\par \'93Sirius,\'94 Harry said suddenly. \'93She wrote some awful things about Sirius. And she tried to make out that Katie was an idiot for going with me. She also mentioned Sam going to prison...\'94 
\par \'93Or--\'94 Hermione said slowly, looking thoughtful. \'93Perhaps you and Sirius and Sam, among others, were targeted because she thought there was a danger of his }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 hating you anymore. You and Malfoy were working with Sam and Katie during the summer, and Malfoy went to Ascog--Sirius\rquote  home--for part of his holiday.... She needs to bring him back to her side if there\rquote 
s to be any kind of Malfoy family reunion. So she has to drag }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 your}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  names through the mud. She may have hoped that if she did this it would mean he wouldn\rquote 
t be feeling too kindly toward all of you....\'94 
\par \'93You think?\'94 Harry frowned. He lifted the Omnioculars to his face again and rewound the images slightly, so he could catch that glimpse again of Narcissa Malfoy\rquote s face. After watching it again, he lowered them and sighed. 
\par \'93Unfortunately, now that Alicia\rquote s dad has been framed, Sirius and the other operatives will be a bit busy with that. When a man\rquote s life is on the line, I can\rquote t very well ask Sirius to go looking into Malfoy\rquote 
s mum, just because she wrote some nasty things.\'94 He frowned, feeling vaguely discontented. Hermione agreed. Ron, however, looked like he felt very restless about this. 
\par \'93Oh, come on, Harry. Can\rquote t we at least send her a howler?\'94 he pleaded. Harry laughed; the idea was tempting. Hermione looked a bit wistful for a moment, and sighed. 
\par \'93What\rquote s with you, then?\'94 Ron asked her, putting his hand on the back of her neck and rubbing affectionately. She looked like she was coming out of a lovely reverie. 
\par \'93Oh, nothing. I was just thinking of sending }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Rita Skeeter}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  a howler, actually. One which would burst open and send bubotuber pus flying all over her...\'94 
\par The three of them burst out laughing then at this agreeable mental image, and while they were laughing, Harry saw Ron surreptitiously throw the Omnioculars under his bed, before Hermione took it into her h
ead to look at anything else he had saved on them.

s case. He knew a good lawyer for Mr. Spinnet, a witch who had studied law and was a barrister. Harry, R
on and Hermione visited Alicia every day in her rooms. Ron, oddly enough, was especially helpful in keeping her spirits up, telling her a number of things his doctor had told him when he\rquote d been in St. Mungo\rquote s. Harry was impressed. 
\par On the last day of the t
erm, Harry, Hermione and the other Gryffindors went to the village with Sirius to take the Floo network to London. They were going to the Department of Magical Transportation to take their Apparition tests. To avoid taking a large number of students in on
e go, the Slytherins, Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs had already gone. Harry didn\rquote t care for the idea of Crabbe and Goyle Apparating--but then he learned that they\rquote d both failed, and would have to try again. He\rquote 
d felt pressure to do well before, but now he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 really}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  felt pressure. The last thing he wanted to do was be like Crabbe and Goyle... 
\par They went alphabetically. Since Lavender had stopped attending Apparition lessons, Seamus went first, standing with his wand poised before him, visibly shaking. One moment he was there, the next--he had vanished with a }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 pop!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  The problem was--his clothes remained. \'93Bloody hell!\'94 Sirius exclaimed when he saw the pile of clothes on the ground, including Seamus\rquote 
 drawers. He smiled feebly at the Ministry official who stood nearby; Harry thought he remembered his name being Basil, from the World Cup. \'93Excuse me; be right back,\'94
 he said quietly, clearly embarrassed that Seamus had bollixed the test. He took the clothes and with a wave of his wand Disapparated with a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 pop!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par They all star
ted snickering when Sirius was gone, unable to resist. Harry imagined poor Seamus standing with nothing on in the cold December wind at Broome Park, the wizarding estate in Kent where they were supposed to be going (it was where Ron went for practice when
 he was playing on the English team). But then they sobered, catching Basil\rquote s eye; there was no guarantee any of them would fare any better. Harry thought very, very hard about his destination. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 It\rquote 
s in Barham parish, halfway between Canterbury and Dover...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
He pictured Kent on a map of England, thought about what it would be like to fly there on a broom, or better still, as a golden griffin. The landscape and villages, the tiny houses and churches and schools would pass too quickly to be really seen.... 

\par Sirius }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 popped!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  back into their midst, no longer carrying the clothes. \'93
Wait a minute before taking your try, Hermione. Seamus needs a few minutes to get dressed. He arrived at the right place, just a little south of the house, actually...\'94 
\par Basil held a clipboard with a piece of parchment on it; he made some rather angry-sounding scratches on the parchment with his quill. \'93He\rquote ll have to be taking the test again,\'94 Basil proclaimed. \'93We can\rquote 
t allow people to jump around the country naked...\'94 
\par Harry saw that a smile was pulling at the corners of his mouth, and Sirius\rquote , too. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 They\rquote d laugh, too, if they thought it would be all right,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 Harry thought. When they reckoned that enough time had passed to allow Seamus to dress, Hermione took out her wand, a look of fierce concentration on her face, as she closed her eyes and waved her wand... Harry wasn\rquote 
t prepared for the abrupt way she simply disappeared. He felt like his heart was going a mile a minute, as he hoped desperately that she had made it. Sirius, however, did not look like he was concerned about this. 
\par \'93All right then, I\rquote ll check on Hermione and be right back,\'94 he said, once again Disapparating. Little by little, their numbers were diminishing. Neville would be next, then Parvati, and Harry would be last, since Ron couldn\rquote 
t Apparate. Dean would have been taking his test, but he didn\rquote t feel he was as far along as the others and wanted to continue learning what he could after the New Year, in order to take his test at Easter. 
\par Sirius returned and reported that Hermione had been successful. Harry breathed a sigh of relief. Then he felt nervous all over again, on Neville\rquote 
s behalf, watching him vanish. Sirius went to check on him, as well. When he returned this time, he was grinning broadly. \'93That\rquote s two out of three! Not too bad...\'94 Harry smiled at him. His students doing well reflected well on }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
. Harry was also glad to hear that Neville had done all right; he had been more worried about him than Seamus, before coming to the Ministry. Parvati looked nervous, but waved her
 wand and disappeared, like the others. Sirius returned from checking on her and said she\rquote d been successful. Now it was Harry\rquote s turn. 
\par Taking a deep breath, he waved his wand and thought again about the geography, the landscape, feeling a tingling all over that was like and yet unlike the Animagus Transfiguration. He\rquote d done this before, when he\rquote 
d Apparated to the opposite side of the Hogsmeade village hall, or from one end of the High Street to the other. They\rquote d done plenty of practice Apparition during the
ir lessons, in the past few weeks, but it had always been within Hogsmeade, to places they\rquote d }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 been}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  before, places they\rquote 
d seen and could picture quite easily. He decided that Apparition felt similar to separating his mind from his body, when he did the pain blocking, but he knew that he was actually traveling along a unique sort of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
fluid}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  dimension in which he was made only of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 thought}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
. As his thoughts turned to his body and clothes and the destination, he felt the tingling again, more strongly, as he appeared with a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 pop!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 on the estate in Kent, with Hermione, Seamus, Neville and Parvati standing about twenty feet away. He grinned, looking up at the enormous orange brick house with its jagged roofline and multiple chimneys. As soon as he arrived, the others burst
 into applause. He turned to them, grinning even more broadly, unable to believe how excited he was. 
\par Thirty seconds later, Sirius arrived nearby; he turned and grinned at Harry. Clapping his hands for all of them now, he said, \'93Well done! Oh, very well done, everyone! And Seamus--I think Basil may let you take the test over while you\rquote 
re on your holiday, so you won\rquote t have to wait until Easter. All right?\'94 
\par Seamus nodded. \'93That\rquote s grand,\'94 he said, his voice full of relief. 
\par \'93Very well, then!\'94 Sirius said. \'93You should be very proud of yourselves. But remember--the test is really only half over. We have to get all of you }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 back}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  now.\'94 

\par They looked at each other in alarm. They had to Apparate to the Department of Magical Transportation? Underneath Regis House, in the disused King William Street tube station that had been a bomb shelter during the Second World War? 
\par \'93All right, then! We\rquote ll start from the end of the alphabet this time. You\rquote re up, Harry!\'94 
\par He swallowed, no longer wondering why they\rquote d been told very ca
refully about the location of the tube station, and about the large building it was under, which had been rebuilt the year before. (That had caused a number of nightmares concerning keeping the Muggles from excavating into the Ministry offices, according 
to Sirius.) He repeated the process of mentally flying over the landscape, picturing the room where Basil would be waiting for them... 
\par The flowing, liquid feeling of being }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 thought}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .... the tingling sensation.... With a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 pop!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 Harry reappeared before Basil, wh
o, with a bored expression, made a quick mark on his parchment with his quill, then suggested that Harry move out of the way, to make it less likely that someone else would splinch themselves or land on top of him. He hurried across the room to where Basi
l
 stood, and watched as Parvati, Neville and Hermione reappeared one at a time. As each additional person arrived, they clapped in congratulations, and Basil made his marks on the parchment. The four of them stood on the far side of the room with Basil, wa
iting for what seemed rather a long time. 
\par Finally, Seamus reappeared. 
\par His clothes did not. 
\par \'93Bugger!\'94 he exclaimed. He used his hands to cover himself. \'93Hermione! Parvati! Bloody hell, turn around, can\rquote t you?\'94 
\par They did, both trying to stifle their laughter; Harry\rquote s cheeks hurt from stifling his, and Neville caught his eye; he was grinning ear to ear. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 He}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  had passed, and hadn
\rquote t lost his clothes in the process. Sirius arrived, again carrying Seamus\rquote  clothes, looking resigned. They waited with their backs turned while Seamus dressed, swearing under his breath.

The next morning, when most of the students who were going home for the holiday were packing, preparing to ride in the horseless carriages to the Hogsmeade train station, Harry let himself int
o the staff wing to find out whether Alicia was ready to leave for Hog\rquote s End. Harry had daily visited with Alicia in her rooms, usually with Ron, Hermione and Sirius. 
\par Harry, Ron, Ginny, Hermione and Neville were going down to Hog\rquote s End for the holiday and
 Alicia was invited, too. Sirius, Snape and Maggie were to come for Christmas dinner on Thursday, and then Harry and Sirius were going to Ascog for most of the rest of the holiday, except for the European Cup final the day after Boxing Day (where they wer
e meeting the residents of Hog\rquote 
s End as well as the other Weasleys, plus Snape and Maggie), and the broomstick race in Sweden on the last day of the year, to which Draco Malfoy was also invited. Harry had actually invited him to come to Ascog after Christma
s, but to his surprise, Draco had declined, only accepting the invitation to the race. 
\par Alicia wasn\rquote t in the sitting room when he let himself in, so he knocked gently at the bedroom door, calling, \'93Alicia! Are you ready? The carriages will be leaving soon...\'94
 When he received no answer, he debated whether to open the door to check on her. She was rather despondent when she first arrived at the castle, and there was little good news Sirius had been able to give her since then. He carefully turned the knob an
d found that she was still in bed, sleeping peacefully. But she wasn\rquote t alone. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Sirius!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94
 Harry hissed at him. He lifted his shaggy black head and wagged his tail at Harry, giving him what seemed to be an appeasing smile, although it was hard to tell when Sirius was in his dog form. Alicia, under the covers, had one arm thrown over Sirius
\rquote  body possessively. He lay on top of the blankets. She still slept peacefully, a small smile on her face. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 What do you think you\rquote re doing?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94
 Harry demanded of his godfather. 
\par Sirius looked at Alicia, then Harry, shaking his head. He turned back to Alicia and nudged her gently with his nose. Her eyes opened slowly; she gave the dog an affectionate smile and stroked his soft fur dreamily, down the length of his back and onto hi
s flanks. Harry swallowed, remembering Ginny touching him that way when he was in his griffin form. Then she looked up and noticed Harry standing in the doorway. 
\par \'93Oh, Harry! What time is it? I\rquote m sorry I overslept. I did pack last night, so I only need to dress.\'94 She noticed him looking with disbelief at the large black dog. \'93Oh, isn\rquote t he lovely? He\rquote s Sirius\rquote 
 dog, but he said I could keep him with me at night. Wasn\rquote t that nice of him? I have to admit, I never expected Sirius Black to be--how he is. I\rquote m not sure I can explain it. After the way we were all so panicked, when I was in fifth year...
\'94 
\par \'93Erm,\'94 Harry said awkwardly. \'93Right.\'94 He didn\rquote t know what to say. Alicia thought the dog was--a dog. Belonging to Sirius. She didn\rquote t realize it was Sirius himself. \'93So--has he been spending every night with you?\'94
 Harry tried to keep his voice from going up in pitch. 
\par She leaned down and hugged the dog tightly, burying her face in his fur. \'93Yes. Snuffles has been very comforting, haven\rquote t you Snuffles? Funny, Sirius Bl
ack having a dog with a name like that. Seems like the sort of thing an old lady would name her dog...\'94 
\par Harry tried not to laugh at her assessment. \'93Well, Snuffles and I will go into the next room and let you dress...\'94 
\par \'93Oh, don\rquote t worry about the dog. He can stay. I\rquote ll be ready in a minute.\'94 
\par Harry hesitated for a moment, then shrugged and closed the door, wondering whether Alicia had been dressing every day with \'93Snuffles\'94 in the same room. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Lucky dog}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 he thought for a moment, before squashing that thought. 
\par He had to admit, though, Alicia seemed more cheerful than she had when she first arrived. When she opened the door she was levitating a suitcase before her. The large black dog followed. Harry gave Sirius a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 look}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , but Sirius gave what seemed to be a very pointed yawn and turned away. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Oh, no you don\rquote t,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry thought. }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 We need to talk...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par When they arrived at Hog\rquote s End, Fred greeted them in the drive, the front door of the house open behind him. \'93Happy Christmas, everyone!\'94 he crowed, his messy red hair stand
ing up all over his head. He helped his little sister and Hermione and Alicia down from the carriage, giving Alicia an extra hug when he had her on the ground. 
\par \'93Alicia! How ripping to see you! I\rquote m, er, sorry about your dad...\'94 
\par Alicia ducked her head for a moment, then lifted a smiling face to Fred. \'93
Thanks for letting me come for the holiday. My mum is staying in the flat in London that she and dad took after he was elected; she goes to see him every day. I just--I just couldn\rquote t bear the idea of being down there, seeing him like that...I
\rquote m glad to be back with old friends...\'94 She smiled affectionately at Fred, who hugged her again. 
\par \'93And Katie\rquote s here, too!\'94 he said. \'93She\rquote s done with her training. It\rquote ll be just like old times, except for no Oliver. We invited him, but he\rquote s spending the holiday with his family. You\rquote 
ve got to come to the match with us, on Saturday. We can all see Oliver then--he said he\rquote s going with his older brother, Alex. Bill knew him at school. Say you\rquote ll come?\'94 Fred smiled winningly and it was clear that Alicia couldn\rquote 
t resist. She laughed, the first time Harry had seen her do so since she had returned to Hogwarts. He\rquote d had a feeling the twins would be good for her. 
\par \'93Of course I\rquote ll come. I haven\rquote t seen a good Quidditch match in ages.\'94 
\par Once they were inside, Ron, Ginny and Hermione opened their wickerwork cat carriers and loosed Crookshanks, MacKenzie and Argent upon the house. The cats stretched and started sniffing the various unfamiliar corners, rubbing against furniture and establis
hing who had which choice spot before the fire. Ginny and Hermione went up to the room that used to be Harry\rquote s, in his other life; Harry and Ron went to the room that used to be Jamie\rquote 
s. Katie and Alicia would share the room where Ron had been the previous 
summer. Neville was sharing with Percy. There was a flurry of welcoming in the front hall; George was hugging his sister and Hermione and Alicia and pounding Ron and Harry on the back. Lee was being gregarious as ever, making them all laugh with a very hi
gh-pitched impersonation of an old witch in Nottinghamshire who wasn\rquote t sure whether she wanted to sell their wares in her sweetshop. Percy waved his arms, directing traffic and ordering the twins to carry their guests\rquote 
 luggage to their rooms. 
\par Harry smiled, standing in the hall, looking about at the Christmas decorations. He felt like he\rquote 
d come home; this was where he should be, for the holiday. A hand appeared on his shoulder and he turned, surprised to see that it was Katie. She was smiling at him. \'93Happy Christmas, Harry,\'94
 she said quietly, then hugged him. Harry held her for a moment, closing his eyes, glad that she was safe, but worried about what she would be facing, now that she was an Auror. He pulled back from her and smiled down at her. 
\par \'93Happy Christmas, Katie,\'94 he replied, seeing that she was looking at him fondly, instead of with a faint air of resentment, as at the wedding. \'93How\rquote s your dad?\'94 
\par \'93He\rquote s fine. He\rquote s coming to Christmas dinner, and then I\rquote ll be staying with him for Boxing Day. We\rquote ll see all of you at the match on Saturday. He said you were brilliant against England! Of course, you had to go and win...
\'94 She smiled mischievously. 
\par Harry laughed. \'93Oh, well, I have to admit--I felt a little like a traitor myself. Welsh by birth, but English by upbringing, you know.\'94 
\par \'93And now, technically, a resident of Scotland. Well, I\rquote m just sorry you won\rquote t be playing on Saturday. It sounds like France will be very hard to beat.\'94 
\par Harry nodded. \'93They\rquote re very rough. Fantastic Seeker. But I\rquote ve also heard that Romania has an amazing team. What I\rquote ve been reading in the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Prophet}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 says it should be an even better match than the World Cup game between Ireland and Bulgaria.\'94 
\par Alicia whirled around. \'93Where\rquote s Angelina? Where\rquote s my other old teammate?\'94 Harry realized that Angelina wasn\rquote t in the hall. George colored and looked oddly sheepish. 
\par \'93She\rquote s having a lie-down,\'94 Katie told her, blushing for some reason. \'93She hasn\rquote t been feeling very well lately. Don\rquote t worry--you can go up and see her in a bit, Alicia.\'94 
\par Harry followed Ron up to their room. After they were finished unpacking, Ron went to the door and said with a forced casualness, \'93I\rquote ll check on Hermione and Ginny...\'94 
\par Harry grinned at him. \'93You mean you\rquote re going to kick Ginny out of the room for a while so you and Hermione can be alone...\'94 
\par Ron looked enormously offended by this. \'93Harry! What do you take me for?\'94 
\par Harry grinned at him. \'93You have to ask? I wasn\rquote t criticizing...Just go already. Hermione\rquote s probably expecting you, right?\'94 
\par He turned bright red. \'93Er, yeah. She is.\'94 
\par Ron left while Harry shook his head, opening and closing drawers. He was rather surprised, however, when a minute later, the door to the room opened and Ginny entered. He stared at her, wondering why, if Ron and Hermione had kicked her out of he
r room, she had chosen to come here, of all places. 
\par \'93Ginny! What are you doing here?\'94 he asked; then he wanted to bite his tongue. It sounded like he was about to kick her out too, when that was the last thing he wanted to do. On the other hand, he wasn\rquote t all that keen to be told off again... 

\par She gave him a small smile. \'93I--I wanted to talk to you. I need to tell you something--a lot of things.\'94 She sat on the end of the bed and patted the space next to her. Harry sat, confused. She was being friendlier than he\rquote 
d seen her since she\rquote d told him off (and Draco and Mariah) for carrying on with Mariah in the tunnels under the castle grounds. 
\par Being so close to her again was almost unbearable. He knew he wasn\rquote t completely over her, but he\rquote d managed to not think about her }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 too}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 much. Apart from ogling her when they went running. And when she sat by the fire in the common room, reading. And when she dueled during Dueling Club meetings, her hair like a fiery halo round her determined face... }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Erg.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  He\rquote d tried to occupy himself with other concerns, like Alicia, so he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 couldn\rquote t}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 think about her, but it wasn\rquote t dreadfully successful. Spending time with Draco hadn\rquote t helped, either. Somehow, they wound up talking about Ginny quite a lot. 
\par She took his hand in hers and he swallowed, looked down at her, aware of how close together they were sitting, and that they were sitting on a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 bed.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par \'93First--I want to apologize, Harry, for the way I had to speak to you when I broke up with Draco.\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Had}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to speak to me?\'94 Harry choked out. \'93You told me you loved me, we were even using your sister\rquote s powers to communicate, and then--\'94 
\par She leaned her head on his shoulder. \'93I know, Harry. But I--I had to put on a good show in front of Draco. I\rquote m still not completely sure whether he believed it, but now that it seems the two of you might actually be }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 friends}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 --\'94 
\par He pulled away from her and lifted her head by putting his hand under her chin. \'93A }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 good show}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? Is that what it was?\'94 
\par He felt her tremble. \'93Please don\rquote t be angry, Harry. I did it to protect you. Well, it wasn\rquote t just me--it\rquote s a long story....\'94 Tears began to escape her eyes and roll down her cheeks. 
\par \'93You mean,\'94 Harry said, incredulous, \'93you didn\rquote t mean it? You--you just didn\rquote t want Draco to hurt me?\'94 
\par She smiled. \'93You\rquote re calling him Draco now! How funny--\'94 
\par He rose and walked toward the window. He realized that he was shaking with rage. He whirled on her. \'93Do you know what you put me through, Ginny? Why couldn\rquote t you have let me in on the plan? Why did you have to hurt me that way?\'94 
\par She looked at him in shock. \'93I just said! But--but now that you\rquote re friends with Draco--\'94 
\par He strode toward her. \'93I am friends with him because I know what he can be. What he can do, if he wants to. I know that he drew a short straw in this life and that he doesn\rquote t have to
 be a complete prat. Yes, I thought about the Obedience Charm a bit, but that\rquote s not the only reason I\rquote m his friend now. Do you know I showed him my Penseive?\'94 
\par Her jaw dropped. \'93So--he knows--\'94 
\par \'93That you were my girlfriend. Yes.\'94 
\par \'93And--and how did he take that?\'94 
\par Harry crossed his arms. \'93Not too badly, actually. He reckons that it technically never happened, so getting upset about it is pointless....\'94 
\par She smiled and walked to him, throwing her arms around his neck. \'93This is wonderful! Maybe he\rquote ll be able to handle the idea of our being together in }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 this}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  life! Maybe--
\'94 
\par He cut her off, pulling her to him roughly, unable to be so close to her anymore without kissing her. He held her face up and covered her mouth with his, opening his m
outh and drinking her in, feeling her surprise turn to passion as she tightened her hold on him and kissed him back. But then, something at the back of his mind bothered him, and he pulled back from her, taking her arms from around his neck and walking to
 the window again. 
\par \'93What\rquote s wrong, Harry?\'94 she whispered. 
\par He stared at the drive before the house. \'93I don\rquote t know, Ginny. I still love you. I do. I can\rquote t help it. And I want you so badly it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 hurts}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  sometimes. But I
\rquote m very }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 angry}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  with you, too. And I don\rquote t know how long it will take me to get past that. I think--I\rquote m just not ready to stop being angry.\'94
 He turned and looked at her shocked face. He was more than a little surprised himself at what he was saying. \'93I\rquote m not ready to forgive you.\'94 
\par Now she wasn\rquote t so much shocked as equally angry. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 You\rquote re}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  not ready to forgive }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
? What about when I saw you with Mariah? Do you know how I felt?\'94 
\par \'93She\rquote s a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 selkie}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , Ginny! I didn\rquote t exactly have a choice!\'94 
\par \'93I know!\'94 she cried. \'93But do you think it was any easier to remember seeing the two of you, even knowing that? I still }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 saw}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  you together. }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 And}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  I had the pleasure of finding you in bed with Katie. To say nothing of when you were with Hermione...\'94 
\par He strode toward her, feeling angrier and angrier. \'93I was trying to convince mysel
f I had to get over you. I was with other people because you told me repeatedly that you were with Draco and that was that. And what about when I had to see you and Draco in the amulet, taking each other\rquote 
s clothes off in the greenhouse? At a time when you say you loved me? He\rquote s not a bloody selkie, or a veela, or anything. What\rquote s }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 your}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  excuse?\'94 
\par She trembled and he could see the fire in her eyes. \'93I was his girlfriend at the time, largely because I was protecting }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , not that you seem to care--\'94 
\par They were standing toe-to-toe, shouting in each other\rquote s faces. \'93I would rather have had the choice of dealing with Draco Malfoy myself and having you by my side!\'94 he yelled. 
\par \'93I would rather have been in the greenhouse with you any day!\'94 she screamed back at him. 
\par They were standing very close, red-faced with anger, chests heaving with emotion. Harry swallowed and pulled her to him again, whispering, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Bloody hell,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94
 before covering her mouth with his once more, kissing her hungrily, feeling her kissing him b
ack, her hands sliding up under his jumper, then pulling his shirt from his trousers and sliding her hands under the fabric, her touch on his bare skin inflaming him further, making him press her to him so that her breasts were crushed against his chest, 
her heart beating against his. 
\par Every nerve in his body was standing at attention, and he could feel her trembling from head to foot. He wasn\rquote t sure how long they were kissing when he pulled his mouth away from hers and moved his lips along her jaw, then do
wn her neck. She removed her hands from his back and pulled his jumper off over his head; after allowing her to do that, he clamped his mouth on her neck again as her fingers flew to his shirt\rquote 
s buttons. A feeling of desperation seemed to flow through them, telling them }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 now, now}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . Before something else happened to drive them apart... 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 The warriors of light shall come.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Harry lifted his mouth from her neck. He looked down at her passion-clouded face; her cheeks were quite pink, her lips swollen from kissing. \'93Sandy says that someone\rquote s coming, Ginny,\'94 he told her softly, his heart pounding in his ears. \'93I
\rquote m not sure who. This--this probably isn\rquote t the time or place for--for--\'94 He swallowed and tried to steady his breathing, every swear word he knew rocketing t
hrough his head. What he really wanted to do was rip her clothes off and pick her up, take her to the bed, but instead he backed away slightly and sat in a chair next to the desk, slowly buttoning his shirt, trying to calm down but still feeling like he
\rquote d run about ten miles... 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 How did we go from screaming at each other to kissing?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 he wondered, staring at her. But when he saw her standing before him, still looking angry and passionate both, her hand on her sternum as her ribcage rose and fell, he didn\rquote t wo
nder this for long. It was possible that they could have an even more volatile relationship than Ron and Hermione. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Relationship?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 Were they going to have a relationship? As he gazed at her, it was very difficult to not leap forward and take her in his arms again. He didn\rquote t remember ever feeling quite this way in his other life, when he was with her. 
\par But suddenly, the door to the room opened and to Harry\rquote s surprise, Katie and Percy were standing there. Katie looked particularly surprised to see Ginny and Harry in the room. 
\par \'93Oh! I, erm, thought--we thought we heard someone having a row. Well, anyway, we\rquote ve had all of this wonderful snow, and we were going to go out and enjoy it. Coming?\'94 Katie raised one eyebrow as she spoke, looking back and forth between Ha
rry and Ginny. 
\par He swallowed and forced a smile. \'93Er, yeah. That sounds great. I\rquote ll tell Ron and Hermione,\'94 he said quickly, hoping that Katie and Percy hadn\rquote t already tried walking into the other bedroom. 
\par He had a feeling that something like that had already occurred, however, when Katie\rquote s smile turned rather mischievous and she said, \'93Oh, they }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 know}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 already. We shouted through the door. We weren\rquote t expecting to find it locked...\'94 
\par Harry felt himself reddening. He was glad now that he and Ginny hadn\rquote t done anything else--he hadn\rquote 
t considered the possibility that someone would walk in on them. And while Percy might look amused at the idea of his younger brother sleeping with his girlfriend, Harry wasn\rquote t certain how he\rquote d react to his little }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 sister}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  being in a similar situation... 
\par \'93I\rquote ll get my cloak,\'94 Ginny said quickly, practically running from the room. 
\par Katie raised her eyebrows, giving Harry a knowing smile. Percy, on the other hand, looked at him suspiciously. \'93Erm, going out in the snow sounds like fun. I\rquote ll be right there,\'94
 he said, nodding at them. Finally, they left, closing the door. Harry put his jumper on again, then did some deep breathing to try to collect himself. 
\par \'93Thanks for the warning, Sandy,\'94 he said to her feelingly. \'93I\rquote m not sure what they would have seen if I didn\rquote t know they were coming.\'94 
\par \'93I have no control over what I See,\'94 Sandy reminded him. \'93I do know that I am glad that the shouting stopped. When you are angry, it makes me very nervous. For one thing, your arm becomes far too warm.\'94 
\par \'93Sorry, Sandy. Do you want to stay indoors while I go out? You probably don\rquote t want to be where it\rquote s snowy.\'94 
\par \'93That would be my preference, Harry Potter.\'94 She slithered out of his sleeve and he picked her up, carrying her from the room. He was very glad that he\rquote d found her again in the park in Little Whinging. 
\par He left Sandy curled up in a basket near the large old cooker in the kitchen and went to get his cloak; while he was fastening it, something suddenly occurred to him. He strode back into the front hal
l, remembering something Katie had said months ago about her trip to Hog\rquote s End... 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I actually had quite a nice time this weekend. I spent most of it with--with the other Auror applicant...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Percy and Katie were bundling up in their cloaks and gloves, wrapping their old Gryffindor mufflers around their throats, and Harry stood before them, tapping his foot with his arms folded and one eyebrow raised. They stopped abruptly and stared at him. 

\par \'93Are you all right, Harry?\'94 Katie asked him, a slight shake in her voice. 
\par \'93Oh, I\rquote m fine. Tell me, what would you say is a good definition for \lquote Auror?\rquote  Would \lquote warrior of light\rquote  be a fairly accurate one?\'94 
\par Percy frowned at him. \'93Yes, but why are you--\'94 
\par Harry stepped toward Percy and pushed his finger at Percy\rquote s chest. \'93You, Percy Weasley, are an }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Auror}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , aren\rquote t you?\'94 
\par Percy dropped his jaw. \'93Did the twins tell you?\'94 he said, his voice dropping to a whisper. 
\par Harry hid his surprise that the twins knew. \'93No. Katie did. Months ago. She told me that she\rquote d been to the screening tests with someone else who lived in Hogsmeade, and then just a few minutes ago, my snake Sandy told me }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 The warriors of light shall come.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  She used the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 plural.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Sandy doesn\rquote 
t make mistakes about things like that.\'94 
\par Percy dropped his jaw. \'93Well. I suppose I know why you have that pet snake now.\'94 
\par Harry nodded. \'93I don't tell just anyone about this, mind you, but as you're Aurors, it's the sort of thing you should probably know. She has the Sight. All snakes do. Why do you think Voldemort has one?\'94 
\par Percy shook his head. \'93I didn\rquote t know before, but I do now.\'94 He put his arm around Harry\rquote s neck, walking to the kitchen with him. \'93Perhaps if I\rquote m going to do this, I should talk a bit with the resident expert on the Dark Lord?
\'94 he grinned. Harry was relieved to see that Percy had loosened up. Perhaps that was the Auror training. 
\par \'93After Christmas,\'94 Harry said. \'93First we have a serious snowball battle to wage,\'94 he said, grinning and opening the back door. He ushered Katie and Percy into the garden, forgetting briefly that this was Percy\rquote 
s house and not the Snape-Evans-Potter house. 
\par After a minute, Ron, Hermione and Ginny turned up, plus Neville, Lee and the twins. Alicia was evidently staying indoors to keep Angelina company. The ten of them managed to do a rather good job of pretending that they weren\rquote 
t of-age, or prefects, or successful businessmen, or newly-trained Aurors. They ran and laughed and sent charmed snowballs flying after each other (all except Ginny, who couldn\rquote t do magic away from school). Harry was trying 
to help Ginny evade some snowballs the twins had sent her way, but she pushed him out of the way and instead caught them in the air, sending them hurtling back at Fred and George. Harry marveled at her, but a minute later Fred and George were sending far 
too many snowballs at her for her to manage in this way, and Harry pulled her down behind a snowbank as the cloud of snowballs began to bear down on her. 
\par A second later, they found themselves tumbling down a small embankment, getting snowier and snowier by
 the moment. When they stopped rolling, Harry looked up at Ginny; she was radiant, her cheeks glowing with healthy color, her eyes sparkling, her long fiery curls escaping from her hood. Knowing that they were too far from the others to be seen, he pulled
 her down to him suddenly in a kiss, unable to resist her, and she immediately succumbed. He rolled them so that he was leaning over her, devouring her mouth, then moving his lips down to her throat, making her gasp and grip his arms tightly. 
\par \'93Um, Harry?\'94 she whispered as his teeth nipped at her neck lightly. 
\par \'93Yes?\'94 he murmured between kisses. He felt both cold and hot simultaneously, a curious sensation. 
\par \'93Does this mean that you\rquote re not angry with me anymore?\'94 
\par He rose and looked down at her, considering this question. \'93No,\'94
 he answered simply. He saw how confused she looked before he claimed her mouth again; she laced her fingers into his hair, holding him in place; her fingers were making his scalp prickle pleasantly. But a minute later she pulled his face away from her. 

\par \'93So, you\rquote re doing this even though you\rquote re still angry?\'94 
\par \'93Well--a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 little}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  angry--\'94 he admitted. \'93But somehow--\'94
 He remembered how electrifying it had been when the two of them had been shouting at each other in his room, before they had kissed... 
\par She nodded. \'93Right. Shut up and kiss me,\'94 she ordered him. He looked at her with one eyebrow raised. 
\par \'93I\rquote ll kiss you when I\rquote m ready, Ginny Weas--\'94 
\par But she had pulled his face down to hers again and his words were cut off. 
\par He didn\rquote t complain.

That night, it was very hard for Harry to watch Ginny go off to the same room as Hermione, while he had to go to the room he was sharing with Ron. His best friend dropped off almost immediately. Harry grimaced and pulled the covers back to his side of the
 bed; Ron wouldn\rquote t know the difference. He slept like the dead. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 If,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry thought, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
dead people slept while sounding like a thousand sawmills...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Eventually, despite Ron\rquote s snoring, he fell deep asleep. When an unfamiliar weight on his chest and a painful pri
cking on his face woke him and his eyes flew open, he was surprised to see that a grey morning light was already filtering into the room. Then, suddenly, everything went black. And furry. And there was a lot of loud purring. 
\par \'93MacKenzie,\'94 Harry said irritably to the large fuzzy black cat that had once been Ginny\rquote s tiny fluffy kitten, \'93get off my face.\'94
 The cat backed up a little, sitting on his chest, looking at him with baleful yellow eyes, still purring loudly. Then she touched his face again with her claws. He winced and batted her paw away. \'93Cut that out,\'94
 he told her, reaching out to rub the side of her face. The purring increased in volume and she leaned into his hand appreciatively, urging him on. \'93How did you get in here, then, eh?\'94 he asked her as h
e chucked her under the chin. He glanced at the door, which he was certain had been securely closed when they\rquote d gone to bed. It was now slightly ajar. He smiled at the cat. \'93You were sent to fetch me, weren\rquote t you?\'94
 She merely pushed her nose at his hand, purring some more. Harry laughed softly and picked her up, throwing back the covers. He put her down, donned his dressing gown, then cradled her against him and rubbed her fuzzy belly while he walked. \'93Let
\rquote s go find your mistress then, shall we?\'94 
\par In the co
rridor he put her down and she trotted purposefully to the stairs, then began descending them. Harry followed. When she scratched at the door of the drawing room, Harry turned the knob, completely unsurprised to find Ginny sitting in front of the fire in 
h
er dressing gown. The Christmas tree nearby was adorned in sparkling lights that made her look like she had a golden aura. She turned and smiled at him. He closed the door; the cat went to a squashy armchair and curled in a circle on the seat, tucking her
 nose into her tail. Harry sat beside Ginny on the hearth rug, also hugging his knees to his chest, grinning. \'93MacKenzie told me you were waiting for me down here,\'94 he said. 
\par \'93Oh, really? So you\rquote re not just a Parseltongue?\'94 
\par He laughed. \'93Oh, sure. I\rquote m a regular Doctor Doolittle.\'94 
\par \'93Who?\'94 She frowned. He shook his head. 
\par \'93Never mind.\'94 He put his arms around her and pushed her hair from her brow. \'93It doesn\rquote t matter...\'94 But then he thought of something that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 did}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 matter. It mattered quite a lot. It had been bothering him the day before, but he hadn\rquote t been able to articulate it when he\rquote d been so angry about other things... 
\par She had leaned in, expecting him to kiss her, but he pulled back and frowned. She opened her eyes and saw that he was frowning at her, and she frowned back. \'93What\rquote s wrong, Harry?\'94 
\par He breathed heavily through his nose. \'93Neville.\'94 
\par She turned to look at the fire again. \'93Oh, is that all?\'94 
\par His jaw dropped. \'93How can you say that? I can\rquote t believe the way you just took up with him, using him so that Draco wouldn\rquote 
t think you were still interested in me. And then Hermione used him, too! Really--I was rather disappointed in the pair of you. I do think you both owe him an apology. Asking him here for the holiday isn\rquote t going to make up for his heart being t
rod on by }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 two}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  girls he fancied...\'94 To his horror, Ginny was grinning at him. \'93It isn\rquote t funny!\'94 he said, appalled, making her grin even wider. 
\par \'93Wait right here,\'94 she said suddenly, springing up and running to the door. Her cat watched her run off, then tucked her nose into her tail again, unconcerned. Harry frowned into the fire. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
What on earth is going on here}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? he wondered. He yawned suddenly, realizing how early it was and how tired he was. 
\par A few minutes later, Ginny came springing back into the room. \'93I reckon we should tell you everything,\'94 she burbled. 
\par He stared at her. \'93We?\'94 he echoed, not understanding. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Maybe I just need to be more awake to get what she\rquote s saying.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par \'93Right. I woke up Hermione, so--\'94 Ginny turned around, looking very confused. She walked back over to the door and called into the hall, \'93Hermione! Where are you?\'94 
\par \'93Coming....\'94 came the faint whisper of Hermione\rquote s sleepy voice, accompanied by the sound of her feet, still in slippers, plodding down the steps. Ginny looked like she\rquote d had seve
ral pots of coffee or tea. Hermione stumbled into the drawing room; Harry tried not to laugh, she was such a sight, from her bleary eyes to her wild hair and misbuttoned nightshirt, showing under her old frayed dressing gown, to her mismatched socks. (He 
knew the socks were no accident; she did it on principle, in honor of Dobby.) 
\par He was feeling more awake, seeing her. He grinned. \'93Morning, Hermione. Sleep well?\'94 
\par Her eyes had started to close again as she leaned against the door, and she opened one now and looked balefully at him. \'93You say something, Potter?\'94 
\par He laughed, then stopped abruptly, clamping his mouth shut; he couldn\rquote t ever remember her calling him by his last name. She might have done, but he couldn\rquote t remember. \'93Nah. Not me,\'94 he finally was ab
le to say, finding it harder and harder to not laugh out loud again. 
\par Ginny was still bubbling over. \'93Wait here, Harry. I\rquote ll go up and get Neville now.\'94 
\par She was already sprinting out of the room again when Harry suddenly realized what she\rquote d said. \'93Neville?\'94 he said, horrified, getting to his feet. \'93You\rquote re going to wake him up at this hour to apologize? You\rquote 
ll just have to apologize for }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 !\'94 he called after her, uncertain whether she\rquote d heard him. He was too tired to run after her. Hermione staggered to th
e games table, where Ron had been playing Percy at chess the night before. She pulled out a chair and sat in it heavily, her eyes closing. A few minutes later, Ginny came running in again, her face glowing with excitement. 
\par \'93Soon I think you\rquote ll understand why I\rquote m so mad this morning. Oh, good; here\rquote s Neville.\'94 
\par Neville staggered into the room sleepily. He looked, if possible, less alert than Hermione. \'93Morning, Neville,\'94 Harry said softly, not trying to make any jokes this time. \'93Do you want to sit?\'94 he add
ed, pulling out the other chair from the games table, putting it next to Hermione\rquote s. Neville nodded slowly and staggered to the chair, sitting in it and sighing. 
\par Hermione listed to the side and leaned her head on Neville\rquote s shoulder, closing her eyes. Harry looked quizzically at Ginny. He still wasn\rquote t certain that this was a good idea. 
\par \'93Um--was it really necessary to get them out of bed this early?\'94 
\par \'93But you\rquote ve got to understand. I couldn\rquote t wait. It\rquote s just too bad Mariah isn\rquote t here--\'94 
\par Now Harry was really baffled. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Mariah!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Ginny grinned broadly. \'93Yes! It was all her brilliant plan, really. True Slytherin cunning.\'94 
\par Harry shook his head. \'93I think I need to sit, too.\'94 He turned an armchair so that their seats formed a small semi-circle and he sank into its depths. Ginny simply lowered herself to the floor and sat cross-legged, gazing up lovingly at Harry again. 

\par \'93First of all, Neville--Harry and I are together now.\'94 She turned to Harry. \'93I told Hermione last night.\'94 She resumed talking to the other two. \'93I want to tell him about the plan. I also want to thank you for everything. You\rquote 
re the best friends I--\'94 
\par \'93What bleeding plan?\'94 Harry interrupted loudly. His noise seemed to wake Hermione up. 
\par \'93God, Harry, don\rquote t you see?\'94 she said, sounding a bit more disgusted with his cluelessness than she usually did. She spoke slowly, but Harry decided to assume that it was because she was tired rather than because she thought he was dim. \'93
Mariah went to Ginny because she didn\rquote t think that Ginny--\'94 she paused to yawn; \'93-- wanted to be with Malfoy anymore. She was honest with Ginny and said that she }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 did}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  want--\'94 }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 yawn}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  \'93-- to be with him, and that they\rquote d been carrying on. She said she was a selkie, but she\rquote 
d never used that to get Malfoy. Since Ginny didn\rquote t want him, she should let him g-g-g-gooo,\'94 she finally managed to say, and then yawned hugely yet again. 
\par Ginny went on as Hermione snuggled closer to Neville, making contented noises that Harry remembered meant she was about to fall asleep again. \'93So,\'94 Ginny said quickly, \'93I told her I\rquote 
d do that in a heartbeat, but if I left Draco for you, there was no telling what he\rquote d do. She agreed that that might be a problem and suggested we just sneak around. I explained to her about the amulets and showed her mine; she couldn\rquote 
t believe it. She told me about Slytherin and the family curse--she hadn\rquote t originally said that\rquote s why she\rquote s a selkie. She held my amulet and said she could see Draco. I told her I saw }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , and that I was fairly certain Draco could see }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , so there couldn\rquote 
t be any sneaking around while he had his amulet. She was surprised--she didn\rquote t know there was more than one, and she said whenever she\rquote d been with Draco, he hadn\rquote t been wearing it.\'94
 She made a face then, and Harry thought about her pride. \'93I reckon he might actually have felt guilty if he\rquote d been wearing it while he was with }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 her}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, and touched it and saw }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ...\'94 
\par Harry put out his hand to her and she took it gratefully. Shaking herself, she went on. \'93Sorry. I\rquote m being stupid. So Mariah and I talked and talked about how to handle the problem, and finally, she had an answer. She said she\rquote 
d get the patrolling schedule changed so that she and you were on the same shift. She\rquote d make a pass at you and I\rquote d say I\rquote 
d seen it in the amulet and then meet with the three of you and tell you all to sod off. That way, it would look like I was admitting to everything. Admitting to knowing about him and Mariah, and also the Muggle girl in the hedge maze
. And not wanting to go very far with him because I was in love with you, and so on. Because of the amulet, I could bring up the part about seeing you and Mariah when I held it, and--this is the key--in front of Draco, I could tell you off and make him th
ink I wanted nothing more to do with you!\'94 
\par Harry was baffled. \'93But wait--I thought the two of them were on different shifts because Ron and Hermione and I had this plan to catch Mariah and Draco, and--\'94 
\par \'93Oh, it is, in part. Except that what you didn\rquote t know was that Mariah and I had recruited Hermione already, and when you and Ron started talking to her about }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 your}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 plan, she decided that if she switched the shifts, it would work for both plans--you\rquote d think she did it because of what you had hatched, and Mariah could pretend to Draco that she didn\rquote 
t know about the switch, although she and Hermione and I planned it.\'94 
\par Harry was feeling a little hurt. \'93Why couldn\rquote t you tell me about all of this?\'94 
\par Hermione opened one eye and looked at him sleepily, and not like she thought he was a genius, either. \'93I told her not to tell you. It was better for you not to know. You\rquote re not the world\rquote 
s best actor, Harry. You couldn't even bite your tongue when your Aunt Marge was insulting your dad. You couldn't pretend not to care, oh, no; instead you inflated her. Malfoy would have spotted it right away if you knew.\'94 
\par Harry was flabbergasted. He remembered the way Ginny and Mariah had been shooting daggers at each other during the confrontation in the anteroom--and they\rquote d rehearsed it all! Planned every moment of it, practically. \'93
So you knew that she was a selkie, yet you looked so shocked when--\'94 
\par Ginny laughed. \'93I really made you think I didn\rquote t know! That\rquote s fantastic. I was worried about that. Mariah helped me practice my \lquote completely shocked and taken aback\rquote  look.\'94 
\par Harry picked his jaw up from the floor. \'93But,\'94 he finally managed to say, \'93what does all of this have to do with Neville?\'94 
\par \'93Well,\'94 Ginny explained, \'93I was afraid Draco would suspect something and still think we were sneaking around, after the break-up, and try to catch us. We had to get the amulet away from Draco. The funny part about }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Mariah}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  getting it, of course, is that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  were the one to mention it first. I was going to say, 
\lquote Haven\rquote t you shown her your amulet, Draco?\rquote  But you saved me the trouble. That worked out so well...\'94 
\par He frowned again. \'93But--Mariah seemed really hacked off when she saw you wearing it that morning, you know, when she--\'94 
\par Ginny nodded. \'93We did that on purpose. She already knew, of course. We needed for both you and Draco to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 see}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 that Mariah knew, so when she was on patrol with you, after she made the pass, she could say she knew I\rquote d see the two of you in the amulet. If you didn\rquote t know that Mariah knew I had it, that wouldn\rquote t have worked. See?\'94 
\par Harry\rquote s head was spinning. \'93Um, can we get back to Neville?\'94 
\par \'93Wha--?\'94 Neville said suddenly, sitting up abruptly, his shoulder hitting Hermione in the cheekbone. 
\par \'93Ow--\'94 she said slowly, putting her hand to her face. 
\par \'93Oh, sorry, Herminninny,\'94 Neville said sleepily, putting his arm around her shoulder. She leaned on him again and they both closed their eyes, falling asleep again. 
\par Ginny laughed softly at them. \'93Hermione\rquote s idea. She said I should talk to Neville, because he seemed like he had a bit of a crush on me, and he\rquote d probably help. I explained to him that you and I wanted to be together, and I\rquote 
d broken up with Draco, but I couldn\rquote t be with you yet because I was afraid of what Draco would do. So I asked him whether he\rquote d mind pretending to be my boyfriend, to throw Draco off the scent. I said I\rquote 
d understand completely if he didn\rquote t want to, since }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 he}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  could become a target--except that I think Draco doesn\rquote 
t usually take Neville seriously enough for that to happen right off--\'94 She looked fondly at Neville. \'93He was so sweet. He kissed me on the cheek, and said, \lquote I couldn\rquote 
t imagine losing you to someone better than Harry Potter. And if it will make Draco Malfoy squirm to see you with me, I\rquote m in. I\rquote ve wanted to get Malfoy\rquote s goat for almost seven years. This\rquote ll 
be like a birthday and Christmas present rolled into one!\rquote \'94
 She grinned. Harry looked at Neville, smiling and shaking his head. No wonder Neville seemed so happy to be with Ginny; in addition to at least being able to pretend to be her boyfriend, he was al
so able to live an old fantasy about getting the better of Draco Malfoy. 
\par But Ginny wasn\rquote t done. \'93Then, after a while, I really did start worrying about Neville\rquote s safety. There was that ridiculous almost-duel, for one thing. Draco didn\rquote t act like it was no
thing for me to be with Neville, as he did at first, and he definitely seemed like he was cooking up something. So Mariah suggested that, since Hermione was still trying to knock some sense into Ron, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 she}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  should start seeing Neville, sort of \lquote stealing him\rquote  away from me. Then Neville wouldn\rquote t be my boyfriend any more and Draco wouldn\rquote 
t go after him, and maybe if Ron thought Neville and Hermione were seeing each other, he might see sense and stop pushing her away. And }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  worked too!\'94 she crowed. 
\par Harry shook his head at Neville. \'93You\rquote re either the stupidest or the most selfless bloke I\rquote ve ever met, Nev. But I\rquote ll give you the benefit of the doubt and say \lquote selfless,\rquote \'94
 Harry added, grinning at him. Neville had forced his eyes open now. 
\par \'93Well, both jobs did have their fringe benefits. I can\rquote t really complain,\'94 he said, smiling in a sly un-Neville-like way. Harry remembered seeing him--and in Hermione\rquote s case, hearing him--snogging }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 both}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  girls at different points in time, and he had a feeling that he knew what Neville meant. Harry had been seething inside when he\rquote 
d seen Neville with Ginny, but now he just thought, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 How could I not have seen it? It was all an act.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par \'93If we try to get you a real girlfriend, do you promise to stay away from ours in future, Longbottom?\'94 Ron demanded as he entered the room. They all looked up in surprise. 
\par \'93Ron!\'94 Ginny said half-guiltily, springing to her feet. \'93Did you hear--\'94 
\par \'93Yeah, I heard everything. After Harry left our room, I wondered what was going on. Then I heard you get Hermione, and after that, Neville. After he went down, I went out to sit at the top of the stairs. Heard everything without a problem.\'94
 He tapped his ear with his index finger. \'93Wolf hearing, you know. Rather convenient.\'94 
\par Hermione looked at him uncertainly, but he pulled her to her feet and kissed her soundly, then put his chin on the top of her head and looked at Neville. \'93
I figured out pretty early what was going on, but thanks anyway, mate, for helping me see the light. And if you ever lay another finger or lip on her, I\rquote ll break both your arms, Longbottom.\'94 
\par Neville didn\rquote t flinch but smiled back tiredly at Ron. \'93Not a problem. Just see to it that you appreciate what you have in Hermione. Because if you don\rquote t make her blissfully happy, you\rquote ll have me to answer to.\'94 
\par \'93And me,\'94 Harry added, looking happily at his two best friends. Ginny crawled into his lap and put her arms around his neck. 
\par \'93And you\rquote ll have to answer to all six of my brothers and my sister and parents if you don\rquote t make }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  blissfully happy,\'94 she said, kissing him on the cheek. 

\par \'93And me as well,\'94 Neville added, standing. \'93But no pressure,\'94 he said quickly, grinning. They all laughed at that. Then, looking back and forth at the two couples, Neville said a little wistfully, \'93You w
ere saying, Ron, about getting me a real girlfriend....\'94 
\par Both girls immediately abandoned Harry and Ron and threw their arms around Neville. \'93He\rquote s mine!\'94 Hermione cried, grinning. 
\par \'93No, you tart!\'94 Ginny said in a squeaky mock-appalled voice. \'93Get off my man!\'94 
\par Neville didn\rquote t look a bit displeased about their silliness though, and had an arm around each one of them. Harry gently gathered Ginny to him once more, saying, \'93Here, here. There are loads of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 other}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  girls in the world...\'94 
\par Ron also drew Hermione away, and she smiled up at him playfully. Neville made a great show of snapping his fingers and looking disappointed. 
\par \'93And I was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 so}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  enjoying having a harem.\'94

\par Ginny was as red as her hair. Neville looked like he wanted to drop through a hole in the ground. Hermione and Ron, however, looked like their ire was up. 
\par \'93I can\rquote t }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 believe}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  your mother reacted that way!\'94 Hermione said to Ron, incredulous.

 the one with the mother living in the dark ages....\'94 
\par Harry sighed and leaned back, closing his eyes, reaching for Ginny\rquote s hand and clasping it convulsively. Just when he was thinking Christmas was going to be absolutely lovely, a revelation had torn 
the Weasley family apart. It began with Molly Weasley arriving on Christmas day and entering the kitchen, screaming loud enough to wake the dead when she saw her son\rquote s girlfriend and her very pregnant belly. 
\par Harry and the other guests (other than Katie and Alicia, who\rquote d already found out) had learned on Christmas Eve why Angelina was nowhere to be found the day before. Her second trimester was over, she\rquote 
d said, and the babies were getting very uncomfortable for her to carry. She was having twins. Harry had been flabbergasted, then congratulated her and George and asked when the wedding was to be. After an awkward silence, they explained that they weren
\rquote t even going to start planning a wedding until after the babies were born. The pregnancy wasn\rquote t an accident, but completely intentional, because they hadn\rquote 
t wanted to wait. With the war and the Diagon Alley attack and the Gringotts siege, they didn\rquote t want to postpone }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 life}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
. Angelina wanted a proper wedding with enough time (a year) to plan it; that would have m
eant postponing having a child (which had unexpectedly become two children) for almost two years. They decided to reverse the order of things instead: children first, then wedding. (Angelina insisted that this meant she didn\rquote 
t ever have to give birth again-- \'93Two in one go,\'94 was how she\rquote d put it.) 
\par The thing that had most angered Mrs. Weasley was that it was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 planned}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . (She kept using the term \'93premeditated,\'94
 and Harry could see that this was making Alicia very uncomfortable.) The only time Harry had heard her }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 screech}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 in quite the same way was when she had sent a howler to Ron in second year, after they\rquote d taken the Ford Anglia. He had always assumed that the howler had amplified her voice. Now he knew that when she was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
really}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  enraged, a facsimile like a howler couldn\rquote t come close to doing her justice... 
\par The battle lines had been drawn. Percy, to everyone\rquote s surprise, had defended George and Angelina\rquote s decision. He\rquote d known from the very start that they\rquote d planned it and had enco
uraged them, saying that he wished he and Penny had had a chance to have a child before she was killed. \'93Well!\'94 she\rquote d replied, more than indignant. \'93I never thought I\rquote d see the day that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , of all people, would completely forget decorum and--and respect for your parents!\'94 
\par She stormed from the kitchen, her husband traveling uncertainly in her wake. Bill, Charlie, Maggie, Snape and Sirius had also come for Christmas dinner, and they left the kitchen as well, along with Ron, Ginny, Hermione and Harry. In the
 entrance hall, Molly paced, as though uncertain about the next step. She muttered under her breath as the carol-singing Christmas ornaments on the hall tree added an inappropriately cheerful tone. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I just do not believe this}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . That they would be so irresponsible...\'94 
\par To Harry\rquote s surprise, Hermione stepped forward. \'93They\rquote re just worried, Mrs. Weasley. They want a family, but with everything going on--\'94 
\par The next thing Harry knew, Molly Weasley was attacking }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Hermione}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , bringing up the Rita Skeeter article agai
n, from the Tournament, and the Daisy Furuncle article from the summer, saying that when she and Harry had been sneaking around together they\rquote 
d been playing Ron for a fool. Hermione looked like she was on the verge of tears but trying to hide this behind a furious fa\'e7ade; she stormed out of the room. Ron turned on his mother with fire in his eyes. 
\par \'93You will }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  speak to Hermione that way, Mum! Now, I know that I\rquote m a disappointment to you--\'94 Mrs. Weasley suddenly put her hands out to Ron in appeasement. He 
brushed her off. \'93Don\rquote t try to make it up to me now. The letters you sent me when I was in hospital said it all. \lquote Try to find out if they have a cure now,\rquote  you said. You\rquote re ashamed of me. You don\rquote t want a son who
\rquote s a werewolf. Well, fine! You don\rquote t have to think of me as your son anymore, if you like. But George is still my brother and Angelina is going to have my nieces or nephews, or maybe one of each, so if you don\rquote t mind, I\rquote 
d like to go have Christmas dinner with }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 my family}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 
\par He stormed out as well. Charlie looked sheepishly at his mother and followed Ron, showing tacit agreement. Bill and Maggie went to their mother; Maggie put her arms around the small woman, tutting and comforting her. 
\par Ginny looked at them with her hands on her hips. \'93You\rquote re not agreeing with her, are you?\'94 she asked her sister and her eldest brother. Bill and Maggie looked uncertainly at Ginny, but it was Snape who answered. 
\par \'93Never have I seen a more disgraceful display of disrespect toward a parent,\'94 he growled iciliy. \'93War or no war, this is still nominally a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 civilized}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  society and }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 in}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  a civilized society one shows }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 respect}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to one\rquote s elders.\'94 
\par \'93Is that what my sister shows to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? Is that what they\rquote re calling it now?\'94 They all whirled; George had left the kitchen and was now
 standing in the entrance hall, giving Snape a piece of his mind. \'93Because you\rquote re--what? Twelve years older than her? Convenient, isn\rquote t it? She can\rquote t disagree with you or she\rquote s showing disrespect to her elder. Well, you
\rquote re not a member of this family, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Snape}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , so stay out of our family arguments. For that matter, stay out of my house. That goes for all of you; if you don\rquote 
t like what Angelina and I are doing, you can leave and have your ruddy Christmas dinner elsewhere!\'94 
\par George turned on his heel and returned to the kitchen. Harry was shocked. Ginny had tears streaming down her cheeks; Molly hugged her and said, \'93Come on then, love. I can fix up something for us back at the Burrow...\'94 
\par But Ginny pulled back suddenly. \'93Erm, no, Mum. I\rquote m staying here.\'94 She spoke very quietly and lifted her chin slightly. Her mother looked shocked. She turned to Harry. He stood shoulder to shoulder with Ginny. 
\par Before she could say anything, he said softly, \'93I\rquote ll be staying as well, Mrs. Weasley.\'94 Sirius stood next to him with his hand on his shoulder, silent, but since he was there as Harry\rquote s godfather, it was clear that he wouldn\rquote 
t be leaving for the Burrow either. 
\par Mrs. Weasley looked as though Harry had hit her and turned to her husband, who had been rendered utterly speechless until now. He put his arms around her and said, \'93Come along, love. We should go...\'94
 Mr. and Mrs. Weasley stepped into the fire after throwing the Floo powder, followed by Bill, Maggie, and finally, Snape, who looked pointedly at Harry and Sirius before disappearing into the green flames. 
\par The meal that followed was a silent, grim affair, unrelieved by the slight amusement provided by the wizarding crackers. Sirius suggested to Harry that he, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Neville could come to Ascog after dinner
, instead of waiting for the morning of Boxing Day, and they all jumped at the chance to leave the tension-fraught house. 
\par However, leaving Hog\rquote s End didn\rquote t immediately lift their spirits. The silence in the sitting room at Ascog Castle was palpable. Sirius looked down and saw Harry and Ginny holding hands and said, \'93
Harry, is there something you and Ginny would like to tell me?\'94 
\par Harry looked at Sirius, then Ginny, and put his arm around her, smiling at his godfather, who, to Harry\rquote s dismay, did not look very happy for him. 
\par \'93What?\'94 Harry said, feeling rather hurt by Sirius\rquote  reaction. Sirius stood and walked to the mantle. When he turned around he looked a little happier, but Harry could still see concern behind his dark eyes. 
\par \'93It\rquote s just that--yeah, I\rquote m happy for you both. But don\rquote 
t go getting any ideas about shouting it from the rooftops. It was one thing when Hermione was your girlfriend--she was already targeted by Voldemort just for being your friend. Just as Ron is. But Ginny--well, it would probably b
e a bad idea for anyone outside this room to know about the pair of you... Like Draco Malfoy.\'94 
\par Harry\rquote s mouth worked silently. \'93But--but--\'94 
\par Sirius shook his head. \'93I know you\rquote re trying to become friends, but you }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 cannot}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  tell him. Absolutely not.\'94 
\par \'93Come on, Sirius--\'94 
\par \'93Two words, Harry. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Obedience Charm.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93But--\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 No.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 Harry had never felt like a small child being disciplined when he was with Sirius; he usually felt like an equal. But now he felt anything }{

\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Brilliant. That\rquote s the way to convince Draco I\rquote m his friend... Start sneaking around with his old girlfriend, the one I said would probably never want to look at me again.}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry swallowed. \'93Well, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 others}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  know. I think. Actually, we didn\rquote t make an announcement at Hog\rquote 
s End or anything, so the twins and Percy and the others may or may not know...\'94 
\par Sirius waved this concern away. \'93I don\rquote t mean them. They\rquote re trustworthy. After all, they\rquote re--\'94 He stopped suddenly, and Harry leaned forward, waiting. 
\par \'93They\rquote re Ginny\rquote s family. Of course they\rquote re not going to tell anyone anything that could get her hurt.\'94 
\par \'93Er, yes. Right,\'94 Sirius said awkwardly. 
\par \'93Maggie and Bill know,\'94 Ginny said quietly, gripping Harry\rquote s hand. \'93I told them when they arrived. You were in the kitchen,\'94 she told Harry. \'93But of course, they\rquote re also family. And Professor Snape knows as well, but he
\rquote s working for Professor Dumbledore, and he\rquote s--he\rquote s with our sister. I trust him. I never had a chance to tell Mum and Dad, though; Mum went right into the kitchen when she arrived, and then the fight began...\'94 
\par \'93Do the other girls know?\'94 Sirius asked. \'93You know--Alicia, Katie, Angelina?\'94 
\par Ginny looked thoughtful. \'93I\rquote m not sure about Alicia. Katie knew months ago how we felt about each other, and she and Percy sort of--found us together yesterday. Just talking, mind you,\'94
 she said quickly; Harry was trying not to turn red. He remembered that it hadn\rquote t been }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 all}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  talk. \'93
And I told Angelina myself, yesterday, when I took some tea to her room. We visited for a while...\'94 
\par Sirius looked thoughtful. \'93Hm. I hope Alicia doesn\rquote t know....\'94 
\par Harry frowned. \'93Why?\'94 
\par Sirius looked uncertainly at Ginny and Neville. \'93They don\rquote t know about her dad, do they?\'94 he said to Harry. 
\par Harry looked at them in turn. \'93There\rquote s no reason why they can\rquote t, is there?\'94 
\par Sirius considered it for a moment, then nodded and gave them the short version of Alicia\rquote s father\rquote s plight. Ginny and Neville looked shocked by the tale. Harry frowned at Sirius again. \'93So why do you hope Alicia doesn\rquote 
t know about me and Ginny?\'94 
\par \'93Because I\rquote m not certain how truthful she\rquote s being about this whole mess...\'94 
\par Harry was shocked. \'93You don\rquote t think Mr. Spinnet actually }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 did}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  it, do you?\'94 
\par Sirius shook his head, pacing before the fire. \'93Oh, god no. But she is so }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 insistent}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  that Roger is innocent, and I just don\rquote 
t think we can afford to eliminate anyone as a suspect. Even her.\'94 Harry wondered whether that was why Sirius had been staying in Alicia's bedroom in his dog form. \'93Ambrose and Eve Davies are still perfectly healthy, and it\rquote 
s been over a week since
 Alicia came to Hogwarts. If someone was going to kill them by now, I think they would have done. Which strongly implies that Roger--if he did it--followed his orders to the letter. Plus--if Roger is the one who did it, that means he\rquote 
s not above sacrificing other people to protect his own family. That\rquote s why he became a Death Eater in the first place. And many people wouldn\rquote t blame him; it\rquote s like his family is being held hostage, after all. But still. If Roger
\rquote s former contact managed to get to Alicia, and if she thought she could help her dad by giving up certain information, like Ginny being your girlfriend... And then there\rquote 
s still the possibility that she did it herself. And killed Roger. Or at least sent him off where he\rquote s in no position to provide her dad\rquote s alibi.\'94 
\par It was Hermione\rquote s turn to be shocked now. \'93You think she would frame her }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 own father}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? Not to mention, she\rquote s Muggle-born. I\rquote 
ve never heard of a Muggle-born Death Eater.\'94 
\par Sirius looked very gravely at them all. \'93On the contrary, Voldemort would probably be highly amused to be able to coerce a Muggle-born witch to do his will. And at any rate, Roger was working to protect his family. How do we know that Alicia isn
\rquote t doing the same? In a way, her father going to prison }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 could}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  be something that woul
d protect him. Muggle prison would certainly get him away from the corridors of power at Whitehall. I\rquote 
m starting to get a very bad feeling that Voldemort having infiltrated the Muggle government through Roger is going to be putting all of those people in d
anger, and Alicia might have looked on this as the only way to get her father out of office and to safety--even if it is prison. A desperate ploy, to be sure, but although the traditional way for an MP to lose his job was to be embroiled in a sex scandal,
 the public just don\rquote t respond to those in the same way these days. And who knows? She could have offed Roger herself, to make it look even worse for her dad...\'94 
\par \'93Let me get this straight,\'94 Ron said, running his hand through his hair. \'93You\rquote ve hired a lawyer for Alicia\rquote s dad even though you think }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 she}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 might have framed him? So we might have been eating Christmas dinner with a murderer?\'94 
\par Sirius grimaced. \'93My theories change almost hourly, Ron. It\rquote s a huge tangle. Severus and Arabella, er, Professors Snape and Figg don\rquote t know what to think, either. And Albus has all of the operatives looking for Roger Davies now.\'94 

\par Harry was alarmed. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 All}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? So this one thing has drawn everyone off from whatever they were already doing? Is that wise? What about Gringotts?\'94 
\par Sirius shook his head. \'93Well, maybe not }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 all}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
. Most. Still, in that this has to do with some people with quite a lot of power in the Muggle government, it seemed prudent to pursue this before the trail grows cold. And most importantly, we have to determine what Voldemort\rquote 
s original goal was. I don\rquote t think Mr. Spinnet being elected was it. There\rquote s more to this...\'94 
\par Sirius grimaced and rubbed his hand over his face. His mother appeared in the doorway of the sitting room, looking surprised. \'93Oh! Sirius! And Harry! Welcome home! I didn\rquote t realize you were all coming this evening. Happy Christmas, everyone!\'94
 Sirius forced himself to smile when he saw his mother and strode to her, his arms out. 
\par \'93Happy Christmas, Mum. I think you remember Ginny, Hermione and Ron from the summer? And this is Neville Longbottom.\'94 
\par Ron went to the doorway so he could shake her hand and Neville did also; she clung to Neville\rquote s hand for a second, peering into his face. \'93Longbottom? Not Frank and Gemma Longbottom\rquote s boy?\'94 
\par He nodded sheepishly and she grinned at him. \'93Gemma went to school with my girls! She and Ursula were quite the pair, you know. They almost had a falling out over who was going to get Frank...\'94
 She winked at Neville and he blushed; Harry imagined that he had never heard anything like this about his parents\rquote  youths. 
\par \'93Well, no offense, but I\rquote m rather glad that my mum was the one to get him,\'94 Neville said quietly. Callisto Black put her hand on his arm and smiled at him. 
\par \'93Confidentially, so am I. I think Alan is a very good match for Ursula, and I think Frank and Gemma made a lovely couple.\'94 She looked sadly at Neville. \'93I\rquote m so sorry about what happened...\'94 
\par He nodded. \'93Thank you, ma\rquote am,\'94 he said levelly, showing a maturity to which Harry was finally growing accustomed. 
\par \'93Since you\rquote re all here, why don\rquote t you join the others down in the pool? Cass and Floyd are at his parents', but Ursula and Alan are downstairs enjoying themselves with Leo and Mercy. The children }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
are}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  a handful, though. I\rquote m sure they wouldn\rquote t say no to some assistance...\'94 Her eyes twinkled at them, crinkling up at the edges, and they couldn\rquote 
t help but smile back at her. Suddenly, the strife at Hog\rquote s End seemed very far away. 
\par They all climbed the stairs to the rooms where they\rquote d be staying. Neville went to Leo and Orion\rquote 
s room while Sirius went to his own room and Hermione and Ginny went to the guest room. After they were done changing into their swimming gear, Ron and Harry were descending the stairs again when Ron suggested they stop at Sirius\rquote 
 room so he could ask him something.
\par Harry shrugged and went along. Ron knocked, and after a few seconds the door opened. Sirius appeared, dressed for his swim. \'93Ready?\'94 he asked them, grinning, clearly needing to release some tension with physical exercise. 
\par \'93Well, actually,\'94 Ron said, his voice shaking for some reason, \'93I was curious about something. You said that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 all}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  of the operatives were working on Mr. Spinnet\rquote 
s case. Does that mean that no one\rquote s looking for my other sister anymore?\'94 
\par Sirius looked surprised. \'93Well, that\rquote s a good point. I\rquote m sorry I forgot to mention that. I\rquote m afraid we have to set priorities, Ron, and there haven\rquote t been any leads lately--\'94 
\par \'93No, no, that\rquote s fine. I mean--I understand. Priorities and all.\'94 
\par Harry peered at him, frowning. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Since when did Ron not want his other sister found?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  \'93You }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 do}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 want Annie found, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 eventually}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 he said to his friend. Ron looked back at him blankly. 
\par \'93Er, yeah. Of course. Not that today\rquote s Christmas dinner would exactly be a Weasley-selling point, of course. Good thing she didn\rquote t turn up while that row was going on. It was a ruddy civil war.\'94 
\par Harry was even more baffled. \'93Yeah, I suppose. Not that she }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 would}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  just turn up out of the blue. I mean, she doesn\rquote t remember anything about her early life, after all.
\'94 
\par Ron clamped his mouth shut and looked at them both. He turned and left the room, calling over his shoulder, \'93Let\rquote s just go swimming,\'94 before descending the stairs. Sirius looked at Harry. 
\par \'93What was all that about?\'94 his godfather asked. 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93No idea.\'94 He paused, then said very quickly, \'93About Draco Malfoy--\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 No.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Harry sighed. It was clear that Sirius wasn\rquote t going to change his mind. 
\par They followed Ron down the stairs and were soon in the dungeons. When they made their way to the pool they found Sirius\rquote  sister Ursula and her husband Alan in the pool with nine-year-old Leo and seven-year-old Mercy. Mercy\rquote 
s almost-white eyes were as disturbing to Harry as ever. Ginny, Neville and Hermione had already reached the pool. Harry could see that Ron was disappointed that Hermione wasn\rquote t wearing the bikini from the photo she\rquote 
d sent Harry from Corfu. Both she and Ginny were wearing conservative one-piece outfits in turquoise (Hermione) and purple (Ginny). Harry had a difficult time not staring at Ginny, for despite 
the fact that certain areas of her body were quite thoroughly covered, they }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 were}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  covered very }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 tightly}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  by the purple fabric.... 
\par Ron swatted him with the back of his hand; it hurt rather more than Harry would have liked. \'93Get a good look at my sister\rquote s bum?\'94 Ron snarled under his breath. 
\par Harry rubbed his arm. \'93Get a grip. If I\rquote m not supposed to let on to \lquote outsiders\rquote  that there\rquote s anything between me and Ginny, you can\rquote t go into protective-brother-mode, either. The Piersons aren\rquote 
t to know about this, remember? The only couple amongst us is you and Hermione. Officially.\'94 
\par \'93Well, then you\rquote ll remember to keep your eyes on more }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 neutral}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  anatomy when looking at Ginny, won\rquote t you?\'94 Ron hissed under his breath. 
\par Harry sighed. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 This was not going to be easy.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par They enjoye
d being in the pool for a while, but as the evening wore on, Ursula and Alan decided to take the children up to bed. Sirius and Harry were lounging by the side of the pool when Harry asked him about what Rodney Jeffries was up to. Sirius hesitated for a m
oment. 
\par \'93I don\rquote t mean to alarm you, Harry, since your aunt is with the organization now, but every time I go and spend some time with his people, it strikes me as more and more--\'94 
\par \'93What?\'94 
\par \'93Cult-like. Disturbingly so. And there are plans for a big gathering in the spring. Not sure where yet. It\rquote s to be outdoors, I know. A large venue. Designed to bring together as many people as possible. I\rquote m trying to find out more.\'94 

\par They hadn\rquote t realized how close to them Neville was swimming. He swam to the edge of the pool and leaned his chin on his arms. \'93Did I hear you say Rodney Jeffries? He\rquote s brilliant, isn\rquote t he?\'94 
\par Harry sat up, his eyes wide. \'93What? Why would you say that?\'94 
\par \'93Well, he healed my Uncle Algie, didn\rquote t he? Aunt Enid, Uncle Algie and Gran always go down to Blackpool Pier for Bonfire Night, because, well--\'94 He looked at the girls and Ron, to see whether they were listening. \'93Promise not to tell?\'94
 Harry and Sirius nodded, speechless. \'93They like to sabotage the bonfire. You know, since Guy Fawkes was a wizard and he was framed for the Gunpowder Plot...\'94 
\par Sirius leaned forward. Harry remembered this vaguely from History of Magic; he knew it was yet another reason for Slytherin hatred of Muggles and Muggle-borns. A raucous Muggle holiday which had the burning of
 a wizard in effigy as its centerpiece. Harry had wondered why this holiday seemed to go unobserved by wizards when he'd started Hogwarts, but once he knew about Guy Fawkes being a wizard, it made perfect sense. \'93Go on,\'94 Sirius said to Neville. 

\par \'93Well, Uncle Algie is, erm, a little--accident prone,\'94 Neville said, reddening. Harry tried not to laugh; it must run in the family. \'93
Instead of putting out the fire in a way that no one would know who had done it, he set himself on fire. But before Aunt Enid or Gran could get to him--this Rodney Jeffries had healed him....\'94 
\par Harry frowned. \'93I read a newspaper article about that. It said he'd healed a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 young}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  man.\'94 
\par Neville shrugged. \'93Uncle Algie looks young for his age. He and Aunt Enid }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 love}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Jeffries. Since October, they\rquote 
ve been traveling with him, too. And so have some other witches and wizards. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Everyone}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  loves Rodney Jeffries...\'94 
\par Harry thought of the vicar from Little Whinging, Mr. Babcock, and Dr. Forbes. Not }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 everyone}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  loved Rodney Jeffries. He was glad he hadn\rquote t pub
licized Jeffries healing his back.

\par Neville went back to swimming and Harry looked quizzically at Sirius. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 So. Witches and wizards even thought he was wonderful. The man who was healed was Neville\rquote s Uncle Algie. What now?}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry wondered. But with Neville so close by, this wasn\rquote t the time or place to discuss Rodney Jeffries further, and Mr. Spinnet\rquote s case was more of a priority, anyway. 
\par After they went back up to their rooms and prepared for bed, Ron asked Harry whether 
he could borrow some parchment and Hedwig to send a letter. Harry directed him to the desk and Ron sat down to write, the quill scratching on the parchment for some time. When he was done, Ron folded it up and wrote a name on the outside, then sealed the 
back with some purple wax Harry had in the desk. Once, when he\rquote d been passing by on the way to the bathroom, while Ron was still writing, Ron had hurriedly covered the letter so that Harry couldn\rquote 
t see it. Harry had moved on, perplexed, but not wanting to let on to Ron that he cared. 
\par Ron left to go up to the roof, where Hedwig was roosting, and Harry crept over to the desk; he felt the blotter lightly. There was an impression in it where Ron had been writing. He pulled out his wand and whispered, \'93}{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Crayonnaise}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94
 The end of his wand was now tipped with graphite, like a pencil. Out of one of the desk drawers he pulled a piece of very thin tissue paper, for wrapping presents, and rubbed the end of the wand over it while it sat on the blotter. The words Ron had w
ritten emerged. 
\par Harry stared. He could only make out part of it because the writing overlapped, but when Ron had been addressing the letter, he\rquote d been leaning on a different part of the blotter. In spite of this, the name of the person to whom Ron had wri
tten the letter was partially overwritten by other things and all Harry could make out was \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Care of St. Mungo\rquote s Hospital}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94

ed up the papers and threw them in the dustbin, and after that he crawled into bed and was already dozing off when Ron returned. They said goodnight to each other and put out the lights. Harry stared into the dark; something was disturbing him. He wasn
\rquote t sure what it was. Something he\rquote d seen out of the corner of his eye when he\rquote d been doing the rubbings on the blotter... 
\par When Ron was snoring loudly beside him, he crept from bed and gingerly picked up the dustbin from beside the desk, taking it into the en 
suite bath with him. He fished the crumpled papers out of it and stared at each one, at the overlapping words and phrases. Finally, he found what he was looking for, what his mind had seen earlier, very briefly... 
\par Ron was writing to someone at St. Mungo's, all right. 
\par And it wasn't his doctor.

Unfortunately, he was quite aware of how the day dawned because Hermione came tearing into his room wearing her dressing gown and nightshirt, shaking him and Ron awake and screeching hysterically. \'93Oh, god! I knew there was a reason why we shouldn
\rquote t have come a day early! I just knew it, but I forgot yesterday because of the row with your mum!\'94 she was ranting at Ron. 
\par Ron and Harry sat up groggily and rubbed their eyes. Ron smacked his lips sleepily and Harry winced when he inhaled a bit of Ron\rquote s morning breath. \'93All right, Hermione, why shouldn\rquote t we have come a day early?\'94 Ron ground out sleepily. 

\par \'93It\rquote s Boxing Day!\'94 she cried shrilly, making Harry cover his ears in pain. 
\par \'93So?\'94 he and Ron said in unison.

\par \'93Oooooh!\'94 both boys responded, understanding now. When they had been planning to stay Christmas night at Hog\rquote

\par \'93What do you mean }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Oooooh}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 she cried indignantly, her hands on her hips. \'93I\rquote

\par At that, Ron burst out laughing, holding his middle. Harry was shocked; it wasn\rquote t like Ron to mock Hermione quite this badly, especially now that they were a \'93real\'94 couple. \'93You }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 must}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  be joking,\'94 he managed to say with some difficulty, in the midst of his laughter. Hermione folded her arms across her chest and glared at him.

\par Ron put out his arms to her and said, \'93Come here,\'94
 with an affectionate tone in his voice, smiling at her. She walked to him, still looking put-out, and he pulled her down to sit on the bed beside him, his arms around her. He kissed her temple gently and said softly, \'93What is your name?\'94 
\par \'93What?\'94 she said, frowning. 
\par \'93Your name,\'94 he answered for her, \'93is Hermione Granger, the most brilliant witch I know, but a woman who }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 still}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  sometimes forgets that she }{

re staying in a house with a fireplace on the Floo network. Even Ginny and I, without licenses, can use the fire to get to Hog\rquote s End in a heartbeat, and then we can substitute our morning run for a jog to the castle from the village. There\rquote

\'94 
\par She sighed and slumped against him, then gave a small laugh. \'93I\rquote m sorry, Ron. You too, Harry. You must think I\rquote m mad. I do have an excuse, though. Maybe you\rquote ll identify, Harry...\'94 
\par \'93Why not me?\'94 Ron said, sounding a little hurt. 
\par \'93Because you\rquote ve always known you\rquote re a wizard. Harry hasn\rquote t. Anyway, the reason is--there are a lot of mornings when I wake up and fully expect to find out that the last six-and-a-half years have been a dream. The idea that I
\rquote m a witch still seems too good to be true sometimes, even with all of the things we\rquote ve been through. Maybe in twenty years that will change, but I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 still}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  don
\rquote t wake up and automatically think, \lquote I\rquote m a witch, so I can learn the geography of a place and think about it terribly hard and then just transport myself there in the blink of an eye using my wand.\rquote \'94 She grinned at Ron. \'93
I know it sounds stupid. You probably never experience that kind of madness...\'94 
\par Harry smiled ruefully. \'93I kept }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 wishing}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  I would wake up and find it was all a dream when I was in my other life. The Slytherin common r
oom, for instance, is one of the most depressing places on earth.\'94 
\par Ron nodded. \'93Yeah, I remember. It looked like Neville\rquote s toad had exploded in there, or spewed on everything. Dull green, sick green, olive green, puce, chartreuse... If there was an awful shade of green, it existed in that room.\'94 
\par \'93You were only in there once. I lived there for five-and-a-half years. Of course, I never reacted badly to it until the beginning of my sixth year. Before that, I didn\rquote t know how much nicer the Gryffindor common room was,\'94 he laughed. 
\par They were all smiling now, and Ron kissed Hermione quickly on the cheek. \'93Are you all right now? Looking forward to Boxing Day? We\rquote ll be dressed in a few minutes and then we can eat breakfast and leave for Hogsmeade. And next time--t
alk to me before you start fretting, yeah?\'94 
\par She nodded and kissed him quickly before leaving the room, a calm happiness on her face that made Harry smile. He went to his wardrobe for clothes, shaking his head. 
\par \'93You\rquote re getting very good at handling her.\'94 
\par \'93Well, last year was especially good practice for that, since you were sort of missing in action even when you were in the same room with us. She fretted over you quite a lot.\'94 
\par Harry nodded. \'93Sorry about that. And--this probably can\rquote t be said enough--I\rquote m sorry about the way I reacted to what you said at the Burrow, before sixth year--\'94 
\par Ron waved the apology away, opening some drawers and taking out a pair of old jeans. \'93I told yo
u, Harry. I was the one at fault there. I was incredibly tactless and had no business saying what I did, and it was largely self-interest. You were right to be upset.\'94 
\par \'93But even though it was tactless and said out of self-interest, you were also }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 right}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . An
d I should have seen that and ended it with Hermione instead of dragging it out and then committing my own tactless maneuver and offering her to you as a birthday present.\'94 
\par Ron grimaced while he tied his old trainers. \'93Well, I\rquote m not going to disagree with you there. That was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 very}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  bad judgment,\'94 he said simply. \'93But it\rquote

\par \'93That\rquote s true,\'94 Harry said, ready to duck, but Ron only pretended to hit him, also grinning. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Your}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  morning breath is no bed of roses, either. I could have said, before...\'94 
\par \'93No, I meant--in first year, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  were the one responsible for her running off and almost getting killed by a troll
, because you made her so upset she was crying in the bathroom. And then there was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Are you a witch or not?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  when we were dealing with the Devil\rquote

\par \'93Yeah.\'94 Ron stopped with his hand on the knob and looked thoughtful. \'93
Hermione and I talked about that last year. The crying-in-the-bathroom thing, I mean. And about third year, when I was so upset because it seemed Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers--too bad he didn\rquote t }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 really}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  eat Pettigrew, eh? She said she used
 to get very annoyed with herself whenever she reacted to my being upset with her. Over things like Crookshanks. And Krum, in fourth year. She kept telling herself that everything I said shouldn\rquote t }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 matter}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  so much to her, and she kept telling herself that it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 didn\rquote t}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  matter.\'94 
\par Harry snorted. \'93The queen of denial, she is. Was. Anyone with }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 eyes}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 could see that it mattered a great deal to her. If you said a cross word to her, she was grumpy to everyone else all day. Even getting over one-hundred ten percent from Flitwick couldn\rquote 
t cheer her up. If you said something nice to her, she was all smiles.\'94 He shook his finger at Ron. \'93You shouldn\rquote t abuse that sort of power, you know.\'94 
\par \'93Yeah, well, her revenge was going to the Yule Ball with Krum. Thank goodness balls are the exception and not the rule at Hogwarts! That night }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 she}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  had the power to make }{

\par \'93I would say you returned the favor, with your talk of \lquote fraternizing with the enemy.\rquote  Oh, and you managed to make Padma miserable while you were at it. Two-for-one.\'94 
\par \'93She didn\rquote t }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 look}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  terribly miserable when she was out there dancing with Krum. And Padma met up with a nice boy from Beauxbatons.\'94

\par He grimaced. \'93Can we not engage in any more reminiscences of what a prat I was?\'94 
\par Harry agreed. \'93Fine. I\rquote m not much better than you, frankly. I can\rquote t believe how much time I spent mooning over Cho when Ginny was right in front of me.\'94 
\par Ron made a face. \'93Let\rquote s go. Before you start telling me how wonderful my sister is. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Erg.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Harry laughed. They stopped short when they opened the door and found Hermione and Ginny waiting for them. Harry felt a rather large smile creeping across his own face upon seeing Ginny, and realiz
ed that he was the same way about her that Hermione had been about Ron. If she was cross with him, his day was ruined. One beatific smile, and the day was suddenly salvaged. He\rquote d had it bad for a while. 
\par They met Neville and Sirius in the kitchen for a quick breakfast before they went into the sitting room to use the Floo network. \'93A good rule to remember,\'94 Sirius had taught them, \'93is to only Apparate when necessary. If you don\rquote 
t need to Apparate, don\rquote t. There are always risks, and it\rquote s best to limit your use of Apparition if you can absolutely help it.\'94 
\par Glad to see that no one at Hog\rquote s End had awoken yet, they let themselves out the front door and jogged to the castle, Sirius running alongside them in his dog form. Neville brought up the rear, panting nois
ily, as the only one who was unaccustomed to early morning runs. They slowed down a bit, to be kind to him. Harry ran by Ginny\rquote 
s side; she turned and grinned at him, and he felt infused with an inner warmth. Turning his face toward the castle again, he dec
ided that for once he was looking forward to Boxing Day and working side by side with her. He could think of far worse ways to spend a day.

\par He seemed cheered by this thought and began whistling as he continued down the stairs to the school laundry, clutching the robes. Harry and Ron stood still on the steps above him, looking at each other nervously. \'93What do you reckon he meant by }{

\par They had to duck to enter the laundry, as the doorway was only four feet high. Ron had to get on his knees }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 and}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 duck once he was crawling along the floor. He scattered robes as he moved, and once they were inside the laundry proper he was bending over, trying to pick up the dropped robes and dropping more each time. Harry sighed and put out his hand, saying, \'93}
{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Accio}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 somewhat lazily. Ron\rquote s last dropped robe shot into his hand and he added it to the pile he was carrying. 
\par \'93Show-off,\'94 Ron grumbled. Harry grinned at him. 
\par \'93We can\rquote t pop around the castle like the elves. We should have }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 some}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  advantages.\'94 
\par They delivered the robes to some younger students who were overseeing the huge vats where the clothes were being washed by magically churning machi
nery. On the far side of the enormous, noisy room, Hermione, Ginny and Zoey Russell were magically sorting the clean clothes, along with some students from other houses whom Harry did not know; they then used banishing charms to return the piles of neatly
 
folded clothes to the proper dorms. There were chutes leading up to the dorms which the students never saw. Harry noted that the small door flaps were indicated by the house colors, with the appropriate year number painted on each door. There were twenty-
eight in all, four rows of seven doors each. 
\par Ron gave Hermione a kiss on the cheek when he saw her. \'93Impressive operation you\rquote re running here,\'94 he told her, as she waved her wand and sent a neatly folded pile of clothes zooming toward the small blue door with a \'933\'94 painted on it. 
\'93If you can do this with Banishing Charms, I\rquote m assuming }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 we}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  could have been using Summoning Charms to get the clothes here. Why didn\rquote

\par She raised her eyebrows at him and smirked. \'93Are you a wizard or not?\'94 she said, looking like she was trying hard not to laugh. Ron laughed instead, his blue eyes crinkling up, looking happier than Harry had seen him in a very long time. 
\par \'93I reckon I deserve that,\'94 he said, still smiling as he gathered Hermione into his arms, a hungry look in his eyes that Harry recognized. 
\par She colored, looking up at him lovingly, then hit him on the chest lightly, chiding him. \'93Why didn\rquote t you lot figure that out for yourselves? Especially you, Harry,\'94 she said, looking past Ron\rquote s arm at him and rolling her eyes. \'93

\par She gently separated herself from Ron and walked to the wall with the small doors; when her back was turned, Draco Malfoy made a rude gesture at her, to which Ron responded in kind. Hermione was oblivious to the pantomime behind her. \'93
These chutes are something new I asked Professor Dumbledore about last year,\'94 she continued. \'93Since we have to move about the castle in conventional ways, I asked him whether we could have something like this to aid us. }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Especially}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  as the school\rquote s ultimate goal should be to have a more diverse, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 paid}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 workforce, including non-elves...\'94 
\par Harry wasn\rquote t listening very closely to Hermione, however. He was gazing at Ginny, who was wearing rather close-fitting jeans and a white school blouse, open at the collar, with the sleeves rolled up. Her hair was cau
ght up in a messy ponytail, tendrils of hair clustered humidly about her face, which was a bit flushed from the warm, moist air in the laundry. He smiled at her and she went on waving her wand over the pile of clothes before her. The shirts and jumpers fo
l
ded themselves into neat rectangles, the sleeves tucked under, and they stacked themselves on the table before her. Without thinking, he strode toward her, smiling, and kissed her on the cheek, as Ron had Hermione. For a split second, she smiled, before a
 horror-struck expression took over her face, and then pure fury. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Harry Potter}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 !\'94 she cried. \'93How dare you! What do you think you\rquote re doing?\'94 She backed up and was pointing her wand at }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
him}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  now. He swallowed and looked sideways at Draco Malfoy, to see what his reaction was. Draco seemed to be glad that Ginny\rquote s wand wasn\rquote t pointing at }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him.}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  \'93I thought I made it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 very}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  clear how I feel about you!\'94 she cried, her voice shaking just a little. 
\par Her words reverberated in the cavernous room and Harry felt himself go very red. \'93I--that is, I didn\rquote t--which is to say--didn\rquote t think--\'94 he stuttered. It was true, he\rquote 
d been an idiot. His problem was that when he saw her, he felt like they were the only two people in the world. At the moment, however, they were surrounded by other students who hadn\rquote 
t gone home for the holiday, students who were shocked that Ginny Weasley was not only telling off the Head Boy, but }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Harry Potter}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . The general population at Hogw
arts had not been privy to what had occurred between her, Draco Malfoy, Harry and Mariah Kirkner, and the ones who were seeing this display now looked utterly shocked. 
\par \'93Um,\'94 Harry struggled, \'93I\rquote m sorry. Really. Not thinking,\'94 he said again. 
\par \'93I could tell!\'94 she said acidly, sneering at him. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Damn, Ginny,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 You\rquote re far too good at this. And I\rquote

\par Ron looked at him sympathetically, then pulled him away from Ginny gently but firmly, whispering to him, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 You should probably go.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94
. He opted to stay behind in the laundry, to be with Hermione. Harry and Draco left to do other chores. After they ducked through the low, elf-sized doorway again, Harry was walking rather dejectedly. He felt very 
stupid. Draco slapped him on the back, shaking his head. \'93You\rquote re lucky she didn\rquote t hex you. What were you thinking, you git?\'94 He almost sounded sympathetic. 
\par Harry shook his head. \'93Dunno.\'94 But then he had a thought, an excuse. \'93For a moment--I think I forgot where and when I was. It seemed like I was back in my other life, when we were together...\'94 
\par Draco nodded. \'93I wondered whether that was it. Your face looked kind of funny, like you weren\rquote t really }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 here}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 Harry looked at him, smiling ruefully, feeling a pa
ng because he was deceiving Draco, who was being so much like his old friend. Apart from calling him a git (which Draco had sometimes done in his other life in a friendly sort of way), he wasn\rquote 
t insulting him or accusing him of sneaking around with Ginny. Harry almost wished he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 would}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
. He thought of Sirius forbidding him to tell Draco about him and Ginny. How would he ever forge a real friendship with Draco while keeping this secret from him? 
\par After some floor-cleaning, (with more grumbling from Draco, altho
ugh they both used their wands to control the mops) they were supposed to report to the kitchens, where lunch preparations were underway. Harry found Neville overseeing younger students while they waved their wands, making food fly here and there, into co
oking pots and ovens and onto cutting boards, where knives chopped the vegetables, metal flashing. Harry steered cautiously around the unmanned cutlery, going to Neville. 
\par \'93Oi, Harry! Good. We have a problem. Our summoning charms aren\rquote t working on the root cellars. Maybe. Either something magical is down there preventing the food from coming up when we need it, or we\rquote 
ve actually run out of potatoes, carrots, turnips and onions, which seems unlikely. I think it might be a boggart. Could you check into it? I wouldn\rquote 
t trust the younger students to try to keep their heads when confronted by a boggart. These are mostly first and second years.\'94 
\par Harry smiled at him; Neville was very much in charge, confident and sure. Draco scowled at him and started to follow Harry. Neville put his hand on his chest, stopping him. \'93You stay here, Malfoy. I have some other work for you.\'94 
\par Harry tried very hard not to laugh; Neville was clearly enjoying ordering Draco Malfoy around. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Well,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought; }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that\rquote 
s what we get for not volunteering to be in charge of anything in particular. We get ordered around all day.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Draco\rquote s scowl deepened. \'93What, you think I can\rquote t handle a stupid boggart, Longbottom?\'94 
\par Neville looked at him levelly. \'93Yes,\'94 he said simply, not bothering to give any reason. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 You}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  can mash potatoes,\'94
 he said, nodding at some pots on the stove with clouds of steam over them. \'93Be careful when you drain them,\'94 he said. \'93You can get some nasty burns just from steam.\'94 A smile played around the corners of Neville\rquote s mouth. 
\par Harry fo
rced himself to appear sober again when Draco looked at him; he shrugged and gave Draco a sympathetic look before proceeding to the steep stairs leading down to the root cellars, bracing himself for the coldness inside that he knew that he would feel when
 the boggart drew near to him and sensed his fear of dementors. He remembered going down to the root cellar to do the very same thing in his other life, when his dad was teaching them to handle boggarts in Defense Against the Dark Arts. 
\par He reached the bottom of the stairs and still hadn\rquote t felt the wave of cold. Harry walked slowly, cautiously, with his wand out, then stopped and swallowed. What if it wasn\rquote t a boggart? What if it was something he\rquote 
d never encountered before? Who knew what strange things were living in the bowels of the castle? No one had suspected that a basilisk had been living in a secret chamber for a thousand years. 
\par He opened the door to the potato storage and stood back cautiously, peering into the dark. Nothing happened, so he started to close the door again; when a soft thud was heard in the depths of the room, he froze. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Get a grip, Potter,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he told himself. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Use your head.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  He whispered, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Lumos,}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 and held up his wand, sending a soft glow into the blackness. Standing on the other side of the room, flattened against the wall, surrounded by sacks of potatoes, was Ginny. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Ginny!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Am I so afraid of Ginny now that boggarts don\rquote t turn into dementors anymore, they turn into her?}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par She leaped forward and threw her arms around him; she felt warm and solid, and he didn\rquote t know what to do. He didn\rquote t feel like laughing, so how could he banish her with a cry of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Riddikulus?}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par \'93Oh, good!\'94 she said, her mouth very close to his. \'93Neville managed to get you to come down here. Isn\rquote t he a good friend? I\rquote m--I\rquote 
m so sorry about what happened in the laundry earlier, Harry. This is how I really wanted to respond--\'94 
\par And then she was pressing her lips against his, and he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that she was no boggart, but Ginny, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 his}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Ginny. He liked be
ing able to think of her that way now. He was still a little awkward, having been bracing himself for a dementor, or a boggart, at the very least, and she could tell that he wasn\rquote 
t relaxed yet and pulled her face away from his, putting her head on his shoulder and tightening her hold around his waist. \'93Poor Harry,\'94 she said, sniffing a little. \'93I didn\rquote 
t mean to embarrass you in front of everyone. I was just so surprised when you kissed me, with Draco there and all. At least I didn't have to lie,\'94 she said with a sly smile. \'93I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 did}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  make it clear how I feel about you, at Hog's End....\'94 
\par He put his finger under her chin and lifted it slightly. He brushed his lips against hers, once, twice, three times, before tentatively reaching out with his tongue and tracing 
the crease between her lips, which opened in answer to his silent question, admitting him with a soft moan that thrilled him. He was holding her tightly now, kissing her deeply as she responded, the moaning a constant now in the back of her throat. Her ha
n
ds against his back pressed him to her firmly, and he held his left hand in the small of her back, tracing her spine lightly through her blouse, while his other hand slid down and cupped her bottom tenderly, pulling her against him. She sighed into his mo
uth and squirmed against him deliciously as the hand on her bottom moved in light circles. He remembered, when he\rquote d seen her behind Hagrid\rquote s hut with Draco Malfoy on her fifteenth birthday, that she\rquote d been trying to keep Draco\rquote 
s hands away from certain parts of her body. She did nothing about his hand now. 
\par However, thinking of Draco Malfoy made him remember that he was in the kitchen with Neville, and that he was trying to be Draco\rquote 
s friend. That thought had a slightly chilling effect on him, and he pulled back from her, gazing down at her eyes, dark with passion. She looked searchingly back at him, one eyebrow raised. 
\par \'93Is everything all right, Harry? Why }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 did}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  you kiss me in the laundry, anyway?\'94 
\par He drew his lips into a line, gently pushing her hair out of her face as he spoke, then stroking the side of her face with his fingers, making her shiver. \'93I told Draco it was because I temporarily forgot where and when I was, that I thought
 I was back in my other life for a moment. He seemed to buy it. Now that I think about it, I\rquote m not so sure that\rquote s }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  what happened.\'94 
\par She kissed his chin lightly. \'93Perhaps it will prove useful after all that he knows about that now. He didn\rquote t get upset?\'94 
\par Harry shook his head. \'93No. He asked me what I was thinking and called me a git. But--maybe that\rquote s why I felt a little confused. Sometimes }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 he}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  really }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 does}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  seem like that other Draco now.\'94 He sighed. \'93I wish Sirius hadn\rquote t said he can\rquote t know about }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 us}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . If I\rquote m really going to be his friend--\'94 
\par She backed up from him and shook her head. \'93I agree with Sirius, Harry. Yes, at first I was terribly glad that you were making friends with him, in case that meant he'd be happy for us, eventually. But he's been giving me 
these strange looks lately that are a bit unnerving. Tell me, has he given you any reason to believe he\rquote d react well to being told that we\rquote re together? Has he said, \lquote 
If you and Ginny become a couple, I will be thrilled for you and promise not to hex you or find a way to deliver your head on a platter to You-Know-Who?\rquote  Because if he has, maybe we should talk to Sirius. Maybe he's wrong about Draco.\'94 
\par \'93Draco would say \lquote the Dark Lord.\rquote \'94 He sighed. \'93No, he hasn\rquote t. He said that he didn\rquote t know what he\rquote d do, that he was being honest about that. He doesn\rquote t know and he said he wouldn\rquote 
t be responsible for his actions....\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 He doesn\rquote t know}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 she repeated, shaking her head again. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Not responsible?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 That doesn\rquote t exactly sound like }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 You have my blessing.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93No, it doesn\rquote t,\'94 he agreed reluctantly. \'93Sirius is probably right,\'94 he admitted, not happy about this. He was also not at all happy about the fact that it felt like Draco was in the room with them. \'93Plus, I don\rquote 
t want Voldemort to find out what you mean to me and to--\'94 He couldn\rquote 
t say it; the idea of Voldemort getting anywhere near her was too horrid. He cupped her cheek in his hand and gazed at her dear, dear face, just as Sandy hissed at him. He sighed; he knew exactly what she meant, but he couldn\rquote t stop gazing at Ginn
y. 
\par Her voice caught, and she said softly. \'93Oh, Harry, when you look at me that way--\'94 
\par \'93Draco and Neville will be down here in about a minute,\'94 he said. \'93But first--\'94 He leaned forward and breathed warmly in her ear, nipping her earlobe between his teeth.
 Her sharp intake of breath was beautiful; he slid his lips down her neck, aching to hear more, drawing a small bit of skin into his mouth for a moment, tracing upward to her ear with his tongue again while she moved her hands to his waist once more, and 
then }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Oh, god}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , he thought, groaning, as one of her hands moved further down, cupping his bum in one of her small palms the way he had done with her earlier... 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Harry! You all right down there?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 He\rquote ll be fine, Malfoy! Get back to work!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Harry sighed; whil
e he had been kissing Ginny, he had been vaguely aware, in the back of his mind, that the creaking sound overhead was the old rusty hinges on the door leading to the stairs to the root cellars. As Sandy had announced, Draco and Neville were coming. 

\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 You\rquote re a cold bastard, you know that Longbottom? You think the whole school didn\rquote t hear about his boggart turning into a dementor, in third year? You know what those things do to him.}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Yeah, and because you knew, you and your Slytherin toadies impersonated dementors and almost killed Harry during a Quidditch match. Don\rquote t act so concerned now. Harry\rquote 
s perfectly capable of conjuring a Patronus, Malfoy. I saw him do it at the end of third year, when Lupin tested us, during our O.W.L.s, and last year, when we were repelling Lethifolds. Let him be.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par But Harry heard something in Draco\rquote s voice that bothered him. Why was he so determined to come down? Was it really that he wanted to make sure Harry was all right? 
\par Harry backed up from Ginny and pulled out his wand. Pointing it at the sacks of potatoes, he cried, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Expecto Patronem!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94
 with his face turned toward the door, to project his voice into the corridor. 
\par He wasn\rquote t very focused, so only a small wisp of a stag flew from his wand-tip. He followed that by crying very loudly, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Riddikulus!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Ginny quickly grabbed a stick of wood in the corner and tried to snap it, but it was too thick for her. Harry took it and lifted his leg, then snapped it across his thigh, producing a loud }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 crack!}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  not unlike the sound of a boggart bei
ng banished. He quickly pulled Ginny to him and kissed her on the mouth once more before stepping into the corridor again and slamming the door shut, only to find himself face to face with Draco Malfoy. 
\par Harry couldn\rquote t tell what to make of the expression on Draco\rquote s face. Was it concern? Suspicion? Neville stood at the bottom of the stairs, red-faced and panting. \'93I tried to keep him away, Harry, but he wouldn\rquote t listen.\'94
 Neville looked quite frightened, as though he had made an unforgivable blunder. 
\par Harry shook his head. \'93Don\rquote t worry about me, either one of you. Your potatoes should come when summoned now, Neville. Never fear.\'94 
\par Neville snorted. \'93Easy for you to say. Your boggarts don\rquote t turn into Snape.\'94 
\par Harry smiled at him. \'93Actually, I\rquote ll bet yours don\rquote t anymore, either. You shouldn\rquote t be afraid of Snape, Neville. He\rquote s all right. I\rquote m just glad we got him back, after last year.\'94 
\par Neville shrugged. \'93I reckon you\rquote re right. It\rquote s probably more likely now that my boggart would turn into Pa--\'94 He stopped and colored, looking in Draco Malfoy\rquote s direction. 
\par \'93Oh, come on, Longbottom. Don\rquote t stop now. You\rquote d deprive me of knowing what your greatest fear in the world is, now that it\rquote s not my head-of-house? Not very sporting of you, is that?\'94 
\par Neville didn\rquote t look young and wide-eyed anymore; he smirked at Draco. \'93And what would }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 your}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  boggart turn into, Malfoy?\'94 
\par Harry thought back to the boggart lesson in his other life. What }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 had}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Draco\rquote s boggart turned into? When he remembered, he laughed, holding his middle. Neville and Drac
o stared at him. \'93What\rquote s wrong with you?\'94 Draco drawled. 
\par \'93I know what your boggart would turn into!\'94 he crowed, unable to stop his laughter. Draco Malfoy glared at him with his arms crossed. 
\par \'93Oh, you }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 do}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , do you?\'94 
\par Harry nodded and smiled, then whispered to him, so Neville wouldn\rquote t hear, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 A cat.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Draco backed up from him, swallowing. \'93Yeah, well, plenty of people are--I mean, I\rquote m not the only one in the world who--\'94 
\par Harry laughed. \'93That\rquote s all right. Let\rquote s go back upstairs.\'94 
\par He led the pair of them away from the potato storage, while Neville bounced on the balls of his feet and begged, \'93Oh, come on, Harry! Tell me what he\rquote s afraid of--\'94 
\par \'93Never mind,\'94 Harry said; he whispered to Draco again, saying, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Don\rquote t worry; I won\rquote t tell him.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Draco Malfoy frowned a little, as though Harry was a puzzle he hadn\rquote t yet figured out. \'93Good,\'94 he said, not sounding completely convinced. \'93Glad to hear it.\'94 
\par Nonetheless, Neville continued to beg until they were back in the kitchens and 
after that, they were all too busy to do anything but prepare lunch for the elves and the students and staff who had stayed at the school. He suggested to Draco that they take some tea up to Mrs. Figg, in the staff wing (so that poor Ginny could emerge fr
om the root cellar and eat some lunch). Draco glared at Neville for a moment as they left the kitchen.

. She needs a woman around, someone who knows about childbirth and babies. Where is the mother-to-be of my grandchildren? We have so many plans to make! Is she upstairs?\'94 George no
dded, his hand at his throat. She turned her head and finally spotted her youngest children, along with Harry, Hermione, Neville and Sirius. \'93Oh, hello, you lot. Had a good day? Can\rquote t talk now; too much to do.\'94 She turned to George. \'93
This will be thirsty work. Make yourself useful and bring us a pot of tea. And the knitting! I\rquote ve so much knitting to do!\'94
 She shook her head over the extent of the preparations that would be required before Angelina gave birth. Gathering her robes in her hands, she began to cl
imb the stairs. Harry and Ron looked at each other quizzically; Harry noticed that Hermione and Ginny looked rather smug. 
\par \'93I didn\rquote t think it would take long for her to come around,\'94 Hermione said quietly, watching Mrs. Weasley go. 
\par \'93That\rquote s Mum,\'94 Ginny said, nodding. \'93Now that all of us are out of the house, for the most part, since Ron and I are practically never home, she\rquote s been a bit at loose ends. This will give her plenty to do. If there\rquote 
s one thing Mum can\rquote t resist, it\rquote s babies.\'94 
\par Ron rolled his eyes. \'93As if they couldn\rquote t have worked }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  out, Ginny,\'94 he said, nodding at the others. \'93No, she had nine kids because she really didn\rquote t }

\par George slapped Ron on the back. \'93Yeah, well, after Fred and I it\rquote s amazing she ever had more,\'94 he said, grinning. 
\par Ron did not grin back at him, however. \'93I know I defended you yesterday, but you might have told Mum about this sooner and not ruined the holiday for everyone. What were you thinking?\'94 
\par George looked a little sheepish and shrugged. \'93I reckon we knew that Mum would react that way at first, and were putting it off as long as possible. We also knew she\rquote d come around pretty quickly.\'94 
\par \'93Still,\'94 Ron said, looking like he wanted to hit George, just for a moment. \'93You do realize now that she\rquote ll be underfoot every moment of the rest of the time Angelina\rquote s expecting? And even more after the kids are born?\'94 
\par Fred put his hand on George\rquote s shoulder and grinned. \'93I don\rquote t think George was afraid of the row. I think he was afraid of the peace treaty after. He knew there\rquote d be no keeping Mum away once she knew she was going to be a granny. }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 That\rquote s}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  what he was putting off, if you ask me.\'94 
\par \'93Geroff, you,\'94 George grumbled, although he was smiling at his twin a little. \'93You\rquote re also going to have to live with Mum over here morning, noon and night.\'94 
\par Fred shrugged. \'93Yeah, but she won\rquote t be paying any attention to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , will she? Angelina\rquote s going to be taking the brunt of it.\'94 
\par Ron poked George in the ribs to get his attention. \'93How about Bill and Maggie? Has everyone made up again? Or do we all continue walking on eggshells?\'94 
\par George shrugged. \'93I think we\rquote re all okay. Except for Percy. Somehow--he hasn\rquote t forgiven Mum. I\rquote ve never seen those two on the outs before. Very weird. I hope they settle it soon. He was the first one to
 see her arrive and went storming out of here. I think he\rquote s in the office now,\'94 George said, meaning the large dining room which was no longer used for dining but as the center of operations for Weasley Wizard Wheezes, Limited. \'93I can\rquote 
t take being her golden boy,\'94 he added, shaking his head. \'93You know--the first one to pop out kids. With Angelina\rquote s help, of course,\'94 he said quickly, seeing Hermione\rquote s expression of indignation. \'93That\rquote 
s supposed to be Percy\rquote s job: being Mum\rquote s pet. Too much scrutiny for me, thanks. I wish he\rquote d just apologize to her already.\'94 
\par \'93I should apologize to her as well,\'94 Hermione said, looking a little pink. \'93I probably overreacted,\'94 she added softly. 
\par Ron put his arm around her shoulder. \'93You and Percy are a right pair. What do you think }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 she}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  did? Write her a nice letter. You\rquote ll be fine. Anyway, I\rquote 
m knackered and can\rquote t think about this anymore. We\rquote re going back to Ascog,\'94 he told the twins, \'93and we\rquote ll see you at the match tomorrow.\'94 
\par Fred and George nodded. \'93Right!\'94 Should be a good one!\'94 Fred said. \'93But--George isn\rquote t going,\'94 he said, looking at his twin wistfully. It seemed so strange to Harry that the twins\rquote  lives were diverging this way. 
\par \'93Keeping Angelina company,\'94 George explained shortly. \'93Or rather, since she can\rquote t go, I\rquote m not going to be able to lord it over her if }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  don\rquote 
t go. Madam Pomfrey said she\rquote d probably spew all over if she went spinning through the Floo network, as her stomach has been very delicate all through this and Pomfrey was very cross with her for }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 losing}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  weight about a month ago, because so little of what she ate stayed inside her. Broomsticks are out of the question, and so\rquote s Apparition. I think even a Portkey would jostle her about too much, so she\rquote 
s not going anywhere. I keep thinking we need to coax Dad\rquote s old car out of the forest, see if it\rquote s still working. That would have been just the thing for this.\'94 
\par Hermione glared, her hands on her hips. \'93It\rquote s }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 only}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  completely illegal.\'94 
\par George shrugged. \'93If I was caught I could throw myself on the mercy of the court.\'94 He put his right hand over his heart and affected a melodramatic air. \lquote }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

 He put the back of his other hand to his brow and closed his eyes as they all laughed. 
\par \'93And our mum knows just how thankless that is, eh?\'94 Ginny said through her laughter. 
\par \'93Sorry you aren\rquote t playing in the European Cup final, Harry,\'94 Fred said when they had sobered a little. 
\par Harry brushed away the comment. \'93That\rquote s all right. I get to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 see}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  the final, at least. I\rquote ve been looking forward to it. Thanks for the ticket.\'94 
\par \'93And thanks for the ticket for me, as well!\'94 Neville added. \'93I never thought I\rquote d get to see the European Cup before finishing school. And I reckon that even after I\rquote 
m out of school my gran will have things to say about what I do in my spare time.\'94 
\par They laughed sympathetically, and George said to Neville, \'93You know, I think I\rquote ll take our mum over your gran anytime. No offense.\'94 
\par Neville shrugged, smiling. \'93None taken.\'94 
\par The twins saw them off, waving as each one stepped into the green flames and said, \'93Ascog Castle!\'94 very clearly, to prevent any Floo mishaps. Harry stumbled
 out of the fire in the sitting room at Ascog and quickly moved out of the way for Sirius, who was coming last. Callisto and Walter Black were there waiting for them all to return, but since they\rquote 
d had their tea at Hogwarts, they were going directly to bed. It had been a long day and they didn\rquote t know how much time the match would take. It was to start at nine o\rquote 
clock in the morning, but Harry knew there was a chance it could last for several days. He hoped that wouldn\rquote t happen, though, as he was hoping to have }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 some}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 time alone with Ginny before they went to Sweden for the broom race--without her--on New Year\rquote s Eve. 
\par They said goodnight to Neville and Sirius, and when the four of them had reached the top floor, Ron pulled Hermione into Harry\rquote s room, saying \'93We\rquote re just going to say goodnight for a moment. The pair of you can do that, also, but }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 stay on the landing.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Ron slammed the door; Harry frowned at it. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Stay on the landing.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Who did he think he was? But he didn\rquote t have time to ponder this as Ginny was pulling
 him to her, and he had no thought for anything but holding her, kissing her, listening to the sweet gurgling sound in the back of her throat as she wrapped herself around him and he held her trembling body in his arms.... He pulled back from her for a mo
ment and said against her mouth, \'93I love you so much Ginny. So much....\'94 
\par He held her face in his hands and kissed her cheeks and brow, while she answered, \'93I love you, Harry...\'94 
\par They heard a throat being cleared ostentatiously and looked up in surprise, finding Ron and Hermione standing in the doorway of Harry\rquote 
s room, Ron holding his fist before his mouth to assist him in his mock-coughing. Harry stepped away from Ginny, then turned to Ron with his eyebrows raised. \'93As commanded,\'94 he said somewhat snidely, \'93we stayed on the landing.\'94 
\par He walked past Ron and Hermione and into his room without looking at them, wishing he didn\rquote t have to be apart from Ginny for a single moment, but resigning himself to another night with Ron, whose werewolf hearing made any sne
aking about after bedtime completely prohibitive. It was very nearly as annoying as Draco Malfoy having one of the basilisk amulets. He sighed as he brushed his teeth and changed his clothes. Oh, well. At least Neville helped them sneak around a little, a
lthough Harry wasn\rquote t keen on going back to the root cellar. He could think of far nicer places to be alone with Ginny. Somehow, when he pictured being with her, sacks of potatoes had never been part of his fantasy.

manian Seeker and had wangled permission for Ginny and Ron to take the Floo network to a fireplace in the office being used for the Romanian team at the castle. A Portkey for Ginny and Ron was out of the question, as the nearest one was leaving before daw
n from Wemyss Bay, well before the first ferry arrived there from the island. Harry, Hermione, Neville and Sirius were Apparating. 
\par When Harry could feel his body again, he saw that he had successfully arrived in the small copse of trees near the castle tha
t had been his goal; it was the designated Apparating area, heavily guarded by Aurors. Harry was surprised to see Katie there. It was odd to see her working at her new job when he was there for fun. She regarded him impassively in front of her colleagues,
 but winked at him surreptitiously after he had passed, flashing him a smile and whispering to him, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Enjoy the match. I didn\rquote t expect to be working today--last minute thing, you know. With luck I\rquote 
ll get to see some of it.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94. 
\par Once they had passed through security, they were able to show their tickets at the gate and enter. On the way up to their seats, they bought small flags and programs. They\rquote 
d brought both wizarding and Muggle money, not knowing which would be accepted, and ended up paying in pound notes. Harry\rquote s nostrils flared; there was a very strong odor in the castle that he couldn\rquote 
t place; it seemed to be everywhere, and he wondered whether Ron was bothered by it, with his acute sense of smell. Harry also noticed a lot of people standing about having talking while holding wands that were abnormally fat and sharp. 
\par After making their purchases, they continued climbing upward and quickly found Ginny and Ron, already in their seats in the stands on top of the castle wall, behind the parapets. Fred and Charlie were there as well, with Percy (who wasn\rquote 
t working, evidently), Alicia, Bill, Oliver Wood and Oliver\rquote s older brother, Alex, to whom Harry and the others were introduced. The odd smell did not dissipate once he was up in the fresh air again. 
\par Harry for
got about this, though, as he looked around the pitch excitedly; he now knew what it was like to play two matches on this pitch, and he waved to Jean-Claude Jones as the French Seeker flew about, getting in some practice. Jones grinned back at Harry, evid
ently bearing no grudge, and Harry waved his small French tri-color enthusiastically. He bore no grudge either--not toward Jones, at any rate. 
\par Charlie, on the other hand, was flicking back and forth a small }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Romanian}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  tri-color (blue, yellow and red instead of the French blue, white and red) and waving to the Seeker on }
{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  team. He explained to Harry that he knew her from his work with dragons. Her name was Natasha Lemnaru; her parents were both dragon-handlers and she\rquote 
d grown up on the reservation in Romania. Now she was following in her parents\rquote  footsteps--when she wasn\rquote t playing Quidditch. 
\par \'93Bloody brilliant flyer,\'94 Charlie enthused. \'93After I told her about your maneuver with that Horntail, she\rquote s insisted there\rquote s no better way to control dragons than from 
a broomstick. You may have revolutionized dragon handling, Harry,\'94 he grinned at him. Harry looked at the Seeker. She had flashing black eyes and long raven hair she\rquote 
d pulled back into a ponytail that whipped around like a heavy rope as she flew. Her nose 
had a little bump on the bridge, and for a moment Harry wondered how closely related to Bulgarians Romanians were; she seemed almost like she could be a sister of Viktor Krum. She winked cheekily at Charlie; Harry wondered just how good a friend she was. 

\par The roar of the crowd increased as Ludo Bagman appeared in the top box and cast the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Sonorus}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 spell to amplify his voice. He welcomed them all to the European Cup Final for 1997 and introduced the two teams. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I give you Antonescu, Bratiano, Lazar, Lemnaru, Negrea, Radescu and Valsan!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94
 he cried, as the Romanian team zoomed down the pitch to raucous cheers from their supporters, including Charlie. Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Percy also had Romanian flags and were cheering the Romanians, who wore vivid blue jersey
s and trousers with red robes bearing the Romanian coat of arms: a large golden eagle holding a sword and scepter in its claws, a cross in its mouth, and a shield with too many small things on it for Harry to make out while they were traveling so fast. He
 pulled out his program and looked at it there instead. 
\par Then Ludo Bagman was announcing the French team. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Devereux, DuFresne, Fourcade, Jones, Laroche, Laroche and Pierpont!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par As the French team took their turn showing off, Harry leaned behind Hermione and said to Ron, \'93Laroche }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 and}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Laroche?\'94 
\par Hermione shoved her program in front of him. \'93It says here that they\rquote re married. Clarice and Thierry Laroche. And they\rquote re both Chasers.\'94 
\par Harry nodded without looking. He turned to Ginny and gave her a small smile, hoping this would be considered subtle enough that Sirius wouldn\rquote 
t shout at him later. Ginny gave him a small smile in return and then turned her head away, reddening slightly. He picked up his Omnioculars (he\rquote 
d taken the precaution of finally erasing the footage of Draco and Mariah), recording the match so that George and Angelina could see it later. 
\par It was time for the mascots now, and France was going first this time. Harry had to laugh. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 They were garden gnomes!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 Then something else appeared on the pitch and Harry stopped laughing, as did everyone else present. There were two large ogres standing at each end of the pitch, one in front of each center goal. Some nervous-looking wiz
ards were fastening chains to the bottom of the goal posts; each chain led to a large metal collar around each ogre\rquote s neck. And then the gnomes were actually running up to the ogres of their own accord and the ogres were }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 hurling}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  the small creatures the len
gth of the field, where the opposite ogre had to catch them. Harry laughed in spite of himself, still feeling a little nervous about the ogres. The gnomes actually seemed to enjoy it (they pulled very silly faces and did a lot of posing as they were flyin
g through the air). Even Hermione, whom he would have expected to be outraged over this treatment of the gnomes (she was never very keen on the way they de-gnomed the garden at the Burrow) found it amusing enough to laugh. 
\par \'93Why, they\rquote re like little acrobats!\'94 she exclaimed appreciatively, watching a gnome cleave the air, intentionally flipping over and twisting around as he hurtled toward the other ogre. \'93
But I do hope they keep those ogres in check. They eat babies, you know.\'94 
\par Ron was holding his sides, laughing, watching the flying gnomes. \'93No wonder they don\rquote t seem to mind when we fling them over the privet, and come back for more!\'94 he grinned. \'93Should have realized they }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 enjoyed}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  it, the little buggers! And it figures that things as annoying as gnomes would come from France...\'94 
\par \'93Ron!\'94 Hermione exclaimed, scandalized. \'93I\rquote m surprised at you! That\rquote s very xenophobic. Gnomes have been here for quite some time now. They came over on ships with the Normans...\'94 
\par Harry squinted at her. \'93Are you telling me that garden gnomes came to Britain with William the Conqueror?\'94 
\par She sniffed. \'93If you two wouldn\rquote t treat History of Magic as }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 naptime}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ...\'94 
\par Harry and Ron grinned at each other over her head. \'93But those desks are so }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 comfortable}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , Hermione,\'94 Ron said by way of explanat
ion, putting his arm around her and squeezing gently. In spite of herself, she smiled back at him. The gnomes were standing around the pitch now, taking their bows to thunderous applause, while the ogres were being led away again by their handlers. 

\par The Ro
manian mascots were far more sinister than gnome-throwing-ogres, however. After the gnomes trooped off, a number of people in the stands started pulling out massive necklaces of garlic and sharp wooden stakes. Harry was now able to place the odd odor he
\rquote d detected upon entering the castle, and he realized that the fat, sharp wands weren\rquote t wands at all. The other spectators seemed to know what was going to happen and had come prepared--but for what? However, after a moment\rquote 
s thought, Harry realized what sort of creatures were probably serving as the Romanian mascots. Sirius was sitting behind him and he turned to his godfather with concern. 
\par \'93They wouldn\rquote t--would they? But--it\rquote s daytime.\'94 
\par Sirius looked up. It was a flat white winter sky, with solid cloudcover stretching from horizon to horizon. \'93
No direct sunlight today, Harry, as during most of the winter this far north. You should probably at least pull out your wand, just to be on the safe side.\'94 
\par Harry did this just as a Romanian official, covered, it see
med, in heads of garlic, tentatively approached a large wooden box sitting in the middle of the pitch and unlatched it, stepping back quickly with his wand drawn. The top of the hinged box was flung back violently as a flock of pitch-black bats emerged, m
oving as one being, spreading out and forming the image of a larger bat, which then rose high above the pitch and swooped over the crowd. Harry was strongly reminded of his stepfather\rquote s Patronus, which had saved him from the dementor\rquote 
s kiss in the courtroom. While this made him miss Snape momentarily, he was also glad he had not come to the match; the presence of so many people wearing garlic would probably have sent him into a fit. 
\par The large bat that was composed of so many smaller bats broke up then and the individual bats flew, still in formation, over the crowd on the upper deck. People ducked and waved their garlic or stakes in the air. Harry wasn\rquote 
t sure why, now that he saw that they were just bats. He started to heave a sigh of relief, realizing that the Romanians hadn\rquote t actually brought vampires as their mascots-- 
\par Hermione let out a chilling screech when, suddenly, a bat that had alit on the stone barrier before them transformed into a rather sinister-looking man who bore more than a passing resembla
nce to a young Tom Riddle. Harry knew it was stupid, but he had been expecting the first vampire he saw in person to resemble Snape, and was surprised to be confronted with what looked like a handsome, healthy (if rather pale) twenty-year-old man with a r
ed glint in his dark eyes and a large, sharp, toothy smile as he surveyed Hermione\rquote s bare neck before him. Ginny gripped Harry\rquote s arm painfully, shaking violently. \'93He--he looks like--\'94 she whispered, and Harry knew just who she meant. 

\par Hermione had the presence of mind to pull out her wand, but Ron had already leaped between her and the vampire; as he was a dark creature, the vampire couldn\rquote t harm him. \'93Don\rquote t you come near her, if you know what\rquote s good for you!
\'94 Ron snarled at the young-looking vampire, holding his wand out. 
\par To their surprise, the vampire smiled broadly, his sharp fangs overlapping his blood-red lips. \'93I thought I saw quite a bit of red hair in this area,\'94 he said, looking at Ron, Ginny, Percy, Bill and Fred. \'93You must be Weasleys!\'94 he cried 
cheerfully, without a trace of a Romanian accent. In fact, Harry thought he sounded American. Ron\rquote s brow furrowed. 
\par \'93What the--\'94 
\par But the vampire had found the person he was looking for. \'93Charlie? Charlie Weasley! How are you?\'94 
\par Charlie came forward now and, to the consternation of everyone nearby, hugged the vampire, grinning and laughing. The vampire kissed him twice on each cheek and Charlie did the same to him. Beside him, Harry saw that Ginny was open-mouthed with shock. 

\par \'93Dimitry! How fantastic to see you! I didn\rquote t know you were working for the team now.\'94 
\par \'93Yeah, well, when someone\rquote s promising me a steady supply of food with no chance of angry villagers coming after me, I\rquote m not going to say no, am I?\'94 Dimitry said, laughing. 
\par \'93Maybe you can visit after the match?\'94 
\par Harry saw Fred\rquote s eyes widen, and Alicia, who was sitting between him and Sirius, seemed to pull both men a little closer to her, shrinking down in her seat. 
\par \'93We\rquote ll see. We might be a bit busy celebrating, after our win and all--\'94 
\par Charlie laughed. \'93I certainly hope so. I have a significant amount of money invested in Romania winning.\'94 
\par Dimitry turned and saw that the formation flying was continuing. \'93Well, got to go. Time to show off some more.\'94 
\par He turned and leaped over the edge of the para
pet, and the crowd sent up a collective gasp before he transformed back into a bat in mid-air, swooping low over the pitch and then rejoining his fellows as they zoomed overhead and around the pitch one last time, finally transforming into their human sha
pes again, standing around the pitch, bowing to the appreciative applause (although no one removed their garlic necklaces yet and stakes were still prominent). 
\par Up in the stands, Harry and the others all stared at Charlie, who shrugged casually. \'93I met a lot of people in Romania. Lived there for years. What do you expect? You\rquote 
d never know he was a day over two-hundred, would you? He lived in America for a long time. Only just came back home about ten years ago.\'94 Charlie shook his head. \'93Dimitry always was a ham. He\rquote 
d have gone to California to try to be in films, but it was too sunny.\'94 
\par \'93And, er, wouldn\rquote t they have noticed his fangs?\'94 Harry asked nervously. 
\par \'93Oh, he can retract those. Dimitry\rquote s a good bloke. Likes dragons--but he hates dragon\rquote 
s blood. We had a good laugh about that. When I worked on the reservation, Mum and Dad sent me sweets, including Chocolate Frogs, and I had a Dumbledore card, you know, the one that says he discovered the twelve uses of dragons\rquote 
 blood. Dimitry likes to say, \lquote And not one of the twelve is }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 food}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 !\rquote  He calls it \lquote trying to drink rendered bacon fat.\rquote \'94 
\par Harry shuddered at the thought and tried to put dragon\rquote s blood, vampires, his own blood and especially drinking rendered bacon fat far from his mind. He\rquote d been feeling so distracted that he didn\rquote 
t even notice the match start; suddenly the fourteen players were zipping over the field, and Harry\rquote s pulse started racing as he remembered being out there with his own team, zigging and zagging in and out amongst the other pl
ayers. His stomach leaped about excitedly as he watched their acrobatics, the Chasers tossing the Quaffle back and forth, and Beaters hitting the Bludgers at players on the opposite team, while the Keepers watched everything with a tense alertness and the
 Seekers hovered at the edges of the action, ever watchful for that glimpse of gold. 
\par \'93Sirius! Move!\'94 Harry cried, ducking suddenly. He also pushed down Hermione and Ginny, sitting on either side of him. However, the reason for this, a Bludger that had been
 hurtling directly toward him, was quickly handled by a Romanian Beater hitting the Bludger very hard at a French Chaser. 
\par \'93Ooh!\'94 Bagman cried. \'93Radescu tries and fails to wing Thierry Laroche. And now Devereux tries to send the same Bludger at Lemnaru, who dodges it handily,\'94 he added as a French Beater hit the Bludger with a hard blow, sending it at Charlie
\rquote s friend Natasha, who moved out of the way easily. Bagman made no mention of the Bludger having been zooming straight at Harry Potter. 
\par Harry sat up, looking sheepishly at Hermione and Ginny, who frowned at him. Ron, however, was laughing. 
\par \'93What\rquote s wrong, Harry, having flashbacks to our match? The Bludger that tried to take your head off?\'94 
\par Harry grimaced at him. \'93Yeah. Something like that.\'94 He could ha
ve sworn that the heavy cannonball-like Bludger was heading right for him. But now both Bludgers were far away, being hit back and forth by the four Beaters at the far end of the pitch. He tried to take deep breaths; it felt like his heart was racing stil
l, and he swallowed, trying to enjoy the game, but when he opened his mouth to cheer with everyone else (Romania had scored) nothing came out but a small croak. 
\par The game continued, a fast and furious display of Quidditch prowess. Harry could see that even had the Welsh team won over France, they wouldn\rquote t have had a prayer against Romania. He admired Natasha Lemnaru\rquote 
s agility, dodging Bludgers and other players, and thought that Jean-Claude Jones might not be celebrating a win on this day. The score was eigh
ty to twenty in favor of Romania when suddenly the Snitch was seen flitting about the middle of the field, near the ground. Harry\rquote 
s heart and mind raced as he watched it zip around the players, Lemnaru and Jones ducking and weaving, trying to reach it. 
\par A Romanian Beater hit a Bludger toward Jones. Harry wouldn\rquote t have believed it if he hadn\rquote t been watching it through the Omnioculars, but the ball swerved in mid-air, making an impossible turn that sent it hurtling directly toward }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  again. He looked up, not using the Omnioculars; it was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 still}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 heading toward him. Everyone else was looking to the left, where Lemnaru was inching toward the Snitch, slightly ahead of Jones. Harry waited for a Beater to hit it, but that didn\rquote t happen this time. Almost too late, Ha
rry pulled Ginny and Hermione down again and screamed for Sirius to move. Luckily, he did; the Bludger went crashing into the stands, sending wood splinters flying and halting the game. It hit exactly where Harry\rquote s head and Sirius\rquote 
 shins would have been if they hadn\rquote t moved, going clean through the stands and continuing, moving away from the castle. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Bumphing!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Bagman cried, his amplified voice hurting Harry\rquote s head. \'93And a foul against Romania! Negrea has hit a Bludger into the stands--\'94 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Except he hadn\rquote t,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry thought wildly. He\rquote d }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 seen}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, very clearly, the ball change direction. It was hurtling at Jones and then abruptly }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 turned}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . 
\par \'93You ruddy ponces!\'94 Charlie was screaming, having leapt to his feet and shaking his fist at the Romanians. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Budos olah!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 he said, 
switching languages. Harry had no idea what he meant, but he assumed that if you were Romanian, you wouldn\rquote t let your grandmother hear you say that. \'93Don\rquote t you see the bloody Romanian flags?\'94
 he cried now, waving his own small example indignantly. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 And Adrienne Fourcade will take the foul for France!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 Bagman declaimed. The French Chaser moved into position near the Romanian goal. The Snitch had disappeared. 
\par \'93But he didn\rquote t do it!\'94 Harry cried feebly, his voice catching in his throat. He picked himself up and helped Hermione and Ginny stand. \'93Negrea hit the Bludger toward Jones,\'94 he said to the girls and Ron, just as he heard a small }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 pop!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  nearby. \'93It turned and headed for }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  after that. Didn\rquote t }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 anyone}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  else see?\'94 
\par \'93I did,\'94 Katie said, breathlessly; she was the \lquote pop\rquote  he\rquote d heard. She had Apparated directly to the top of the stands. \'93
I was on my way up, but I stopped and looked through one of the openings down below, and I saw it, so I didn\rquote t bother with climbing the rest of the stairs,\'94 she explained. \'93Fred,\'94 she said urgently, \'93do you have some Weasleys\rquote 
 Whacky Whompers with you? I have a feeling that Bludger will be back.\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Uca Lazar blocks the foul shot by Fourcade!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 Play resumed, both teams zipping around the field again. 
\par \'93I have some,\'94 Percy said quickly in
 answer to Katie, producing a drawstring bag from his robes and taking out some small sweets wrapped in paper with rainbow-patterned lettering. Despite the fact that Percy was running the family business, this seemed odd to Harry. He didn\rquote 
t normally think of Percy as the sort of person to carry sweets with him. 
\par Percy began passing them round and Sirius, Neville, Fred, Bill and Katie immediately unwrapped them and started chewing vigorously. Harry looked at the thing Percy had put in his hand; according to 
the wrapper, it was gum. This being a Weasley Wizard Wheezes product, he was also hesitant to learn of its side-effects the hard way, as Dudley had with the Ton-Tongue Toffee. 
\par \'93I\rquote m really not that keen on gum, thanks,\'94 he said, trying to hand it back. 
\par \'93Harry!\'94 Percy said imperiously, reminding him strongly of when he\rquote d been Head Boy during Harry\rquote s third year. \'93Chew and swallow it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 now}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
! That goes for all of you!\'94 he barked at Ron and the girls. \'93Can\rquote t be too careful!\'94 
\par Ginny and Hermione hurriedly opened their wrappers and popped the gum into their mouths; Ron did too, less urgently, but Harry still resisted. \'93Swallowing gum isn\rquote t good for you. Dudley did once, and--\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Just do it!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 Sirius screamed at him now, alarming him. After an outburst like that from S
irius, Harry swiftly put the gum in his mouth and chewed as quickly as he could, swallowing with great difficulty. The gum tasted like sand, as far as he could tell, and settled in his stomach like a piece of lead. Then he saw something out of the corner 
of his eye, and when he looked, it was the Bludger, soaring back toward the castle. 
\par Directly at }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . 
\par \'93Duck, Harry!\'94 Hermione and Ginny both screamed, also seeing it. 
\par \'93No!\'94 Percy objected. \'93It should be all right now. You did swallow, Harry?\'94 he asked urgently, referring to the leaden Weasleys\rquote 
 Whacky Whomper now sitting in his rather uncomfortable stomach. The Bludger was zeroing in on him. He nodded at Percy, sweat running down his face. \'93Let it hit you, Harry. Or else the spell on the Bludger won\rquote t be b
roken. If you swallowed, you should be all right.\'94 
\par Harry felt strange all over. He wasn\rquote t numb, exactly, but he didn\rquote t feel like he could sense the presence of his limbs and his very }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 skin}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 in quite the same way he was used to. He felt as though he were encased in some sort of protective sheath, like a knight\rquote 
s armor, only stronger, and invisible. He faced down the oncoming Bludger, bracing himself for the impact, hoping Percy was right. He knew he would be in big trouble if he was wrong. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Oof}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 !\'94 Harry was u
nable to stop himself from grunting when the Bludger struck him. It had taken all of the bravery and willpower he could muster to remain immobile and let the Bludger come right for him, as Percy had instructed. Knowing that Percy was an Auror now helped; 
he wasn\rquote 
t sure he would have followed such an order previously. It struck him in the stomach and propelled him backward against the stone barrier. He hit the parapet hard enough that he heard some dislodged bits of stone and mortar fall down toward the pitc
h, bouncing against the wall on the way to the grass. 
\par Ginny, Hermione and Alicia screamed when it made impact, and Ron leapt forward to grab his arm, to keep him from toppling over the parapet. Harry panted and hugged the metal ball to him, which, oddly, 
felt like the fight had gone out of it. It no longer struggled against him and was strangely inert for a Bludger. He also didn\rquote 
t seem to have any broken ribs, or even a pain in his stomach. He looked quizzically at Percy, who was standing next to him now. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 What kind of gum was that?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 he wondered. Katie was on his other side, with Ron and Fred. Sirius was motioning to them to follow him, before Bagman and the other officials bearing down on them arrived. 
\par Harry looked at Neville, Hermione and Ginny over his shoulder, shrugging. (They were following.) Percy was right, but }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 why}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , and }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 how}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? 
\par Charlie stayed behind with Bill, Alicia, and Oliver and Alex Wood; Harry could hear Bill trying to keep B
agman, Cornelius Fudge and the French and Romanian Ministers of Magic away. Charlie was speaking to the Romanian Minister in his own language, very fast, without pausing between words, as far as Harry could tell. As he left, he could see out of the corner
 of his eye that Bagman and Fudge were fuming. 
\par Katie and Percy hustled him down some stairs and into a bathroom labeled \'93Wizards;\'94 Sirius had run ahead and now stood with the door open, waiting for them. As soon as they were inside, along with Ron, Fred, N
eville and the girls, he used a charm to lock the door. Harry was still trying to get his breath. He was also still clutching the Bludger, which he handed to Ron now. Ron looked at it quizzically, tossing it back and forth from hand to hand and shrugging.
 Watching him do that, Harry wondered whether it wasn\rquote t a legal Bludger; surely it was too light to do him damage, and that\rquote s why he was all right? 
\par Ron seemed to think that was a possibility too, for after shrugging over the mystery of the Bludger, he toss
ed it casually toward one of the sinks. It promptly crashed violently into the edge of the porcelain sink, making everyone in the room jump. A large chunk of the sink broke away and dropped noisily to the tiles, along with the Bludger itself, which landed
 with a loud ringing noise before rolling lifelessly into the drain in the middle of the floor. Clearly it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 a regulation Bludger. Harry had forgotten that to Ron it would weigh relatively little. Neville stared at it with large, round eyes and Harry swallowed, surveying the damaged sink. He turned to Percy. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 What}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  did you give me?\'94 
\par \'93What?\'94 Percy said softly with a sly smile, his eyes glittering behind his spectacles. \'93You really thought we were just running a business producing silly sweets?\'94 He looked ar
ound, at his youngest brother and sister, at Hermione, Fred, Neville and Sirius. Harry also thought that he looked rather fondly at Katie, who looked back at Percy proudly. \'93Nothing I say leaves this room,\'94 he said with authority. \'93
Sirius and Katie know already, as they\rquote ve had occasion to use our products. Fred, of course, is one of our two masterminds, although we\rquote ve also had some assistance from Snape and his uncle. Professor Sprout and Neville,\'94
 he said, smiling at Neville unexpectedly, \'93know what we\rquote re up to because they\rquote 
ve been making sure for some time now that we have a steady supply of mandrakes for one of our most useful sweets, one that every Auror keeps with him or her these days. Thanks for that, by the way. I can\rquote t believe you spent all last sum
mer growing those ruddy things.\'94 Neville nodded in acknowledgment, turning a little pink. 
\par Harry was mystified still, and he could see that Ron, Hermione and Ginny were, too. \'93Our products are }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 weapons}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 Percy continued, \'93for Aurors and for Dumbledore\rquote 
s operatives. Even most Ministry officials aren\rquote t aware of it, for security reasons. The gum you swallowed, Harry, has Aegisthos Potion in it; if you read the instructions on the wrapper, you\rquote ll see that it\rquote 
s necessary to say the spell printed there for the gum
 to have any flavor to it. Saying the flavor spell transfigures an inert ingredient in the Aegisthos potion into something that converts the Aegisthos component into an inactive ingredient. Most people don\rquote 
t want sand-flavored gum, so they say the spell before putting it in their mouths. Plus, most people don\rquote t usually swallow gum. An Auror who\rquote 
s in a spot of trouble can just pop one of these in, chew and swallow, and they have a temporary protection from bodily harm. It doesn\rquote t protect against spells--only physical violence. And of course, the Aegis charm only blocks spells and doesn
\rquote t protect against physical assaults, so this helps fill the gap. Some Death Eaters have been resorting more and more to purely physical violence that doesn\rquote t leave a magical signature. Carrying some select Weasley\rquote 
s Wizard Wheezes products is a lot easier than carting around vials of potion.\'94 
\par Harry looked back and forth at Percy and the others who were in on the secret of Weasley\rquote s Wizard Wheezes. His mouth was open and working
 soundlessly. Harry saw that Hermione had colored at the mention of Aegisthos Potion, which had helped her to finally consummate her relationship with Ron. \'93I don\rquote t believe it!\'94 he breathed. \'93So all of you at Hog\rquote s End are really--
\'94 
\par \'93--fighting the good fight, Harry,\'94 Fred said, grinning and clapping his hand on Percy\rquote s shoulder. Harry shook his head in disbelief. 
\par Ron was grinning. \'93And disguising it as sweets!\'94 he said, clearly quite impressed. \'93Bloody brilliant! The Death Eaters haven\rquote t caught on yet?\'94 
\par Sirius shook his head. \'93So far we\rquote ve been all right. I\rquote ve managed to get out of more than one tight spot because of those \lquote silly sweets,\rquote \'94 he said, smiling. 
\par \'93And I\rquote m working on developing one myself that will give Fred and George the irresistible urge to clean up after themselves in the kitchen, instead of treating me like a house elf...\'94
 Percy said, looking at Fred and laughing. Fred, ever the mature one, stuck his tongue out at Percy, then grinned. 
\par Suddenly, someone was pounding on the door of the bathroom. They were even more startled by this than by Ron tossing the Bludger at the sink His voice still amplified, Ludo Bagman cried, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Open this door at once!}
{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93Ludo! End the sodding }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Sonorus}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  spell!\'94 Harry recognized Fudge\rquote s voice. 
\par Sirius strode to the door, saying sharply, \'93Just a minute!\'94 He turned to Percy and Fred, speaking in a low, urgent voice. \'93Get the girls, Neville and Ron into some stalls; standing on the seats, so their feet can\rquote 
t be seen. You should do that as well, Fred. You just produce amusing sweets, remember?\'94 he said with a wink. 
\par Fred grinned slyly and herded the others into stalls to hide, then claimed one himself. Percy picked up the Bludger with some effort and handed it to Ron (Harry assumed this was because it was so light for him), 
and Ron was now hiding in a stall with the Bludger. Sirius repaired the broken sink with a wave of his wand while Percy hustled Harry over to some urinals. \'93Pretend you\rquote re just zipping up, finishing,\'94 Percy said softly. 
\par Harry nodded, one hand at his waist as though he was doing what Percy said; he didn\rquote 
t feel so invincible anymore; the potion from the gum seemed like it might have worn off. Percy positioned himself at a urinal two away from Harry; he was actually not pretending to fasten his trousers, but 
was unwrapping a purple-wrapped sweet, popping it into his mouth and chewing. Harry wondered what it was. 
\par \'93This is Ludo Bagman!\'94 came the angry voice, no longer amplified. \'93Open this door immediately before I blast it open!\'94 
\par Sirius ran his hands under th
e faucet of the repaired sink quickly, then strode to the door, his hands still wet. He took the spell off the door and opened it, then started flapping his hands around to dry them. Ludo Bagman entered with Cornelius Fudge and the Romanian Minister of Ma
gic. \'93Hullo, Minister,\'94 he said cheerfully, as though former notorious Azkaban escapees were accustomed to addressing the Minister of Magic every day. \'93I was in the middle of washing my hands.\'94 He held them up. \'93
Sorry about that. I took the precaution of locking the door because Harry\rquote s with me. You know how it is when you\rquote re famous; people always gawping and wanting autographs. I thought--a bloke shouldn\rquote t be disturbed in }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 here}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , of all places, yeah?\'94 
\par Sirius went to dry his hands on a towel. Harry watched him and the others out of the corner of his eye, then turned away from the urinal, saying, \'93I should do the same, now.\'94
 Ludo Bagman, however, positioned himself between Harry and the sinks, looking very suspicious. 
\par \'93Are you all right, Harry?\'94 Bagman said, sounding less concerned than incredulous. \'93That Bludger--\'94 
\par \'93Yeah,\'94 Harry said quickly. \'93It really smashed through the stands. I reckon that Beater\rquote s aim was a bit off,\'94 he added, catching Sirius\rquote  eye. 
\par Bagman frowned. \'93No, I mean when it came back and--\'94 
\par \'93Now, now, Ludo. Harry\rquote s fine. It\rquote s wonderful that you\rquote re so concerned, and you too, Minister,\'94 a familiar voice said. Harry turned in amazement. Where he had expected to see and hear Percy Weasley, he instead saw and heard }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 his father.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  The spitting image o
f Arthur Weasley stood before them all now, every hair on his head and line on his face exactly as it had been on Christmas day, when Harry had last seen him. 
\par With a jolt, Harry realized that the sweet Percy had eaten was probably impregnated with Polyjui
ce Potion, specifically, potion with part of Arthur Weasley in it. Harry swallowed, seeing the way Fudge and Bagman responded to the presence of the ersatz Mr. Weasley; they were clearly far more willing to show respect to him than to Sirius Black. 

\par \'93Arthur!\'94 Fudge said now, sounding disconcerted. \'93I didn\rquote t know you were here. Thought you were working today.\'94 
\par \'93I was, I was. Finished early. I decided I could manage to catch some of the match if I hurried. How\rquote s it going so far?\'94 
\par The Romanian Minister of Magic crossed his arms and looked very grumpy; he was about Hermione\rquote 
s height, with a large barrel chest and dark brows which were lowered discontentedly over his black eyes. He only had about three hairs on his head, combed carefully over his otherwise bare
 pate. His black robes were trimmed with dun-colored fur at the neck and cuffs. His expression said that he was not accustomed to people disobeying him. 
\par But instead of answering the question \lquote Arthur\rquote  asked him, his face suddenly split in a rather gruesome but recognizably friendly smile, and he put out his hand to Harry. \'93
Laszlo Constantinescu. I am indescribably pleased to meet you, Mr. Potter.\'94 He had a very robust voice, over-emphasizing his consonants, and Harry started to put his hand out, but he caug
ht Sirius giving him the tiniest of head-shakes and quickly withdrew it, then held up both of his hands, his mouth drawn into a line. 
\par \'93I would, Minister, but I still need to wash up.\'94 He looked pointedly at Bagman with one eyebrow raised. Constantinescu looked grumpy again. 
\par \'93Well, don\rquote t just stand there, you idiot!\'94 he barked at Bagman. \'93Let Mr. Potter wash his hands!\'94 
\par Ludo Bagman sent Harry a look that made him shiver as he moved out of the way. While he was at the sink, the Romanian Minister stood next to him, practically gushing about Harry\rquote 
s performance in the match against England, decrying the unfairness that led to Wales losing to France, and how it would have been an enormous privilege for the Romanian team to play against him in the final. 
\par \'93Unfairness!\'94 the French Minister exclaimed in a honey-rich voice; unable to stay out of the bathroom any longer, she had pu
shed the door open and now strode over to Harry and Constantinescu. Harry was finishing drying his hands by now and the French Minister ignored her Romanian counterpart long enough to extend her hand to Harry, palm down, at chest height. \'93
Mignonette Beauvais. I am charmed to meet you, Mr. Potter.\'94 He had been expecting an accent something like Madame Maxime\rquote s, but instead, the Minister\rquote 
s diction was quite perfect, if rather formal, with barely a trace of her origins revealed. 
\par Harry took her hand uncertainly, and as she seemed to be rather moving it upward, bent slightly and gave the back a small peck, before straightening up and releasing it. \'93Madame,\'94
 he said uncertainly. Her dark blonde hair was pulled into a loose bun at the back of her head and her sparkling hazel eyes made Harry feel that she was not only taking in everything around her at once but taking }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
possession}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  of it. The lines around her eyes and mouth were minimal, and since she was a witch Harry was unable to tell whether she might be forty or seventy. 
\par She turned to Ludo Bagman. \'93So, Ludo. I see you were not just trying to impress me when you said you knew Harry Potter.\'94 
\par Ludo Bagman turned deep red, and Harry wondered whether he\rquote d been }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 flirting}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  with the French Minister. \'93Er, no, of course not.\'94 He suddenly threw his arm around Harry
\rquote s shoulders and squeezed them painfully. \'93Harry and I go way back.\'94 He grinned at Harry, who felt a strong desire to kick Bagman in the shins. \'93That\rquote s why I\rquote m so concerned. Getting a Bludger in the middle is hardly--\'94 

\par Harry did his best to look shocked. \'93A what?\'94 Is that what you think happened?\'94 
\par \lquote Arthur\rquote  Weasley stepped forward again, smiling and laughing. \'93I\rquote m afraid you\rquote re mistaken, Ludo. Harry would be a wreck if that had happened. Does he look to you like someone who\rquote s taken a Bludger?\'94 
\par Bagman looked vaguely discontented. \'93Show us your stomach,\'94 he demanded, not really responding to the question. Harry turned deep red, but when Sirius gave him a small nod, he unbuttoned his robes and lifted up his jumper and sh
irt a few inches, enough to see that he bore no marks, no damage of any kind. Bagman reached out with his finger and poked at Harry\rquote s ribs for a second; Harry flinched at his cold finger. 
\par \'93Ticklish,\'94 he lied. He pulled his clothes down again and fastened his robes, feeling self-conscious about everyone standing about ogling his stomach. 
\par \'93I tell you Negrea did }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  hit that Bludger at Harry Potter!\'94 Constantinescu declared. \'93Our Seeker was about to catch the Snitch, and then--\'94

\par Sirius cleared his throat. \'93Erm, since it is clear to everyone that Harry is all right, perhaps we should all leave? It looks like the rest of the match will have to be played with one Bludger only.\'94 
\par Ludo Bagman looked rather grumpy. \'93Yes, it does look that way. Odd, that. Even when they\rquote re hit out of bounds, Bludgers always come back. I wonder why this one }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 didn\rquote t}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 He looked very pointedly at Harry, who returned a blank stare. 
\par When he was leaving the bathroom with the three Ministers, Sirius, \lquote Arthur,\rquote  and Bagman, Harry caught Bagman\rquote s arm and pulled him back a little. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 How much did you put on today\rquote s match}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 Harry whispered conspiratorially, but not so softly that the others couldn\rquote t hear. Ludo Bagman glared an
d pulled his arm from Harry\rquote s. When the others turned, his glare turned into a grin, and he threw his arm around Harry\rquote s shoulders again. 
\par \'93Well, well, good to see you again, Harry. I--\'94 
\par \'93Did I hear correctly, Bagman?\'94 Constantinescu said suddenly, very loud. \'93Are you permitted to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 wager}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  on matches as the head of Magical Games and Sports?\'94 
\par Bagman looked very nervous suddenly, and Harry could see small beads of sweat starting to form on his upper lip. \'93Of course not, Minister,\'94 he said very quickly. \'93I may 
sometimes speculate about who will win, of course, just in idle conversation. I predicted, for instance, that Harry here would win the Triwizard Tournament, and I was right about that, wasn\rquote t I, Harry?\'94 
\par He squeezed Harry\rquote s shoulders painfully again, and Harry gave him a false smile. \'93Actually, you were a little off about that, remember? I didn\rquote t win outright; I drew with Cedric Diggory.\'94
 Harry kept his stiff smile in place, looking at Bagman steadily, waiting for the older man to crack. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 And I cost you a good bit of money, too}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, he thought. It was very tempting to say it, but he controlled himself. 
\par Bagman finally backed down, taking his arm from around Harry. \'93Oh, yes, right. Technically you both won, although you were the only }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 surviving}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  winner,\'94 he continue
d, emphasizing \'93surviving\'94 in a way Harry didn\rquote t like. They were all standing outside the bathroom again, and Bagman and Fudge started hustling the Ministers away. \'93Back to the top box with us,\'94 Bagman said. \'93The game can\rquote 
t start again until I\rquote m up there...\'94 Harry watched them go, then looked quizzically at Sirius. His godfather nodded. 
\par \'93Yeah, Harry. I don\rquote t trust him either.\'94 
\par Harry drew his lips into a line. Then beside him, hands clutched his arm and he beheld Percy Weasley once more, gasping as his body returned to normal and he no longer resembled his father. Harry watched the hair grow thicker on Percy\rquote 
s head, the features change subtly to a smoother, more youthful appearance. Harry was startled to realize, however, that few other changes occurred. Pe
rcy was as tall as his father, his glasses appeared to have the same frames, and his clothing clearly didn\rquote 
t cause a problem for Percy when he transfigured, including his shoes. It was like watching Arthur Weasley age backward, becoming his younger self. F
or some reason, it had never occurred to Harry before that Mr. Weasley must have looked just like Percy when he was young. 
\par Percy swallowed and finally stood upright without having to hold anything. \'93Sorry, Harry. Wasn\rquote t quite prepared for that. Thank goodness it didn\rquote t happen before they left.\'94 
\par Harry had a sudden thought, looking at Percy. \'93I know why you and your mum are still fighting. It has nothing to do with George and Angelina. It's because she doesn't want you to be an Auror.\'94 
\par Percy looked surprised for a moment, then nodded grimly. \'93She thinks it's too dangerous. But--after what happened to Penelope--I can't }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  do this...\'94 
\par Harry looked at him sympathetically. After he'd learned that Ginny had died, in his other life, nothing was the same again. 
\par \'93She'll come around eventually. But I am confused about something--I thought Polyjuice Potion lasted for an hour?\'94 
\par \'93A normal dose does. That\rquote s just a small--\'94 Percy stopped and stared at Harry. \'93How do you know about Polyjuice Po--\'94 
\par But then the door to the bathroom opened and Fred peeked out, checking to see that the way was clear for the others to emerge. They all went back up to their seats, a few at a time, Sirius and Harry going last. Sirius repaired the hole where he\rquote 
d been sitting and resumed watching the match as though nothing had happened. Beside him, Harry was startled to see that Ginny had tear tracks running down her face. 
\par Without looking at her, he whispered out of the corner of his mouth, \'93You all right, Gin?\'94 
\par She nodded miserably. \'93I just--I thought you were gone when that Bludger was coming for you,\'94 she whispered. She hiccuped and looked like she would start crying in earnest any second. 
\par Harry turned to Charlie. \'93Charlie--can you get us to the Romanian offices where Ron and Ginny used the Floo network? Ginny needs to go back to Ascog. She doesn\rquote t feel well.\'94 
\par Charlie looked very grumpy. \'93Aw, Harry, why do we all have to go? The match just started again!\'94 
\par \'93No--I\rquote ll take her. But she can\rquote t Apparate, so--\'94 
\par Charlie sighed and took him to the office. He stood by, waiting, while Ginny and then Harry threw the powder into the fire and stepped into the green flames. Nothing mattered, the Quidditch match didn\rquote 
t matter, whether anyone saw them leave together didn\rquote t matter, only Ginny mattered... 
\par When they arrived in the empty sitting room at the castle, a new snow was starting to fall, forming small drifts in the corners of the courtyard visible through the sitting room windows. Harry took Ginny to the couch near the window and drew her ont
o his lap just as the dam burst. She flung her arms around his neck, sobbing uncontrollably. He gathered her to him, warm and shaking. He\rquote d never seen her quite like this, crying like the world had come to an end. That was how he\rquote d cried on 
}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 her}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  after showing Ron and Hermione his Pensieve, but she\rquote d never opened up and cried like this on him. She\rquote 
d been very shaken up by her experience with Tom in the Chamber, but it still didn\rquote t come close. 
\par After a little while she slowed down; her breathing began to sound more regular, and he put his hand on her tear-stained cheek and gazed at her shining eyes, which looked like liquid chocolate. \'93All right now?\'94 he whispered. 
\par She shook her head. \'93No. I--I\rquote m sorry, Harry. I\rquote m sorry for everything. For the ruddy plan Mariah and I cooked up, for ever thinking I shouldn\rquote 
t wait for you, for every moment I ever spent with Draco over the past two years--all of it. I--I had no idea how bad it would be, Mariah making a pass at you. When I held the amulet, I never expected to see t
he pair of you like that, rolling about with no clothes on...\'94 Harry flushed. Ginny gave a small laugh. \'93Mariah said she wasn't expecting it either, that when she used her selkie charms for the first time, she hadn't known it would make }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 her}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  get rather carr
ied away as well. She apologized profusely to me, she really did. Offered to let me hex her and everything. One of the hardest things about all of this, apart from having to pretend to be cross with you, has been treating her dreadfully too, at least in p
ublic, when she's been nothing but the dearest friend. She said that you were the one to put a stop to it, which shocked me, because selkie charms are very, very strong.\'94 
\par \'93But I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 did}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  manage to stop us,\'94 he said. \'93And do you know what did it? One thought: 'She's not Ginny.'\'94 
\par She stared at him, her mouth open slightly, and he couldn't not dip his head and capture her lips with his, as he showed her that he'd really wanted to be kissing }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 her}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , holding }
{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 her}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , not Mariah, and not anyone else. She sank into the kiss 
with him, her breathing matching his, the heat from her mouth feeling like it was seeping into his entire body, down to his fingertips and toes. When he broke the kiss gently and looked at her, she seemed much more relaxed, and he kissed her nose lightly,
 while she smiled lovingly at him. 
\par \'93When you found me crying in the common room after that, I wasn't really acting. I'd never been more miserable in my life, and it was all my own fault. I thoroughly deserved it. I thought it had been hard to see you in be
d with Hermione, and then Katie. But that--\'94 she choked, and he pulled her head onto his shoulder, rubbing her back. \'93I never should have given up on you,\'94 she whispered. \'93I should have--\'94 
\par \'93Gone on pining for me forever? No, Ginny. How would I ever have w
oken up and figured out what a dolt I was? When we were in the pool this summer, I never had a chance to finish telling you about that time in Flourish and Blotts. You know, that day when your dad and Lucius Malfoy had the fight. When Draco said that it l
ooked like you were my girlfriend, I wished I had had the nerve to say back to him, \lquote Yes, and don\rquote t you wish she was yours?\rquote  But--well--\'94 
\par She smiled feebly through her tears. \'93But twelve-year-old boys don\rquote t do things like that. Especially when they have to listen to the girl\rquote 
s brother talking all the time about what an annoying ninny she is. Ron was your friend--you had to agree with him.\'94 
\par He put his other hand up to her face now, cradling it. \'93I wish I hadn\rquote t. Every time I let some remark Ron made about you pass without comment, I felt this awful leaden weight inside me. It was dishonest of me not to respond--but I wasn\rquote 
t just being dishonest with you, and with Ron. I was being dishonest with myself. The one reason I thought maybe I\rquote d done the right thing not to really acknowledge you was that--well, it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 did}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  seem to border a little on hero-worship. Putting your elbow in the butter dish, dropping things...\'94 
\par She smiled at him and turned her head slightly to kiss his palm, making him shiver. \'93That wasn\rquote t becau
se I worshipped you. All right, when I first saw you at the train station, your first year, I was utterly in awe of you. I admit that. But later, when we started getting letters from Ron at Hogwarts--I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 liked}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  you tremendously. And you know why? Because you were Ron\rquote 
s friend. Silly, I know, but I knew that if the famous Harry Potter had befriended one of the poorest boys at school, and if Ron thought you were worth his time, it was because you were a good person who didn\rquote t care about appearances. I heard abou
t Draco offering you his hand. You didn\rquote 
t take a golden opportunity to be connected with one of the wealthiest families in the wizarding world. You became friends with my poor, threadbare brother with only a stupid rat for a pet and second-hand robes. And 
you did it in spite of the fact that he had an obnoxious little sister.\'94 She smiled at him and his heart turned over. \'93That made me like you, and I was very, very nervous whenever I was near you as a result. I }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  a ninny. But isn\rquote t that what happens? When you first had your crush on Cho, didn\rquote 
t you feel awkward when you were around her? Like your feet were suddenly very large, or like you always had bad breath or a piece of spinach in your teeth or something growing out of your ear?\'94 
\par Harry laughed. \'93Oh, yes. I thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown from trying to ask her to the ball. And then it turned out Cedric had asked her first.\'94 
\par She poked him in the chest. \'93I think that if you had asked her out at the beginning of your fourth year, she would have accepted. She }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 did}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 like you. Cedric just got to her first.\'94 
\par He pulled her closer. \'93I\rquote m glad I didn\rquote t. I know now that when she turned me down for the ball, that awful feeling must have been what }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 felt when you found out I didn\rquote t have a date, after you\rquote d accepted Neville...\'94 
\par She put her head on his shoulder, looking at his neck. \'93I cried for hours after that,\'94 she whispered. \'93I felt like you\rquote d never notice me...\'94 
\par He rubbed her back and turned to kiss her forehead lightly. \'93I was a little scared at the thought of going to the ball with you and just a bit relieved, frankly, that you were going with Neville. It seemed--it seemed to }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 matter}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  so much to you, and I was afraid I\rquote d disappoint you. I was still rather fixated on Cho. I don\rquote t think you would have enjoyed yourself very much.\'94 
\par She smiled, her head still on his shoulder. \'93I might have had my feet trod on a little less. You danced very well with Parvati.\'94 
\par He laughed. \'93It was easy. I just let her lead.\'94 
\par They both laughed then, for a moment, but after that they just sat together on the couch in quiet communion while the snow fell outdoors, until Sirius\rquote  mother called them for tea. They joined the rest of Sirius\rquote 
 family, wondering how the match was going, but not really disappointed that they weren\rquote t there.

\par Ron\rquote s voice hurt Harry\rquote s head. Where was he? Opening his eyes, he found that he was on the couch in the sitting room again; he and Ginny had returned there after tea. Harry had picked up the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Daily Prophet}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 to try to work the crossword and Ginny, yawning, had lain down with her head on his leg. Soon her nose was whistling in that way that made him smile; he smoothed her hair out of her peaceful face and then went on working the crossword, feeling very cont
ent and domesticated. Sirius\rquote  mother sat on the other couch for a while, reading. She asked him whether he wanted to hear the match on the wireless; it was still going on, presumably, or the others would have returned. He declined, knowing he
\rquote d get a blow-by-blow from Ron, and instead they sat in companionable silence until Callisto Black decided she would go up to bed. 
\par The children had already been put to bed by Ursula, after their tea, and she and Alan had retired after that as well. Walter Black had gone on a short trip to visit Sirius\rquote 
 cousin Ian, whose appearance Sirius had borrowed at the ceilidh. Casseiopeia and Floyd were still visiting his family, and the house seemed much less fraught with tension with them gone. 
\par Harry didn\rquote 
t realize that he had dozed off; when Ron stumbled out of the fire, his exclamation woke Harry, who felt a bit disoriented. He blinked up at his best friend, trying to focus his eyes. To his surprise, Ron was looking at them now with a soft expression, hi
s mouth twisting. 
\par \'93Aw--do you two have to look so--I mean--oh, bloody hell--\'94 he trailed off helplessly. Harry blinked some more; the world finally stopped looking fuzzy. He heard three }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 pops!}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  from the entrance hall, and then Sirius, Neville and Hermione we
re entering the room. Hermione stopped, and, after one glance at Harry and Ginny, had the same soft look on her face. She seemed like she was going to say something, but Harry put his finger to his lips, so they wouldn\rquote t disturb Ginny. 
\par She smiled and bent over, whispering in his ear, \'93You look nice together.\'94 She straightened up, still smiling, and Harry felt himself color. \'93However,\'94 she added, \'93Ginny should probably sleep upstairs, not down here on your lap.\'94 
\par Ron nodded vehemently. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Definitely,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 he agreed, crossing his arms. 
\par Harry managed to gently wake her and Hermione led her up to their shared room. Ron and Harry walked behind them, Ron regaling him with Romania\rquote s victory over France. Harry wasn\rquote t listening very closely. He was frowning, remembering 
the Bludger again. 
\par \'93Did Percy or Katie say anything about trying to work out why that Bludger was coming after me?\'94 he asked Ron as they continued up the stairs. 
\par \'93Yeah,\'94 he confirmed; \'93Percy said he\rquote d get on it, try to find out who had access to the equipment before the match. Charlie\rquote s vampire friend said he\rquote 
d try to find out something, too. We went to a pub in a nearby village after the match--that\rquote s why we\rquote re so late. Dimitry\rquote s a right nice bloke--for a vampire.\'94 Ron laughed. \'93And he said the same thing about me, using the words 
\lquote for a werewolf,\rquote  instead.\'94 
\par Harry grinned at him. \'93I reckon we should have known what the Romanians would be doing for mascots, but it was still a bit of a surprise. Didn\rquote t they think it was a bit risky? Others seemed to think 
so, too, with all of the garlic and stakes they were handing out.\'94 
\par Ron shook his head. \'93Nah. Less risky than the ogres the French had, if you ask me. The garlic and stakes were for show, to get people stirred up. Vampires are smart. They know that food ha
nded to them without a fight is better than food they have to sneak around for, with the risk that someone\rquote ll try to skewer them with a stake. Ogres are just stupid, and indiscriminately violent and bloodthirsty. They\rquote re like giants\rquote 
 dumb cousins.\'94 
\par Harry huffed at Ron. \'93Hagrid\rquote s not stupid.\'94 
\par \'93I didn\rquote t say he was! That\rquote s why I said they were like }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 stupid}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  giants. And even though Hagrid\rquote s not stupid, Harry, he }{

\par \'93I heard that, Malfoy. You talk about your own mother,\'94 Ron growled, giving Harry a fairly good idea of what Draco had said. 
\par Sirius cleared his throat. \'93When you two are }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 quite}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  through, we should make way for someone else to arrive. There\rquote s another Portkey in ten minutes.\'94 
\par Hermione drew Ron away from Draco, who fell into step beside Harry. He saw Sirius and Charlie grin at each other and shake their heads. It was the la

\par \'93I wish we could have Apparated,\'94 Hermione said in a slight whine. \'93I studied up on it! We\rquote re fifteen degrees east and sixty north, about halfway between Oslo and Stockholm--\'94

lker over to a Swedish Ministry official and emerged from the small cottage serving as the arrival point for Portkeys from Britain. Harry suppressed a little laugh, but let Draco see that he was smiling. Hermione frowned at them both. She was still not ha
ppy about Harry being friends with Draco Malfoy. 
\par Harry also looked about; there was a single street with just a few houses. There didn\rquote t seem to be any restaurants or inns, or even a church or school. He\rquote d never seen a place that looked more deserted. 
\par \'93We couldn\rquote t have Apparated, Hermione,\'94 Sirius told her. \'93Anti-Apparition wards have been erected all around the town, so witches and wizards who haven\rquote t done as much preparation as you can\rquote

\rquote t be rising very soon, and in fact the race would be starting and ending in darkness, because of the very short days so close to the Arctic Circle. \'93
You can't see my aunt and uncle's house from here, of course. It's across those fields. But how difficult would it have been to avoid so few houses? It would probably be harder to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 intentionally}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  land in a house.\'94 
\par Harry saw that Sirius was smiling now, too. From what he\rquote d seen so far, Sirius seemed to get along well with Draco. Harry took that as a good sign. Draco called him by his first name (he hadn\rquote 
t been his student), and each seemed to appreciate the other\rquote s wry sense of humor. Harry wished Sirius would budge on the issue of telling Draco about him and Ginny; he didn\rquote t yet feel that he had an adequate explanation for why he couldn
\rquote t tell him. 
\par A blue Swedish Ministry of Magic bus with a large yellow cross on the side suddenly appeared before the cottage, and the bus door opened. A large blond man who seemed to be both driver and conductor stepped down from the bus, saying, \'93
Velcome! Velcome! Ve vill vait for the next three Portkeys, and then ve vill go to the race!\'94 He grinned at them, and Harry ducked his head as he passed him, hoping his scar wouldn\rquote 
t be noticed. When they were seated in the rear of the bus (which had seats like any Muggle bus, rather than the Knight Bus\rquote s beds) Hermione pulled a book out of her bag and began to give unsolicited information about the race. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 The annual broom race takes a total of about seven to nine hours, depending upon the speed of the slowest flyer}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 she read aloud. \'93}{

\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 She frowned at Sirius, sitting with Charlie behind her and Ron. \'93It sounds very regimented.\'94 
\par \'93Well,\'94 he explained to her, \'93they don\rquote t want everyone attending the race to try to Apparate to Arjeplog at once any more than they want everyone to Apparate here for the start of the race. That would be utter chaos. It\rquote 
s a good thing the end of the race is about three-hundred miles away. That gives everyone enough time to get there.\'94 
\par Hermione nodded. \'93True. And if you have a low number and go early, you may have enough time to explore Arjeplog and do some sightseeing. I hope I do.\'94 She turned the page. \'93It says here that there\rquote 
s a museum with a wonderful collection of Lappish silver--\'94 
\par Ron made a choking noise next to her. \'93Erm, Hermione, can you }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  tell me that you\rquote re going to be staring at a pile of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 silver}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  while I\rquote m dodging dragons?\'94 
\par She drew her lips into a line. \'93It\rquote s a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 museum}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , Ron, not a shop. I\rquote m sure it\rquote s all behind glass or something like that. It\rquote 
s supposed to be quite beautiful. Anyway, I wouldn\rquote t dream of making }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  go. That\rquote s why I\rquote ll go when you\rquote re otherwise occupied.\'94 
\par Ron\rquote s mouth twisted. \'93Forgive me for being unable to see the beauty in silver these days.\'94 
\par Hermione smiled gently at him and kissed his cheek, where the scar showed from the Three Broomsticks attack. \'93There\rquote s nothing to forgive,\'94
 she said quietly, looking up at him with wide brown eyes. Ron put his arm around her shoulders and pulled her to him. She rested her head on his chest and stopped quoting from books, and they waited in silence for the other race specta
tors to arrive and fill up their bus. 
\par They soon discovered that the Swedish Ministry bus was on the order of the British Ministry cars that had taken them from the Burrow to London in past years, which couldn\rquote t bounce about the country like the Knight Bus, but }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 could}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  do extraordinary things when traffic was bad, like leap to the front of a line of waiting cars. This bus didn\rquote t need to do that, as there was no traffic, but it didn
\rquote t technically keep to the road. Their route took them over numerous fields and
 through more than one wood. Several times, Harry saw rocks and trees leap out of its way, as the bus trundled on in what he was fairly certain was a straight line. He held onto the seat in front of him as they bounced along. 
\par \'93Well,\'94 he said to Sirius, on the other side of the aisle; \'93the driver clearly believes what they say about the shortest distance between two points...\'94 His teeth rattled in his head. 
\par Sirius looked at him blankly. \'93What do you mean, Harry?\'94 Harry shrugged and said nothing; wizards probably }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 didn\rquote t}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 think the shortest distance between two points was a straight line. There were many even }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 faster}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  ways of getting about using magic. 
\par When they arrived at the starting point for the race, they went with Ron and Charlie to check in with the other racers, and Harry felt his pulse quicken; he\rquote 
d never seen so many people with brooms before, surely. Then he, Hermione, Draco and Sirius had to move off to the spectator area, but they wished Ron and Charlie luck first. Harry and Sirius pounded them on t
he back while Draco stood nearby, shifting uncomfortably from foot to foot. Hermione kissed Ron the cheek before starting to move away, but Ron would have none of it; he pulled her to him in a deep kiss, her face flaming when he finally released her. Harr
y saw that she had a small lopsided smile. Draco looked like he was trying to studiously ignore the pair of them and failing. 
\par He assumed that Muggle-repelling charms were keeping non-magic people away, for otherwise, the spectacle would surely have drawn a
 great deal of attention. Fairy lights were shining onto the spectator area at either side of the starting line, and a huge number of racers were taking up positions behind the starting line. When they spotted Ron and Charlie they waved, and Ron and Charl
ie waved back. There had to be over two-hundred racers, and over a thousand spectators. Witches and wizards moved through the crowd wearing sandwich boards with odds on them; Harry looked at Sirius quizzically. 
\par \'93There\rquote s a lot of wagering on this, Harry. You wouldn\rquote t believe how much money people lose on this race.\'94 
\par Harry nodded. \'93Yes, I would.\'94 That made him think of Bagman. \'93Do you think Ludo Bagman has a bet on the race?\'94 
\par Sirius shrugged. \'93He might, although he really shouldn\rquote t. He registers the British participants. In a position like his, one has to be above reproach.\'94 
\par Harry guffawed. \'93Well, that\rquote s one thing Bagman definitely }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 isn\rquote t.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Sirius drew his lips into a line, looking thoughtful but not responding. Harry was wearing his Omnioculars around his neck, and he lifted them to his face now, peering at the racers. 
\par \'93They\rquote re mounting their brooms. I think it\rquote s going to start.\'94 
\par The crowd grew restless and a low murmur started up from somewhere, the crescendo growing until finally the flag was lowered and Harry saw the amazing spectacle of over two-hundred brooms rising into the air at once. They didn\rquote 
t move forward, however, and Harry realized that they were just getting into position. He watched the cloud of broom-riders hovering, waiting. He didn\rquote t rea
lize he was holding his breath until the second flag was lowered and the flyers at the front of the pack zoomed into the cold, dark morning air, flying north to Arjeplog. 
\par The crowd almost immediately started up a deafening cheer; Harry\rquote s ears were ringing
 with the noise, and then he realized that his throat was sore from joining in. He saw that even Draco and Hermione were caught up in the excitement, waving their hands in the air as the riders zoomed forward in a dark cloud. They watched and cheered and 
w
atched some more. It took over an hour for all of the riders to disappear from sight, especially as many people, like Harry, could see them from quite a distance using Omnioculars. But finally, a mountain obscured the last trailing racer, and the crowd st
arted milling about, clearly wondering who was going to get the low numbers and have the opportunity to get out of Kopparberg first. Harry hoped they didn\rquote t have to wait all day; from what Hermione said, Arjeplog was a much more interesting place. 

\par However, when they could no longer see the racers, Hermione grasped his arm tightly, her brow knit with worry. \'93They }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 will}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  be all right, won\rquote t they Harry?\'94 
\par He put his arm around her shoulders and squeezed, trying to comfort her even though he had doubts himself. \'93They\rquote ll be fine, Hermione.\'94 
\par \'93But they\rquote re going to be invading the dragons\rquote  }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 home}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , basically,\'94 she said, making Harry think she wanted him to tell her it }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 wouldn\rquote t}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  be all right. 
\par \'93Yes,\'94 Draco drawled, \'93and the dragons will be worried that they\rquote re going to make off with their women. Dragons }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 are}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  very sexy, you know,\'94
 he said waggling his eyebrows. \'93You can bet that all of the bachelor dragons have calendars hanging in their lairs with the best-looking she-dragons in provocative poses....\'94 
\par Then Harry and Draco couldn\rquote 
t take it anymore and doubled up in laughter, while Hermione crossed her arms on her chest and frowned at them. Sirius was rolling his eyes, but Harry could also see a smile at the corner of his mouth. As they made their way through the crowd to fin
d out when they would be allowed to Apparate, Harry put his arm around Hermione again, saying, \'93There, there. It\rquote ll be all right, really. And now you\rquote re too busy thinking about how immature }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 we}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  are to be worried about Ron, yeah?\'94 
\par She relented, smiling a little. \'93I suppose.\'94 She dropped her voice, looking furtively at Draco Malfoy, walking ahead of them by Sirius\rquote  side. \'93I want you to be careful, Harry. I think he\rquote s a bad influence on you.\'94
 He nodded grimly, looking at the back of Draco\rquote s head, wishing Hermione would get along with him better, but knowing that their history of animosity probably made that impossible. 
\par They didn\rquote t have to wait all day, but it was a full two hours after the last racers had disappeared from sight. They were all growing restless, tired of salesmen pushing through the crowd trying to sell them their wares, which didn\rquote 
t include enough offers of hot food and drink for Harry\rquote s taste, although he did get a bowl of hot meatballs in a brown gravy, with some flat noodles. He shoveled it into his mouth quickly, letting it warm him. 
\par When he finally Apparated to Arjeplog, it was a relief, and for once he wasn\rquote t worried, for he knew he was prepared. Hermione had been quizzing him about it constantly. When he felt his
 body again, he was on the shore of a lake, with a small forest in the distance on the other side of the water, a white church steeple rising out of the trees. There were some other long, low houses visible but not much else. 
\par They were hustled out of the 
Apparition area and onto buses which would taken them to the town of Arjeplog proper, since it was still about four to six hours until the end of the race. They found that the town was charming, and they wandered up and down the streets for a while, wonde
ring what story the Swedish Ministry of Magic put out about why over a thousand visitors suddenly converged on Arjeplog on the New Year's Eve every year. 
\par When the sun finally rose, they decided to eat lunch, finding a charming inn with a restaurant. Hermio
ne pulled out her phrase book and spoke to the waiter for them. They had a nice meal and let Hermione drag them to the silver museum afterward; there was still at least an hour to go before the first racers would arrive. They returned to the finish line a
f
ter leaving the museum, watching the sky to the south anxiously as the dark became deeper; the brief daylight hours had passed very quickly, and the sky was covered in clouds, without any starlight at all seeping through. Harry felt like they were at the 
top of the world. When he said this to Hermione, she rolled her eyes and replied, \'93We }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 are}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 
\par At length, a small speck was seen in the distance, then another and another. An excited noise started rumbling through the crowd. Harry watched with his heart in his throat; even with his Omnioculars to his face, he couldn\rquote 
t yet make out the identities of the first flyers to appear. He wondered how many would make it, not knowing whether to take }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Quidditch Through the Ages}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 with a grain of salt. He hated to think the book was right about the race. In the second chapter, about ancient broom games, it said that at the annual broom race, the spectators Apparated to Arjeplog \'93to congratulate the survivors.\'94
 Although Charlie and Ron were uniquely equipped to handle themselves while flying through a dragon reservation, Harry sincerely hoped that the book was exaggerating. 
\par More and more flyers moved into view, becoming a black swarm against the deep blue sky. It looked to him like a large number of flyers had made it through, and he was almost ready to breathe easy again. Almost. 
\par Next to him, Hermione was looking through her own Omnioculars and jumping up and down excitedly. \'93Oh, where are they? Do you see them, Harry?\'94 
\par Harry squinted into the lenses; in the dim light, it was
 impossible to spot the bright Weasley hair. He thought a couple of tall, lanky riders might be Ron, but they turned out to be other people. Finally he spotted Ron, Charlie flying by his side. He let out a yell. 
\par \'93There they are!\'94 he cried. They were final
ly in the finish area, lit by fairy lights, as the starting area in Kopparberg had been. But rather than crossing the finish line, the initial swarm of flyers simply landed on the strip immediately preceding it, the witches and wizards who had flown the r
ace all looking quite shaken. 
\par \'93What are they }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 doing}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 Draco demanded to know. \'93
Why aren't any of them trying to cross the finish line? What is this, some new kind of race that Granger's invented? Where no one actually }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 wins}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , they just all }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 enjoy}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  themselves, and no one's disappointed at }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 losing}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ...\'94
 he drawled sarcastically, rolling his eyes at Hermione. She immediately bristled and opened her mouth to say something, her hand reaching for her wand. \'93Go ahead, Granger,\'94 he said, before she could respond either verbally or with a spell. \'93
I'd love to see you in trouble in a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 foreign country}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
. Might I remind you that my aunt's here somewhere? She's the one who organizes this race, after all. There would be a nice news story. 'Hogwarts Head Girl Hermione Granger Arrested
 for Attacking Nephew of Swedish Ministry Official.' You'd have to wait until you're a hundred to be allowed in the country again.\'94 
\par \'93Shut up, the pair of you,\'94 Harry said harshly, although Hermione hadn't said a word. Her mouth was open, though, as if she
 were about to retort. She shut it abruptly now, looking at Harry sullenly. He didn't usually speak to her that way. But Harry was very worried, and had started to wonder how many had fallen to dragons. Yet another dark swarm came over the horizon, and an
o
ther and another. They were probably at least an hour from seeing the last of the riders reach Arjeplog, but it was certainly looking as though a large number of them had come through without any problems. So why weren't any of them trying to cross the fi
nish line? 
\par A sense of foreboding gripped Harry as he pushed through the crowd. Sirius called his name; Harry turned his head and yelled, \'93Come on! I think something\rquote s wrong!\'94 
\par Hermione, Draco and Sirius followed him through the crowd; Harry thought he hear
d Hermione giving Draco a piece of her mind as they approached. They soon reached the edge of where spectators were permitted. Ron and Charlie stood amid the other racers, holding their brooms, scanning the crowd. As soon as he spotted them, Ron began to 
work his way through the other riders, parting the crowd and allowing Charlie to travel in his wake. 
\par When Charlie and Ron stood before them, they looked very serious indeed, and Harry couldn\rquote t begin to imagine what had happened. Ron let Hermione throw her 
arms around him with an inarticulate cry; Harry had seen her chewing her fingernails as the first flyers had appeared, before Draco had started trying to wind her up. Sirius frowned at Charlie. 
\par \'93What is it, Charlie? What\rquote s wrong?\'94 There was a worried tone in his voice, which shook. \'93Is it the dragons? Were a lot of riders lost?\'94 
\par Charlie opened his mouth to speak, shut it instead, then tried once more. \'93That\rquote s just it. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 There were no dragons.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94

t that far away, either. After two-hundred miles, it\rquote s the last thing we were supposed to go through before the finish line. But--no dragons.\'94 
\par Hermione noticed Ron looking about anxiously. \'93What is it?\'94 she wanted to know. 
\par Ron frowned. \'93It\rquote s a bit hard to make out, with all the noise, but I thought I heard an official say they\rquote re going to ask some of us to go back to the reservation, take a look around. They\rquote re get
ting some doctors and nurses to go, too.\'94 Harry knew that Ron\rquote s sharp hearing was picking up on things the rest of them were missing. Ron nodded to Charlie. 
\par \'93I\rquote m game if you are,\'94 Ron said to his brother. \'93I\rquote d like to bloody well know where those dragons are. Because if they }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 aren\rquote t}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  on the reservation--
\'94 
\par Charlie nodded; he looked very serious, his jaw clenched tightly. Harry felt a lump in his throat. Reservations were to protect dragons from poachers (the her
d was periodically thinned, and one could only buy officially-approved dragon-related products resulting from the thinning) and protect humans from dragons. 
\par \'93So, I\rquote m volunteering,\'94 Ron said, his mind clearly made up. \'93You, Charlie?\'94 
\par \'93Definitely. It seems unlikely, but I hope they didn\rquote t just wander off....\'94 
\par \'93You\rquote re thinking about the dragons?\'94 Hermione squealed excitedly. \'93What about }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 humans}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? Those dragons could be anywhere, wreaking havoc on a village--\'94 
\par \'93There, there, Hermione,\'94 Ron said, putting his arm around her and trying to calm her. \'93Charlie knows dragons }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 and}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 he knows dragon-poachers. Dangerous work, but possible. One summer, years ago, they lost over a fourth of the herd on his reservation to poachers who made off with them one at a time, in the middle of the night. It does happen.\'94 
\par \'93The other question is--where are the witches and wizards who work on the reservation?\'94 Charlie said, as though realizing that he sounded more worried about the dragons than he should. \'93There\rquote s a huge staff, and if even }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 one}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  of the dragons had suddenly gone missing, someone would have said }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 something.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Harry didn\rquote t like the sound of that. He hadn\rquote t realized that the reservation would have humans living there, but when he thought about it, it made sense. Charlie had worked for years on a reservation in Romania, after all. 
\par After kissing Hermione again, Ron went off after Charlie to volunteer. They all watched silently this time as the cloud of flyers rose as one and charged south toward the snowy mountains. Harry felt restless; he wished he\rquote 
d already registered as an Animagus. He was itching to transfigure, spread his wings and fly south with Ron, Charlie and the others. 
\par Sirius didn\rquote t know this when he sighed and looked at their grave faces. \'93Perhaps we should get a bite to eat. I have a feeling this may take a while.\'94 Harry didn\rquote t know how he would keep from jumping out of his skin while he waited. }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I knew there was a reason to bring my own broom, even though I wasn\rquote t racing.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par They returned to the restaurant where they\rquote d h
ad lunch; while waiting for their food, Hermione went to find a bathroom, and Sirius spotted some people he recognized and went to talk to them, to find out whether they knew more about the missing dragons. 
\par Harry stared around the room, trying not to meet Draco Malfoy\rquote s eyes across the table; they hadn\rquote t been alone since Boxing Day. Every time he saw Draco he felt dreadfully guilty about the times he\rquote 
d been alone with Ginny, although she was no longer Draco\rquote s girlfriend and wasn\rquote t cheating on him. (Harry hadn\rquote t felt as guilty when she }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Draco\rquote 
s girlfriend and he was kissing her at the top of the Astronomy Tower.) 
\par \'93So,\'94 Draco started to say awkwardly, drumming his fork on the table noisily. \'93A bit odd, this?\'94 Harry nodded mutely. There was only about a minute of awkward silence, but it seemed to be much more than that. Harry hadn\rquote 
t expected them to be immediate good friends again yet, but he also hadn\rquote t expected there to be these extended silences. At length, sounding desperate, Draco said, \'93Expectations. It\rquote 
s always disturbing when you have certain expectations and they\rquote 
re not met. Know what I mean? You fly over a dragon reservation and you expect there to be dragons. You walk into a room in a pub and expect to find Harry Potter in bed with a naked girl....\'94
 Harry stuck his tongue out at him, but felt himself starting to smile in spite of himself. \'93....or you snoop around in a Muggle house and expect to find old Muggle photos, not wizarding ones....\'94 
\par \'93What?\'94 Harry said. \'93Are you speaking hypothetically now, or did this happen to you?\'94 
\par Draco shrugged, starting to arrange the silverware in geometric patterns on the table. \'93Yeah, it happened to me. You never know when a family\rquote s going to have a Muggle-born witch or wizard. Probably loads of Muggle houses have
 some wizarding photos stuffed away somewhere. I found them in a shoe box inside a suitcase that was stuffed under a bed, with a lot of other dusty things. It wasn\rquote t exactly framed and on the mantel, was it?\'94 
\par Harry raised his brows. \'93Some thorough snooping you were doing there.\'94 
\par \'93I was especially bored. We were in her parents\rquote  bedroom. They were out for the day and Felice had gone to change into some stupid nightie or something she said she bought for me to see. What was the point? She was going to be out

\par Harry grasped the edge of the table. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Felice}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? This was in New Stokington? I thought maybe it was at the Galbraiths\rquote

\par \'93You thought I was shagging Bobbie Galbraith?\'94 
\par Harry rolled his eyes. \'93Did I say I thought you were shagging Mrs. Galbraith? God. Sometimes you remind me of--}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 
\par Draco laughed for a moment. \'93I think I know what you mean.\'94 He shrugged. \'93Bobbie wasn\rquote t bad looking, I\rquote ll give you that, but she needed to learn how to dress. And she was a bit old. And married. Say what you will about me, I don
\rquote t think I\rquote d go after a married woman. Probably. Anyway, if she hadn\rquote t been married and old, I reckon that her taste in clothes wouldn\rquote t matter if we were more concerned with her being }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 un

\par Harry rolled his eyes. \'93Focus,\'94 he said simply. Draco shook himself, tearing his eyes away from the waitress\rquote  bottom. 
\par \'93Erm, yeah, it was in New Stokington, at Felice\rquote s place. So?\'94

\par \'93Sod that. Apart from the fact that technically I was cheating on Ginny }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 and}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Mariah, I was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 supposed}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to be doing my job. I was supposed to confess to any of those people what I was doing? Was it my fault she wanted me so badly?\'94 he said with a smirk. 
\par \'93No, probably not.\'94 It was Draco\rquote s turn to stick out his tongue. \'93If you found wizarding photos, did it ever occur to you that Felice might }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 be a Muggle? That she might be a witch? And that she might have an ulterior motive for shagging you?\'94 
\par \'93Er, no, it didn\rquote t,\'94 he said quietly, biting his lip. 
\par \'93God, you\rquote re stupid!\'94 Harry wasn\rquote t feeling much like being friendly at the moment. \'93She could have been a Death Eater for all you know. You\rquote 
re not exactly popular with them. How did she react to seeing your Dark Mark? She could have put a spell on you, or given you a time-release potion. All kinds of things. You didn\rquote t know }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 anything}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  about her, did you?\'94 
\par \'93Erm, no,\'94 he admitted, reddening. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 You}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  just saw an opportunity, and that\rquote s all you cared about! You really need to be more careful where you put your--\'94

\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 What}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94
 Harry squeaked. Then he realized that Hermione was standing at his elbow. Harry swore to himself. He wished he had been able to bring Sandy on the trip, but he wouldn\rquote t have been able to Apparate with her, so he\rquote d left her in Ginny\rquote 
s care. He didn\rquote t know for certain that Sandy would have warned him about Hermione\rquote s approach, but she\rquote d done similar things many times before. He felt like his heart was beating very fast. 
\par \'93He needs to be more careful where he puts his }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 what}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , Harry?\'94 she asked guilelessly. 
\par \'93Erm--his gloves. Can\rquote t be too careful. It\rquote s cold up here; can\rquote t afford to lose them.\'94 Draco rolled his eyes; while Hermione wasn\rquote t looking, he mouthed }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Gloves?}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  at Harry. 
\par Hermione frowned, not noticing Draco, as she was looking at Harry. \'93I don\rquote t have gloves. I always lose them. Now that I\rquote m of age, I just put a warming spell on my pockets and put my hands in when they\rquote re cold. It\rquote 
s lovely. Why are you bothering with gloves?\'94 she said, turning back to Draco, his mouth was opening and closing like a fish\rquote s. 
\par But then Harry was saved by the waitress arriving with their food, and Hermione went to fetch Sirius back to their table. They ate in silence, no one wanting to voice their worries about the missing dragons. 
\par After the meal, Harry watched Draco go to the loo; when he was out of earshot, Harry leaned over the table and said to his godfather, \'93I need to talk to you.\'94 
\par Sirius saw that Harry's eyes were still following Draco. \'93About Draco, I presume?\'94 
\par \'93Yes. He told me that when he was working at that estate in New Stokington this last summer, he found wizarding photos under a bed.\'94 
\par Sirius frowned. \'93I thought you did }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 gardening}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . Why was he looking under beds?\'94 
\par Harry glanced at Hermione, feeling his face grow a bit warm. \'93He was shagging the daughter. They were in the bedroom for that, but she\rquote d gone to change into something, and he was bored and went snooping around.\'94 
\par Hermione drew her lips into a line. \'93Why that little....\'94 
\par \'93Not now, Hermione,\'94 Sirius said abruptly. \'93The important thing right now is to know why there were wizarding photos in a Muggle house where wizard gardeners just happened to be working. What were they photos of?\'94 
\par Harry shook his head. \'93Don\rquote t know. Listen, I\rquote d stand a better chance of getting somewhere with questions about this if I could be honest about something else...\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 No}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 Sirius said quickly, knowing what Harry wanted to do. 
\par \'93But Sirius--\'94 
\par \'93No.\'94 
\par \'93But--\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 No.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 Sirius\rquote  jaw was set. \'93Please don\rquote t defy me on this Harry. Stop asking.\'94 
\par Harry sat back, crossing his arms, feeling a bit like a chastised five year old. \'93All right, then. If you\rquote re going to be that way, I think I have a right to demand a satisfactory explanation, which I have yet to hear. You say \lquote no.\rquote 
 I say }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 why bloody not?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Sirius took a bite of his steak, chewed and swallowed. Harry clenched his fork tightly, his knuckles turning white while he reluctantly waited for an answer. While he was cutting another bite of meat Sirius said, \'93I\rquote 
ve had the opportunity to get to know Draco better since I came to Hogwarts to teach, Harry. And on this trip as well. And you know what? I like him.\'94 Hermione made a face; Sirius laughed for a moment and patted her hand. \'93
No one said you have to, Hermione. But I can see why Sam Bell likes him, and Aberforth as well. Remember, Harry--they\rquote re his friends too, not just yours. He reminds me of me, when I was that age. And yes, I was a prat. But you like me now, don
\rquote t you? And keep in mind that my feelings will be hurt if you take too long to answer....\'94 
\par Harry smiled. \'93Yes, I like you. All right, so you like Draco, and so do Sam and Aberforth. And--?\'94 
\par Sirius put his utensils down. \'93And I don\rquote t want him to know about you and Ginny.\'94 
\par Harry rolled his eyes. \'93Because--?\'94 
\par \'93It\rquote s as much to protect him as to protect
 the pair of you. I mean, honestly--if Voldemort managed to get his hands on Draco and ordered him to say whether you have a girlfriend and to identify her, do you think Draco would just shrug and tell him? Or do you think--\'94 
\par \'93--he\rquote d refuse, and by refusing die--\'94 Harry whispered. 
\par Sirius put a piece of meat in his mouth and then said, \'93Right,\'94 around the food, before chewing and swallowing. \'93If he doesn\rquote t know, then he can\rquote t say one way or the other and he can\rquote 
t die by refusing to tell. Do you see? If you tell Draco, you\rquote re putting him in a very dangerous position. He doesn\rquote t want Ginny endangered. I think we all agree on that.\'94 Harry nodded; Hermione reluctantly did the same. \'93
If he knew about the two of you, it would be rather like--\'94 
\par \'93--like making him their Secret Keeper against his will,\'94 Hermione finished quietly, looking at Sirius with a very grave expression in her dark eyes. \'93That\rquote s why Harry\rquote s parents agreed to have the Secret Keeper changed to Peter P
ettigrew, wasn\rquote t it? They were afraid you\rquote d literally take the secret to your grave. That you\rquote d die before giving them up. They were worried about }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 

\par Sirius grimaced. \'93I went back and forth on it. First it was my idea to switch, then I changed my mind.
...In the end, Lily pleaded with me and I finally agreed. We all felt that I would be such an obvious target that making me the Secret Keeper would have the opposite effect of keeping them safe--or me. Peter, on the other hand, said he could go off and li
ve in his rat form somewhere unobtrusive. No one would be able to find him even if they }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 knew}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he was the Secret Keeper. It }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 should}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  have been the perfect plan. 
\par \'93Of course, as I already knew where the house at Godric\rquote s Hollow was, I needed to forget. A memory charm. It was a very strong one, and it\rquote s possible that if a Death Eater tried to negate it, I would have had permanent brain damage. But }
{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 they\rquote d}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  still be safe. What I didn\rquote t know at the time was that Lily had used a very specific spell on me; if she, James
 or Peter died, my memories would be restored to me. That\rquote s how I knew something had happened. I was out on a date that night when suddenly these }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 memories}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 came roaring into my head. I remembered the first time I\rquote d gone to Godric\rquote 
s Hollow, I remembered the last time, all of it. And the moment these things started dancing around in my mind, I knew there were a limited number of possible reasons for it. I knew I had to go to Wales, to find out what had happened. 
\par \'93My date wasn\rquote t thrilled, but she let me go. I took my motorcycle, since I didn\rquote t want to leave it in Hertfordshire, where we were having dinner. I wish I\rquote 
d Apparated, so I could have been there sooner. Of course, when I arrived at the house, I knew Peter had betrayed them....\'94 He covered his face with his hand, then ran his fingers through his hair. \'93
I wished then that I had been the Secret Keeper, and I felt like I\rquote d killed your mum and dad with my bare hands. The problem with Draco knowing what you want him to know is that if he does the right thing, he\rquote ll probably die, and if he doesn
\rquote t, then it could be you or Ginny, or both. What he doesn\rquote t know he can\rquote t tell, and he can\rquote t }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 refuse}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to tell, either. That\rquote 
s all there is to it.\'94 
\par Harry slammed the table with his hand. \'93That sodding charm! That\rquote s why my mum wanted to kill Ron, so that I couldn\rquote 
t refuse a direct order from Voldemort to do it. If he was already dead, the order and my response to it would be null and void.\'94 
\par Sirius nodded, cutting another piece of meat. \'93Right. Now, are you going to eat or not?\'94 
\par Harry began to pick at his potatoes in a desultory fashion. \'93I reckon. I hadn\rquote t thought about putting Draco in danger by telling him...\'94 
\par \'93Well, now you\rquote re thinking about it. And while telling him might ease your conscience, Harry, it could cost lives. His, yours, Ginny\rquote 
s. Or all three of you could be at risk. Is it really worth it, just to feel a little less guilty? How guilty would you feel if someone died over your wanting to get this off your chest to Draco?\'94 
\par Harry grimaced. \'93Did my mum give you lessons in how to induce guilt, years ago? Because you\rquote re very good.\'94 
\par Sirius smiled ruefully. \'93All mums teach that, Harry. It\rquote s required in their by-laws.\'94 He grinned, then took another bite, chewing it slowly and watching his g
odson. Harry glanced at Hermione, who looked sympathetic, but seemed to agree with Sirius. 
\par Draco appeared at his elbow suddenly, making Harry miss Sandy again; he sat and started to attack his food, looking ravenous. Harry nodded almost imperceptibly at S
irius and Hermione and bent over his own meal, more worried than ever that he might say or do something stupid to give away his and Ginny\rquote s relationship--and now he had to worry about Draco dying if he did that.

\par \'93Dead,\'94 Charlie said briefly, his voice barely audible. \'93All of them--dead.\'94 Sirius put his hand on his shoulder. Hermione
 choked out a soft cry and put her arms around him and he held her, shaking, his face buried in her hair. Harry knew that Charlie had known some of the dragon handlers. He looked at Ron\rquote 
s face; his best friend had never had quite that particular haunted expression in his eyes before, even when he had almost killed Parvati and wanted to die himself. Harry glanced at Draco Malfoy; even he looked very concerned about Charlie and Ron\rquote

\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 The smell}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 Ron said softly to Harry, looking like his gorge was rising. Harry knew it was probably bad for the others who\rquote 
d gone back to investigate; for Ron it probably bordered on hell, with his wolf senses. 
\par \'93Do you need to spew?\'94 Harry asked him quietly. Ron put his hand to his mouth and shook his head; Harry wasn\rquote t sure he believed him. 
\par \'93Already did that,\'94 Ron whispered from behind his hand, without shame. 
\par They walked back to the village, to the inn where Sirius had booked rooms for them for the night. \'93All right, now Charlie and I will be in this one,\'94 he said, in the corridor outside their rooms. \'93
Harry, you and Ron and Draco are next door and Hermione, you have the next one over. Let\rquote s all get some sleep; in the morning we\rquote re getting an early Portkey.\'94 
\par Sirius put his hand on Charlie\rquote s back and led him to their room; Harry wondered whether Charlie would really sleep. He wasn\rquote 
t surprised when Hermione followed them into their room instead of going to her own. Harry and Draco each sat on one of the beds and Ron sank into an armchair; Hermione crawled into his la
p and put her head on his chest. He rested his cheek on her hair and abruptly began to talk, the words spilling out of him. 
\par Harry wasn\rquote t sure how long Ron talked. It hadn't been easy for them to get into the buildings where the humans lived; there were hi
dden underground entrances, and tunnels connecting the various structures, to give the dragons the impression most of the time that they were living in an area with no human inhabitants. The family members of the dragon handlers rarely went above ground, 
w
here they risked being immediately burnt to a crisp. Even the handlers usually cast their spells from magical protective cover, seldom exposing themselves to any of the dragons directly. This was no longer a danger; the entire herd was gone. Fourteen cows
 
and eight bulls, plus six calves. There were also three nests with five eggs, all of which were gone. The four dozen handlers who worked on the reservation, and their families, were all dead: men, women and children. Even pets were dead (cats, dogs and po
st owls). They weren\rquote t dead from the killing curse, either. They\rquote 
d been slaughtered. It was messy. It still looked magical, as though blade spells had been used for the attacks. Cleaner than the most finely honed knives, the spells had ripped through the bo
dies like they were soft butter. Since everyone was usually inside, the racers, flying far overhead, had no inkling of what had occurred. They would have had to descend to the reservation and risk being attacked by the dragons in order to enter the human 
accommodations. Outsiders seldom visited; Portkeys were usually used for anyone who couldn't Apparate, so that the dragons couldn't see people coming and going. 
\par In the main administrative office, they found it. The letter taking credit for the massacre. \'93Voldemort,\'94 Harry whispered. Ron no longer flinched at the name; Draco did. 
\par \'93Voldemort,\'94 Ron said, echoing Harry, who fought the urge to smile. Ron would never go back to saying \lquote You-Know-Who.\rquote  \'93Or rather,\'94 he amended, \'93Death Eaters. The killings were rece
nt, which is why no one knew anything was wrong. The staff were held prisoner for weeks, while the dragons were spirited away. Then, a couple of days before the race, they slaughtered the people. Death Eaters continued to maintain contact with the outside
 
world, pretending to be staff when they spoke with the Swedish Ministry about everything being ready for the race. No one knew anything was wrong because everything seemed normal. Evidently, the head handler had told the Ministry to suspend all post to th
e reservation two days before the race, so the owls wouldn\rquote t agitate the dragons. It wasn\rquote t really the head handler, of course, but a Death Eater....\'94 
\par Harry watched Ron as he spoke; he didn\rquote t think Ron was going to be sleeping any time soon. When he had ta
lked himself out, Hermione kissed his cheek and whispered to him. She stood and laced his fingers through his. She looked at Harry for just a moment before they left. Harry nodded to her. Draco Malfoy looked grumpy as he watched them leave. 
\par After the door had closed, he said, \'93Well, I\rquote d have gone to have a look-see at the reservation if I\rquote d known I\rquote d get to shag Granger after....\'94 
\par \'93Shut up,\'94 Harry said quickly, irritated that Draco was being so crass; he was also more than a little worried that Ron could hear him quite well. \'93You don\rquote t know what they\rquote 
re going to do. He needs her to be there for him right now. That might mean anything.\'94 
\par Draco smirked. \'93Like you needed her the night before your cousin\rquote s funeral.\'94 
\par Harry tried not to think back to that night, being in the bed with her, in the shower, the nightmares he\rquote d been trying to beat back.... 
\par \'93Shut up, wanker,\'94 Harry said, trying to be harsher. \'93Even if they do--she\rquote s his girlfriend, and there\rquote s no moon. Safest time of month. Mind your own business and go to bed.\'94 
\par He laid in the dark, staring at the ceiling, trying not to see the images Ron had described, and feeling very tempted to spill his secret to Draco. When he behaved like this, it was very hard to want to keep Draco safe. }{

\par When some time had passed and Harry still didn\rquote t hear snoring, he turned to 
see Draco in the other bed, also staring sleeplessly at the ceiling. Harry suspected the tactlessness had been to avoid admitting that he was affected by what Ron had said. Harry looked back at his portion of ceiling. He had a long night of staring ahead 
of him. Best to get started.

t going to Apparition lessons, they rescheduled Elven Army training sessions for those times. This was no problem for Ron, now Major Weasley, since he\rquote 
d never been going to Apparition. (Harry promoted him from lieutenant at the start of their seventh year, so his rank was on a par with Hermione\rquote s; she thought she should have been promoted to colonel.) 
\par More than two weeks into the new term, Harry stood at the front of the Great Hall, where they were training the elves, the tables pushed to the walls. The small figures stood at attention, stretched out before him, rank upon rank, la
rge shining eyes in small, wrinkled faces all focused on him. He barked orders, had them spar with each other and with him, Ron and Hermione. But in a way, he wasn\rquote 
t really present. He was in the room on the reservation that Ron had described, where they\rquote d found all of the children rounded up and slaughtered....

d found, silent tears running down his cheeks while Hermione covered her mouth in horror and buried her face in his neck. 
\par The elves were ready to fight in the war, Harry thought, but how will we know where to send them? Who knew that there was a battle to be fought on the dragon reservation south of Arjeplog? To fight in a battle, you have to }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 know}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  about it. If only one side shows up, that\rquote s not a battle. It\rquote s a massacre. 
\par When training was over, Harry dismissed the elves. Dobby, at the head of a column, saluted smartly. Harry smiled at him as he saluted back. \'93Dismissed, Lieutenant Dobby.\'94 
\par \'93Thank you, General Harry Potter, sir!\'94 
\par \'93You can just call me General Potter, Dobby,\'94 Harry said, still smiling. \'93During training.\'94 Harry was going to tell him that he could just call him \'93Harry\'94 the rest of the time, but Dobby was still in the habit of cal
ling him by his full name. Harry decided against suggesting he use just his first name; Dobby might think he was criticizing. 
\par Ron walked over to Harry, smirking. \'93I see. You promoted }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  so you could promote }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Dobby}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 to lieutenant. Afraid I\rquote d be insulted to have the same rank as an elf?\'94 Harry looked at him with one eyebrow raised and Ron laughed. \'93Yeah, you\rquote d be right.\'94 
\par He was rather amazed with Ron, who turned out to work quite well with the elves. He'd been somewhat awkward when he'd started the year before. When they\rquote 
d been sparring earlier, five elves against Ron, Harry had seen him purposefully let his guard down, although he had the fastest reflexes, and allow the elves to overcome him. After Zenana had revived him, the five elves still sat on his chest
 and extremities, and Ron was laughing and saying, \'93Geroff,\'94 good-naturedly, ruffling the hair on a young elf, patting another on the back and saying, \'93Good job, that.\'94
 Harry could tell the elves liked him, too. Hermione smiled benevolently on them all, and Harry could see that Ron would probably receive a reward from her later for his friendly interplay with the elves. 
\par When they were using magic to move the tables back, Harry saw a piece of parchment fall out of Ron\rquote s robe pocket and he scooped it up; after glancing at it briefly, he put it in his pocket. Harry tried to hid his shock. He\rquote 
d almost forgotten about the letter Ron wrote while he was at Ascog, thinking that it was a one-off, rather than part of a regular correspondence. Ron didn\rquote t notice that he\rquote d picked up the parchment. Harry eyed him suspiciously; he\rquote 
d just been behaving perfectly naturally with the elves, and hugging Hermione affectionately, and yet he was also walking around with }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 this}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 in his pocket. Harry was torn between being upset with Ron or mystified by him. 
\par Having the rest of the afternoon free, they went up to the Gryffindor common room, where Hermione diligently sat down at a table with her N.E.W.T. text, setting a good example. Harry and Ron, however, decided to play Exploding Snap
 with Dean and Seamus. Hermione had to tell them repeatedly to quiet down as they were soon roaring with laughter, even while wincing and sucking on burnt fingers. Harry looked at Ron as they played; he seemed perfectly carefree. Harry didn\rquote 
t know what to make of it. 
\par Before dinner, Ron said to Harry and Hermione, \'93You go on. There\rquote s something I want to put in the dorm, so I don\rquote t lose it. Forgot to do it earlier.\'94 
\par Harry swallowed when he saw that Ron was putting his hand in his robe pocket, and when it emerged empty, and Ron looked panicked, Harry stepped quickly toward him, whispering, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I know where it is. Let\rquote 
s go upstairs and talk.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Ron looked angrily at him; Harry was taken aback by the open hostility. Hermione was oblivious, already turning toward the portrait hole. \'93All right. See you downstairs,\'94 she said, unconcerned. When they were in the dorm, Ron whirled on Harry. 

\par \'93Hand it over,\'94 he said tersely. Harry did as he was asked. Ron whipped it out of Harry\rquote s hand, then turned to his trunk, opened it 
and rummaged in the bottom. When he seemed satisfied about its hiding place, he slammed the lid shut and turned to face Harry, who was watching Ron with his arms crossed. 
\par \'93Care to tell me why you\rquote re getting a letter from }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 her}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , Ron?\'94 
\par Ron also crossed his arms and glared back at Harry. \'93No, I don\rquote t. Care to tell me when I gave you permission to read my mail?\'94 
\par \'93Hermione\rquote s my best friend. If she\rquote s going to be crying on me because you\rquote ve broken her heart, I think I deserve fair warning.\'94 
\par Ron\rquote s jaw dropped. \'93Break her heart?\'94 Then he looked shrewdly at Harry. \'93So--you didn\rquote t actually read it?\'94 
\par \'93No. I just know who sent it. And I know that you wrote to her when you were at Ascog, during the holiday.\'94 
\par Ron\rquote s mouth was open even wider now; he abruptly shut it and narrowed his eyes at Harry. \'93Been keeping that to yourself for a while, have you? This has nothing to do with Hermione. I\rquote 
m not cheating on her and I have no intention of doing so.\'94 
\par \'93So why--\'94 
\par Ron threw up his hands. \'93I had to have someone to talk to in hospital. The other patients on my ward were all barmy. I know, I was too. That\rquote 
s why I was there. But trust me--I was a paragon of stability compared to most of them. And everything I said to Dr. Bastion was picked apart into a million pieces for \lquote significance.\rquote  It was a relief to talk to someone who wasn\rquote 
t insane, brain-damaged or analyzing me.\'94 
\par Harry smirked. \'93But }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 her}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? I mean--after what we saw in your Omnioculars--\'94 
\par \'93Yeah, yeah. I know. But we saw that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 after}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  I came back. I didn\rquote t know when I was in hospital. And when I saw her in Sweden--\'94 
\par \'93Wait!\'94 Harry said, shaking himself, feeling as though he\rquote d just woken up. \'93You saw Nita in }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Sweden}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? Why didn\rquote t you say anything?\'94 
\par Ron rolled his eyes. \'93For the last time, Harry, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I am not cheating on Hermione with Nita Anderssen.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  God. She\rquote s--what? Ten years older than me?\'94 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93That might not be an impediment to her. And you like blondes.\'94 
\par Ron grimaced. \'93I liked }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 a}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  blonde, and I think it\rquote s fair to say that was just because Fleur was part-veela. I\rquote 
m actually rather partial to dark-haired girls. One in }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 particular}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, as you know. And remember--Parvati has dark hair, too. Much as she tried, Annika never got so much as a snog from me. So there goes that brilliant theory, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 General}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Potter.\'94 

\par Harry drew his lips into a line. \'93You still haven\rquote t explained all this. How can you be friends with Nita Anderssen after Narcissa Malfoy wrote that article about you? And doesn\rquote t she hate Weasleys, anyway?\'94 
\par Ron sighed and ran his hand through his hair. \'93You don\rquote t understand, Harry. First, she was a very good listener when I was in St. Mungo\rquote s, and she didn\rquote 
t seem to hold against me that I was a Weasley. In fact, she seemed concerned that the family might abandon me because I\rquote m a werewolf. You don\rquote t know what I had to go through to convince her that they wouldn\rquote 
t, even though I had doubts myself at first. Perhaps having to defend my family did me good; I had to believe what I was saying before I could convince }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 her}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
. And for your information, I spent a lot of time singing Hermione\rquote s praises to her. Traditionally, that isn\rquote t a good way to woo an older mistress, is it?\'94 
\par Harry grunted a reluctant agreement to this. \'93But you didn\rquote t say anything about running into her in Sweden.\'94 
\par Ron looked down at his hands and sat heavily on his trunk. \'93We didn\rquote 
t really meet up under the best of circumstances. Since her mum is the organizer of the race, she wanted Nita to go as one of the investigating doctors, when we went back to the reservation. Nita didn\rquote t want to, at first, as she\rquote 
d been going out of her head trying to convince her mum not to resign her post in disgrace. She was worried that if she went, when she returned she\rquote d find her mum had given up her job. Finally, when her mum promised not to make any rash decisions u
ntil after Nita returned, she agreed to go. We were with a racer from Italy when we found the children.\'94 Harry could see that Ron\rquote s eyes were wet. \'93She said that she\rquote 
d never cried before while doing anything that was connected with medicine. That was the first time....\'94 he choked. \'93She\rquote s really not too bad. She\rquote s definitely opinionated. We talked a bit about Malfoy\rquote s dad....\'94
 He looked very grim then and pressed his mouth closed. 
\par \'93What?\'94 Harry said, wondering what they\rquote d discussed. 
\par \'93Never mind. Anyway, she told me in Sweden that she was on the outs with her aunt. I confronted her, told her I knew her beloved Aunt Cissy was Daisy Furuncle. I didn\rquote 
t tell her how I knew. She was surprised. She said that she was really hacked off at Malfoy\rquote s mum }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 because}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  she\rquote d written that article about me. They weren\rquote 
t talking.\'94 
\par Harry peered at Ron; there was something he wasn\rquote t saying. \'93So you\rquote re corresponding with Nita Anderssen now, Draco Malfoy\rquote s cousin, but there\rquote s nothing going on?\'94 
\par Ron rolled his eyes. \'93Come on, Harry. Hermione\rquote s }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 your}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  friend, but do I assume that every time I\rquote m out of the room the pair of you are shagging? I }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 do}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  think that a man and a woman can be friends without it having to involve sex. I thought you did, too.\'94 He raised one eyebrow. \'93Or should I worry about you and Hermione--?
\'94 
\par Harry swallowed, looking away from Ron. He remembered the night on the hearth rug, while Ron was in St. Mungo\rquote s. \'93Of course not,\'94 he said quickly. \'93Besides, I love Ginny.\'94 
\par Ron nodded. \'93All right then. Let\rquote s drop this.\'94 
\par They started toward the door. Harry said, \'93But why haven\rquote t you told Hermione?\'94 
\par Ron looked levelly at him. \'93What makes you think I haven\rquote t?\'94 
\par His best friend turned and moved swiftly down the stairs. Harry followed him, thinking about what Ron had said and wondering still about his friendship with Nita Anderssen.

Harry watched Ron and Hermione as they ate breakfast. Ron passed Hermione a plate of bacon and she took one rasher only, while she passed a bowl of berries to him, so he could spoon them into h
is porridge. They seemed to have reached a level of silent symbiosis where they didn\rquote t always need to speak. It wasn\rquote 
t a hostile silence but one punctuated by sly looks and affectionate smiles. And just because he was her boyfriend, Hermione didn\rquote t let up on nagging Ron about his schoolwork. Ron said that he reckoned he\rquote d know she\rquote 
d been replaced by someone taking Polyjuice Potion if she ever did stop. 
\par Harry glanced at Ginny as she ate, missing her so dreadfully, but they hadn\rquote t dared spend any time togeth
er since returning to school. There were just too many people around. Sometimes when they were at Dueling Club meetings, while they were waiting for others to duel, they would share a look across the room, or they might do the same in the Gryffindor commo
n room if no one else was about apart from Ron, Hermione and Neville. He sighed and took a bite of his toast, chewing glumly. 
\par The post owls soared in through the clerestory windows; it was a welcome distraction. Hedwig brought Harry a note from Hagrid, asking him, Ron and Hermione to tea. Harry was glad; he missed Hagrid, whom he\rquote 
d only been able to see during Care of Magical Creatures classes when he\rquote d been training as a professional Quidditch player, and when he had Apparition classes in addition to Elven Army training, Dueling Club and prefects\rquote 
 meetings. Now that he wasn\rquote t training on the Welsh team (although practices would start again in the spring) and he had his Apparition license, he\rquote d have more free time. 
\par Hermione had received some more newspapers from her parents; she frowned over the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Times.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  \'93Alicia\rquote s dad\rquote s trial begins next month,\'94 she said. \'93
The barrister Sirius hired for him asked for plenty of time to prepare, but it still doesn\rquote t look good. He can\rquote t produce any witnesses to bolster his alibi,
 and all of the forensic evidence is against him, plus, they have him committing the crimes on film. Security cameras.\'94 
\par Harry and Ron digested the depressing news. Other students were reading their letters, opening packages from parents and otherwise chattering happily. For most of them, the war hadn\rquote 
t really intruded on their lives yet. But then Harry noticed that Gabrielle Delacour had received a post-owl; she sat near Will Flitwick and Jamaica Thomas. Harry thought Jamaica was asking her politely about her letter. Gabrielle gave her a sad smile. 

\par \'93Eet is from my seestair\rquote s midwife. I am an aunt. My seestair has had her baybay.\'94 
\par Hermione heard this and leaned forward. \'93Congratulations, Gabrielle. Boy or girl?\'94 
\par Gabrielle looked down at the letter. \'93Eet eez a boy. Ze midwife says zat eef I have a difficulty wiz pairmission to see my seestair and nephew, she weel talk to Professor Dumbledore for me.\'94 
\par Harry looked at the head table; Dumbledore\rquote s seat was empty. \'93Professor Dumbledore isn\rquote t here right now, but I\rquote m sure Professor McGonagall will let you go. And she\rquote 
s your head of house. Professor Dumbledore would probably just defer to her anyway.\'94 
\par Gabrielle smiled at him; he was glad to see that she didn\rquote t seem to be upset with him anymore. \'93Would you go wiz me?\'94 
\par Hermione smiled warmly at her. \'93We both will. With the Head Boy }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 and}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Head Girl, how can you lose?\'94 
\par The three of them crossed the hall to the head table and approached Professor McGonagall, in her customary place, next to Dumbledore\rquote s empty seat. After explaining the situation to her, she nodded and said, \'93
The previous visit to your sister was without incident. I believe that Remus Lupin is not available to accompany you at the moment, however.\'94 She turned to Sirius, beside her. \'93Profe
ssor Black, do you have room in your schedule to accompany Miss Delacour and our Head Boy and Girl to St. Mungo\rquote s?\'94 
\par Harry started to object, not feeling the need to see Fleur again. She\rquote d been very queer toward him. Hermione trod on his foot, making him bite his tongue before treating Professor McGonagall to an impromptu tour of his vocabulary of swear words. 

\par \'93Yes, Professor,\'94 Sirius answered with a nod. \'93I think I can manage that.\'94 
\par \'93Thank you, Professor,\'94 McGonagall said. Harry was trying not to laugh now; he wondered now whether, in the staff room, the teachers were constantly saying, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 But Professor, I find that I must disagree}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ...\'94 and \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Disagree? How can you say that, Professor?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 followed by, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Because, Professor, I recently read a journal article}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ....\'94 
\par \'93Harry, wake up,\'94 Hermione hissed, putting her elbow in his ribs. He winced. She was being very annoying today. 
\par \'93I\rquote m here. Don\rquote t put }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  in hospital, please,\'94 he answered, rubbing his side as they walked back to the Gryffindor table with Gabrielle. 
\par \'93In case you weren\rquote t paying attention, as we have no first lesson today, and Gabrielle\rquote s first lesson is with Professor McGonagall, she\rquote s being permitted to go right after breakfast, so we\rquote 
ll go down to Hogsmeade after eating and Floo to St. Mungo\rquote s.\'94 
\par Harry vaguely remembered now hearing McGonagall saying something about Gabrielle being an excellent Transfiguration student, but he hadn\rquote t really heard much else while his mind had been wandering. \'93Of course I heard all that,\'94 he lied. \'93
I wasn\rquote t originally expecting to be going out so early, though. We should go get our cloaks.\'94
 However, when he, Hermione and Gabrielle returned to the entrance hall to meet Sirius, they found him waiting with Alicia, who was also wearing a heavy winter cloak. 
\par \'93Alicia\rquote s coming,\'94 Sirius said brightly, making Harry and Hermione exchange a worried look. They didn\rquote 
t say a word, though. Harry watched Gabrielle as the five of them walked to Hogsmeade, a light dusting of snow on the road crunching under their boots. Did she know who Alicia was? he wondered. Did she know who the father of her nephew was? 
\par Harry was used to the security procedures at St. Mungo\rquote s by now; he hardly noticed anymore. When they were walking down the high stone corridors, passing the doctors and nurses going about th
eir business, that worried him for a moment, but then he noticed that they weren\rquote t going toward the ward where Ron and Fleur had been. They\rquote 
d climbed some broad marble steps and were proceeding down an unfamiliar corridor. He soon learned why: Fleur was now with the other new mothers and their babies. 
\par Sirius stopped a nurse in the corridor, to check that they were going in the right direction; they had to turn around and retrace their steps slightly. Finally finding the place, they heard the distinct sharp
 noise of a baby crying as a nurse showed them to Fleur\rquote s room. It was as bare and austere as Ron\rquote 
s hospital room had been. When they entered, a young nurse was carrying a small bundle in her arms, rocking it and cooing to it while the wails continued. She frowned when she saw five people preparing to enter. 
\par \'93 \lquote Oo are you, then? \lquote Ere I am, tryin\rquote  to convince this foreign piece o\rquote  baggage to feed \lquote er own child, and now I got a bleedin\rquote  audience....\'94 
\par Harry saw Hermione put her hands on Gabrielle's shoulders
 when the young girl bristled at this comment; Harry wondered whether the nurse knew what a very bad idea it was to anger someone who was part-veela. Hermione's fingers looked like they were gripping Gabrielle very tightly, and he saw her give Fleur's lit
tle sister a tight-lipped shake of the head. 
\par Harry looked at Fleur; she was much thinner than when he\rquote d seen her last, with good reason, but just as odd and detached from the world. She sat in a chair near the window, staring unblinkingly at the blank, whi
te winter sky. They all winced as the baby let loose a cry that took the noise up a notch; Fleur seemed not to notice at all. 
\par Alicia stepped forward. \'93I\rquote m married to the baby\rquote s father, if you must know. Here, let me try to do something with him....\'94 
\par The nurse looked at Alicia uncertainly for a moment, then handed the baby to her. Alicia carried the crying, red-faced baby to the bed and sat on the edge. She held out her hand to the nurse and said, \'93Hand me your wand. They took ours.\'94
 The nurse hesitated, as there was a good reason why visitors' wands were confiscated. However, she seemed at a loss for how to quell the baby's cries herself, so she took out her wand and handed it to Alicia, who passed it over her own chest, murmuring, 
\'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Lactatio}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 She nodded a
t the nurse and handed the wand back; then Harry was jolted as Alicia very calmly opened her robes and blouse and began to unfasten her bra. He turned away, red faced, then turned back again when the baby\rquote 
s cries stopped, curious. The baby had latched onto
 Alicia and was nursing contentedly now, one of his little hands brushing over the curve of her slight breast. Harry swallowed and turned away again. He noticed, however, that Sirius did not seem avert his eyes at any time, and he wondered at this. 

\par After some rustling, Hermione told him, \'93You can turn around now, Harry.\'94 He did, finding that a soft blanket was hiding both the nursing baby and Alicia\rquote s chest. He still felt a bit red-faced. 
\par \'93Thanks for that, miss,\'94 the nurse said. \'93Ma\rquote am, I should say. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 She}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  won\rquote t do it. Just stares an\rquote  stares. She don\rquote  touch \lquote im, hold 
\lquote im, nuffin\rquote . We\rquote ve given \lquote im some bottles, but \lquote e should \lquote ave his mum\rquote s milk. Best thing.\'94 She glanced at Fleur, shaking her head. \'93A shame. So pretty. But nuffin\rquote  there.\'94 
\par \'93What\rquote s his name?\'94 Hermione wanted to know. The nurse snorted. 
\par \'93That we know. Arne FitzDavies Delacour.\'94 
\par \'93Arne?\'94 Harry said, frowning. 
\par \'93It means }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 eagle}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 Alicia said, swallowing, still holding the baby tightly. \'93Roger wanted that name. Because of being in Ravenclaw. He contacted Fleur\rquote 
s midwife months ago, to tell her that, so there\rquote d be no question when the baby was born.\'94 
\par Harry nodded. \'93Shouldn\rquote t his name be Arne Delacour Davies? What\rquote s this FitzDavies?\'94 
\par Hermione, to his surprise, colored. \'93It means }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 illegitimate son of Davies.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 she said quietly. \'93Like }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 FitzRoy}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  means }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 illegitimate son of the king.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Harry looked at Alicia, who was glancing under the blanket. \'93Oh,\'94 he said softly. 
\par \'93I\rquote ll take him,\'94 Alicia said suddenly, looking up at the nurse. Gabrielle gasped, then gripped Hermione's arm. 
\par \'93Er--\'94 the nurse responded awkwardly. Harry was surprised; he didn\rquote t think she was the sort to be at a loss for words. 
\par Sirius stepped forward and put his hand on Alicia\rquote s shoulder, his face full of concern. \'93Are you sure about this?\'94 he said softly. 
\par She looked up at him and nodded, then looked at the nurse. \'93My husband is--away for the moment. But he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 is}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  the father, and I am his legal wife. }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 She\rquote s}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  clearly not competent. I can feed him by magically inducing lactation, I can change his n
appies, I can do whatever he needs a mother to do. What do I have to sign to have permission to take him? He can\rquote t just stay here. His mother is catatonic, and she needs to go back to a ward where she\rquote ll be treated for her condition.\'94 

\par The nurse looked bac
k and forth between Fleur and Alicia and Gabrielle, clearly adrift in this situation. Gabrielle ran to her sister, taking Fleur's face in her hands and murmuring to her in French. Harry strode to Fleur and crouched before her; Gabrielle moved to her side.
 \'93Fleur!\'94 he said sharply, trying to get her attention. \'93Fleur, it\rquote s Harry. I\rquote ve come again. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Har-ree}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . You\rquote ve a beautiful son. Don\rquote 
t you want to see him?\'94 Gabrielle started speaking to her sister very rapidly, presumably translating what Harry had said. 
\par Hermione walked to Harry and put her hand on his shoulder. \'93Harry--\'94 
\par But Harry gazed up at Fleur\rquote s perfectly placid, expressionless face from his position on the floor, trying to will her to notice that she was a mother, that her sister was speaking to her, 
anything. Out of the corner of his eye, he sensed that Alicia had removed the blanket from her front and took the baby from her breast. Harry tried to keep his eyes on Fleur, but at last, curiosity forced him to look at Alicia. She was buttoning her blous
e again, then fastening her robes, while Sirius held the baby. He handed the boy back to her and she approached Harry, placing the baby carefully in his arms. He was surprised both by how small and light Roger and Fleur\rquote 
s baby was, and how substantial, how warm and solid and squirmy. 
\par \'93Fleur,\'94 he whispered now, holding up the baby for her to see. He was no longer red and screaming but rather content-looking, some milk dripping from the corner of his mouth. \'93See him? See your son?\'94 Gabrielle's translation poured out again. 

\par She looked past them out of doors still. Nothing about her expression--or rather, the lack thereof--changed. Harry sighed and stood with the baby. He looked down at him, at his dusting of dark hair, his large blue eyes, his round cheeks and
 very pale skin. He was the image of Roger Davies. 
\par The image of a Death Eater. 
\par Harry shook himself, trying not to think that. He\rquote d been trying to protect his family. Harry had offered to do as much, in the Forbidden Forest, to protect Ron and Hermione. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 They}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  were like }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 his}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  family. He held the baby tighter, thinking of what his mother had gone through in his other life to protect }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 her}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  family. He looked at Alicia again. She had nothing now, he thought. Nothing but this baby. Roger was probably dead, Harry real
ized. If he was just in hiding--how could someone do that? How could Roger not emerge from hiding to come see his son, take responsibility for him? 
\par \'93Who do we talk to?\'94 Harry asked the nurse softly, handing the small boy to her. Gabrielle looked up at him
 and took his hand in hers; her look seemed to say that he had tried, they had both tried, but it was no use. The nurse drew her lips into a line. 
\par \'93The midwife. I need to take \lquote im back to the nursery. Follow me; I\rquote ll take you to her office.\'94 
\par And so it was settled. As the legal wife of the father of record (Roger\rquote 
s name was on the birth certificate) Alicia was permitted to take Arne FitzDavies Delacour back to Hogwarts, to act as his mother until further notice. Oddly enough, Gabrielle seemed to be quite happy with this arrangement. 
\par \'93Can I come to see \lquote eem?\'94 she asked breathlessly, holding her nephew and watching him grasp one of her fingers with his tiny hand. 
\par \'93Of course you may,\'94 Alicia said generously to the young girl. \'93You\rquote re in Gryffindor, right? I was in Gryffindor, too,\'94 she said, sounding a little wistful, as though she wished she were back in school, when her life wasn\rquote 
t quite so complicated. 
\par The doctor went with them to the entrance hall of St. Mungo\rquote s, helping Alicia to prepare to take the bab
y through the Floo network. They made the trip back to Hogsmeade without incident, then walked to the castle from the village, each of them helping to carry some baby paraphernalia, except for Alicia, who carried little Arne close to her chest in a sling 
the midwife had given her. 
\par Harry was shocked that the trip hadn\rquote t taken very much time at all; he and Hermione were only ten minutes late to History of Magic. While the ghostly Professor Binns droned on, Harry and Hermione filled Ron in on what had happened at St. Mungo
\rquote s. Ron\rquote s jaw dropped. \'93So--so you }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 saw}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  her--}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 feeding}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  the baby?\'94 
\par Hermione hit his arm with the back of her hand. Ron didn\rquote t seem to notice. Harry felt himself going red, but he said, \'93It\rquote s a perfectly natural thing, Ron. It\rquote s how we all start off in life. Nothing to get excited about,\'94
 he lied, as he\rquote d been rather uncomfortable and yet curious about what Alicia was doing (and guilty after taking peeks). 
\par \'93So--she\rquote s going to be living here at Hogwarts and taking care of her husband\rquote s kid while her dad goes on trial for murder. Weird. That\rquote s all I have to say. Very, very weird.\'94 
\par Harry and Hermione nodded; they all agreed on that. 
\par After lunch they had Herbology; when the lesson was over and Professor Sprout asked for volunteers to help repot some mandrakes, Harry smirked at Neville and stepped up to help. Neville gave him a sly look as they went to get some pots. 
\par \'93I can\rquote t believe you never said anything about the mandrakes, Nev,\'94 he whispered to him. \'93Even to Ron. He didn\rquote t know what his own brothers were up to!\'94 
\par Neville shrugged as he worked. \'93As you\rquote ve learned by now, Harry, I can keep secrets rather well.\'94 
\par Harry put his earmuffs on, thinking about how true this was; Neville hadn\rquote t told any of them about his parents for years. And Harry certainly hadn\rquote 
t suspected that he was a willing participant in the Great Plan. When they were walking down to Hagrid\rquote s afterward for their final class of the day, Neville was beside Harry while Hermione and Ron walked ahead. \'93
Um, Harry, can I ask you something?\'94 Neville said uncertainly. \'93Do you remember Ron saying something about getting me my own girlfriend--?\'94 
\par Harry laughed and slung his arm around Neville\rquote s shoulders. \'93That\rquote s right. We\rquote ve been quite negligent about that. Who\rquote ve you got your eye on?\'94 
\par Neville looked around furtively, then whispered a name. Harry stopped, taking his arm from Neville\rquote s shoulders and swallowing. \'93Erm, you realize that might be a bit difficult...\'94 
\par Neville shoved his hands into the pockets of his cloak. \'93Yeah, I reckon so. You think--maybe if I send her a really nice Valentine? That's only about a month away.\'94 
\par As they continued walking, Harry shrugged. \'93That might help break the ice. Has she ever shown }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 any}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  interest in you?\'94 
\par Neville frowned. \'93Not really.\'94 He sighed as they reached Hagrid\rquote 
s hut. The Slytherins and the other Gryffindors who were already there all looked rather apprehensive. They stood on the frosty ground, shivering in the wind, while Hagrid wheeled a large crate out of his hut and into the fenced paddock nearby, wh
ich sometimes held baby unicorns or hippogriffs (after Harry\rquote 
s fifth year, Hagrid decided to include these in the curriculum again, but only for fifth year and up). After parking the crate, which looked large enough to hold Hagrid himself and a little room to spare, he came to the fence to speak. 
\par \'93Afternoon, all!\'94 he said brightly, looking very cheerful and excited. He clapped his huge hands together and grinned at them, even the Slytherins. Draco Malfoy sneered; if Hagrid was happy at the beginning of the
 lesson, that was a very bad sign, his expression seemed to say. Harry wasn\rquote t so certain he didn\rquote t think the same. \'93Now, I ain\rquote t doin\rquote  this fer jest anyone. On\rquote y seventh years. You lot\rquote 
ll need practice on these sort o\rquote  creatures ter pass yer N.E.W.T.s. I spoke ter Perfessor Figg, and ever\rquote one who does well with this gets ter skip one o\rquote  her assignments. Now, Duelin\rquote  Club members up front, as they\rquote

ll start with--\'94 He consulted a parchment in his hand; \'93Millicent Bulstrode, Draco Malfoy, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley,\'94 he read, as though he\rquote d never met them and he hadn\rquote t invited Harry and Ron to tea after class. 
\par Harry swallowed, drawing his wand. He leapt lightly over the fence, as did Ron. Draco Malfoy started to, until he realized that Millicent needed some help, which he reluctantly gave her. The four stood arrayed before the crate, which was eerily still and 
silent. 
\par \'93Now, don\rquote  think \lquote e\rquote ll mind the cold. Remember--\rquote e\rquote s in \lquote is element in the cold. Right now \lquote e\rquote s stunned. When \lquote e\rquote s revived, \lquote e\rquote 
ll be a wee bit cross. Try not to antagonize \lquote im, yeah? And remember ter have fun!\'94 Hagrid added, grinning. 
\par The four of them looked at each other apprehensively. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Cross}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? Harry thought. They\rquote d be very lucky if he was merely }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 cross}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . And they were supposed to have }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 fun}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? 
\par \'93I\rquote ll do it,\'94 Harry said finally, when neither Ron, Draco nor Millicent said anything. \'93I\rquote ll cast the spell to revive him.\'94
 They all nodded grimly and stepped back a little, to give him a clear field. He pointed his wand at the crate, shaggy pure white fur showing through the large cracks between the wooden planks. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Ennervate!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 he cried. A crackling white light shot from his wand and slid cleanly through the boards, striking the creature waiting within. After a moment\rquote 
s hesitation, there was a roar of outrage, and the crate exploded, splintery wood flying in all directions as the creature erupted in rage, ripping his prison to shreds. 
\par \'93Harry!\'94 Hagrid cried, chiding him. \'93Ye should \lquote ave cast the spell ter }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 open the crate}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  first! Now it\rquote s ruined!\'94 
\par Harry called over his shoulder to Hagrid, \'93I\rquote ll repair the crate later, Hagrid! I\rquote ve got bigger worries right now!\'94 The yeti slogged toward them, his arms outstretched and his eyes wild.

Afterward, they were laughing about it of course. The yeti was stunned again and back in his repaired crate, which they left standing in the paddock instead of wheeling it back into Hagrid\rquote 
s hut. (Hagrid explained that if they were going to be having tea, it would be better to do it without the hut stinking of yeti.) 
\par Hagrid was grinning and waving goodbye to the students. Crabbe and Goyle were both walking funny as they headed back toward the castle, and Harry winced, watching them. They\rquote 
d been stupid, of course, which was why they were injured, but that was nothing new for them. He and Ron and Hermione bustled around the dark, crowded hut, helping get the tea ready while Hag
rid went out back to retrieve Fang from the pumpkin patch. (Poor Fang hadn\rquote 
t wanted to be in the hut with the yeti.) When Fang entered he made right for Harry, leaping up and licking his face enthusiastically while Harry grinned and removed his very wet glasses, rubbing Fang behind his ears and trying not to wince. 
\par They were all seated around the fire, drinking their tea and talking animatedly about the students\rquote  reactions to the yeti when suddenly Hermione caught sight of her watch and leapt up excitedly. \'93
Oh, dear! I completely forgot! I told Ruth and Tony I\rquote d help them with some dueling practice!\'94 
\par \'93Aw, Hermione, does it have to be now?\'94 Ron whinged. 
\par \'93I promised. Somehow I forgot when Harry said about tea. I\rquote m dreadfully sorry, Hagrid. And I volunteered your help, too, Ron. Tony wants some practice going up against someone with }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 exceptional}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  reflexes.\'94 
\par \'93But--but--\'94 Ron sputtered as Hermione dragged him to his feet and out the door. 
\par \'93We\rquote ll have to do this again, Hagrid!\'94 she called over her shoulder as they left. 
\par \'93Tha\rquote s all right, Hermione. Harry an\rquote  I\rquote ll have ourselves a right nice tea. Have fun!\'94 
\par But Ron and Hermione had only been gone for five minutes when a brown owl began beating itself silly against one of Hagrid\rquote s windows. He looked surprised and went to the window, muttering. When he had taken a parchment from the bird\rquote 
s leg and unrolled it, he looked up at Harry sighing. \'93Looks like I\rquote m abandonin\rquote  ye, too. Miss Dougherty here says Professor Snape is in the middle of workin\rquote  on a very delicate potion and \lquote e needs some newts. \lquote E
\rquote s all out, and she can\rquote t get down here and back to the castle in time. I reckon this won\rquote t take me too long. You wait here--I\rquote ll be back in a shake.\'94 
\par After Hagrid left with a small cage of newts, it suddenly occurred to Har
ry that he could have offered to send the newts to the Potions dungeon by banishing them. (For that matter, he thought, Snape could have fetched them himself by summoning them. He didn\rquote t have to bother Hagrid.) 
\par He drank his tea, sitting back and watching 
the fire, waiting for Hagrid to return. It was strange being alone; he realized suddenly that he almost never was. He was with Ron and Hermione usually, or if they had gone off to be together, he was in the Gryffindor common room with the other students i
n his house. He went running with seven other people, ate in the Great Hall, and even Malfoy and Tony (and Ron) were usually in the prefects\rquote  bathroom when he was showering after running in the morning. He slept in a dorm with four other people. 
\'93Alone,\'94 was not usually a word that described him. 
\par Suddenly, sitting in Hagrid\rquote s hut by himself with just the sound of the crackling fire, his isolation felt quite eerie, and he started to feel more than a little nervous. When the back door of the hut suddenly swun
g open, he leapt to his feet with his wand drawn and the person who\rquote d entered gasped and backed up against the wall. 
\par It was Ginny. 
\par Harry sighed and lowered his wand, trying to get his breath. \'93Ginny! You startled me!\'94 
\par As she closed the door, she said, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  startled }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 Then she turned to him with a smile. \'93
This was supposed to be a surprise, but a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 pleasant}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  one. Perhaps I should have told Hermione to tip you off.\'94 
\par \'93Hermione did this?\'94 
\par \'93And my sister helped, too. She sent Hagrid a note about some newts.\'94 
\par \'93Ah. Right,\'94 he nodded. realizing how the conspiracy had been done. He pocketed his wand and smiled at her. \'93It\rquote s nice that we have so many people helping us to be alone, but you\rquote re still standing over there, and I\rquote 
m over here....\'94 
\par They moved toward each other simultaneously and Harry wasn\rquote 
t certain whose arms were thrown around whom first, he just knew that he was holding Ginny and kissing her, that her fingers were in his hair, holding his head in place while she drank him in, and everything felt all r
ight again now that they were together. Ginny broke the kiss and smiled up at him. 
\par \'93What were you doing before I came in? Sitting by the fire? That looks nice....\'94 
\par She led him back to the fire and he sat again in the huge Hagrid-sized leather armchair, in which the two of them could easily have sat side-by-side (with space to spare) if they wished. Instead, Ginny sat beside him with her legs over his lap, and he lea
n
ed in again, catching her lips with his, kissing her softly at first, then lightly running his tongue along her lower lip, making her drop her jaw and pull him to her. As they continued to kiss, he ran his hand up to her knee, under her robes and skirt, t
hen back down to her feet, pulling off her shoes without untying them. She sighed and squirmed a little, her feet flinching as he ran his fingers over the insteps, then traced the arch of one foot with his thumb. 
\par \'93Ticklish?\'94 he asked mischievously as he kissed along her jaw, then blew lightly in her ear. She melted against him, guiding his lips to her neck by twining her fingers in his hair. 
\par \'93Yes,\'94 she admitted. \'93But I don\rquote t care. It feels--oh!\'94 She couldn\rquote t speak any more as he moved his lips along her ne
ck, nipping lightly at the throbbing pulse-point, while his fingers danced over her feet and her breathing became more and more ragged. Harry moved his hand farther up her leg; she stiffened and he moved it back down to her calf, worried that he\rquote 
d gone too far too fast, but then she put her hand on his and guided it back where it had been. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 He}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  froze, about to ask whether she was sure, but now her hand was moving up }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 his}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 leg, higher and higher, until finally he choked out, \'93Um, Ginny--\'94 
\par \'93Mmm?\'94 she murmured dreamily, continuing to move her hand in lazy circles on his thigh. 
\par \'93I--I have a couple of--of concerns,\'94 he gasped when her hand made a very sudden move before retreating again. She murmured softly at him again, her lips brushing his jaw. He cleared his throat. \'93First,\'94 he said, \'93we don\rquote 
t really know how soon Hagrid\rquote s going to be walking in that door again. Sandy sometimes tells me these things, but I didn\rquote t wear her to come out this afternoon, as it\rquote s so cold.\'94 
\par She looked up at him with a sly half-smile. \'93Yes, we do know how soon Hagrid might be back. Maggie promised me that she\rquote d keep Hagrid in the Potions dungeon, talking about cooking, until at least--\'94
 she twisted around and looked at his watch; \'93--five thirty.\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Cooking}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 he laughed, hugging her tightly. \'93What\rquote s she going to do? Ask him for his recipe for rock cakes?\'94 
\par \'93If necessary,\'94 she answered, with a very large grin. 
\par Harry lowered his face until it was a fraction of an inch from hers. \'93I\rquote m so glad I found you a sister. She\rquote s }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 far}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  more helpful than any of your brothers....\'94
 
\par She started to laugh at that, but he cut her off, catching her lips with his again. She opened her mouth, her warm tongue flicking out against his. He began moving his hand up her leg again, and groaned when she placed }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 her}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  hand where it had previously been. However, he suddenly remembered that he wasn\rquote t done with his list. 
\par \'93Oh, right,\'94 he said, separating his mouth from hers with difficulty. \'93The second thing. I\rquote m, erm, not really sure how far we--erm, what I mean to say is--have you had a chance--to go see Madam Pomfrey?\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Oh, no}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 she breathed, a panicky look in her eye. Harry nodded grimly, taking his hand out from under her robes and smoothing them down over her lap. 
\par \'93Ah,\'94 he said, his chest tight with disappointment. \'93In that case, we need to exercise some self-con--\'94 He noticed that Ginny didn\rquote 
t seem to be listening, although her eyes were very wide, looking over his shoulder. He turned and saw a pale face under very pale hair looking in at the window. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Bloody hell,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 he spat. \'93Get up, Ginny,\'94 he said quickly. She scrambled to her feet and he pushed past her to the door. 
\par \'93Wait up, Harry! I have to put my shoes back on!\'94 
\par \'93Use magic!\'94 he called over his shoulder to her as he rushed out the door of the hut, following the fresh footsteps through some new-fallen snow. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 The storm must have started when we were in the hut}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , he realized. They\rquote d been too preoccupied to notice that snow was starting to fall. Harry\rquote s teeth were clacking together in the icy wind. 
\par \'93Draco!\'94 he cried in
to the wind, walking with difficulty. When he caught up to the Slytherin, his pale hair disappearing against the whirling snow, he touched his shoulder. Draco Malfoy stiffened, then turned, his face ruddy from the wind, his grey eyes blazing with fury. He
 
pulled his arm back suddenly, and before Harry knew what was happening, he found himself on the cold ground, his jaw aching. He could taste blood. It had been so quick he was having trouble digesting it. He put his hand to his aching jaw and winced; where
 Malfoy\rquote s fist had made contact, the skin was raw and sensitive. The cold made it sting even more. He looked up at the other boy, incredulous. 
\par \'93You }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 hit}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  me!\'94 he couldn\rquote t help exclaiming in shock. Malfoy sneered at him, although he also looked like he might want to cry. 
\par \'93You\rquote re as quick as ever, Potter. Which isn\rquote t saying much,\'94 he drawled. It sounded forced. 
\par Harry struggled to his feet; the wind had died down momentarily. \'93Listen, Draco--\'94 
\par \'93No!\'94 he cried suddenly. \'93You do }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  call me that! Friends use first names. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 We}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

\par Harry looked at him helplessly; he could see the loss in Draco Malfoy\rquote s eyes, behind the anger, as though Harry\rquote s betrayal were far worse than Ginny\rquote s. \'93I\rquote m not a false friend,\'94
 he said levelly, although even to him it sounded hollow. \'93And I\rquote ve made no secret of how I still feel about Ginny. I never lied to you about that.\'94 
\par \'93Oh, no, but you did let me think she wanted nothing to do with you. Ah, well, here she comes now. I don\rquote t know why I\rquote m surprised; I gave her her acting training, now didn\rquote t I? Isn\rquote t }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
that}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  coming back to bite me?\'94 he snapped. Ginny stood before them, her cloak pulled tightly around her. Her mouth was drawn very thin. \'93I should have known you couldn\rquote t stay angry with }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , if you ever were,\'94 he said, speaking to her now. \'93This is Harry-bleeding-Potter we\rquote re talking about, after all. The one you were thinking about every seco

 was I to think a Gryffindor would ever really stoop to being with a Slytherin? You were just slumming with me, weren\rquote t you? Women!\'94 he spat at her. 
\par Harry didn\rquote t say anything; they\rquote d both deceived him, it was true. Draco Malfoy turned his ire on Harry again. 
\par \'93And }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ! Trying to make me think you were pining away for her! God, now I know how Weasley felt when he found out about you and

\par \'93I didn\rquote t know, honestly!\'94 Harry said at last. The wind howled in his ears. \'93I only found out how she felt about me at Christmas. I wanted to tell you, I did! Because I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 do}{

\par Harry turned, hoping the wind had carried Draco Malfoy\rquote s words away, hoping that Ginny hadn\rquote t heard that. But he looked at her face now; she stared at Malfoy, her jaw slack. Then she turned to Harry, looking very hurt. \'93
Is--is that true, Harry?\'94 
\par Harry felt his heart pounding in his ears. \'93No! I loved you in this life before--\'94 
\par \'93I don\rquote t mean that, Harry. I mean about--what he said you did--in your other life--\'94 She couldn\rquote t go on, but continued to look at him with very wide eyes, which grew angrie
r and angrier, until the fire in those brown eyes surpassed that in Draco Malfoy\rquote s. \'93And }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 he}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  knows? You told }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 she hissed, pointing a shaking finger. 
\par Draco Malfoy burst into laughter, the sound blending with the wind\rquote s howls. \'93You still haven\rquote t told her! Ha! I don\rquote t think she\rquote s acting this time, Potter.\'94 He was enjoying himself now. \'93She looks quite--}{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 cross}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 he said with his eyes wide open in innocence, as though looking for the word that would produce the most extreme understatement. With a sneer, he t
urned away from Harry and began to walk up the snowy lawn to the castle. Harry watched him go for a half a minute, hovering between him and the irate Ginny, then ran after him. After a moment he realized that the footsteps he heard meant Ginny was running
 after }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . 
\par \'93Draco!\'94 he cried. \'93Please, you have to understand--\'94 
\par Malfoy turned, his wand in his hand. Harry froze, the tip of the wand inches from his face. Ginny stopped short too, at his elbow. \'93I understand that I was too trusting. I understand that y
ou just take what you want with no regard for anyone else. You sound more like a Slytherin than I do, frankly. I think that needs to change. I think I need to start living up to my house\rquote s reputation. It\rquote s time I started acting like a }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 real}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Slytherin again!\'94 He put his wand away and turned back toward the castle, his shoulders squared against the wind.. 
\par Harry watched him go, a lump in his throat. He was startled when Ginny put her hand on his arm. Her bright red hair was full of snow, so that she almost looked like an old woman, although her face was still young and unlined. \'93
We should get indoors, Harry,\'94 she said simply. He put his arm around her shoulders and together they walked toward the castle, ducking their heads into the wind, and when they were ins
ide the entrance hall, they found that Draco Malfoy had already gone down to the dungeons. They were alone. 
\par Ginny looked helplessly at him; she was drawn and pale under the ruddiness that the wind had temporarily given her. Harry gestured with his head. \'93Let\rquote s go somewhere more private to talk.\'94 She didn\rquote 
t respond but followed him to the anteroom just off the Great Hall. When the door to the room was closed, he started to speak, but she stopped him. 
\par \'93I don\rquote t think I want to hear whatever justifications you\rquote ve come up with between Hagrid\rquote s hut and this room. I just--I just want you to understand what\rquote s really upsetting me,\'94
 she said softly, her eyes meeting his, full of hurt. \'93Or rather, perhaps I should start with what\rquote s }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  upsetting me. Do Ron and Hermione know?\'94
 He shook his head, swallowing. She nodded with understanding. \'93Yeah. You didn\rquote t tell them when you showed them the Pensieve. I get that. Ron would have had kittens and Hermione--well, it would have hurt her a great deal.\'94
 He nodded this time. \'93And so, when I was using the amulet to watch you in the Pensieve, I didn\rquote t find out either. I also understand why you didn\rquote t tell me when they weren\rquote t around. It would be rather--awkward.\'94 
\par \'93I--I already had to tell the Hermione in my other life what kind of relationship we\rquote d had in }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 this}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  one, and I just--I didn\rquote 
t want to go through that again. The hardest part was admitting that although Hermione and I loved each other, we weren\rquote t }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 in}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  love....\'94 
\par \'93Please, Harry,\'94 she said, putting her hand up. She sighed, then continued. \'93All right; I understand }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 completely}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  why you didn\rquote

 understand, especially as you said how awkward it was talking to the other Hermione, is how on earth you could tell }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , of all people!\'94
 Harry saw that she was shaking head to foot, and he longed to take her in his arms, but did not. He drew his lips into a line and looked at her contritely. \'93I mean--you--you have no idea--\'94 
\par And then she started crying in earnest, and he couldn\rquote t remain apart from her, he had to take her in his arms and pull her head onto his shoulder while she wept quietly, her arms holding him as though she might drown otherwise. \'93
Having him know this--it simply makes me feel }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 violated}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , Harry. By him. All over again--\'94 
\par He held her at arm\rquote s length and stared at her. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 What}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par \'93No--I don\rquote t mean he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 actually}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  violated me. I mean that he made me }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 feel}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 violated, repeatedly. The first time you know about, when you found us in the Potions Dungeon on Ron\rquote s sixteenth birthday....The worst times were--were after he had the amulet. He would--\'94
 Her voice dropped to a whisper; Harry had to strain to hear it. \'93He would tell me that he\rquote d been lying in bed watching me sleep while holding the amulet, and he\rquote d--he\rquote d describe what he was doing while he was watching me--\'94
 She shuddered again. \'93Usually he\rquote d tell me that after he\rquote d tried again to get me to sleep with him. Revenge. He knew how it made me feel, to know he was watching me like that. Spying on me. He told me it hardly mattered whe
ther I took my clothes off for him in person, as he\rquote d seen me many times in the shower and bath--\'94 She put her head down on Harry again and he ached inside that he\rquote d made this possible by giving Draco Malfoy the amulets. 
\par \'93I\rquote m so sorry, Ginny. I--I didn\rquote t know how bad it was...\'94 
\par \'93I know you didn\rquote t, Harry. I didn\rquote t like to speak of it. I just had to carry on, pretending to love him, to be his girlfriend. I had to put up with his humiliating me in private and act as though nothing was wrong when we were arou
nd other people. I asked him to stop, but I couldn\rquote t be very insistent, because I was still trying to protect you. I had--I had these nightmares, about Tom, only Tom\rquote s face became Draco\rquote s....\'94 
\par \'93Tom?\'94 Harry said, alarmed. \'93He--he didn\rquote t--\'94 
\par Ginny shook her head. \'93Oh, he was incapable of laying a finger on me, as he wasn\rquote t corporeal until he left the diary. And I doubt that he would have done anything down in the Chamber, as he couldn\rquote 
t risk my waking up. He might have lost some of his strength. No, he--he did things like Draco, earlier, when I was writing in the diary. He\rquote d tell me things that were--rather disturbing for an eleven-year-old girl. Things he\rquote 
d done. With other girls. And alone. And once he took me into the diary and }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 showed}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  me; somehow he was controlling me so that I couldn\rquote 
t close my eyes in order not to see it. I had no choice. And he asked me whether seeing those things made me excited. Draco did that later and I had to try very hard not to spew, it was so like Tom. It was all more than a litt
le unnerving--what both of them did. I know now that Tom was trying to shake me up. Draco, too. Well, it worked. And then he\rquote 
d do something else Draco did later, apologize and beg me to continue talking to him. And I would, against my better judgment, because he had rather mesmerized me....At least I can truly say that Draco did }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  do that. My staying with him was voluntary; I would have done anything to keep you safe.\'94 
\par \'93Well,\'94 he said softly, stroking her cheek. \'93Not }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 anything}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . You didn\rquote t, after all. That\rquote s one reason why he\rquote s upset.\'94 
\par She nodded. \'93I\rquote d say \lquote I\rquote m sorry,\rquote  but I know you didn\rquote t want me to do that either, even for the sake of greater realism. I\rquote m glad it never went that far. At least that\rquote 
s one less thing he can hold over my head. He can say he\rquote s seen me in plenty of private moments, but never }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  kind of private moment. Thank goodness.\'94 
\par She wiped her eyes on her sleeve and stepped back from him. \'93I\rquote m tired of Draco Malfoy playing mind games with me. I\rquote m tired of feeling violated, and like others know things about me that even }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  don\rquote t know. And now I find out that you--you slept with the me in your other life, and you couldn\rquote t be bothered to tell }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, but you told }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . Did you really think he was going to be your friend if you did that?\'94 
\par Harry looked down at his shoes. \'93Maybe. I was obviously wrong. It was stupid....\'94 
\par \'93When was it?\'94 
\par Harry looked up at her. \'93It was when I told him about my other life.\'94 
\par \'93No, I mean--\'94 She swallowed. \'93When did we sleep together?\'94 
\par \'93Oh. Um, it was the night we spent together in the Quidditch changing rooms. During the blizzard.\'94 
\par She nodded. \'93That makes sense. All right, then. Put that in the Pensieve. I\rquote ll look at it tomorrow morning.\'94 
\par \'93Wh--what?\'94 he sputtered. 
\par She looked at him shrewdly. \'93I think I have a right to know about this, Harry. Although I must admit--\'94 She was whispering again. \'93
I always thought that the first time we slept together, it would be the first time for both of us to be together that way. Not the first time for me and the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 second}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  time for yo
u. Unless you slept with the other me more than once--\'94 
\par He shook his head. \'93No. After we came back to the castle, you went into hiding. That was the last time I saw you alive--\'94 he choked out. \'93That\rquote s why, when I fixed the timelines--\'94 She looked at him, stricken. 
\par \'93Oh. Right.\'94 But when he made a move to take her in his arms again, she backed up. \'93I think--I think I need some time alone, Harry.\'94 She looked up at him. \'93I want to see the Pensieve, because I think I have that right. And I know that I
\rquote ll get over this. I love you and I want to be with you. But--I think expecting me to get past this in a matter of minutes isn\rquote t quite fair.\'94 He nodded in agreement. She swallowed and turned toward the door. \'93
All right then. We agree. I\rquote ll eat breakfast early tomorrow. When everyone\rquote s left your dorm, come and get me in the common room. I\rquote ll look at that night in the Pensieve.\'94 
\par She left, closing the door softly behind her. Harry sank down onto the floor, running his hand through his hair. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 He\rquote d made her feel violated.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 The idea haunted him, remembering as he did carrying her to the hospital wing, when he\rquote d thought that Draco Malfoy had attempted to ravish her in the Potions dungeon. It turned out he\rquote 
d come rather close. But somehow, he wondered whether all of Ginny\rquote s efforts to protect him were now for naught, because Malfoy saw them in Hagrid\rquote s hut. The words of the boy he\rquote 
d tried to befriend rang in his ears. He knew that he had to heed what he\rquote d said: 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I think I need to start living up to my house\rquote s reputation. It\rquote s time I started acting like a }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 real}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Slytherin again!}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

\par \'93Is that why you didn\rquote t want to tell me?\'94 she finally said, still not looking at him. \'93Were you--afraid I wouldn\rquote t want to sleep with you in this life if I knew how it went that night? That morning, rather.\'94 
\par Harry felt himself redden. \'93Well--I reckon that was part of it. I also didn\rquote t know how you\rquote d feel about it having happened in general. As you said yesterday, our first time wouldn\rquote t really be }{

\par She finally looked up at him, eyeing him thoughtfully. \'93You were thinner. And taller. And I still can\rquote t get used to the idea of you without the scar.\'94 Her v
oice was very quiet. He tried not to think about her in the Pensieve, looking at his body. The thought was too distracting. \'93I was very thin, as well.\'94 
\par \'93Too thin,\'94 he agreed. \'93It was unhealthy. That\rquote s why--why you thought you were going to have a baby. That and the fact that you hadn\rquote t had the potion.\'94 
\par She tried to smile a little. \'93I have a healthy appetite, with all the running and dueling training. In fact, I keep feeling like I should work out more diligently, lose a little weight. Especially after Mum has sent one of her cakes, or some fudge--
\'94 
\par \'93Don\rquote t say that!\'94 he exclaimed, smiling at her. \'93You\rquote re lovely. You could even stand to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 gain}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  some more weight, as far as I\rquote m concerned. I don

\par She guffawed. \'93Little danger of that.\'94 She paused. \'93Is it possible that you didn't tell me--because you didn't want to repeat that at all? In this life?\'94 
\par His jaw dropped. \'93No!\'94 
\par She grimaced. \'93I had to ask. Sometimes--I'm still not sure whether I'm dreaming. You want to be with me. H
arry Potter actually wants to be with me. You don't know how many times Tom told me that I should forget you, that I was more like him, that you'd never be with someone who'd kill roosters and release a basilisk and lie about it....I believed him, of cour
s
e. I think that was still at the back of my mind when I started seeing Draco. I remembered what Tom said about me, what I deserved, and whether you would ever notice me, which he said was very unlikely, but not in such kind words. Draco said as much; They
 were both always saying }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Potter would never understand you, appreciate you. You're supposed to be with someone like me...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93And you believed them? Oh, Ginny, is that why you did all that to make me believe you hated me? Because you thought that's who you were and had no choice? God! What did they do to you? How could they make you believe that you }{

\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to be a certain way because of his bloo
d, his line. But that's not true. We always have choices, Ginny, every one of us. I botched this up because I chose to tell Draco and not you. I was incredibly stupid. But you don't have to act anymore. You don't have to pretend to love Draco Malfoy or ha

\par She looked up at him gratefully, looking like he might cry. \'93I'll try to work on that, then. But--maybe I need to do that on my own. Some time to really think about who I am. And--and to get over Draco knowing about--\'94 
\par He nodded. \'93Right. Of course. Take all the time you need. I love you; that won't change.\'94 
\par She smiled through her tears at him. He could wait. They would be fine. His heart ached when he thought of the psychological manipulations of both Tom Riddle and Draco Malfoy, the way they'd convinced her to devalue herself, to be like }{

\'94 
\par Ron stopped short, looking back and forth between the two of them and looking mystified. \'93A bit paranoid, aren\rquote t we, Harry? If you }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 had}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

\par \'93What?\'94 they said in unison. Ron had the largest grin Harry had ever seen on him. 
\par \'93The Gringotts siege is over! All of the Death Eaters turned themselves in, and the goblins are asking for immunity in exchange for their testimony against the Death Eaters. They might not all get it. But here\rquote 
s the best part--Remus had been the operative in charge of the Gringotts stand-off. The other operatives all answered to him, and Aurors from the Ministry were working with the operatives at last, too, as they weren\rquote

\rquote s a bloody hero! Anyway, the Great Hall is a madhouse. It\rquote s fantastic, like a huge party. You have to come down!\'94 
\par He pulled Harry to the door and Ginny followed. Ron was not exaggerating; when they were still several flights up from the G
reat Hall they could hear the racket, and when he reached the source of the noise he thought he would go deaf. It was a mystery to him how Ron was able to stand it, with his extra-sensitive werewolf hearing. 
\par The students and teachers were thronging the hall without regard to house tables. People were hugging each other and jumping about excitedly. Someone was punching the air and crying out, \'93Take that, Death Eaters!\'94

\par \'93Oh, Harry! Isn\rquote t it wonderful?\'94 she shouted in his ear, so he could hear her above the din. \'93And Minister Fudge says that Remus is going to get the Order of Merlin! That\rquote s completely unheard-of for a werewolf!\'94 
\par Harry looked around; a number of people were cheering for \'93Professor Lupin.\'94 He grinned; Remus had been a very popular teacher during the two years-Harry\rquote s third and sixth--that he\rquote 
d taught Defense Against the Dark Arts. He shouted at Hermione, \'93Maybe if Mrs. Figg doesn\rquote t stay another year, Remus can get his teaching job back.\'94 
\par Hermione shook her head. \'93I don\rquote t think he\rquote ll want it. The }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Prophet}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  is full of speculation that he\rquote 
s going to be offered a very high-ranking post in the Ministry. It\rquote s about time the rest of the wizarding world found out how wonderful he is, instead of just us! Oh, Harry, this could do }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 wonders}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  for werewolves\rquote  reputations!\'94 Her eyes were shining as she regarded Ron again, who was surrounded by Will Flitwick, Jamaica Thomas, Dean Thomas, Neville and Seamus, who were all patting Ron on the back 
and talking loudly about Remus Lupin being their favorite teacher ever. Ginny grinned at her brother and he enfolded her in a hug that looked slightly painful; she had her hand on her lower back and was smiling less enthusiastically when he released her. 

\par Harry already felt tired from the celebrating. Hermione looked at him, concerned. \'93Are you all right, Harry?\'94 
\par He shrugged. \'93I\rquote ll be fine. Ginny and I are having a rough patch, is all. Well, not a rough patch so much as--we're taking a little break.\'94 
\par Hermione looked disappointed. \'93A break from }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 what}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , precisely? And after what Maggie and I went through yesterday to--\'94 
\par \'93Yes. Thanks for that. But in a way--well, that\rquote s part of why we\rquote re doing this. See, Draco Malfoy knows about us now. He saw us down at Hagrid\rquote s hut. And then he told Ginny--he told her that I\rquote 
d slept with her in my other life.\'94 
\par Hermione\rquote s jaw dropped. \'93He told her what? You did? And }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 he}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  knows? Oh, God, Harry.\'94
 She looked at his face, frowning, then held his jaw with her right hand and surveyed the raw skin where Draco Malfoy had hit him. \'93Is that where this came from? I\rquote d like to kick his--\'94 
\par A roaring chorus of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 For Lupin\rquote s a Jolly Good Fellow}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  drowned out her comment, but when he bent and put his head closer to her mouth, he could make out the 
next thing she said. \'93And why would he tell her that you two had slept together in your other life? What made him think she\rquote d believe that?\'94 Harry looked at her guiltily and her jaw dropped. \'93You never said--\'94 
\par \'93I\rquote m sorry Hermione. I was showing you and Ron my Pensieve at the same time. How do you think he\rquote d react to that? Not to mention, well, I wasn\rquote t too keen on telling you either. Ginny understands why I didn\rquote 
t tell the two of you, and even why I didn\rquote t tell her. She\rquote s upset that I told Draco Malfoy.\'94 
\par Hermione had turned quite pink and she nodded. \'93Yes,\'94 she said shortly. \'93I can see where she\rquote d be upset by that.\'94 Her mouth was drawn very thin, and Harry hoped she didn\rquote 
t hate him now. She glanced at Ginny and then back at Harry. \'93So--?\'94 
\par \'93So I need to give Ginny a little space. She says she has no doubt she\rquote ll get over this, but not in the blink of an eye. Which is understandable. And she needs some time to think about some other things, too.\'94 
\par Hermione snorted. \'93Understandable? I\rquote ll say.\'94 Then she sought out the Slytherin table, which was hard to see for the thronging students and teachers. \'93I don\rquote 
t see Malfoy celebrating the liberation of Gringotts. Or any of the Slytherins, for that matter.\'94 
\par Harry searched the crowd with his eyes as well. \'93No. Did they all leave before Ginny and I came down?\'94 
\par Hermione shrugged. \'93Could be. After people started opening their newspapers, it became mayhem pretty quickly. I wonder whether any of them have parents who turned themselves in. Death Eaters. If I had a mum or dad
 who had just been arrested, even if I didn\rquote t think they were right, I doubt I\rquote d be celebrating.\'94 
\par Harry nodded. \'93Right. I\rquote m just a bit surprised not to see Millicent, or Mariah. For Slytherins, they\rquote re not bad.\'94 
\par Hermione nodded. \'93But I think that\rquote s largely because they like Draco. Millicent--well, she\rquote 
s never had any hope. Sad, really. Draco really takes advantage of her. Do you know I think he gets her to do his homework quite a lot? And Mariah, well--\'94 She guffawed. \'93He takes advantage of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 her}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  in a slightly different way. But let\rquote s face it--both Millicent and Mariah are screwed, no matter which way you look at it.\'94 
\par \'93Hermione!\'94 he said, shocked at her language. Not that he didn\rquote t say far worse, but he wasn\rquote t accustomed to her speaking like this. She laughed. 
\par \'93After almost seven years, you and Ron have been a terrible influence on me. What can I say? Do you think people would fall over in shock if I said something like that during a prefects\rquote  meeting?\'94 She was grinning at him. He laughed. 
\par \'93Probably.\'94 Then he thought of Mariah again. \'93I do think he cares about Mariah, though. She may not have been his first choice, but she helped Ginny, and Ginny thinks she\rquote 
s a good person. Maybe if he ever realizes what a good thing he has in her, she can help keep him--\'94 
\par \'93--from becoming a complete pawn of Voldemort? That would be nice, but we\rquote d hoped that of Ginny, too, didn\rquote t we?\'94 
\par \'93Mariah is with him because she really cares about him, though, not because she\rquote s trying to protect someone else, as Ginny was with me,\'94 he reminded her. 
\par \'93Yes, but if she really cares about him, she could wind up going along with whatever he decides to do. She doesn\rquote t want him to refuse an order from Voldemort and die. I doubt she does, anyway.\'94 Hermione\rquote 
s voice shook. Then she grinned again as Ron grabbed her hand and whirled her away, while someone started singing the Chudley Cannons fight song, laughing and clapping. Harry let himself be swept into the crowd celebrating Remus Lupin\rquote 
s magnificent capture of over twenty-five Death Eaters. But as he did so, he felt rather empty, watching the celebration rage on around him. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I can still hope, can\rquote t I?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

in being Harry's friend, Ginny was still working through her Riddle and Malfoy issues, not making any attempt to spend any time alone with him, Sirius was cross with him after he told him that Draco had found out about him and Ginny, and nothing else good
 had come of the Gringotts siege being over. There were a large number of Death Eaters to be processed and tried. The ringleaders were going to be tried together; the subordinates would have a separate trial. And soon Alicia\rquote s father\rquote 
s trial would begin, which promised to go badly. Or at least, predictably. 
\par Crabbe and Goyle were hanging about with Draco Malfoy again. Millicent and Mariah were still hanging about with him too, so now where he had a gang of three when he was younger, now he was a leader of so
rts amongst the five of them, strutting about with one arm draped over Mariah's shouders while Crabbe and Goyle walked behind, each trying to put }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 their}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 arms around Millicent, in a similar fashion, while she beat them off with a look of disgust on her face 
and an expression of longing aimed at Draco Malfoy. Harry had to be very careful now, for in many of his classes Malfoy's full time occupation had become to prank and irk him at every turn. Putting wrong ingredients in his potions, casting a Contrary Char
m
 on the chair Harry was trying to Transfigure in McGonagall's class, and simply doing puerile things like tripping Harry as he entered the Great Hall for a meal were among the amusements Draco Malfoy had taken up. Harry wanted to take house points for the
s
e things, and he could have, but he restrained himself. He would not deign to notice the aggravating things Malfoy was doing. He wouldn't. After he'd been tripped and was lying, sprawled, on the cold stone floor of the Great Hall before the entire school,
 Mariah mouthed, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Sorry}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, before following Malfoy to the Slytherin table. Harry worried for her. Had Malfoy done the same thing to her he'd already done to Ginny? Did she think she had no }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 choice}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 but to be with Draco Malfoy? 
\par Harry was glad to have the Quiddit
ch match against Ravenclaw to focus on. The first Saturday in February was frigid but without a new fall of snow. The air was crisp and cold as they Gryffindor team made their way to the changing rooms, and when Ron was pacing the floor of the team meetin
g room, Harry met Ginny\rquote s eye and she reddened, looking away. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 It was here,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 he thought, looking at the leather couch where Tony, Neville and Dean were sitting. He thought Ginny might be thinking the same as she glanced up at the house banners hanging on the walls; if it weren\rquote 
t for those banners, they would have been much colder that night. 
\par Finally, they were on the pitch, and when the game started, Harry started flying rings around the second-year boy who had replaced Cho Chang as Ravenclaw Seeker. Soon Ron
 was doing his usual job of racking up points, as he sent the Quaffle hurtling into one goal or another at the Ravenclaw end of the pitch. The crowd was split in its cheering; about half were Gryffindor and Hufflepuff students cheering for Gryffindor, whi
l
e about half were Ravenclaw and Slytherin students cheering for Ravenclaw. Harry saw Draco Malfoy and Mariah Kirkner very briefly, sitting near Millicent Bulstrode. All three of them were on their feet when one of the Ravenclaw Beaters sent a Bludger towa
rd Neville. Neville, however, raised his Beater\rquote s bat and propelled it toward one of the Ravenclaw Chasers. 
\par Ginny allowed three Quaffles to get past her in the time that Ron had put twelve past the Ravenclaw Keeper, but Harry still hadn\rquote t seen the Snitch. 
It was tempting to hover near his own goals, watching her. When he finally gave in to this temptation temporarily, he found himself rewarded by seeing a glimpse of gold out of the corner of his eye. Ginny saw it too. 
\par \'93Harry--\'94
 she started to say, but he was already speeding toward it, down near the far goal post, twenty feet off the ground. He had to chase it in circles around the post before grasping it--which made him dizzy--but when he finally had it in his hand, he breathe
d a sigh of relief and flew upward again to see Ginny, the Snitch held high over his head. But she wasn\rquote t there; she\rquote 
d flown forward to meet the other Gryffindor players, and they were all congratulating each other without Harry, until he finally joined them. 
\par Afterward, the party in the Gryffindor common room went on for hours, during which Harry just watched Ginny, sitting on the opposite side of the room drinking a butterbeer and wanting her so badly. He\rquote 
d hugged her briefly right after the game, but he\rquote d only dared to dance with her once during the party. The wizarding wireless was playing mostly raucous music, and he\rquote d had to wait for a soft, slow song. She\rquote 
d looked down at his shirt the entire time, keeping her distance. Afterward, Zoey had pulled her away, making some excuse, and he had watched her go, feeling bereft. 
\par Harry stayed in the common room long after the others had all gone up to their respective dorms, trying to focus on the good things from the day. He sat with his feet stretched out toward
 the fire, thinking about the match and grinning. The entire team had been brilliant; Ron, Annika, Natalie, Tony, even Neville. And Ginny, especially Ginny. He remembered his own experience as a Keeper; not the easiest thing in the world, after being a Se
eker, but for the most part she kept those Quaffles out of the goals with a single-bloody-mindedness that had proved impossible to beat, combined with Ron\rquote s Chaser prowess and his snagging the Snitch, of course.... 
\par He remembered the way she\rquote d felt in his arms when the entire team had been hugging after the win, how hard it had been }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 to kiss her as he had that time in his fifth year when Hermione had stomped on his foot....Even though she wouldn\rquote t have done that if he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 had}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 kissed Ginny (Hermione was too busy hugging Ron), he somehow didn\rquote t feel like repeating it. He felt like Pavlov\rquote s dog, effectively warned away for life from kissing Ginny Weasley after Quidditch matches. And he hadn\rquote 
t felt that Ginny would welcome a kiss at that moment, either. 
\par He heard a step on the stairs and thought about turning around, but he was so tired he just continued to watch the flames and lean against the chair. He immediately felt every nerve in his body stand to attention when he heard the soft voice. 
\par \'93Harry? What are you doing up?\'94 
\par He didn\rquote t turn to look at her; it was hard enough to see her, day in and day out, without seeing her late at night, too. If he hadn\rquote t been so stupid and just }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 told}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 her about what had happened in the Quidditch changing rooms... 
\par \'93I\rquote m--I\rquote m just a bit wired still. The match. I\rquote ll probably go up soon. Why are you up?\'94 He tried to sound casual. 
\par \'93I\rquote ve got a dreadful ache in my neck from grasping my broomstick so hard during the match. It\rquote s just that I have to fly with one hand, and so the hand I\rquote m not
 using to catch the Quaffle...well, Zoey practically had to pry my hand from the broomstick, and I could feel the strain all along my arm, and shoulders....\'94 
\par \'93So you couldn\rquote t sleep?\'94 
\par \'93Well, that and I thought I\rquote d go to see Madam Pomfrey for some kind of salve, anything to take this pain away....\'94 
\par Harry took a breath before speaking, knowing he was taking a huge risk of being laughed at or scorned. \'93Maybe--maybe I can help. Come here.\'94 He turned to look at her now. She was wearing her old grey dressing go
wn over a long pink nightgown and dirty pink slippers. Her hair was wild and her eyes looked a little bleary, as though she\rquote d tried to get some sleep and the pain wouldn\rquote 
t let her. She walked tentatively to the fire, and Harry opened his legs and patted the hearth rug before him. She started to sit down facing him, looking unsure, but he said, \'93No; face the fire.\'94
 She turned her back to him and sat between his legs, and he felt her shudder for a moment. 
\par He gathered her hair together and twisted it into a t
hick rope which he draped over her shoulder so it was out of the way. He put his hands on both of her shoulders, starting to knead the muscles there and along her upper back and upper arms. But the dressing gown material was bunching annoyingly, and after
 a few minutes, he asked her, \'93Can I take your dressing gown from your shoulders?\'94
 She nodded, saying nothing, and he brought the dressing gown down and pulled her arms out of the sleeves. Her nightdress did not actually have sleeves, just thin little strap
s holding it up, and Harry sucked in his breath, unprepared for this sight. He tried to be clinical about it and return to the massaging, but the longer he looked at that tantalizing little freckle on the back of her neck, the more he wanted to lick it...
. 
\par As he moved his hands over her flesh, he felt her muscles eventually unbunch and at length, a light sheen arose on her neck and shoulders. He was aware of her breathing sounding different, and he moved his head to one side while he continued to knead her
 shoulders, trying to get a glimpse of her face. He could see her in profile, her eyes closed, her mouth slightly open, and he could see her chest rising and falling as her breathing sped up. 
\par He stopped for a moment, both gratified to see that what he was doing was having an effect on her and afraid to do anything that would change this moment, alter the balance in any way. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Willpower,}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he told himself. That\rquote s all you need. He resumed the massage, but a moment later he bit back a moan in his throat as her ha
nds had wandered to her sides and found his legs. He tried to focus, he really did, but now, while he was manipulating her muscles, she was lightly tracing her fingers up and down his legs, occasionally focusing on his very sensitive kneecaps. He was very
 thankful he was still fully clothed.... 
\par He moved his hands over her neck and shoulders and back on autopilot, trying not to think about what her softly caressing fingers were doing to his legs....But finally, he had to go and look at that damn freckle aga
in, and found his mouth being drawn inexorably toward it.... 
\par She sucked in her breath when she felt his mouth on her neck, and he braced himself, waiting for her to put a stop to it. But she didn\rquote t; if anything, the action of her hands on his legs became 
more sensuous than ever and more frantic, until Harry couldn\rquote t help himself, and he moved his mouth from her neck to her shoulder and back again, both sides of her neck, nipping and kissing and sucking.... 
\par He had had to stop massaging her because the area
 where he was kissing was the same area where he had been massaging. Now he brought his hands lightly to her shoulders, tickling the skin there softly and letting his fingers continue down the backs of her upper arms, then the fronts, then focusing briefl
y
 on that supremely sensitive skin in the crooks of her elbows, then the backs of her upper arms again, his fingers lightly tracing her repeatedly as though he were blind and trying to memorize her, and the whole time, his mouth moved on her neck and shoul
d
ers and upper back and he thought he could never have enough of her smooth skin, that nothing had ever sounded so wonderful as her surprised gasp when he gave attention to a spot that had been languishing, Harry-less, until he traced over it with his tong
ue or nipped it lightly with his teeth.... 
\par Her hands were gripping his legs now instead of caressing as he continued to tickle her arms and lick her shoulder, and when she turned and looked at him, the moment their eyes met, Harry knew that she had forgive
n him completely and that she probably wasn\rquote t going to run screaming into the night, either, because he\rquote d told Malfoy that they\rquote d slept together in his other life and had neglected to tell }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 her}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . 
\par Their hands stopped moving, and they looked into each other\rquote s
 eyes for what seemed an eternity. Finally, she turned around completely, kneeling on the hearthrug before him, not breaking eye contact for a moment. She put her hand on his cheek and he covered it with his own hand, knowing that he was her slave, that w
hatever command she gave him, to do this or not do that, he would obey without question. If she demanded that he stop and never touch her again, he would have to agree.... 
\par But she was leaning toward him, and when their lips met, Harry was almost willing to
 believe it was a dream. She continued to press her lips again his, and now he brought his hands up behind her head and held her mouth in place, opening his, running his tongue lightly along her upper teeth, feeling her soft little tongue meet his, the he
at almost undoing him completely. She relaxed on the floor in front of him, twining her fingers in his hair, opening her mouth wider; he shook, not completely certain he wasn\rquote 
t going to weep for joy, doing everything he could to make her a part of him, holding her tightly. He wasn\rquote t sure how long they\rquote d been kissing when she gently pulled her mouth away from his, but she wasn\rquote 
t gone for long. She kissed both corners of his mouth, then moved her lips along his jaw, then up to his ear, sending an electric jolt
 through him. When she clamped her mouth on his neck, he closed his eyes, grunting, trying to calm himself a little; she was driving him mad. 
\par Then her fingers started fluttering over his shirt buttons. She opened the shirt completely, separating from him and looking at his chest appreciatively, giving him a smile that had such raw desire behind it that he really wasn\rquote 
t certain he was awake now instead of dreaming. She moved her mouth down his chest as he continued to caress her shoulders and arms, and when
 she took his left nipple in her warm moist mouth he felt like he would lose all control and rip her clothes off if they didn\rquote t stop soon.... 
\par He tried to distance himself, as before. He really tried. But her hands and mouth were drifting over his torso an
d his breathing became ragged as she pushed him further and further to the point of no return. He looked down at her bright head; her mouth had traced a moist trail down to his trousers, and he knew that this couldn\rquote 
t continue; there was only one thing he wanted to do now, and he knew that they couldn\rquote t afford for things to go that far, since she hadn\rquote t yet taken the potion. 
\par \'93Ginny,\'94 he whispered, and she brought her head up. He wanted to kiss her again, until she was gasping for breath, but instead he said, \'93We have to stop.\'94 She furrowed her brow. He took a breath. \'93If we don\rquote t--I may not be able to--
\'94 
\par He raised his eyebrows at her, and now she said, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Ooooh...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  with a look of understanding on her face. \'93Just put your head on me,\'94 he said, pulling her to h
im so that her head was on his bare chest. \'93How are your arms and shoulders?\'94 
\par \'93Mmmm,\'94 she practically purred with contentment. \'93Much better...\'94 
\par Harry wrapped his arms around her, trying to quell the turmoil in his body, telling it, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Not tonight,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  and }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Settle down.}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 He kissed the top of her head and rocked her back and forth ever so slightly, eventually hearing an odd whistling sound which he remembered was the sound of Ginny sleeping. Her nose whistled when she slept. He smiled to himself and kissed her chee
k, then leaned his head back and closed his eyes. She had forgiven him. That was the important thing. Nothing else mattered.

In the morning, Harry was a bit disoriented. Ginny was stretched out on the hearth rug, her head on his thigh, and he was leaning back against the armchair. He ached all over and his bum felt numb. He wanted to stand, but Ginny would need to be woken up f
or that. He closed his eyes again, not ready to really awaken, unwilling to trade being comfortable for a little more sleep. But then he saw something out of the corner of his eye that he couldn\rquote t ignore. 
\par He was cautious, not wanting to scare her away; he 
watched her work, bustling around the room, fluffing cushions on the squashy armchairs, dusting tables, and finally, creeping near the fire, pointing her hand at it, making it glow with an extra warmth that Harry could feel immediately. Before she could g
et away, he reached out and grasped her wrist; she looked shocked, clearly having assumed that he was still asleep. 
\par \'93Let go! Let go of me!\'94 she squeaked, her brown eyes large and frightened. 
\par \'93Winky, what are you doing here?\'94 
\par She wore the same small black robes he\rquote d seen her in at the Quidditch match, when she\rquote 
d attended with Aberforth, her master. A master who paid her, evidently, and clothed her. She seemed to be past caring about that; all she wanted to do was work, and she was clearly allowed to do that. Then he remembered the flick of black he\rquote 
d seen when he\rquote d entered Alicia\rquote s rooms in the staff wing. Other elves did not wear black robes. He couldn\rquote t think of a single one of the elves he trained--even the ones who\rquote d opted for clothes, freedom and a sal
ary--who dressed like this. Only Winky. 
\par \'93You\rquote ve been here at the castle for a while, haven\rquote t you? You were preparing Alicia\rquote s rooms when she came. Why on earth are you here?\'94 But even as he asked, the answer blossomed in his brain. \'93Aberforth is here, isn\rquote 
t he? Your master. Tell me!\'94 
\par She nodded, her eyes large and frightened. \'93Please, sir, I is needing to tend to more fires, sir,\'94 she said in such a high-pitched voice Harry suspected that dogs in the village would soon be howling. Or Fang. Or Ron. 
\par He released her arm. \'93I\rquote m sorry I frightened you, Winky. Of course you can--\'94 She disappeared with a loud }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 crack!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  before Harry had even finished; \'93--go,\'94
 he trailed off. Ginny yawned and stretched; Harry wished they were in a more private place, preferably with a bed, and that she\rquote 
d taken the Prophylaxis Potion. She looked so sensuous, the fabric of her nightgown shifting over her body as she stretched, her head still on Harry\rquote s thigh. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Stop having those thoughts. Stop having those thoughts,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he ordered himself. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 There are more important things to think of right now.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par She finally opened her eyes and blinked sleepily, sitting up. \'93Oh, goodness! We slept all night down here on the floor?\'94 Then she smiled and leaned toward him. \'93We never woke up next to each other before,\'94
 she observed, smiling affectionately at him before giving him a small kiss on the lips. \'93At least not in this life. I think I can understand why the other me was feeling so randy after sleeping next to you all night with nothing on,\'94
 she said with a throaty suggestiveness to her voice that was new to Harry, and was not making it easy to change his train of thought. Harry wanted to lift her chin with his finger and kiss her tenderly. He wanted to do a dozen things that didn\rquote 
t involve self-control. But this was neither the time nor place. \'93Were you shouting a moment ago, by the way?\'94 she asked. 
\par \'93Yeah. Listen, Ginny. I need you to go upstairs and get Hermione. Be as quick as you can. I\rquote m going up to my dorm to get Ron. It\rquote s very important.\'94 
\par She frowned at him. \'93What is?\'94 
\par He drew his mouth into a line. \'93It\rquote s about Dumbledore. Get Hermione, please!\'94 She scrambled to her feet and went to the girls\rquote  stairs while he stumbled to his feet. It wasn\rquote 
t easy to wake Ron, but Harry finally convinced him to pull on his
 trainers and dressing gown and come downstairs. Ginny was waiting with Hermione; both girls pulled their dressing gowns securely around themselves and waited for Harry to tell them what was going on. 
\par He looked at his two best friends and the girl he loved and said, \'93This may shock you, but this morning when I woke up, I found Winky tending the fire here in the common room. Winky!\'94
 he repeated when none of them showed any indication that this was an extraordinary discovery. \'93She works for }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Aberforth}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  now! An
d I realized why she was here--the reason Professor Dumbledore has been so queer for so long now is that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that isn\rquote t Dumbledore!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  It\rquote s his brother! Something we didn
\rquote t tell you--\'94 he looked guiltily at Ron and Ginny now; \'93--is that some time ago. Hermione and I were in Dumbledore\rquote s office when he didn\rquote t know it, and he wasn\rquote 
t actually in there but in his bed chamber, next door. He was lying abed and Professor McGonagall was talking to him; from the sound of it, he was doing something to fight Voldemort withou
t actually leaving Hogwarts. And sometime since then, Aberforth has come to stay and has been impersonating him, I\rquote m sure of it!\'94 He stared at Ron and Hermione, who were now looking guiltily at each }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 other.
}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  \'93What?\'94 he asked them, irritated that they didn\rquote t say anything about his discovery. 
\par \'93Well, erm, we already knew that, Harry,\'94 said Ron awkwardly. \'93The first day Aberforth showed up I sniffed him out. Literally. Dumbledore smells like a sweetshop. A bit overwhelming sometimes, actually, unless he\rquote s been
 eating his favorite sweet, which has a lemon scent and takes the edge off the sugary smell. Aberforth smells like earth and lawn-clippings. Completely different. I told Hermione right off, and she told me about that time you two heard him and McGonagall.
 We reckoned we shouldn\rquote t say anything, because if Aberforth\rquote s been impersonating his brother, it must be for a good reason, and the fewer people who knew the better, we reckoned.\'94 
\par Harry\rquote s jaw dropped. \'93You couldn\rquote t have told }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par Hermione looked contrite. \'93I\rquote m sorry, Harry. We wanted to, but we just didn\rquote t know what you would do. After all, he talked about how your scar wasn\rquote t hurting you. We worried that you might feel guilty....\'94 
\par \'93Well I do feel bloody guilty! I\rquote d also like to know what he\rquote s really doing! And I intend to find out!\'94 
\par He turned and strode toward the portrait hole. The others followed him into the corridor; he was moving so quickly that only Ron kept up with him effortlessly. Despite all their running, Hermione and Ginny were struggling, a
nd Hermione seemed to have developed a stitch in her side by the time they reached the gargoyle that guarded Dumbledore\rquote s office. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Chocolate Snidget,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 Harry said clearly to the gargoyle. The passage opened and they ascended to the oaken door on the spiral
ing stairs. Harry did not bother knocking but simply opened it, striding across Dumbledore\rquote s unoccupied office to the bed chamber door. 
\par \'93Harry! What do you think you\rquote re doing?\'94 Hermione demanded, the lack of propriety finally getting to her. \'93It is before breakfast on a Sunday morning, and three of us are in our dressing gowns!\'94 
\par Harry turned to her. \'93I am making sure our headmaster is all right. I don\rquote t know about you, but this is something I have to know!\'94 He put his hand on the knob and opened the door. 
\par Despite the early hour and its being Sunday, Dumbledore wasn\rquote 
t alone in the room. A man who looked remarkably like Albus Dumbledore whom Harry now realized was his brother Aberforth was sitting by the bed. He looked up, startled to see Harry and the othe
rs come stumbling into the room. At the foot of the bed stood Professor McGonagall, looking equally shocked by the invasion. But what caught Harry\rquote s attention was the occupant of the bed. 
\par Lying back on simple linen sheets, with a damp cloth on his brow, was Albus Dumbledore. But he was an Albus Dumbledore who was virtually unrecognizable to them all. His breath rasped, echoing around the still chamber. Harry\rquote 
s heart was in his throat. 
\par The headmaster looked like death.

\rquote t wearing his half-moon spectacles. Harry wondered why for only a second; one look at Aberforth's face and he had found the familiar eyeglasses. Evidently Dumbledore didn't have an extra pair. His skin looked sallow and loose, as though he\rquote 
d lost weight, and his wrinkles seemed more pronounced, as a result. His long hair and beard were like old twine that had been thrown in a dustbin and each breath was a painful rasp that echoed around the chamber and made Harry\rquote 
s stomach clench. He swallowed, wondering what they would all do if they lost Dumbledore, then shook himself and tried not to think about that. Which just meant that it kept creeping into his mind. 
\par \'93What do you think you are doing?\'94 McGonagall demanded, when she had recovered from her shock and found her voice. 
\par Harry looked at her levelly. \'93I saw Winky this morning.\'94 
\par That\rquote s all he had to say; McGonagall drew her lips into a line and glared, not at Harry, but at Aberforth. The glaring made sense to him now; when he\rquote d previously seen her and Snape looking askance at Dumbledore, he\rquote 
d found it rather odd. Harry remembered that Professor McGonagall, along with other teachers, had been rather unwelcoming to Aberforth when he\rquote d come to the castle to teach Charms in Professor Flitwick\rquote s place. 
\par \'93Harry! Hermione!\'94 Dumbledore rasped, a smile creasing his worn features. \'93Ah, and we get some Weasleys into the bargain. How nice!
 Come in, come in. I have been feeling under the weather, as you have surmised, but despite my dreadful appearance, I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 am}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  on the mend. I\rquote 
ve quite missed seeing students. You keep me feeling young, you know. Not that your company is anything to sneeze at, Minerva, and you too, Aberforth--\'94 
\par Professor McGonagall appeared to be having a difficult time not exploding. \'93Albus, I must protest!\'94 she said, her voice shaking. \'93No one is to know--\'94 
\par \'93--but clearly they }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 do}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  know, Minerva,\'94 he answered quietly but firmly. \'93Cat\rquote s out of the bag, it seems,\'94
 he added with a small smile, making Professor McGonagall purse her lips in annoyance at the joking reference to her Animagus form. 
\par Aberforth nodded at Ron. \'93I told Albus that you knew right away. I could tell from the look on your face. But why is Harry just finding out? Why didn\rquote t you tell him?\'94 
\par Ron looked embarrassed. \'93I was going to. I just happened to tell Hermione first, and she told me--told me that she and Harry had been in the headmaster\rquote s office and heard Profes
sor McGonagall and Professor Dumbledore talking while he was sick in bed--\'94 
\par \'93Well!\'94 McGonagall countered indignantly. \'93Is there no such thing anymore as a Head Boy and Girl who know the meaning of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 propriety}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par \'93Minerva,\'94 Dumbledore said slowly, \'93clearly there }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 is}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . Harry and Hermione did not tell anyone about that, except for Hermione telling Ron }{

\par Aberforth turned to Harry. \'93Albus was absent from the Great Hall so much that he finally convinced Minerva to contact me and ask fo
r a small favor. I was only needed to impersonate him at meals and in the corridors. The staff have all known about me, of course. With only two exceptions, they don\rquote t know }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 why}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Albus has been indisposed. The speculations have ranged from his being dead to his having infiltrated the Death Eaters from within. In some ways, both are somewhat close to the truth,\'94
 he said somberly (especially for Aberforth), looking at his brother\rquote s pale, drawn face. \'93At any rate, that meant I didn\rquote t need to do any performing at staff meetings, which Minerva very ably presided over. We didn\rquote 
t want the students to panic about their headmaster being incapacitated. And we also didn\rquote t word to get to Voldemort, although he obviously was aware of what Albus was doing once he began in earnest.\'94 
\par Dumbledore looked at Professor McGonagall now. \'93Speaking of not panicking the students, Minerva,\'94 he said, his voice only shaking a little now, \'93you\rquote 
d best be moving along. Soon the early-risers will be in the Great Hall for their breakfasts. I am feeling well enough to entertain some visitors. It will make for a refreshing change, and I know I can trust to their discretion,\'94
 he added, giving each of the four of them a meaningful look. 
\par Professor McGonagall's mouth twisted unpleasantly as she looked at Aberforth; she did not argue, however. \'93Of course, Albus.\'94 She nodded at Harry and the others and said, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Good morning}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 to them, ice in her voice. 
\par After she\rquote d gone, Dumbledore suddenly looked quite tired from the strain of the speaking he\rquote d done so far, as though he\rquote d put on a good show for McGonagall\rquote 
s sake. He closed his eyes, licking dry, cracked lips and letting out a raspy breath again. It didn\rquote t seem to Harry that he was getting stronger. Aberforth, looking so like the headmaster (in better day
s), took a small metal bowl with a damp cloth and began gently to bathe his older brother\rquote s brow. Dumbledore waved him away with a feeble gesture; Aberforth didn\rquote 
t fight him. Dumbledore looked so different from when he first met him, when he was eleven. Harry leaned forward, whispering, \'93What }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 have}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  you been doing?\'94 
\par \'93Inconveniencing Voldemort. Best word for it. For a time, it seemed to be working. However, when we received the news from Sweden about the reservation, I decided that it wasn't enough, and I sto
pped. The strain was incredible, day after day, all my waking hours....\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 What}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? Harry breathed, still mystified. 
\par The old man looked listlessly at him for a moment; with his left hand he tapped the skin covering the artery that ran down behind his ear and thence his neck. \'93Right here,\'94 he rasped, \'93
is where I gave a scar to Tom Riddle when he was eighteen. Accident. But it\rquote s there, and I did it, and it links us.\'94 He stopped abruptly. Harry nodded, waiting for further explanation. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Dumbledore had given Riddle a scar.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  He pointed to Harry\rquote s forehead. \'93Minerva wanted me to repair your scar, when we left you in Surrey. I told her that scars can have their }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 uses}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , and I\rquote ve been right, haven\rquote t I? Apart from any pain you've felt, of course--" 
\par \'93I\rquote ve been able to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 see}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  him, see what he\rquote s up to, or where,\'94 Harry agreed. \'93You\rquote re right; that sometimes has been convenient,\'94 he said quietly. 

\par \'93Wait--\'94 Hermione cut in. \'93What happened when Riddle was eighteen? How did you accidentally scar him? Was it at school, during a dueling demonstration or something?\'94 
\par Dumbledore\rquote s blue eyes lit on Harry. \'93Harry knows.\'94 
\par Harry frowned, dumbfounded. \'93I do?\'94 
\par Dumbledore nodded. \'93You told me once that you read my chocolate frog card your first time on the Hogwarts Express, and later recalled Nicolas Flamel\rquote s name from that....\'94 
\par Harry thought and thought. \'93Well, it said you like bowling and chamber music, and had discovered the twelve uses of dragon\rquote s blood, and the part about Flamel and alchemy...oh, and that you\rquote d defeated the dark wizard Grin
delwald in 1945....\'94 He stopped and looked at his headmaster, starting to understand. 
\par The old man looked levelly at him and nodded. \'93Tom Riddle was a follower of his, briefly, after he finished school. He was there when I defeated Grindelwald. I had gone 
to the Black Forest with my brother and the MacDermids. Unfortunately, Aberforth and I returned without the MacDermids...\'94 
\par \'93Snape\rquote s grandparents,\'94 Harry whispered. Aberforth was the one nodding now. 
\par \'93Stuart MacDermid was a good man,\'94 Aberforth said, \'93and Simone was a fine woman. Outstanding Aurors and human beings. Should have been able to see their kids grow up.\'94 
\par Harry was shocked. Ginny whispered, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Stuart}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Simone}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 and then looked meaningfully at Harry. 
}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 His twin brothers had been named after Snape\rquote s grandparents!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  If he\rquote d been told this in his other life, he\rquote d forgotten. He didn\rquote t }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 think}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he\rquote d been told. 
\par \'93Right,\'94 Aberforth explained. \'93Simone Prud\rquote homme had gone to Beauxbatons. Her family came here fleeing the chaos on the continent caused by Grindelwald, after she finished school.\'94 
\par \'93But--\'94 Ron couldn\rquote t contain himself; \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 how did you defeat Grindelwald}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? How\rquote d you kill him? That\rquote s why Voldemort fears you, I\rquote 
ll bet. He saw you kill another Dark Lord. \'94 
\par Dumbledore looked at Ron kindly, but with a touch of pity in his eyes as well. \'93I didn\rquote t.\'94 
\par Harry frowned, confused. \'93You didn\rquote t? But the card says you did. Not to mention every book Hermione owns.\'94 
\par \'93No, Harry,\'94 Hermione said quickly, her eyes alight with an epiphany. \'93It says he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 defeated}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Grindelwald. Not killed--defeated. It\rquote s different, isn\rquote 
t it, Professor?\'94 
\par Dumbledore smiled at her, looking more like his old self. \'93Ten points for Gryffindor, Miss Granger,\'94 he said weakly. She colored. \'93It is indeed different. You could say I--sent him away. To a place w
here magic does not work, a place of both despair and hope.\'94 He paused, then looked at each of them one at a time. \'93I sent him into limbo.\'94 
\par The four of them frowned in confusion. Aberforth did not look surprised. Finally, Ron dared to say, \'93Into }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 what}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par Harry was worried; Dumbledore looked very weak; his brother handed him a glass of water, helping him sit up straighter so the glass could be tilted enough to let him sip. \'93Limbo,\'94 Aberforth said, while helping him. \'93
Where some souls wait after death.\'94 
\par \'93Wait for what?\'94 Ron said, frowning. 
\par Hermione was looking rather impatient, her hands on her hips. \'93Speaking of waiting--wait a minute. You\rquote re telling me that heaven, hell and limbo are }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 real places}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
? They exist in a solid way, so that if you just had the proper directions, you could take a trip there?\'94 
\par Ron guffawed. \'93Well, that puts a new spin on the expression, \lquote The road to hell...\rquote \'94 
\par Aberforth looked at them all quite calmly. \'93For some people it is very real. For others it is not. It\rquote s as real as you think it is.\'94 The four of them exchanged confused looks again. 
\par \'93I\rquote m not sure I fully understand it myself,\'94 Dumbledore said slowly. \'93In addition to Limbo, Valhalla exists, and Mount Olympus, and other worlds beyond this one populated by gods and demons with whom
 humans have had business over the millenia that we have been sentient, from the time when human-like beings first expected there to be }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 something}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 else after death. Which not everyone expects today, but a large number of people do. And that has only been fo
r roughly ten to thirty thousand years or so, depending upon which archeologists and paleontologists you believe. A hobby that did not get onto my chocolate frog card is that I love to read about the latest archeological news. Fascinating. I found quite a
 lot of useful information for Nicolas that way, when we were doing our research, translating ancient runes found by archeologists who didn\rquote t know what to make of them. Oh, how I itched to tell them what those runes said! I dared not, of course.
\'94 He sighed. \'93Nonetheless, I still harbor my little fantasy of presenting a paper to the Royal Archeology Society.....In my youth, I went on not a few digs myself....\'94 
\par He paused to cough, then took another sip of water before continuing. \'93You see,\'94 Dumbledore rasped, \'93the human consciousness does not cease with death. That is why I have always thought of death as the next \lquote great adventure.\rquote 
 You should also know, if you do not already, that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 every}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  human being has the capacity to do magic--witches and wizards more so tha
n Muggles, obviously, but in large numbers, Muggles can pool their power and do amazing things, for good or evil. The collective human imagination has thus created a plethora of worlds beyond this one where our minds can go after death. 
\par \'93Normally one can only go to those worlds after dying, and by holding a true belief in them. And much as we think we control this, we do not truly have a say over what we believe and what we don\rquote 
t believe. A small child may tell himself that he doesn\rquote t believe there are mon
sters under his bed or in the wardrobe, but when he becomes old enough to sleep without a nightlight, those beliefs may creep back into his brain against his will. And it is not just small children who find themselves believing things that their so-called
 \lquote rational\rquote 
 minds say they should not. Belief is a very tricky thing that way. You can neither force yourself to believe nor disbelieve something. It is like falling in love--you cannot force yourself to love someone else, nor to cease loving. Now, having s
olid, hard evidence of something is an entirely different matter--that is }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 knowledge}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, and quite a different animal from belief. Once we have knowledge of something, such as, oh, the world being round, we cease being able to speak about whether we }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 believe}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  th
e earth is round or flat. It becomes a matter of empirical evidence, not belief.\'94
 He looked shrewdly at Harry, his eyes looking more focused, and Harry remembered Dumbledore telling him that he was highly suggestible and therein lay much of his power, his magical ability. It was his capacity to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
believe}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . Harry hung on the headmaster\rquote s every word. 
\par \'93There are also some spells that have been created--largely by shamans who have undergone journeys to the realm of the dead--that invoke specific realms. Which is 
to say, there is a spell that can invoke Valhalla and allow a wizard to visit the Norse gods. Another spell allows one to invoke Mt. Olympus and visit Zeus himself, if you dare. It is not necessarily }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 safe}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to invoke these worlds and confront these deities, and it is not a prerequisite to believe in their existence if you cast the spell. It is not necessary, for instance, to subscribe to a belief in limbo to invoke it.
\'94 He stopped and began coughing violently; his voice had been dwindling as he was speaking, and Harry went down on his knees by his bedside now, his heart in his throat, his mind saying one thing over and over: }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

\par Ginny put her hand on Harry\rquote s shoulder and he put his hand over hers. When Dumbledore\rquote s cough had subsided again, Ginny said, \'93Do you know why Tom decided to follow Grindelwald?\'94
 Her voice seemed very small in the quiet room, and Harry remembered her talking about Riddle, including telling him about going into the diary. He\rquote d done that too, but he hadn\rquote 
t written in the diary for months and months, letting Riddle into his }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 head}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
. Even in his other life, Draco had largely carried that burden, leaving Harry to merely dabble at the diary writing. He remembered that in the Chamber, Tom had spoken of having to listen to Ginny ramble on about }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
him}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , the Great Harry Potter. He\rquote d been bored by listening to Ginny\rquote s \lquote silly little troubles.\rquote  He\rquote 
d pretended to be sympathetic, understanding. That was clearly before she was so thoroughly in his thrall that he didn\rquote 
t worry anymore about offending her or scaring her. Of all of them, he thought, Tom Riddle as a young man was probably most real to Ginny and Dumbledore, even though Harry had encountered Riddle briefly in the Chamber and in the trees at Godric\rquote 
s Hollow. 
\par \'93Grindelwald was virulently anti-Muggle. Tom responded to that message more than most here at Hogwarts, though he was hardly the only one,\'94
 Dumbledore said, looking at Ginny. Then Harry realized that Dumbledore and Ginny were also the only people he knew who habitually called him plain old \lquote Tom.\rquote  \'93
Soon after he finished his seventh year, Tom disappeared. The Muggle war was winding down; before the end of the term, we\rquote d had VE-Day. The camps in Germany and Poland, among other places, were being liberated b
y Allied Forces. The history books have it wrong--I didn\rquote t confront him before the end of the war, but just after VJ-Day....\'94 
\par \'93VE-Day? VJ-Day? What?\'94 Ron said, frowning. 
\par Aberforth smiled at him. \'93Victory over Europe and Victory over Japan. Middle of Augu
st. A little over a week had passed since the bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Terrible, just terrible. And yet--the atrocities to which those bombs were responding...." He sighed. "Grindelwald gloated over that, you know. Thought it was wond
erful, he did. The bombings. He thought maybe the Muggles would all kill each other off. Grindelwald still held onto his power, even though he\rquote d taken great pleasure in fomenting discord during the war, and it was technically over,\'94
 Aberforth said grimly. \'93
He took advantage of the chaos, people pointing fingers at each other as Allied troops rolled across Germany and France and Poland, among other places. Accusations of being spies and resistance fighters turned around and became accusations of collaboratio
n.\'94 
\par \'93But you obviously didn\rquote t care about that when you decided to go fight him, Professor!\'94 Hermione said, tears in her voice as she gazed proudly at Dumbledore. He shook his head slowly. 
\par \'93I never \lquote decided to go fight Grindelwald,\rquote \'94 Dumbledore said gently. \'93I wasn\rquote 
t planning to go to Germany at all, let alone fight Grindelwald. Yes, he had been attacking wizarding Britain in much the same way the Germans had been attacking Muggle Britain....\'94 
\par \'93They had their Blitz, we had our Battle of Diagon Alley,\'94 Aberforth said, his mouth drawn very thin. \'93We also sent the children up north, as Muggles had sent their children away from London and the focus of the bombings.\'94 
\par His brother nodded. \'93But I was merely a teacher at Hogwarts, not an Auror, not a dark wizard catcher. That was Aberforth\rquote s job.\'94 
\par They looked at Aberforth, dumbstruck. Finally, Ron said, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 You}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  were an Auror?\'94 
\par Aberforth chuckled. \'93Hard to believe, isn\rquote t it? Yes, in those days I was an Auror. It\rquote s not }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 too}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  hard to believe, is it? I was a sprightly nine
ty years old, after all. Still had hair }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 your}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  color,\'94 he said, nodding at Ron. Ron smiled back at him, looking a little abashed. 
\par \'93I only meant--\'94 
\par \'93--that you thought the great Albus Dumbledore was the dark wizard catcher. Well, he definitely became more famous. If there\rquote s something you should have learned from that chocolate frog card, it\rquote 
s that Albus likes a quiet life. Bowling. Chamber music. He spent }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 years}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  researching alchemy with Nicolas. I can\rquote t stand things like that. I like being outdoors, really }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 doing}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  things. I like action. Well, I liked it more at that age. I\rquote m feeling a bit more settled now. But I still prefer the outdoors to being cooped-up inside.\'94 
\par Dumbledore looked at them all one by one. \'93I did not go to Germany to fight Grindelwald. I went to save a young man from himself.\'94 He motioned to Aberforth; the glass of water was produced again; after a good long drink, he continued. \'93
I was worried about Tom for seven years. I feared what he might do if he found out about his heritage, how he might respond. He\rquote d already learned of his mother\rquote 
s family. I knew this because he opened the Chamber of Secrets in his fifth year, and the legend about the Chamber said that only Slytherin\rquote s heir could accomplish this. The
 Marvolo family constantly reminded everyone that they were descended from Slytherin, and Cathy Marvolo was no different. She was also a Parseltongue, as her son eventually would be. I had taught her myself, thirty years earlier. 
\par \'93But there was no way to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 prove}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  that he\rquote 
d opened the Chamber; the evidence he presented before the board of governors and Professor Dippet, our headmaster, made it seem very plausible that Hagrid\rquote s pet had killed the girl, and Hagrid was the least sympathetic person you could imagi
ne when he appeared before the board,\'94 Dumbledore continued. \'93
Even at thirteen he was already quite--substantial. Not to mention nervous. His nerves were misinterpreted as a guilty conscience. I did not believe he was guilty for a minute, but I also had no
 evidence to the contrary that could be presented, only a very strong suspicion about Tom Riddle. I even tried something very dangerous and, well frankly, illegal, to get some evidence of what Tom had done, but it didn\rquote t work....\'94 
\par Harry\rquote s brain lit up with the answer. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 That\rquote s}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  when you used the Time-Turner to go back two hours! You said it was all for nought!\'94 
\par Dumbledore frowned. \'93What? When did I tell you--\'94 he rasped. Then he raised his eyebrows and gazed shrewdly at him. \'93Ah, yes. I think I can guess how you know that--\'94 He gave Harry a small wink, then sighed. \'93
All I could do for Hagrid was arrange for him to be apprenticed to Ogg, the old gamekeeper, so that he could take over when Ogg was ready to retire. It wasn\rquote t easy to convince Dippet to let Hagrid remain within a stone\rquote 
s throw of Hogwarts, even though his wand was broken upon his expulsion, but since Hagrid was essentially an orphan--missing mother and dead father--he finally agreed. He was considered to be my respon
sibility. Not once have I regretted that in over fifty years. 
\par \'93But it was not his heritage as the last heir of Slytherin that I feared Tom would learn; I feared his reaction to learning of his }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Muggle}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 heritage. When a student is Muggle-born and receives a Hogwarts letter, we don\rquote t just let them figure out what to do. You know that, Hermione. We send a school representative to speak to the family. However, we had no way of knowing that Tom hadn
\rquote t grown up with his mother, a witch who would have told Tom that
 he was a wizard. Just as we did not know the extent to which your aunt and uncle hid your heritage from you, Harry. So, when we did not receive an owl from Tom or his mother, I was sent to visit him, just as we sent Hagrid to you.\'94 
\par \'93Is that why I kept receiving so many letters?\'94 Harry asked, frowning. 
\par \'93The letters are another story; they are charmed so that they will continue to come until you open and read one, beginning to end, including the list of supplies. They will come to you wherever you are, addressed appropriately, of course.\'94 
\par Harry nodded. \'93Uncle Vernon thought someone was watching the house because the address kept changing.\'94 Dumbledore gave a small chuckle at that. \'93I did manage to open one, but I didn\rquote t read the whole thing. He snatched it away.\'94 
\par \'93Yes, we were starting to think that there was a problem. Arabella said that the village had become quite overrun with owls. The milkman was rather perplexed about \lquote that crazy old Dursley,\rquote  as he\rquote 
d had to deliver your milk and eggs through a bathroom window, if I recall correctly. Is that right? She asked that it be taken care of before anything was written up in the papers, especially as there might be some mention of your home, Harry.\'94 

\par \'93Why couldn\rquote t }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 she}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  have given me my letter and explained about Hogwarts? She certainly knew how my aunt and uncle felt about magic.\'94 
\par \'93You weren\rquote t to know that she was a witch, and neither were your aunt and uncle. And she certainly did }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 know how they felt about magic. As far as she could tell, they were just very discreet about your being a wizard. They thought she was a Muggle. They weren\rquote t going to discuss this with her, were they?\'94 Harry nodded. \'93
So. Back to Tom. I fetched him from the orphanage myself, explaining to him that he was a wizard and that his mother had been a witch. I told the director of the orphanage that Tom\rquote 
s mother had left him a legacy--a scholarship to her old school. We didn\rquote t discuss Tom\rquote s father. 
\par \'93Later, I became aware that he was spending long hours in the school library researching the Hogwarts founders, especially Slytherin. I heard him say that Muggle-born students were unworthy to attend Hogwarts. He seemed to be parroting what he\rquote 
d read in books about Slytherin--at first. As he grew older, his diatribes became more original. I feared his learning about his father more than ever, the Muggle who had repudiated his mother, leaving Tom to grow up in an orphanage. What I didn\rquote 
t know was that Tom knew about his father even before he opened the chamber. He had evidently done research elsewhere, in the Muggle world.\'94 
\par \'93When Albus learned, quite by chance, that a family of Muggles named Riddle had been mysteriously murdered, and that they were in the pink of health, with no marks on them anywhere, he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 knew}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  what Tom had done,\'94 Aberforth said quietly. \'93He didn\rquote t want to believe it, but all of the evidence pointed in that direction--if you knew where to look, as the Muggle authorities did not, of course.\'94 

\par \'93I also knew that he had to be brought to justice,\'94 Dumbledore said. \'93But not a cruel, imperso
nal justice; a justice tempered by a knowledge of what he had endured as an abandoned child, a son bearing the name of a father who did not want him. I felt Tom needed someone to come to him who knew him when he was a frightened eleven-year-old boy who ha
d just learned that he was a wizard and who had been plucked out of a Muggle orphanage and brought to a world whose existence he had never even suspected.\'94 
\par He stopped for more water. Harry thought his cheeks started to show some spots of color, as though he were being nourished by telling the story. Harry didn\rquote 
t take his eyes off him. Ginny now knelt beside Harry, her head resting on his shoulder, and Hermione and Ron stood side by side at the foot of the bed, where McGonagall had been. 
\par \'93So, I told Aberforth that I was convinced Tom had killed his father and grandparents--\'94 
\par \'93--and I knew that I wouldn\rquote t be able to take him in peacefully without having Albus with me. I needed there to be someone he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 knew}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, someone he would listen to--hopefully. The first step was to find him, so Albus did a very simple thing: he wrote to him.\'94 
\par Dumbledore nodded. \'93I used a tracking spell of my own devising to follow Aberforth\rquote s owl to the Black Forest. We took two other Aurors--the MacDermids. When we first arrived, Stuart, Si
mone and Aberforth hid. Tom was a bit shocked to see me, but I convinced him to spend a few minutes listening to me.\'94 The headmaster heaved a great sigh. \'93He pretended to, that was all. I knew it wasn\rquote t going well. I wasn\rquote 
t reaching him. Finally, he said that he didn\rquote t need to listen to me because I was Muggle-born. Evidently, he\rquote d researched every teacher at Hogwarts.\'94 
\par Ron gasped. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 You\rquote re Muggle-born?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Hermione separated from him, her face a dark scowl. \'93Ron! I\rquote m surprised at you!\'94 She turned to Dumbledore. \'93But--I\rquote m surprised about you, too, Professor,\'94 she said, her voice shaking. \'93
I think I just assumed that you came from an old magical family.\'94 
\par \'93So,\'94 Harry mused, \'93the one wizard Voldemort most fears is Muggle-born. And I knew you were Riddle\rquote s Transfiguration teacher, but it didn\rquote t occur to me that that made it unlikely that you were an Auror. I should have realized you
\rquote d usually be at Hogwarts. And I didn\rquote t know you were Muggle-born....\'94 
\par Dumbledore nodded. \'93Yes, I am. I received my Hogwarts when my brother was only a year old, so unfortunately, I wasn\rquote t able to see him grow up. I was out of school myself when he received }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 his}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  letter. I didn\rquote t even know he was a wizard until after he\rquote d gone to school. I no longer lived in Britain; even long-distance owls need some time to cover six-thousand miles.... 
\par \'93At any rate, I tried to reason with Tom. I told him that I understood that he was upset about his father abandoning his mother for being a witch. I assumed, of course, that he had just found out. I did not know that he\rquote 
d harbored this resentment for years. I also told him that when a wizard uses magic to kill willingly, something changes in him; he would never be happy until he came back home with me, to pay his debt to society....He argued, that even if that }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 were}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to make him happy, the dementors in Azkaban would suck the happiness out of him. I couldn\rquote t argue with that, of course. 
\par \'93He did not wish to talk any longer but said that his Master would be meeting him there soon; if I were still there, Grindelwa
ld might think him a traitor, that it was a trap. Tom aimed his wand at me; I dodged the curse. I attempted to stun him, but he disappeared, Apparating to a point about ten yards behind me. Unfortunately, this allowed him to discover Aberforth and the Mac
Dermids in their hiding places. He let out such a cry of betrayal--he said he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 knew}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  I didn\rquote t want to just talk, that it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  a trap--for him. 
\par \'93They dueled with him; he dodged their curses expertly. A part of me felt rather proud of him, in a way; he was exec
uting some impressive Transfiguration of the rocks and trees around them. I could see that it would be no easy feat, even with three Aurors, to capture the brightest student that Hogwarts had ever seen, and someone who had been learning dark magic at the 
knee of Grindelwald, even for a short time. 
\par \'93The three of them kept on. He continued to hold them off. I tried to sever a tree limb near Tom, to distract him, but a spell from one of the MacDermids\rquote  wands hit my spell in mid-air and it ricocheted, hitting Tom on the neck, scarring him....
\'94 
\par Dumbledore stopped, looking into space, as though seeing the young Tom Riddle, holding off three Aurors and his old teacher single-handedly. \'93He sank to his knees suddenly, holding his neck, and asked us to stop. He said
 he was turning himself in, he couldn\rquote 
t go on fighting. We believed him. I was somewhat disappointed; I had hoped Tom would turn himself willingly, rather than being coerced. He wanted to know what would happen to him. Albus explained some of it, but someh
ow it felt odd to me, like he was stalling, waiting, and I remembered that he\rquote d said that Grindelwald was expected presently....\'94 
\par Aberforth ran his hand over his face. \'93I should have turned in my Auror license then and there. I should have realized what we would be up against once Grindelwald arrived....\'94 
\par \'93To say that Grindelwald was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  happy was putting it lightly,\'94 Dumbledore said, his mouth twisting. \'93
Now, at first, when he appeared, his back was to us. He could see only Tom, and he started speaking to him in German. I could understand, as I have an affinity for languages. Rather useful for research. It was something like, \lquote I hope you haven
\rquote t botched things up again.\rquote  That was the gist. Tom had also been rather good at languages in school. Well, he\rquote d been good at everything. That\rquote s why he\rquote d been Head Boy.\'94
 Harry swallowed and his fingers itched to tear off his Head Boy badge. 
\par \'93Tom took Grindelwald\rquote s verbal abuse, surprising me, but then he said, \lquote My Lord--\rquote  In German. \lquote }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Mein Herr}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\rquote 
 He nodded at me. I had my chance to flee, but I did not. I stood my ground; Grindelwald turned to find me, Aberforth and the MacDermids. To this day, I don\rquote t know why none of us attacked him when his back was turned.\'94
 Suddenly, he set his jaw, a steely lo
ok in his eye that made him truly seem like the old Dumbledore; not the joking, cheerful Dumbledore, but the formidable wizard who had stormed the Defense Against the Dark Arts office with Snape and McGonagall after the Triwizard Tournament. 
\par \'93No. I do kno
w. I think it was a combination of feeling that it was inherently wrong to attack from behind--not sporting, or good form, or whatever you like; and--well, he was quite impressive. When he arrived and started to speak, he was--mesmerizing, even though we 
couldn\rquote t see his face. Dark wizards don\rquote t acquire followers for no reason. They must have a certain chemistry, a charisma. Grindelwald had it. Tom wanted it.\'94 
\par Aberforth nodded, looking sadder than Harry had ever seen him. \'93How I wished afterward that I had just stunned them both...\'94 
\par His brother patted his hand. \'93Now, Aberforth. Water under the bridge.\'94 He sat up a little straighter. \'93He seemed glad to see us for a moment. I think he thought we were new supporters. But Tom told him we were Aurors. I reckon he didn\rquote 
t think it worthwhile to split hairs and identify me as his old Transfiguration teacher. Grindelwald was angry with him, assuming that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 he\rquote d}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 brought us there, that he was guilty of treachery. Tom denied it. He was rather obsequious and told Grindelwald that he had pretended to surrender, which we\rquote d stupidly believed. I doubt that he knew I understood every word.\'94 
\par Dumbledore snorted a little, but it turned into a cough. He leaned forward slightly and his brother patted his back gently. When he was leaning against the pillows again, he said softly, \'93Grindelwald laughed and laughed. Then he said, \lquote What do }
{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 they}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  matter when }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  can do }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 this}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 !\rquote  He put an engorgement charm on his wand, so that it was the size of a walking stick, like an old-fashioned wizard\rquote s s
taff. He struck the ground with it three times and cried out an incantation. He opened limbo.\'94 
\par His mouth was very thin. Aberforth closed his eyes for a moment, as though in pain. \'93It was--I can\rquote t describe it,\'94 Aberforth said slowly. \'93Like the earth being 
ripped in two. A fissure opened up in the ground with us on one side, Grindelwald and Tom Riddle on the other. We could feel something drawing us toward it, like a vortex, and Albus and I hung onto the nearest trees for dear life, to keep from being sucke
d into the chasm. It felt like--like it was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 alive}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , like it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 wanted}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 us to go in. And I still remember how tempting it felt to just let go and allow it to happen....It required all of our strength of mind and body to avoid succumbing. Unfortunately, Stuart and Simone didn\rquote 
t manage to do the same. We watched in horror as they were pulled into the fissure. We had been too concerned about ourselves to notice whether they needed assistance. Tom Riddle clutched a tree for dear life, on the other side of the fissure,
 but Grindelwald was just standing before us, laughing, raising his staff in the air in triumph. Evidently he didn't need to hold onto anything, as we did, although whether it was because he had cast the spell or was just the most powerful among us I don
\rquote t know....\'94 
\par Dumbledore nodded. \'93I had just watched the MacDermids disappear, and I felt a rage as I never had before.\'94 Harry could hear that thread of rage in his voice now, making it taut and precise. \'93I thought very quickly about what to do. It was quite
 simple, really. A summoning charm. I pointed my wand at him and cried, \lquote }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Accio, Grindelwald!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \rquote  He }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 laughed}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  at me. He obviously thought it was the stupidest thing he\rquote d ever seen. But it worked, and soon he was flying toward me, still laughing. Perhaps he thou
ght it was daft because he knew what he would do to me when he reached me. 
\par \'93Then, when he was over the chasm, I raised my wand, pointing it straight up, aborting the spell. Although I know he couldn\rquote t have done, he seemed to float in space for some time b
efore the vortex took him.... As he fell he screamed horrible things in German....\'94 
\par Harry, Hermione and Ginny all gasped. Ron punched the air and cried, \'93Yes! Take that, Grindelwald!\'94 Then he looked around, reddening. Aberforth gave him a small smile, and Harry thought he saw just a slight twinkle appear in Dumbledore\rquote 
s blue eyes. 
\par \'93That is how many people felt when they heard about Grindelwald being defeated. Tom, however, released the tree to which he was clinging, crying, \lquote No!\rquote  and reaching out for his 
Master. He was immediately drawn toward the chasm and I quickly engorged my own wand and struck the ground with it, hoping that the incantation I\rquote 
d chosen would close the fissure. I had not come to the Black Forest so that a young man would be lost--quite 
the opposite. A great wind swept down through the trees and seemed to knit the sundered earth together, and then the ground was whole once more, as if it always had been.\'94 
\par Harry gawped at the headmaster, and Dumbledore nodded. \'93Yes, Harry. I know. Think o
f all the lives that have been lost because I did not allow Tom Riddle to be drawn into limbo with Grindelwald, where he would never have troubled the world again. Do you think a day has passed, in the last fifty-odd years, when I haven\rquote 
t thought of that?\'94 
\par Harry bit his lip, and clenched his fists, the nails digging into his palms. \'93It\rquote s--it\rquote s not that, sir. When I think of what\rquote s happened since Voldemort came back--which he did with Wormtail\rquote 
s help--I think of how I made it possible for Wormtail to get away, to return to Voldemort--\'94 
\par \'93Now, Harry, you could no more have killed Peter Pettigrew in cold blood at the age of thirteen than I could have watched that poor, misguided boy--as I thought he was--plunge into the chasm. Although I told myself that I hadn\rquote 
t killed Grindelwald--technically, I hadn\rquote t--and I wasn\rquote t a murderer, I felt very much like one. Perhaps I wanted to convince myself that I wasn\rquote t a murderer by saving young Tom from the same fate....\'94 
\par He sighed and drank more water. Aberforth said, \'93Riddle was enraged. He screamed, \lquote You ruined everything!\rquote  He clawed at the earth, trying to open it up again. \lquote I was going to kill him myself, eventually!\rquote 
 he said. We were shocked. Were we mistaken? Was Riddle really with Grindelwald to bring him down? But he hadn\rquote t finished. He said that he\rquote d been planning to learn everything he could from Grindelwald, and }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 then}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  get rid of him. Albus and I laughed. We couldn\rquote t help it. This young whelp thought he could bring down Grindelwald!\'94 
\par Albus shook his head. \'93It\rquote s possible that Grindelwald would still be wreaking havoc if he hadn\rquote t opened up limbo himself, and if I hadn\rquote 
t surprised him with the utter simplicity of my summoning charm. It would never have occurred to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to open limbo. My rage over Stuart and Simone prob
ably helped focus my power. It is also possible that Grindelwald }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 couldn\rquote t}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 have been killed. There were rumors that Grindelwald had somehow made himself immortal--or nearly so. Many stories were floating about, telling of wizards who had attacked him in ways that should have killed him but did not.\'94 
\par Harry nodded. \'93That\rquote s what Riddle wanted....\'94 
\par \'93Yes, Harry. Tom wanted the ultimate power: immortality. But I knew how overrated it was. I was the one, after all, who had done numerous experiments to find an Eli
xir that did not make Nicolas and his wife ill after drinking it. We even tried making a new stone. We thought--if we created a new stone, altering the process slightly, the resulting potion might not be so debilitating. Yes, they had already lived for hu
ndreds of years when I came along. But it wasn\rquote 
t a peaceful life. However, he tempted me with it. I thought long and hard over whether I wanted to partake, finally refusing. I left it to him and his wife. I was quite young at the time and rather thought I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  immortal without the benefit of any potion. That is the gift of youth,\'94 he said, smiling at the four students hanging on his every word. 
\par \'93I shook my head at Tom and said to him, \lquote You wouldn\rquote t be able to do that, Tom. I know you let that creature of Slytherin\rquote 
s--whatever it was--kill Myrtle, and that you killed your father and grandparents, but I still believe that, deep down, you want to atone for those deaths. You\rquote re a good boy, Tom.\rquote 
 I repeated that, walking toward him; he looked like I had stabbed hi
m. His eyes were wide with pain; he clutched his neck and began rolling on the ground. I was shocked and I stopped speaking. Tom was just getting his breath back when I experimented; I said again, \lquote You\rquote re a good boy, Tom,\rquote 
 and I made sure that I really was thinking that, that I wasn\rquote t just mouthing the words. \lquote You\rquote re a good boy and we want to help you. We care what happens to you. You\rquote re a good boy, Tom.\rquote \'94 
\par \'93\lquote Stop saying that, old man!\rquote  Riddle screamed,\'94 Aberforth told them, his voice shrill when imitating Tom Riddle. \'93Oh, he looked mad with pain. Albus\rquote 
 good thoughts were doing that. He was enraged, down on his knees with a hand pressed to the scar.\'94 
\par Dumbledore looked into space. \'93I remember everything he said after that. It haunted me, after he rose to power almost thirty years ago, and after you and Ginny emerged from the Chamber alive, with Riddle\rquote s destroyed diary,\'94
 he said, turning his head to Ginny and Harry. \'93\lquote He said, \lquote No. I am not good. I am everything that good abhors. And more. Much more. You wil
l find out some day, old man. You think you know so much, that I killed that Mudblood, Myrtle? Yes, I did. With help from the great Salazar Slytherin.\rquote  He gave us a quite evil-looking smile and said, \lquote Myrtle won\rquote 
t be the last to die at Hogwarts. I left a b
it of myself at the school, just waiting for the right accomplice. The Chamber of Secrets shall be opened again, and the school Slytherin helped create will be purged of Muggle-born scum like you once and for all!\rquote \'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 The diary}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 Hermione breathed, clutching at Ron. Harry looked at Ginny\rquote 
s face, which was very white, under her freckles. He put his arm around her shaking shoulders. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Not you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 he whispered to her. \'93Lucius Malfoy. He must have found the diary in Slytherin House, wrote in it, found out what it was, then saved it for a rainy day.\'94 

\par Dumbledore nodded. \'93You\rquote re probably right, Harry. Lucius Malfoy was Head Boy in his time, as Tom Riddle had been. He finished school not long after Voldemort first rose to power; I often heard him speak admiringly of Voldemort. He didn\rquote 
t know I was about, of course, when he said these things.\'94 
\par Harry looked at him shrewdly. \'93Were you perhaps--invisible? In my other life, I saw you suddenly }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 become}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  visible once....How do you do that?\'94 he asked softly. 
\par The edge of Dumbledore\rquote s mouth curled up as he said, \'93Now that would be telling.\'94 
\par Ron looked impatient. \'93Oh, come on! How did Riddle get away? Why couldn\rquote t you have just sent another owl, to track him down again?\'94 
\par Dumbledore sighed. \'93Tom wasn\rquote t done. He said, \lquote You found me once because of my name, my filthy Muggle father\rquote s name. That is no longer }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 my}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 name; I shall have a new name, a new identity, and although every witch and wizard shall know it well someday and tremble to say it, until that time, you shall not be able to f
ind me! Then shall all the wizarding world long for the halcyon days of Lord Grindelwald!\rquote 
 Well, after this rather grandiose speech, he Disapparated. He might have tried to kill us again, I reckon, but then we would not be able tell the world of the next great dark wizard....\'94 
\par \'93I was the one who told the Ministry about Grindelwald,\'94 Aberforth said. \'93Albus didn\rquote t want credit. \lquote I didn\rquote t go to the Black Forest alone, Aberforth,\rquote  he kept saying to me.\'94 Aberforth grinned. \'93I wouldn\rquote 
t hear it. My brother had defeated Grindelwald and I wanted the world to know,\'94 he said, looking at Dumbledore with affection and pride. \'93
He received the Order of Merlin, first class, of course, and was immediately invited to join the International Confederation of Wizards with the rank of Grand Sorcerer. In the end, we didn\rquote t say anything about Riddle. It seemed--out of place.\'94
 He nodded sadly at his brother. \'93It was what he wanted, and I understood. People were celebrating the end of Grindelwald. It wasn\rquote t the time to induce panic ab
out a new dark lord, when Riddle might never acquire the sort of power Grindelwald had.\'94 
\par Harry looked at Dumbledore. \'93So how have you been fighting him? I don\rquote t understand.\'94 
\par \'93Your scar,\'94 Dumbledore said, \'93hurts you when Voldemort is feeling particularly evil. I think that is in part because such things are anathema to you--foreign. When I was thinking good thoughts at Tom, he felt pain in the scar I gave him. }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Those}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  thoughts were alien to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  He had been in
strumental in a young girl being killed when he was only sixteen. He\rquote d killed his father and grandparents. He\rquote d done whatever Grindelwald had asked since he\rquote d started trailing around after him. He was the heir of Slytherin. Tom didn
\rquote t think he was good and no one else was supposed to, either. 
\par \'93We tried sending another owl, but he kept his promise of our not being able to find him. The owl came back. I suspect that he made himself owl-proof as \lquote Tom Riddle,\rquote  so that he could not receive post under that name, and we didn\rquote 
t know yet what new name he had adopted, so we could no longer rely on that method to locate him.\'94 
\par \'93So,\'94 Hermione said softly, \'93you\rquote ve been causing Voldemort pain by--what? Thinking nice things at him? God. What good opinions could }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 anyone}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  hav
e about him by now? Trying to do that would be enough to send me to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 my}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  sickbed, too.\'94 
\par They all laughed, but Harry, Ginny and Ron quickly attempted to stifle their laughter, looking guilty. Dumbledore shooed their guilt away with his hand. \'93Laugh! If we\rquote ve reached the point where we\rquote 
re afraid of the impropriety of laughing, then he has won.\'94 He looked at Harry. \'93Just as a boggart can\rquote t stand laughter, so Voldemort cannot stand someone thinking well of him, having }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 good}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  opinions about him. Fearing him, yes. Admiring him, again, yes. But }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  thinking he is good.\'94 
\par Ron frowned. \'93Yeah, but I think Hermione had a point. How do you think good things about Voldemort? Wouldn\rquote t you need some kind of--I don\rquote t know--\'94 Ron said, waving his arms helplessly, \'93--memory char
m to forget all of the terrible things he\rquote s done?\'94 
\par Dumbledore smiled at him. \'93Ah, there\rquote s that incisive ability to stumble on the solution when being flippant. That is }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 precisely}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 what we did. I had Professor McGonagall put memory charms on me. They were ac
tually more like recall charms. I was sent back in my thinking to a time when Tom was a new Hogwarts student. I was able to vividly recall the wonder in his face during his first Transfiguration lesson... It was a time Tom truly was a good boy, an innocen
t lad. So, I was able to concentrate on sending truly good thoughts about him }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 to}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 him and, as a result, disrupt his other thought processes. Between the memory charms and making a concerted effort to think good thoughts at Voldemort--or rather, Tom--much of 
the day, I was under quite a strain and quickly took to my bed. It's not as easy as it sounds; it took quite a lot out of me.\'94 
\par Ginny gave him a small smile. \'93You were killing him with kindness,\'94 she said quietly. 
\par Dumbledore smiled back at her; Harry saw another small twinkle. \'93Not really killing. Unless you consider that I called him }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Tom}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  in my thoughts. In a way, I }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  trying to kill Voldemort, but I also wanted to resurrect the boy, Tom Riddle. Because of Minerva\rquote s charms, I was able to forget the man and consistently see in my mind
\rquote s eye the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 boy}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 Then he looked rather sad. \'93I decided to stop what I was doing after the news from Sweden,\'94 he said quietly. \'93
I decided that I needed to get my strength back.\'94 
\par \'93But the Death Eaters at Gringotts surrendered!\'94 Ron said brightly. 
\par Dumbledore nodded somberly. \'93Yes, good news. I sent Remus a note of congratulations and said we must have a tea party, recipients of the Order of Merlin only....\'94 
\par Aberforth brightened. \'93Good! I can come.\'94 
\par Ron looked unflatteringly surprised. \'93You!\'94 
\par Aberforth bristled slightly. \'93Yes. When we returned from Germany, Albus refused to accept the Order of Merlin unless I received it as well. I only received third class, but I still have my O.M. badge at home somewhere.\'94 
\par \'93And it's been about two months since the broom race, Professor,\'94 Harry said excitedly. \'93Voldemort hasn\rquote t done anything since then, so it doesn\rquote t seem }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 too}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 dreadful that you\rquote re not doing it anymore. There haven\rquote t been any attacks, only the Gringotts surrender. I haven\rquote t felt so much as a twinge from my scar.\'94 
\par Dumbledore nodded. \'93Yes. That is what concerns me....\'94 He began coughing again and accepted the glass of water from Aberforth once more. 
\par \'93I think that\rquote s enough for your headmaster for the time being. He }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 is}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  still recovering. You should go down to breakfast,\'94 Aberforth told them. 
\par Harry put his hand out to Dumbledore, who took it. \'93Thank you for what you\rquote ve done. I can tell it hasn\rquote t been easy, and I\rquote m glad you\rquote re going to be all right,\'94 he said earnestly. 
\par \'93Eventually, \'94 Dumbledore said, waving away Harry\rquote s concern. \'93If only I had been able to do more....\'94 
\par They returned to Gryffindor Tower so they could shower and change their clothes; Harry finished first, and as he waited for the others to return to the common room, he fingered his scar tentatively. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Voldemort knew he could get to me through the curse scar because he has one,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 he thought. He traced the lightning bolt, thinking about poor Dumbledore having to think nice things about Voldemort and about his defeating Grindelwald. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 It\rquote s even possible that Grindelwald couldn\rquote 
t have been killed. There were rumors that he\rquote d somehow made himself immortal--or very nearly so.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Had Voldemort strengthened himself again, so that he couldn\rquote 
t actually be killed? Harry wondered. If not--how far along the path to immortality }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he? 
\par Harry was glad when the others returned and they left. He could think about that afternoon\rquote s Dueling Club meeting, and Quidditch and what he wanted for breakfast. 
\par However, he had to think about something else entirely when Ruth and Tony looked up at the four of them in surprise. \'93Oh, there you all are,\'94 Ruth said, raising her eyebrows. \'93
We waited and waited, but we finally decided to go running without you.\'94 Ginny was next to Harry and Ruth was on her other side; Harry heard her say, leaning close to Ginny, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 And you\rquote 
ll have to tell me later why you weren\rquote t in your bed this morning.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Harry saw that Ron, across the table, had heard this comment; his nostrils were flaring and he was glaring at Harry, his jaw clenched. \'93Could I speak to you for a minute, Harry?\'94 
\par Harry put down the kipper he\rquote d been about to bite. \'93Erm, sure,\'94 he said, trying not to sound panicked. He followed Ron to the entrance hall; Ron opened the castle\rquote s front door and they stepped outside. Harry shivered in the cold. \'93
Before you say anything Ron--\'94 
\par \'93No, I don\rquote t think you shagged my sister, because I didn\rquote t smell that on either one of you, but I\rquote ll just bet you were }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 thinking}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  about it--\'94 
\par Harry threw up his hands. \'93Well, of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 course}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  I was thinking about it. For pete\rquote s sake, Ron. I\rquote m a human being. But Ginny hasn\rquote 
t taken the potion yet. Do you think I want to go through worrying about that all over again?\'94 As soon as he said it, he wanted to bite his tongue. Ron\rquote s eyes looked like they were going to leap out of his head. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 What}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  did you say?\'94 
\par Harry cleared his throat. \'93I mean--what I meant to say was--oh, bollocks. Just listen to what I have to say and promise you won\rquote t lose your temper. At least until I\rquote m done.\'94 
\par Ron, arms crossed, leaned against the closed door, as though cutting off Harry\rquote s escape. He didn\rquote t appear to feel cold at all. Harry hugged his arms to his chest and spoke quickly, explaining about the night in the Quidditch changing rooms. 
\'93That\rquote s why you came out of hiding--you thought Ginny was pregnant. That led to Binns finding out you were alive--\'94 
\par Ron seemed to be having a hard time restraining himself. \'93Why didn\rquote t you tell me this?\'94 
\par \'93Why? I was showing you and Hermione my Pensieve. Hermione was still my girlfriend when I was with Ginny. Technically. And you\rquote re Ginny\rquote s brother. I was supposed to tell the pair of you I\rquote 
d slept with her, even in another life? And I thought }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Ginny}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  was upset--\'94 
\par Ron\rquote s eyebrows flew up. \'93Ginny knows? And to get back to our original topic, would you happen to know why she wasn\rquote t in her bed this morning?\'94 
\par \'93She was downstairs with me. We fell asleep in front of the fire. It was perfectly innocent.\'94 }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 It almost wasn\rquote t,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 he thought, but technically, he was telling the truth. 
\par Ron looked shrewdly at him. \'93And Ginny wasn\rquote t upset when she found out about this?\'94 
\par \'93Well, of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 course}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  she was upset. Why do you think we spent a couple of weeks apart? You think that was just for the sake of appearances? I was waiting for her to forgive me.
\'94 
\par \'93For shagging her? Or for not telling her?\'94 Ron ground out, his jaw clenched again. 
\par Harry grimaced. \'93For telling Draco Malfoy about it.\'94 
\par Ron grabbed Harry by the shoulders and put him up against the castle door. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 What}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par \'93Please put me down,\'94 Harry squeaked; his feet were a good six inches off the ground. Ron relented and Harry slumped against the door. He cleared his throat. \'93Malfoy let it \lquote accidentally\rquote  slip to her after he saw us in Hagrid
\rquote s cabin, that time we were supposed to be having tea with him and you and Hermione left to duel with Tony and Ruth.\'94 
\par Ron\rquote s mouth hung open. \'93And where was Hagrid?\'94 he finally managed to say. 
\par \'93He had to take some newts to the castle, for Snape. Evidently, Hermione\rquote s part was getting you out of there, and Maggie took care of Hagrid.\'94 
\par Ron paced, running his fingers through his hair. \'93Oh, lovely. Hermione and Maggie. My girlfriend and my sister are trying to help my }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 other}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  sister lose her virginity. Smashin
g.\'94 
\par \'93No, Ron!\'94 Harry said quickly. \'93It was just to let us have some time alone. That\rquote s all--\'94 
\par Ron shook his head, evidently thinking of something else now. \'93How could you tell Malfoy, Harry?\'94 he said softly. Harry looked about for a hole to fall into. 
\par \'93I know. It was stupid. But I have to ask, Ron--how are you going to respond when--\'94 
\par Ron ran his hand through his hair. \'93I\rquote ll try to restrain myself, Harry. Being overprotective is a tough habit to break. You know what it's like--you had a sister. If Ginny\rquote s happy, I reckon it\rquote ll be easier. But I can\rquote 
t vouch for our other brothers. A fair warning. And you\rquote d bloody well better not hurt her.\'94 
\par Harry gave his best friend a lop-sided smile. \'93That\rquote s the last thing in the world I want, Ron, believe me. I also have to admit--I\rquote 
m a little superstitious about this. In my other life, we had no sooner spent the night together when she had to go into hiding. I don\rquote t know--maybe I\rquote m afraid that if we do the same thing in this life, we\rquote 
re just asking for trouble. Maybe we\rquote re jinxed. I\rquote m probably being stupid, but--when I think about that, it actually hasn\rquote t been that hard to control myself. I don\rquote t want anything to happen to Ginny.\'94 
\par Ron put his hand on Harry\rquote s shoulder now. \'93If you want to think you shouldn\rquote t sleep with my sister because you\rquote re jinxed, that\rquote s fine with me, Harry,\'94 he said solemnly. 
\par Harry batted his hand away, laughing. \'93Oh, yeah, as though you\rquote d have a problem with my thinking that. I\rquote m not saying that I really believe that. I just--I think about it sometimes in a sort of \lquote what-if\rquote  way. I know it
\rquote s stupid--\'94 
\par \'93No, no, you should absolutely consider that it might be true, Harry,\'94 Ron said, putting his arm around Harry\rquote s shoulders and opening the heavy front door like it weighed nothing. 
\par Harry laughed again. \'93Are we all right?\'94 
\par He was relieved to see Ron smiling at him now. \'93Yes, Harry. We\rquote re fine.\'94 
\par Hermione and Ginny emerged from the Great Hall; Ginny was carrying some toast in a napkin, which she handed to Harry. \'93Fine about what?\'94 she asked, looking bac
k and forth between Harry and Ron. Harry put his arm around her and kissed her on the cheek. 
\par \'93Ron\rquote s decided to try to turn over a new leaf when it comes to his attitude about us.\'94 
\par \'93He has, has he?\'94 she said, looking amused. \'93I\rquote ll believe it when I see it.\'94 
\par Ron huffed at her and made it very easy for Harry to picture him at about the age of five. \'93I can be as mature about this as anyone,\'94 he said, his expression verging on a pout. 
\par Hermione was trying not to laugh. \'93Come on, Mr. Maturity. We were going to write those History of Magic essays before lunch.\'94 She pulled him up the marble stairs. 
\par He followed her, saying, \'93Oh, and I have a bone to pick with you, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Miss}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Granger--\'94 
\par Harry took a bite of toast and followed while Ron give Hermione a piece of his mind about conspiring to get him out of Hagrid\rquote 
s cabin. Harry's arm was still around Ginny, who smiled sunnily at him, making him feel warm inside. However, when they reached the landing, his senses were all on alert, as though someone was watching. He looked 
down; glaring up at him from the foot of the stairs were the blazing grey eyes of Draco Malfoy.

Ron was holding his middle and panting for breath, sitting on the cold stone floor in the Great Hall. "How did you dodge that Passus Curse?" he asked Harry. "I was certain I was going to hit you." 
\par "Oh, right. That reminds me." He directed his words to his left upper arm now. "Thanks for the warning about Ron's curse, Sandy." 
\par "You know that I do not--" 
\par "--have any control over what you See. I know, I know. Thanks anyway." 
\par Ron looked particularly disgruntled while the hissing conversation was occuring. "Cheat," he said softly. 
\par "It's no more cheating to be a Parselmouth than to be a werewolf," Harry asserted. 
\par "Took your time removing that tickling charm, though, didn't you Harry?" Harry grimaced and put out his hand to help Ron rise; the hand was ignored and he stood unassisted. 
\par "Yeah, well, you were being pretty hard on Hermione when you were dueling her. She already apologized for not telling you about Hagrid's hut. Keeping the Inverso Charm on her as long as you did wasn't very nice. She nearly spewed her lunch." 
\par "Well, what's she doing trying to give the two of you opportunities to be alone, anyway? You're her ex-boyfriend. Surely that's not }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 normal}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
..." he started to say, when his face suddenly lit up, as though she'd had a revelation. "I know why," he breathed, looking at her with narrowed eyes. "Guilt," he informed Harry. 
\par "Guilt," Harry said with almost no inflection; he was not convinced. 
\par "Yeah. Even though she was under the influence of that potion for months, she }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 knew}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  how Ginny felt about you. Sh
e went after the bloke her friend fancied. Guilt. Oh, come on, Harry. You've said as much to me about what you did. You knew how I felt about Hermione, and--" 
\par "--and after I tried to get you to do something about it and you stubbornly refused--" 
\par "Oh, we are }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  having }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 conversation again," Ron said, rolling his eyes, even though he'd started it. He brushed himself off, looking at Hermione, who was very pointedly }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 looking at him but conversing with Ginny and Maggie. Ron and Ginny's sister had come t
o watch the dueling. Harry noticed Draco Malfoy on the other side of the room, where he'd been dueling with Tony Perugia. Harry didn't know whether he was ignoring him, Ron and Hermione (and Ginny) or just pretending to. The other Dueling Club members wer
e starting to disperse. 
\par "I couldn't believe what you were all doing to each other!" Harry heard Maggie saying to the girls. "I've chewed my nails down to the quick just watching!" 
\par Ginny and Hermione smiled at her, and it seemed to Harry that Hermione gave Ron a very cold glance out of the corner of her eye. 
\par "Well," Hermione said, never looking directly at Ron, "we're supposed to be pulling our punches, of course. But some people can get carried away...." 
\par As the captain, Harry used his wand to help Snape 
move the tables back into position in the Great Hall, remaining behind when the others left. He noticed that Ron and Hermione were not touching, although they walked next to each other up the marble stairs. Ginny walked up the stairs behind them, talking 
animatedly with her sister. She gave Harry a smile before disappearing from sight. Draco Malfoy had already removed himself from the Great Hall and was nowhere to be seen. 
\par Before Snape strode out of the hall, Harry stopped him. "Sir; can I ask you something?" 
\par Snape turned to look at Harry with one brow raised inquisitively. "Yes, Harry?" 
\par He'd almost expected Snape to call him 'Potter' again, just as Draco Malfoy had returned to calling him that. "Well, I was wondering--you're not cross with Maggie, are you? Because of Hagrid and the newts?" 
\par Snape turned to fully face him now, his arms crossed on his chest. "Would you care to begin making sense at some point, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Mr.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Potter?" 
\par There went the 'Harry.' "I meant--when Hagrid brought the newts for the potion--" 
\par Snape nodded now, understanding. "Yes; I wondered when Miss Dougherty developed an interest in baking. She was speaking to Hagrid about it for quite some time. Why should I be cross with her for that?" 
\par "Erm, no reason," Harry mumbled, starting to climb the marble stairs himself. 
\par "Would this have anything to do with the fact that Draco Malfoy discovered you and Miss Weasley in Hagrid's otherwise empty hut that afternoon?" Snape said slowly and evenly, his face an impassive mask. 
\par Harry froze. He looked down where Snape stood in the curve of the stairs, so that he didn't need to turn to see him. "I didn't know that was general knowledge among the staff. Or anyone else." His voice shook. 
\par "It is not. Professor Black told me. He evidently had no one else to speak to about this and decided to waste almost an hour of my time which could have been spent marking tedious essays by the third year Hufflepuffs." 
\par It wasn't easy to see, but Harry could detect the corner of his mouth starting to curve upward. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 He's enjoying this}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, Harry realized. "I'm sorry he took up so much of your time," he responded very formally. 
\par "I am not a bit sorry that you were caught, however. It is all out in the open now. That was going to happen in the long run." He took in the look
 of surprise on Harry's face; then Harry realized that Maggie had probably told Snape about him and Ginny. "I have been telling Professor Black that you should tell Mr. Malfoy about--" 
\par "Me too!" Harry interrupted, grinning. Snape looked at him, tight-lipped, but said nothing. "I mean, I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 tried}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 to tell Sirius that it should come from me. I know he thought it was putting too many people at risk, including Draco, but now Draco hates me again...." 
\par Snape sniffed. "Are you surprised? He and Miss Weasley were together for some time, and he glances in Hagrid's window and sees the pair of you--well, I can imagine what he saw." 
\par "No, you can't!" Harry burst out defensively. "I mean--we were just sitting and talking!" 
\par "Just--?" There went those eyebrows again. 
\par "And, erm, well, while we were talking, she was sitting on my lap," he said softly. Okay, he thought; we weren't }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 just}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  talking.... 
\par The corner of Snape's mouth was curling up slightly again. "Which doesn't look the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 least}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  bit incriminating," he said, voice dripping with sarcasm. 
\par Harry grimaced and sat on the steps. To his surprise, Snape climbed the steps and sat next to him, looking straight ahead, his forearms propped on his bony knees. "I was only in Slytherin House with Lucius Malfoy for a year," he said sudd
enly, "as he was Head Boy when I started school. But you are aware that he recruited me for the Dark Lord. I believe I can shed some light for you on the Malfoy psyche. If you are willing to listen to the voice of experience." 
\par Harry looked down at his hands, then up at the man he'd known for so long as his stepfather. "Erm, yeah, I'd like that." 
\par "First--if there is something you don't want a Malfoy to learn about but think it likely or at least possible he will eventually, tell him yourself first. That wa
y you can be in complete control of the situation." Harry nodded. That made sense. "Second, if that approach fails, either because he learns about it from another source or does not take the news well, do not get defensive. Apologize profusely. Make him t
hink that you }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 knew}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 he knew and wanted to avoid forcing him to dwell on it. If you can, make it sound like you were under the impression that it was his idea to do this. Even better is to find a way to convince him that it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  his idea." 
\par Harry frowned. "I'm not sure how I would have done that..." 
\par "How did Mr. Malfoy react when he learned about you and Miss Weasley?" 
\par "Well, at first he stalked off. I went after him. Then he hit me. I probably should have taken house points--" he started to say, but remembered that those points would come from Slytherin. 
\par To his surprise, Snape was all-out grinning now. Harry started to laugh in spite of himself; it was so nice to see Snape smile again, even if it was at his expense. "What's so funny?" 
\par "That's just what Lucius Malfoy did to me." 
\par Harry's jaw dropped. "What? You mean you--and Mrs. Malfoy--" 
\par "Oh, she wasn't Mrs. Malfoy yet. What do you take me for? They were engaged, however..." 
\par "Engaged?" Harry choked. Snape nodded. 
\par "I didn't say I never made a mistake when it came to a Malfoy. I learned what }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 to do the hard way. I suspected when he recruited me that he knew all along, even though he never said a word about her. Later, when he actually retaliated, I learned that she thought it was all rather funny and had
 told him herself. I think he also knew she instigated everything, including taking advantage of the fact that I'd had too much to drink. Which still didn't prevent him retaliating against me. But he waited--he saved it up. A Malfoy can do one of the long
est slow burns I know of. Remember that." 
\par "}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Malfoys; specializing in grudges since always}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ," Harry said, his mouth twisting. 
\par Snape shook his head, ignoring this. "Why do you think there is so much bad blood between the Malfoys and Weasleys? They're }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 still}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  not over it..." 
\par "Over what?" 
\par "Your best friend never told you? Nor Miss Weasley?" Harry shook his head. Snape breathed deeply through his large nose before saying, "Arthur Weasley killed Lucius Malfoy's father." 
\par Harry's eyes went wide. "That can't be true! Mr. Weasley would never--" 
\par "Oh, it was all in the performance of his job duties. A raid. And in self-defense, on top of that. Ministry employees have seldom ever been charged with murder or assault, on or off the job. There have been abuses of that, of 
course, but no one was going to charge Arthur Weasley with murder." 
\par "What about Sam Bell? Katie Bell's dad? Do you remember? He went to prison for killing his wife to protect Katie. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 He}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  was a Ministry employee. An Auror." 
\par Snape nodded. "I remember. He probably could have gone free, if he really wanted. He }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 chose}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 to go to prison. He confessed. Gave up ten years of his life, and his daughter's life, for nothing," he spat, as though angry about this. Harry remembered his face when he'd been in his Pensieve, seeing the family he might have had. 
\par Harry also remembered Sam's face when he'd first told Harry about why he'd gone to prison. "It wasn't for nothing," Harry said softly. "He felt he had to do it." 
\par They sat in silence then, but Harry didn't mind; it felt right to be beside the Potions Master, each staring ahead into space, neither one of them making any comment. He and his dad hadn't felt the need to talk constantly; companionable silence was a good
 thing, too. 
\par Suddenly, the Sunday afternoon silence of the entrance hall was broken by the sound of footsteps pattering down the upper flights of stairs. Harry looked up, seeing Sirius drawing closer, and he remembered that they were going to the Hogsmeade
 station to meet Mr. Spinnet's lawyer, who was coming to the castle to speak to Alicia before the trial. 
\par When he'd reached the top of the flight on which they were sitting, Harry stood, and Snape somewhat reluctantly followed suit. Sirius looked out of br
eath. "So, ready Harry? The carriage should be in front by now. Cecilia's train arrives in about a half hour." 
\par Snape nodded at him. "Professor Black," he said very formally. 
\par Sirius nodded back. "Professor Snape. I didn't expect to see you here. Isn't the Dueling Club meeting over?" 
\par "Yes. However, Harry and I were discussing what an insufferable idiot you were to forbid him to tell Mr. Malfoy about him and Miss Weasley." 
\par "No!" Harry said hastily. "I mean--yeah we were discussing that. No one said the word 'idiot!'" he added quickly. 
\par Sirius drew his lips into a line. "It's rather a moot point now, isn't it? He knows. The damage is done." 
\par "But it is worse than it had to be," Snape said quietly, in that dangerous voice Harry had feared since his first year
. "Some brutal honesty would have been painful for Mr. Malfoy, but better in the long run for his now-defunct friendship with Harry. I have been charged with protecting him since he was a first year--no mean feat, when he finds new and ever-more disturbin
g
 ways to risk his life every year--and now you come sweeping in here, every bit as arrogant as his father, convinced you know best! James Potter got himself and Lily killed and almost got his son killed when he was a baby. Are you trying to finish the job
 now?" 
\par "Hey!" Harry cried. He looked with dismay at Snape. "No one talks about my father like that! And--and I know that Sirius meant well..." he said softly, looking at his godfather sheepishly. "And--I appreciate that you've protected me more than once. 
I wouldn't have survived my first Quidditch match if it weren't for you. Well, and Her--" He stopped himself in time, before he revealed that Hermione had set Snape's robes on fire. "Anyway, thank you both for--everything. But we }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 should}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  probably get to the station now," he finished lamely, not sure how to get out of the conversation without alienating one or the other of them--or both. 
\par As he and Sirius were leaving the entrance hall, he looked beind him to see Severus Snape sweeping toward the stairs to th
e dungeons without looking back. It had been nice to talk to him again, and surprising that he had been in agreement with Harry about telling Draco. Perhaps that was why, he reflected on the way to the station, Sirius had sounded so impatient and unbendin
g every time Harry had brought it up; Snape had been arguing the same thing at him repeatedly, and he was sick of hearing it. Or perhaps he thought Harry and Snape had conspired to wear him down. 
\par While they moved closer to the village, he watched Sirius and thought of Snape, and hoped that someday he'd be able to really be friends with them both without having to worry about that being a problem for either one of them. 
\par ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 
\par \'93Now, dear, do you think you\rquote re ready for the trial?\'94 
\par Alicia looked wide-eyed at the barrister Sirius had hired to represent her father. \'93Hardly.\'94 
\par Cecilia Oberholtzer sighed and put down her tea. \'93I know, it\rquote s difficult to see your father in a situation like this, especially when you know he\rquote s innocent--\'94 
\par \'93I just--I still don\rquote t know what I\rquote m going to say when I testify.\'94 
\par Harry sat back, sipping his tea, watching them, sitting next to each other on the couch, with great interest. After meeting Cecilia Oberholtzer at the station (she felt out of practice when it came to Apparition), they brought her to Sirius\rquote 
 rooms at the castle. Harry was going to leave again, but Cecilia insisted he stay. Oddly, she looked like Alicia probably would in twenty years. She was very smooth and elegant, her blonde hair cut short, her makeup understat
ed and unobtrusive. She looked more than a little odd at Hogwarts, in her smart suit and her loud, clicking heels on the stone floors. Several students had done double-takes upon seeing her striding through the corridors. But Harry knew she\rquote 
d gone to Hogwarts like any British witch, that she\rquote d been in Gryffindor with his mother and father. She\rquote 
d smiled upon entering the castle, looking around fondly before Sirius steered her up the stairs, a hand on her elbow. Sirius sat opposite Harry now, in an identical chair, also watching Cecilia and Alicia with interest. 
\par \'93I understand, Alicia. I am very concerned that nothing you say is perjury. It\rquote s a fine line to walk. You need to be as truthful as possible about everything that occurred--but you also cannot, at any
 time, mention magic, witches, wizards, potions--in other words, anything that would violate the International Code of Wizarding Secrecy.\'94 
\par Alicia snorted and picked up a biscuit, biting it viciously. \'93Good luck to me,\'94 she said bitterly. \'93I\rquote ll either end up in Muggle prison for lying under oath or I\rquote 
ll be called before a wizarding tribunal because of the sacred ICWS. Damned if I do, damned if I don\rquote t.\'94 
\par Cecilia shook her head. \'93Plus, if you mention magic at all, you also run the risk of completely ruining your credibility. Which will appear in the papers. And which won\rquote t help your father\rquote s case.\'94 
\par Sirius sighed and leaned forward, pouring himself another cup of tea. \'93What\rquote s your strategy?\'94 he asked. 
\par Cecilia ticked points off on her fingers. \'93First--as Mr. Spinnet was sleeping in his office during the shootings, anyone could have pressed the gun into his hand afterward. I\rquote m fairly certain that\rquote s }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  what happened--the gunman probably used a potion to impersonate Mr. Spinnet, and that\rquote s why his fingerprints were on the gun--but it\rquote s how it }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 could}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  have happened, and doesn\rquote t involve mentioning magic or potions. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 They}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  didn\rquote 
t want the man who tested Mr. Spinnet\rquote s hand for gunpowder residue to testify. No surprise there, as he found none. We, however, have compelled him to testify; he has no choice. This is good!\'94
 she said to Alicia, seeing her stricken, uncertain look. \'93A hostile witness giving evidence that damages the crown\rquote s case is very good. If he seemed anxious to get your dad off, he wouldn\rquote t be as believable. He\rquote 
ll be admitting this very reluctantly.\'94 
\par She turned back to Sirius. \'93So--his fingerprints on the weapon, but no gunpowder residue on the hand. No soap residue, either, indicating he\rquote d done a quick wash. In fact, when he was tested, his hand was quite d
irty. It will bolster our contention that he didn\rquote t fire the weapon, that it was pressed into his hand after the fact, to frame him.\'94 
\par Harry tried to smile reassuringly at Alicia; she smiled feebly back. \'93Second,\'94 Cecilia went on, \'93the security film is blurry and could be showing any middle-aged man of Mr. Spinnet\rquote 
s age and coloring, or someone trying to disguise himself as Mr. Spinnet. I will question Clive Metford--the wounded MP--about how much contact he\rquote d had with Mr. Spinnet before the shooting. Was h
e a close personal friend, or had he only ever seen Mr. Spinnet once or twice in his life, and not at close quarters? Didn\rquote t he lose a lot of blood after he was shot, which could affect his recall? Is he completely certain about the gunman\rquote 
s identity? Was he in a position to tell Mr. Spinnet from any other man who bore a passing resemblance to him? 
\par \'93By the way," she said suddenly, "we\rquote re not calling him as a witness, because he\rquote s not, but a Mr.--\'94 she rifled through some papers on her lap; \'93--Rudy Afton will be watching the trial. We plan to make good use of him. Wasn\rquote 
t easy, but my assistant put a blurry photo of Mr. Spinnet in an advert in several tabloids, asking whether anyone knew who it was, because of a possible legacy, and the response was overwhelming. You\rquote 
ll see when you meet him, Alicia; our Mr. Afton is a dead ringer for your dad. And many of the other men we found are close enough. We\rquote ve invited five of them to the trial, in addition to Mr. Afton. When Metford testifies, I will ask him about eac
h and every one of those other men who will be in the room--I admit, I\rquote m tempted to use magic to put Mr. Afton in Mr. Spinnet\rquote s place and vice versa, but I daren\rquote t. It would look like I was trying to help my client escape.\'94 
\par She smiled at Sirius; he looked startled. \'93Oh, of course.\'94 Harry wondered whether he\rquote d been paying attention. He appeared to have been gazing at Alicia, who was oblivious. 
\par \'93So!\'94 Cecilia said, smiling with satisfaction. \'93We\rquote re set. The hostile witness will probably be our best bet, with the Mr. Spinnet-ringers our backup plan. The crown will, of course, behave as if nothing were simpler than to see that he
\rquote s guilty. Mr. Spinnet is seen in the film, they\rquote ll say. Fingerprints on the gun, they\rquote ll say. And we\rquote ll knock down each argument. Plus--when all is said and done, the weakest part of their case is this: }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 no motive}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . Scotland Yard cannot, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 absolutely cannot}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , produce a motive. Your father,\'94
 she said, nodding at Alicia, \'93will say in his testimony that he had no reason to wish for the whip to be dead, nor Mr. Metford. He was asleep until he was rudely awakened by the police who arrested him. That\rquote 
s another thing that helps us--he didn\rquote t behave like a guilty man. He was asleep in his office after shooting two people in cold blood, knowing that it would be filmed by the security camera? He\rquote 
ll be testifying to his knowledge of the cameras, as well. He knew--so why would he commit a crime he knew would be recorded in that manner? And then go quietly to have a lie down, where he\rquote d be easy to catch? It\rquote s ludicrous.\'94 
\par Alicia smiled gratefully at her and put her hand over Cecilia\rquote s. \'93Thank you for everything. I can see Sirius was right--you\rquote re very capable. I must go now, however. Time to feed the baby. Thank you so much.\'94 She squeezed Cecilia
\rquote s hand briefly before rising to leave. 
\par \'93I\rquote ll walk you out,\'94 Sirius said suddenly. \'93Be right back,\'94 he said to Harry and Cecilia. 
\par After Alicia and Sirius were gone, Cecilia put down her teacup and settled back comfortably on the couch. \'93How funny to be back at Hogwarts, after all these years! I never thought I\rquote d see this place again. I swore that I wouldn\rquote 
t ever come back, in fact.\'94 
\par \'93Why?\'94 Harry wanted to know. Cecilia snorted. 
\par \'93Well, I have to admit, it was largely because of Sirius. He and I dated for a little while, after your mum and dad\rquote s wedding. I was a bridesmaid in the wedding.\'94 
\par Harry hit his forehead. \'93That\rquote s why you look familiar! You\rquote re in the wedding photos!\'94 And then he realized where else he\rquote d seen her--she was the pretty
 blonde girl sitting with his mother at the Gryffindor table, when he and Hermione had gone into Snape\rquote s Pensieve. 
\par Cecilia laughed, shaking her head. \'93You look so like your father,\'94 she said softly. \'93Although I can see Lily there, too. I was a good friend of your mother\rquote 
s. Well, I could have been a better friend. I was dreadful after she became a prefect--catty and jealous about it. Are fifteen-year-old girls still like that? I was one of the most dreadful specimens imaginable. That will haunt me someday, I\rquote 
m certain. My Becky is only six, but I'm already bracing myself for those horrid teenage years,\'94 Cecilia said, smiling ruefully. 
\par Harry grinned at her. \'93I\rquote m sure it won\rquote t be that bad. So--you can tell me the truth about Sirius and girls,\'94 he said, waggling his eyebrows. 
\par Cecilia frowned. \'93I\rquote m not sure I can. Yes, he had loads of girlfriends in school. I was nervous about dating him after the wedding, although he claimed to have changed--\'94 
\par Harry put his hand on his chest in mock-shock. \'93Are you implying that he was just --\'94 
\par \'93--saying that to get me into bed? Oh, please. He\rquote d have said anything in those days, if he thought--,\'94 she stopped herself, but Harry reddened anyway. \'93But I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 wanted}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to believe he\rquote d changed. I did. When your mum first came to Hogwarts,
 she had a crush on Sirius, you know. When she talked about him I had to bite my tongue because--well, I felt the same way. I never admitted that to her--she was my friend, and she\rquote d--well, claimed him. But he wasn\rquote 
t interested in her, even mocked her. He was a real prat about it. Then, just when she decided to give up on him, he made a pass at her--" 
\par "Yeah. I heard about that." 
\par She laughed, shaking her head. "I was furious with her. Who did she think she was to reject }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Sirius Black}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? I wasn\rquote t entirely rati
onal. I had some other girlfriends in Hufflepuff who had the privilege of listening to me rant about it. Poor girls!\'94 
\par \'93Well, didn\rquote t that work out well for you, then?\'94 Harry said, trying to be conciliatory. 
\par \'93You\rquote d think so, but I could tell, even after she was with James, that he still fancied her. Which made me cross with your mum quite a lot. And she didn\rquote t know why, of course. Teenage girls can be just horrid, horrid creatures....\'94 

\par Harry smiled at her. \'93You seem to be all right now.\'94 
\par She laughed. \'93After twenty years, I should hope so. And after I decided it was a bunch of rot to worry about her having fancied him and went out with him anyway, I discovered that he was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 still}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  carrying a torch for her. He\rquote d been best man at the wedding! I found it rather hard, being in her shadow again like that. We were on-again, off-again for a couple of years after their wedding, until the night--
\'94 Her breath caught; she went on with some difficulty. \'93Until the night your parents were killed,\'94 she said softly. 
\par Harry sat forward. \'93Were you the date in Hertfordshire?\'94 
\par She nodded. \'93He told you about that, did he?\'94 
\par \'93Only that that was where he was before he went to see what had happened. He knew }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 something}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  was up because of a memory charm my mum had put on him. Long story.\'94 
\par Cecilia nodded. \'93He left very abruptly. And then, the next thing I know, I\rquote m hearing about Lily and James being killed, you surviving the attack, You-Know-Who being gone....It was baffling. And in the midst of it all, not a word from Sirius. }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Then}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  I find out that he\rquote s killed Peter Pettigrew and a load of Muggles and that he\rquote 
s been apprehended by the Ministry, suspected of having betrayed your parents. I recalled how he\rquote d left the restaurant so suddenly....I \lquote realized\rquote  it was because he\rquote d gone to tell You-K
now-Who how to find James and Lily. I just assumed he was guilty. But then--\'94 
\par \'93What?\'94 Harry said, frowning. 
\par \'93Well, it didn\rquote t add up for me. He adored your mother. Always said he\rquote d do anything for her, or for your dad. And you could tell he really meant it.\'94 She shook her head. \'93But even though I had doubts, I didn\rquote 
t say anything, and Sirius was sent to prison with no trial. The wizarding world was celebrating the disappearance of You-Know-Who, and I was nursing a broken heart. I didn\rquote t want anything else 
to do with wizards or magic. I felt completely disillusioned--not least with myself, for not having said anything. To put it succinctly, I ran away. After acquiring the necessary documents, I enrolled in a Muggle university and eventually became a lawyer.
 Somehow--I thought that if Sirius had had a good lawyer to draw out the details of what had really happened, he never would have gone to prison. I was very, very angry about so-called wizarding \lquote justice.\rquote 
 It was a travesty. I decided to champion people unjustly accused of crimes. Or even justly accused, to see that they received a fair trial, so the crown had to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 work}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 to convict, instead of making it easy for them. It shouldn\rquote t be easy to put }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 anyone}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  in prison. If you\rquote re going to take away someone\rquote s freedom, you\rquote 
d damn well better work hard to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 prove}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  that it should be taken away. I don\rquote t care what they\rquote re supposed to have done.\'94 
\par \'93Amen!\'94 Sirius said with fervor, returning from taking Alicia to her rooms. 
\par Harry saw Cecilia color a little. \'93Were your ears burning? We were talking about you.\'94 
\par \'93Sounded more like a soapbox speech to me. Shouldn\rquote t you be doing that in Hyde Park?\'94 
\par \'93Oh, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 He grinned at her. \'93You always did like to puncture me whenever there was a risk of my being too puffed up. Derek does that now.\'94 
\par \'93Derek?\'94 Harry asked, trying to stifle his laughter; the words 'puffed up' and 'puncture,' caused him involuntarily to think of Aunt Marge. 
\par \'93My husband. Muggle. Rather shocked when I told him I\rquote m a witch. We met at uni.\'94 
\par \'93I like Derek, really I do,\'94 Sirius said, with his eyebrows raised. \'93But couldn\rquote t you have married someone named, I don\rquote t know--'Smith?'\'94 
\par Cecilia rolled her eyes. \'93Just be glad I didn\rquote t hyphenate my name after I married. \lquote Cecilia Ratkowski-Oberholtzer\rquote  would be just too much.\'94 Sirius laughed. 
\par Harry excused himself and let them continue to catch up. He returned to the common room and found Ron, Hermione and Ginny at a table near the windows. He told them that it sounded possible that Alicia\rquote s dad could be acquitted and they wer
e all very glad to hear it. Harry gazed at Ginny, smiling back at him, and discreetly passed a note to her asking her to meet him at the top of the Astronomy Tower. It wasn\rquote 
t easy to find time to be alone, but it was one of the only things helping him to k
eep his sanity. And he didn't want to rely on other people anymore, if at all possible. Ron and Hermione seemed to have made up, but he still shuddered when remembering the Dueling Club meeting. 
\par When he arrived at the top of the tower, there were snow drifts at the edges of the observation deck and Ginny was shivering, waiting for him. He kissed her lightly and said, \'93You know what I miss? Flying with you.\'94 
\par She gazed up at him, smiling broadly. \'93Oh, I do too! Do you think we should?\'94 
\par \'93Well--just a little.\'94 He closed his eyes, executing the change. His paws touched down on the stone flags; he looked up at her, letting out a loud, rumbling purr when she started stroking his velvety coat. He\rquote 
d hoped it would be easier to keep his desires in check if he wasn\rquote t in his human form, but now he wasn\rquote 
t so sure. She threw one leg over his back and he spread his wings and leapt into the air, feeling her knees gripping him, her fingers in his mane. Then all of their cares and worries dropped away as he banked and soare
d. He was with Ginny and they were flying together again; very little else seemed to matter.

\par Harry closed his mouth again; Sirius was getting far too good at the parental \lquote no.\rquote  Harry felt a little sulky. He used to think it would be hard to argue with Sirius, but was finding it easier and easier. }{

\par \'93He\rquote s right, Harry,\'94 Hermione said, hefting Arne onto her hip more securely, putting her cheek on his down

he\rquote d spent the night in Alicia\rquote s rooms in the staff wing. 
\par \'93So,\'94 Harry said, trying to sound casual, as he took a different tack; \'93how do you think this trip will affect your relationship with Alicia?\'94

\par \'93Harry!\'94 Hermione sounded shocked; Harry was slightly shocked himself by how daring he was being. His stomach was flipping and flopping a bit; it hadn\rquote t been easy to get up his nerve to do this. He had thought a great deal about Sirius a

d had more than one screaming match with his mother. His godfather stared at him in disbelief. Ron looked like he was straining some internal organs from the effort needed not to laugh. 
\par \'93Plus, she looks rather like a younger version of Cecilia, whom you used to date.\'94 
\par \'93I am keeping an eye on her. Cecilia did that last night. Alicia likes having \lquote Snuffles\rquote  around for company. People are less guarded around animals. I won\rquote t be able to do that in London. There\rquote

\par Harry looked grim. \'93You\rquote re certain? You don\rquote t fancy her? No objectivity problems?\'94 
\par \'93Harry! She\rquote s eighteen years younger than me!\'94 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93So? How old were you when you went to prison?\'94 
\par Sirius frowned, sitting on the bed. \'93What does that matter? I was twenty-one.\'94 
\par Hermione looked like she understood now. \'93I think I see where Harry\rquote s going with this. He seems to think you\rquote re arrested at the age of twenty-one--no pun intended--so that it\rquote 
s perfectly plausible for you to fancy a twenty-year old girl.\'94 
\par Harry grimaced. \'93Yeah. Basically. I wouldn\rquote t use the same words, but the meaning\rquote s the same. And you used to have so many girlfriends, but as far as I know, there hasn't been anyone since you escaped from prison. Now you\rquote 
re spending almost all of your non-teaching time with Alicia, and when you\rquote re in your dog form, she hugs and cuddles you and talks sweetly to you. You\rquote re telling me that\rquote s having no affect on you?\'94 
\par Sirius stood and picked his bag up again. \'93I\rquote m not listening to any more of this--\'94 
\par \'93Hermione, Ron, can you go to the other room for a minute?\'94 Harry said abruptly. Ron raised an eyebrow, and Harry knew he probably would have no t
rouble hearing them still, but he steered Hermione out of the room and Harry and Sirius were alone. Harry walked to his godfather so they were toe-to-toe. He gazed into Sirius\rquote  dark eyes and said, \'93I\rquote 
m sorry I was rude, especially in front of Hermione and Ron, but I\rquote m only asking because I\rquote 
m worried. About her hurting you. She was being manipulated before and was pursuing me while under Imperius. Roger also had her under Imperius. I think she\rquote d still do whatever he said if he showed up. Don\rquote t forget: it\rquote s p
ossible that she can\rquote t be trusted.\'94 
\par Sirius suddenly pulled Harry to him in a bear hug, patting his back firmly before releasing him. Harry frowned at him. Sirius laughed a little and looked like he was wiping tears from his eyes briefly. \'93You know, sometimes, it\rquote 
s like your dad is here again, trying to talk sense to me and looking like he feels he\rquote s banging his head on a brick wall....\'94 
\par Harry smiled at him. \'93Was my dad that rude? I had no idea.\'94 Sirius laughed. 
\par \'93Yeah, sometimes tact really escaped James. And your mum always spoke her mind. I\rquote d wondered how you turned out to be so well-mannered. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Usually}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94
 he added, smirking. 
\par Harry\rquote s smile grew and he hugged Sirius now, feeling quite suddenly as though he really were seeing a father off on a trip. \'93Just be careful, all right? And by the way, who\rquote s going to be visiting Jeffries to keep an eye on }{

\par Sirius shrugged. \'93No one. Honestly, Harry. Jeffries seems to be no threat. I mean, everyone who comes in contact with him is so }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 happy}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
! Your aunt is certainly in her element. I\rquote ve even spotted witches and wizards attending. Oh, a lot of what they do isn\rquote t noticed by Muggles, but I can spot the little things that distinguish them, of course.\'94 
\par Harry grimaced. \'93And now we also know that Neville\rquote s Great Uncle Algie was healed by Jeffries.\'94 He hesitated for a moment, then said, \'93And me, too.\'94 
\par \'93You too what?\'94 Sirius said, striding toward the door. 
\par \'93He--he healed me, too.\'94 
\par Sirius stopped dead and dropped his bag again. \'93What? You never said anything!\'94 
\par \'93I--I never told anyone. At all. He somehow got through security at St. Mungo\rquote s. He came to my room and healed my burns. He left me a letter. I still don\rquote t know why he did it--\'94 
\par Sirius looked at him, baffled. \'93Then why are you still suspicious of him, Harry? I don\rquote t know why you have to be so paranoid. Save it for the important things. I don\rquote 
t think we should expend any more energy on Rodney Jeffries. We need to find the missing dragons or work out what\rquote s to be done with them, we need to constantly reassess our estimation of who\rquote s a Death Eater and who isn\rquote 
t. We have to try to find out what Voldemort will be up to next. We have to work out who framed Alicia\rquote s dad and preferably prevent him from going to prison. That\rquote s quite enough without expend
ing energy on a harmless faith healer whom everyone likes--wizard and Muggle. I admit, I was suspicious of him at first. But I haven't seen anything to really warrant that--even his getting past hospital security, which he could have done with assistance 
f
rom a well-meaning witch or wizard. He did heal you. As far as his knowing about the magical world--he saw Voldemort attack him, after all, and remembers it vividly. I've heard the story so often now I could probably tell it myself. I don't think any of t
h
e Muggles who hear it really understand what he's describing, but that's probably why Fudge is still a bit worried about him--he might draw Muggle attention to the wizarding world. However, I'm having a difficult time finding someone Fudge doesn't like to
 be all bad.\'94 He grinned; Harry knew what Sirius thought of Fudge. 
\par \'93I reckon you\rquote re right,\'94 Harry said reluctantly, not really believing his own words, and not very pleased to realize that the one person in the wizarding world who seemed to agree with him 
on Rodney Jeffries was Cornelius Fudge, even if it was for very different reasons.

morning, Ron looked startled when they entered the Great Hall; he stared at the place next to McGonagall, occupied as usual by a man who was the spitting image of their headmaster, with a long white beard and hair, half-moon spectacles flashing in the can

\par \'93He\rquote s back,\'94 Ron whispered to Harry, grinning. \'93It\rquote s Professor Dumbledore.\'94

\par \'93Sod that. Cecilia seemed to have such a good case, too.\'94 Then something else on the front page caught his eye. \'93What\rquote s that other story there, Hermione? Near the bottom.\'94 
\par Hermione turned the paper over and looked at the article. \'93Oh, god. That awful woman who took Mr. Spinnet\rquote s place has had another dreadful idea that will only benefit the rich and make life abysmal for everyone else....\'94 
\par \'93I was wondering because in the picture--\'94 He put out his hand and Hermione gave him the paper; \'93--it looks just like--\'94
 He trailed off, staring at the photograph, which showed the MP and her daughter getting into a car outside their rather large house, also familiar.... 
\par \'93What is it, Harry?\'94 Ginny asked, sitting beside him. 
\par He didn\rquote t answer her, but continued to gawp at the photograph of the member of Parliament representing Mole Valley, the woman who\rquote d taken over from Mr. Spinnet after he\rquote 
d been arrested. Or rather, he stared at the photograph of her daughter. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Felice}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 he whispered. 
\par \'93Who? What did you say?\'94 Ginny frowned. She looked at Hermione, who shrugged. 
\par He looked up and saw Sirius, Alicia and Cecilia in the entrance hall; they must have come from London on the overnight train to Hogsmeade, he reckoned. He strode toward them with the newspaper. He was vaguely a
ware of Ron, Hermione and Ginny following. The three travelers all looked quite grim. Harry nodded awkward at Alicia, carrying the baby in a sling again. \'93I\rquote m--I\rquote m sorry about your dad, Alicia,\'94
 he said quietly. She nodded; her eyes looked red, as though she\rquote d been crying. 
\par \'93I need to get him into his cot,\'94 she said softly, looking down at the baby. \'93It\rquote s been a long trip.\'94
 She turned and began to climb the marble stairs. Harry watched her go, then waved the newspaper in front of Sirius and whispered urgently. 
\par \'93There\rquote s something you should know. About that woman who replaced Mr. Spinnet. I think that either she, her daughter--or both of them--are witches.\'94 
\par Sirius\rquote  jaw dropped. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 What?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  How do you--\'94 
\par \'93Not only that,\'94 Harry said, showing Sirius the photograph. \'93She,\'94 he said, stabbing Felice\rquote s picture with his finger, \'93

Come on.\'94 
\par However, once they were in Sirius\rquote  sitting room, Cecilia started pacing nervously, running her hands through her short blonde hair. \'93Can someone tell me what\rquote 
s going on? Are you telling me my client was framed so a witch could take his place in Parliament?\'94 
\par Sirius grimaced. \'93Well, magic would explain how the crown sabotaged the case.\'94 
\par Hermione\rquote s brow was furrowed. \'93Harry told us it looked rather good.\'94 
\par Cecilia started waving her arms around agitatedly. \'93I really need a fag, Sirius. Please?\'94 
\par \'93Fine,\'94 he said, and she produced a cigarette out of thin air. She flicked it and it was magically lit; as she inhaled nervously, starting to look a little calmer. 
\par \'93Haven\rquote t smoked for over a year; bad habit from uni, longs hours of revision. But losing this case just makes me feel--\'94
 She shook her head, holding the cigarette between the first two fingers of her right hand, which she was now waving in a circle. \'93How\rquote s a person supposed to put on a defense when all the crown\rquote s witnesses just lie through their teeth?
\'94 
\par Harry gawped at her. \'93They just--lied?\'94 
\par Cecilia took another drag. \'93No other word for it. Metford claimed he\rquote d known Mr. Spinnet for ages, that he\rquote d recognize him anywhere, he was even at Alicia\rquote s wedding. He had a photo of himself with Alicia and her
 dad on her wedding day. Alicia refuted this, saying he\rquote d clearly altered a real photo, but it all started to sound petty. \lquote Experts have verified that this photo has not been tampered with,\rquote  Cartwright said. \lquote Wouldn\rquote

 Gardner Cartwright! Self-righteous, pompous--\'94 
\par \'93Cecilia,\'94 Sirius said gently. 
\par She sighed and took another drag. \'93Now you see what poor Derek has to put up with when I lose. I\rquote m a raving lunatic for a week after. At any rate, there were other lies. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Plus}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  all of our ringers mysteriously didn\rquote t show. When I went back to the office, I found that every one of them had received a letter--on stationery from my office, mind you--
telling them that their services were not needed after all. They were all rather surprised and had been ringing up my clerk, who didn't know anything about it. Bloody hell. You don\rquote 
t know what a panic I was in when I realized that Afton and the others weren\rquote t there. But even so--it looked like we }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 might}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  have swayed the jury. How wrong we were....\'94
 
\par Hermione said tentatively, \'93Is it possible that someone could have put the jurors under Imperius? Just in case the lying and so forth didn\rquote t work?\'94 
\par Cecilia looked startled. \'93Yes. Of course. How silly of me not to think of that. Magic would explain the letters on my office stationery, as well. The real question, however, is this: who leaked our defense strategy? There\rquote 
s no other way anyone could have known about those six men who look like Mr. Spinnet. Not to mention their exact identities and their addresses.\'94 
\par \'93Someone probably also used magic to alter the wedding photo,\'94 Harry added. 
\par \'93Yes, well }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  we knew. But we couldn't dwell on the details of the wedding be
cause of the little 'incident' during the reception. The eerie thing was that when Metford was sitting there, calmly stating that he'd been to the wedding--he also had all of the details right, down to the food and the groomsmen wearing kilts--he looked v
ery calm and not a bit like he was lying. I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 wish}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  I\rquote d had a way to challenge his assertion that he\rquote

 while Metford was waving his photo about and talking about the delicious wedding cake. Well, not at the same time, of course.\'94 
\par Sirius looked like he\rquote d had a brainstorm. \'93Third eyes,\'94 he said suddenly, making Cecilia frown. \'93We had a problem with third eyes at Ascog Castle last summer.
 Magical listening and watching devices. Someone may have planted third eyes in your office.\'94 
\par Cecilia waved her hand and suddenly it was holding a glass ashtray, into which she flicked some ash from her cigarette. It was odd for Harry to see someone dressed completely as a Muggle performing magic. \'93
Can you help me root them out, Sirius? Not that we probably need to worry about them now--\'94 
\par \'93Oh, aren\rquote t you going to appeal?\'94 Hermione asked. Ron frowned. 
\par \'93What\rquote s that?\'94 he wanted to know. But rather than answering him, Cecilia stared. 
\par \'93You\rquote re the werewolf, aren\rquote t you?\'94 she said, motioning to him with her cigarette. \'93Bill and Charlie Weasley\rquote s brother, right?\'94 
\par \'93Right,\'94 he said slowly, clearly not liking that she\rquote d started with the \lquote werewolf\rquote  comment. 
\par But Cecilia nodded. \'93Bill and Charlie were in--what was it, Sirius? Fourth and second year when we were in seventh?\'94 
\par \'93Third and first, I think.\'94 
\par \'93Right. Charlie didn\rquote t play for Gryffindor until we were out of school. More\rquote s the pity. They were nice boys,\'94 she said, giving Ron a motherly smile. Then the smile disappeared. \'93
It was so terrible when I heard about--about their little sisters--\'94 Then Ginny caught her eye; her resemblance to Ron was unmistakable. She looked startled. \'93But who--\'94 
\par \'93I\rquote m another sister,\'94 Ginny said, smiling. \'93I\rquote m Ginny Weasley. And we\rquote ve actually }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 found}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  one of my missing sisters! She\rquote s--\'94 
\par \'93Why don\rquote t we have some tea?\'94 Hermione said loudly, popping up and \lquote inadvertently\rquote  treading on Ginny\rquote s toe, making her cry out. Ginny had evidently forgo
tten that no one was to know Maggie was their sister. She bit her lip in pain after her initial cry. 
\par \'93God, yes. I could }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 so}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  use a good cuppa--\'94 Cecilia said, finally throwing herself into a chair and slipping off her shoes, putting her feet onto an ottoman. \'93
And then I really should get back to London. My daughter has a violin recital in the morning. Along with all of her teacher\rquote s other students. I can\rquote t miss two hours of ungodly screeching, now can I? I\rquote

\par They settled down to tea after Sirius conjured what they needed, listening to Cecilia rehash some of the other lies that had made an acquittal impossi
ble. When it was time for her to leave, they walked her and Sirius to the entrance hall and before walking out the large front door of the castle, she put her hands on Harry\rquote s shoulders. 
\par \'93It\rquote s nice to see you again, Harry. The last time I saw you before your parents went into hiding, you weren\rquote t much bigger than little Arne. Please promise me you\rquote ll stay safe,\'94 she said softly. 
\par \'93I\rquote ll do my best,\'94 he said, smiling at his mother\rquote s old friend, remembering again the girl in the Pensieve. She nodded and followed Sirius out the door. 
\par Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny walked into the Great Hall, which was deserted, and sat dejectedly at the Gryffindor table, where the rest of Hermione\rquote s newspapers were still sitting, just where she\rquote d left them. They all seemed to b
e rather deflated after the news of Mr. Spinnet\rquote s conviction. Luckily, seventh-year Gryffindors didn\rquote 
t have a lesson until the middle of the morning on Friday, and while Ginny should have been in her first lesson, Hermione promised to get her out of it wit
h a handy little note from the Head Girl. They all looked listlessly down at the newspapers; Harry idly pulled the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Guardian}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 toward him and began to peruse it. There was another story about Joan Harrington-Smyth. Ginny put her head on his shoulder, reading along; he turned his head for a moment and pressed his lips to her brow, and she gave him a small smile. 
\par Ron and Hermione were sharing the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Daily Prophet}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , and after turning a page, Hermione gasped, making Harry look up. Ron was staring at it, too, swearing softly. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Bloody hell.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93What? What?\'94 Harry and Ginny prompted them; Harry wondered whether there was something about Mrs. Harrington-Smyth. Then he realized that of course there wouldn\rquote t be anything about her in the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Prophet}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , even though she might be a witch. Ron and Hermione didn\rquote t answer immediately; they were moving their eyes rapidly over the text. 
\par \'93The Aurors,\'94 Ron finally said softly. 
\par \'93Did you say }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 the horror}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? Didn\rquote t know you watched Muggle films, Ron,\'94 Harry said. 
\par \'93No, he said \lquote the Aurors,\rquote \'94 Hermione said more loudly. \'93A convoy of Aurors in twenty-five little boats took the Death Eaters who\rquote 
d surrendered to Remus to Azkaban. The trials are over. There were three Aurors to every Death Eater. No boats have come back to Banff from Azkaban fortress. Owls to the prison aren\rquote t being answered.\'94 
\par The four of them stared at each other. Harry remembered that ride to Azkaban across the chilly waters of the North Sea. \'93Are you telling me }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 seventy-five}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

\par Ron looked very grim as he tossed the paper to Harry so he could read it for himself. \'93Oh, the Ministry\rquote s fairly certain they know who\rquote s to blame, all right,\'94 he said, the angry edge in his voice im
possible to miss. Harry goggled at him, hoping that Ron didn\rquote t seriously expect him to read the entire article when he could just tell him the answer.

\par \'93Remus Lupin!\'94 Harry exclaimed. \'93They think Remus had something to do with all of those Aurors disappearing?\'94 The Great Hall was very quiet and still around them, Harry\rquote s words echoing in the nearly-empty space.
\par Hermione looked rather pained. \'93Well, they }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 did}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  all insist upon surrendering to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

\par \'93I don\rquote t mean I agree! I meant--I can see how the Ministry might think that looked suspicious. It was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 obviously}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 an attempt on the part of the Death Eaters to discredit Remus. This proves it. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 We}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  know he couldn\rquote t possibly be on the same side as them, but the Ministry 
still has a lot of ingrained anti-werewolf prejudice,\'94 she added softly, looking sadly at Ron. Ginny also looked morosely at her brother.
\par Harry grimaced and took the paper from Hermione, glancing quickly through the article. \'93It\rquote s another Daisy Furuncle story,\'94 he said dully. \'93Or should I say--Narcissa Malfoy?\'94
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Narcissa Malfoy}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 Ginny said, mouth open. Harry had forgotten that she didn\rquote 
t know about the true identity of Daisy Furuncle. The three of them explained about what they saw in Ron\rquote s Omnioculars. 
\par \'93She spends plenty of time slamming Remus, naturally,\'94 Harry said, still looking at the article. \'93Nothing new there. Perhaps her continuing anti-werewolf kick is because Nita was so upset with her for writing that story about you, Ron, and they
\rquote re still on the outs....\'94
\par Hermione dropped her jaw. \'93You know about that?\'94
\par Ginny raised her hand. \'93I think I need to get caught up again....\'94
\par Harry looked up casually. \'93Yeah. I told Ron I knew he\rquote d been writing to her.\'94 He turned to Ginny. \'93They got to know each other when he was in hospital.\'94
\par Ron looked at Hermione sheepishly. \'93Harry thought I was cheating on you with a woman ten years older than me.\'94 Hermione and Ginny didn\rquote t speak, but after a moment of looking like they were trying to restrain themselves, started l
aughing very hard, their eyes scrunched up. Harry thought they might hurt themselves. Ron looked rather put-out. \'93It could happen, you know,\'94 he said with an injured air, above the sound of their raucous laughter. \'93Not me cheating on you,\'94
 he said hastily to Hermione. \'93I mean--her being interested--or rather--oh, I\rquote ll just shut up now--\'94
 he mumbled as the laughter continued unabated. Finally, Hermione pulled his mouth to hers in a quick kiss, grinning at him, and soon he was grinning back.
\par Harry held up the
 paper to read the rest of the article (and to possibly hide Ron and Hermione doing anything else), grinning briefly to Ginny behind the shelter of the page. But when he continued reading the article, he very quickly stopped smiling and lowered the paper 
to the table once more, finding Ron and Hermione locked in a deep kiss.
\par \'93Oy! Come up for air! Something important here!\'94 They separated, both coloring. \'93There\rquote s a list of names. The Aurors who\rquote ve gone missing,\'94
 he said quietly. He paused, swallowing, looking at Ron and Ginny in turn, unsure how to say it. When he looked at Ginny, he couldn\rquote 
t tear his eyes away from hers; she looked away first, pulling the paper to her slowly so she could read the list herself.
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Percy Weasley}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 she whispered, raising her eyes to meet Ron\rquote s gaze.
\par \'93Oh no,\'94 Hermione breathed, covering her mouth with her hand.
\par \'93And Harry!\'94 Ginny exclaimed now, looking at the list again. \'93Not just Percy--\'94
\par \'93I know it\rquote s not just Percy, there were seventy-fi--\'94
\par \'93Katie.\'94
\par Harry stopped dead, immediately picturing Katie in his mind, Katie working in the hot summer sun, Katie laughing with him as they had dinner at the Leaky Cauldron, Katie at the European Cup--
\par \'93Oh, god,\'94 he said softly, looking down at the list again. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Kathryn Bell}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . He\rquote 
d gone right to the bottom of the list, assuming that it would be alphabetical, looking for Ron and Ginny\rquote s older brother. After staring at Katie\rquote s name for a half minute, he said, \'93I\rquote ll bet Sam doesn\rquote t read the }{

They have to be all right....Katie and Percy have to be all right...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par \'93What are you going to do?\'94 Ron asked as he and Hermione rose to go.
\par \'93Ginny and I will go to Snape\rquote s office. We can use his fire to call Hog\rquote s End--and the Burrow. And he can tell Maggie. I think he should definitely be the one...\'94
 He was having trouble speaking without sounding like he had a frog in his throat now. He remembered the expert way Percy had handled things at the European Cup, impersonating his own father. Ginny patted his arm as though }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 he}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  were the one who had a missing brother--and maybe, in a way, he did.
\par Ron nodded and he and Hermione strode purposefully out of the Great Hall. Harry stood and started walking in the opposite direction. 
\par \'93Where are you going, Harry? The stairs to the dungeon are this way,\'94 Ginny said, perplexed.
\par \'93This is a shortcut. Come on.\'94
\par She followed him silently to the door beh
ind the head table; after he opened it, he took out his wand and lit it, and he was glad to see that she followed suit without question. They each held their wands aloft with their right hands while clutching at the stone wall with their left hands, the s
t
ones slightly damp to the touch. They climbed cautiously down the steep stone steps, finally reaching the bottom; Harry thought something brushed by the bottom of his robes, and he tried not to imagine what it might be. They shuffled along slowly for a wh
ile, their breathing sounding abnormally loud in the underground passage, until they\rquote d come to where Harry thought he remembered the secret entrance being that led to Snape\rquote s office.
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 The Seer shall be Seen.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94
\par Harry froze. \'93What?\'94 he asked Sandy. 
\par \'93What?\'94 Ginny whispered to Harry. \'93Did Sandy say something?\'94
\par Harry couldn\rquote t imagine what Sandy could mean; he didn\rquote t have any plans to take her out of his shirt, or to take his robes and shirt off. \'93Let\rquote s just try to get this open,\'94 he whispered back to Ginny, deciding that he\rquote 
d just have to wait and see about what Sandy had said. He wasn\rquote t sure why he was whispering; it just felt like the right thing to do when standing in a dank secret passage. He felt for and found the crack in the wall that indicated where the do
or was and began to push, Ginny putting her shoulder into it as well to speed up the process. The door finally gave way and pivoted in the middle, revealing Snape\rquote s office in all its depressing glory.
\par Embarrassingly enough, it also revealed Severus Snape sitting in the wing chair by the fire with Maggie Dougherty on his lap. Harry\rquote 
s jaw dropped and he gasped. At the sound, Maggie and Snape looked up, and Maggie--looking unsurprised--was forced to stand, as Snape sprang to his feet, his face dark with anger.
\par \'93How dare you! This is a complete abuse of--\'94
\par \'93We--we\rquote re sorry! We would have come the other way, but then the students might panic--speaking of which, why are you in here together when you\rquote re scheduled to have a classroom of students sitting out there right now?\'94 }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Did I finally catch Severus Snape in a misstep?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 he wondered. He strode to the door leading to the classroom, lifting a corner of the curtain that shielded the window in the door and seeing a room full of Gryffindors and Slytherins. They were thir
d years; Harry spotted Will Flitwick and Jamaica Thomas sitting together in the fourth row.
\par \'93Now, Severus, it isn\rquote t as though I didn\rquote t warn you!\'94 Maggie said to him with her arms crossed on her chest as she smirked at him. \'93I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 told}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 you Harry and Ginny were going to walk in, but }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  said you\rquote d put a foolproof locking charm on the door to the classroom... And as for why I am here,\'94
 she said, turning to Harry and her sister, \'93I came down to pick up some ingredients for a Divination exercise--scrying,\'94 she said, as though what she\rquote d actually been doing wasn\rquote t the furthest possible thing from her intended errand. 
\'93And what are the pair of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  doing here, anyway?\'94 she said, turning the tables in big-sister fashion. \'93Shouldn\rquote t you both be in a lesson?
\par \'93We\rquote re here because there\rquote s something you should know, Maggie, and we thought Professor Snape should tell you,\'94 Harry said. \'93But now--you\rquote 
ll just wind up hearing it from us after all, I reckon. We also wanted to ask Professor Snape whether we could use his fire to talk to some people....\'94
\par Snape narrowed his eyes. \'93Tell her what? Talk to whom? What is going on, Potter? Spit it out!\'94 he snapped. 
\par Harry drew his lips into a line; he told them about the missing Aurors and then said, \'93Percy\rquote s one of them,\'94 very softly.
\par Maggie\rquote s legs couldn\rquote t hold her up suddenly, and Ginny joined her on the floor, holding her sister tightly and whispering to her, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I know, I know--}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94
\par Harry also crouched, to talk to her. \'93So--you didn\rquote t see this coming? Not that I\rquote m criticizing. I just meant--\'94
\par She shook her head. \'93That\rquote 
s all right. I know what you mean. No, not an inkling." Harry waited for Sandy to say something to him about Seers not choosing what they see, but for once she remained silent during an otherwise excellent opportunity to give Harry
 her opinion about Seeing. Maggie lifted shining eyes to Harry. \'93I\rquote ve only recently got my family back! Am I supposed to just accept losing one of them now?\'94 she choked as Ginny hugged her tightly.
\par He crouched down to talk to her, shaking his head. \'93No. Definitely not. We are going to get him back. And the others, too.\'94
\par \'93But--but }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 how}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94
\par Harry stepped closer to Snape and whispered to him, \'93The thing is--in order to get those Aurors back, I think that this calls for someone to break }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 into}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 Azkaban. And the only two people--not counting Barty Crouch, Jr.--who\rquote ve broken }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 out}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  of it are me and Sirius....\'94
\par \'93But that was in--in your other life--\'94 Snape hissed at him.
\par \'93So?\'94 Harry responded.
\par \'93Are you seriously telling me that after }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 escaping}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  that place, you want to go }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 back}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94
\par \'93Do you have a better idea?\'94 Harry whispered fiercely. He stepped back from Snape then and said in a normal voice, \'93At any rate, we need to call the Burrow and Hog\rquote s End, make sure the whole family knows what\rquote s going on.\'94
\par Snape nodded agreement at this and walked to the fire, pinching some Floo powder between thumb and forefinger.
\par \'93The Burrow!\'94 he exclaimed, throwing it into the fire.
\par Molly Weasley\rquote s head appeared in the fire box. \'93Oh, it\rquote s you,\'94 she said, sniffling into a handkerchief. \'93I thought maybe--some news from the Ministry--oh, you very likely have no idea what I\rquote m talking about--\'94
\par \'93Percy,\'94 Snape said shortly, his voice surprisingly gentle. 
\par Harry stepped to the fire. \'93Don\rquote t worry, Mrs. Weasley. We\rquote ll get him back.\'94
\par Mrs. Weasley looked up at him, startled. \'93Oh, Harry! I didn\rquote t see you there...\'94
\par Ginny stepped forward. \'93I\rquote m here as well, Mum,\'94 she said softly.
\par \'93Ginny! So you know! I was hoping--you might not have heard yet--\'94
\par \'93Maggie\rquote s here too. And Ron knows, as well,\'94 she told her mother. \'93We were going to call you, then call at Hog\rquote s End, to see whether they know. They should, as Percy lives there.\'94
\par Molly Weasley blew her nose on a flowered handkerchief. \'93The last time Percy and I spoke we had another row! I\rquote ve been trying to tell him--tell him that he isn\rquote t cut out to be an Auror!\'94 she cried, distraught. \'93I told him that he
\rquote d get himself killed! How could I have said that?\'94 she asked, her face twisting in disgust at herself. \'93I should have been proud of him, and instead I was being selfish at the thought that I might lose him--\'94
\par Harry drew his mouth into a line. \'93It\rquote s all right, Mrs. Weasley. I\rquote m sure he\rquote s just fine,\'94 he said, even though he was not sure of any such thing. \'93You take care of yourself. We need to call Hog\rquote s End--\'94
\par Molly sniffed again. \'93You take care of yourself, too, Harry. Thank you for calling, Severus.\'94 Harry was jolted for a moment by Mrs. Weasley being on a first-name basis with Snape. \'93Goodbye, girls,\'94
 she added with a sad, motherly smile before her head disappeared.
\par Harry was the one who threw the powder into the fire and said, \'93Hog\rquote s End.\'94 Fred\rquote s face popped into the firebox this time. He looked a little less morose than his mother, but only a little.
\par \'93Fred Weasley here, creative genius at Weasley Wizard Wheezes," he recited in an automatic-sounding monotone. "Hang on and I\rquote ll get my Quick-Quotes Quill, as you probably have a message for our presiden--Oh! Harry! It\rquote 
s you. Sorry. Loads of people have been calling, wondering whether their orders are going to be filled. See, Perce\rquote s had a spot of trouble,\'94 he said, clearing his throat.
\par Harry nodded. \'93We know. We didn\rquote t know if you did. How is everyone else there taking it? Katie\rquote s gone missing, too.\'94
\par Fred nodded, looking very harried, and for the first time since Harry had known him, he looked truly grown-up. \'93I know. But the thing is--I was about to use the fire to call Madam Pomfrey. We need to get her here pretty soon. It\rquote 
s not urgent in the next five minutes, but in another hour it may be...\'94
\par Harry frowned. \'93Why?\'94
\par Fred grinned now. \'93Angelina\rquote s in labor. George is upstairs with her now. Lee\rquote s not here, unfortunately. On a trip to London. So Angelina just has us until Madam Pomfrey gets here.\'94 He laughed for a moment upon seeing Harry\rquote 
s face. \'93Don\rquote t look like that! You have an expression like you\rquote ve eaten our newest sweet for general consumption! It\rquote s a very tart-flavored chewy thing, a little like Turkish Delight in texture, but it causes you make this }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 face}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  for a few hours after you\rquote ve eaten it...\'94
\par Ginny brought Maggie near the fire and Fred smiled at them. \'93Ginny! Maggie! Didn\rquote t know you were there!\'94 His smile looked a bit forced.
\par \'93Oh, Fred! How soon are the babies coming?\'94
\par \'93Well, we }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 are}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  talking about twins. I don\rquote t imagine it\rquote ll be }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  fast. When we

 he admitted. \'93But even so--I should probably call Pomfrey now.\'94
\par \'93We\rquote re going to do everything in our power to get Percy back, Fred,\'94 Harry said with determination.
\par Fred nodded grimly at him. \'93Good. Two more people will be waiting to see him when he comes back, unless you\rquote re back }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 very}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

\par His head disappeared from the fire. Ginny turned and put her arms around Harry. \'93How are you going to do it?\'94 she asked him, clutching him tightly. 
\par \'93First--we need to talk to Sirius, I think. And Dumbledore.\'94 He looked at Snape, who nodded at him.
\par \'93I need someone to take over this class. Miss Weasley!\'94 She jumped away from Harry and stood to attention as though he were an army officer and she a recruit. \'93You\rquote re a competent brewer of potions,\'94
 he said with a nod to her. Harry could tell that Ginny was trying not to look pleased about the low-key compliment. \'93And you are a prefect. I need you to tend to these students while I go upstairs with Harry and your sister. I\rquote 
ve written the potion of the day on the chalkboard in the classroom. You will need to patrol the worktables to guard against any unsafe potions practices and check the potions at the end of the class. Are you feeling up to it?\'94
\par Ginny swallowed; Harry didn\rquote t know that Snape had }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ever}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  turned his class over to anyone else before. He hadn\rquote t been at all
 happy with the job his own uncle had done while he\rquote d been away during Harry\rquote s sixth year. \'93Y--yes sir,\'94 she said quietly.
\par \'93Oh, and--should the students give you any trouble or get out of line in any way, do not hesitate to deduct house points.\'94 Would Ginn
y deduct points from Gryffindors? he wondered. Her eyes glittered now and he could almost feel the power emanating from her. No, he didn\rquote t think she would hesitate to do that for a minute, if it was warranted.
\par She lifted her chin and looked him in the eye. \'93I won\rquote t, sir.\'94
\par He nodded to her and swept into the classroom, followed by Ginny, Maggie and Harry.
\par \'93Third year Slytherins and Gryffindors,\'94 he said in that ringing voice. \'93I need to discuss something of great importance with the headmaster, Miss Doughert
y, and the Head Boy. Miss Weasley will be in charge of the class while I am gone. She is a prefect and you are to give her your undivided attention, as well as respect and obedience. She }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 will}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  take house points from anyone who steps one toe out of line--regardless of which house you are in.. And in addition, she will have the power to give detentions--which shall be served with }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . Are there any questions?\'94
\par You could have heard a pin drop in the room. He raised an eyebrow.
\par \'93Yes, Professor Snape,\'94 the frightened third years started stuttering out slowly, in an uneven ripple that took a minute to reach all of the corners of the room.
\par \'93Good!\'94 He nodded at Ginny; despite her brave facade, she looked a bit paler than usual to Harry. \'93Carry on,\'94 Snape said to her with another nod. Harry gave her a reassuring smile and squeezed her hand.
\par As he was leaving, Harry saw Will Flitwick mouth the words, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 What\rquote s going on?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 He merely shook his head grimly as he followed Snape and Maggie into the corridor. He had to slow down to
 wait for them at the top of the stairs, having sprinted up without a thought, moving past them quickly. Maggie tried to keep up, but she was huffing and puffing. Snape was only a little behind Harry, as he was able to skip several steps at a time with hi
s long legs. 
\par Outside the headmaster\rquote s office, they ran into Aberforth, coming out of the passage with the spiral stairs. He looked like his old self again; his hair was collar-length once more, his nose appeared to be restored and his shabby clothes looked
 like he\rquote d just been gardening. His brother, Ron and Hermione followed quickly on his heels.
\par Aberforth nodded at Harry. \'93Goodbye, Harry. I am leaving Winky here for the time being while I--\'94
\par \'93--go tell Sam,\'94 Harry said quietly. Aberforth nodded sadly.
\par \'93Yes.\'94 He sighed. \'93I enjoyed having Katie work for me last summer. A delightful young woman. Sam is very proud of her, you know.\'94
\par Harry grimaced. \'93He didn\rquote t want her to be an Auror,\'94 he said softly.
\par Aberforth looked grim. \'93He has numerous bad memories of it. As do I.\'94 
\par \'93He\rquote ll appreciate that it\rquote s you telling him,\'94 Harry said. \'93And with any luck--soon there will be some good news.\'94
\par Aberforth looked at Harry and smiled. \'93Yes. Hopefully.\'94 He grasped Harry\rquote s hand briefly, then strode off down the corridor.
\par Dumbledore looked round at them all. \'93Well, I do not think that the corridor is the best place to have the necessary conversation about this grave situation, do you?\'94
\par \'93Why don\rquote t we go to my rooms?\'94 Maggie said suddenly. 
\par Dumbledore smiled at her. \'93Excellent idea! And I don\rquote t think a little tea will come amiss, either, as talking is thirsty work...\'94 He took Maggie\rquote s arm in his and they led the way to the staff wing. On the way to Maggie\rquote 
s rooms, Harry stopped and knocked on Sirius\rquote  door, getting no answer. He swore under his breath.
\par \'93Where can he be?\'94 Hermione said softly. \'93Let\rquote s see, when does he teach Apparition on Friday--?\'94
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Alicia\rquote s}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 Harry said softly. Hermione stopped, her mouth clamped shut as though she was afraid she\rquote d say what she thought about }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .
\par As they moved along, Harry hung back, and when they were passing Alicia\rquote s door, he let the others go on and quietly knocked. After half a minute, Alicia came to the door, the baby on her hip.
\par \'93Oh, hello, Harry! What are you doing here at this hour? Don\rquote t you have a lesson?\'94
\par \'93Not right now. Listen, do you know where Sirius is?\'94
\par \'93No, I haven\rquote t seen him since breakfast.\'94 But then Harry looked past her into the room and saw a large black dog lounging near the window.
\par \'93I see Snuffles is here again,\'94 he said, drawing his mouth into a line.
\par She smiled, turning to look fondly at the dog. \'93Yes. He\rquote s such a dear.\'94
\par \'93Yes, well--that\rquote s why I came looking for Sirius. I need to borrow Snuffles.\'94
\par \'93Borrow? For what?\'94
\par \'93Well--it\rquote s not me, actually. Professor McGonagall sent me. Sirius promised her she could use Snuffles for a Transfiguration lesson.\'94
\par \'93What?\'94 she said, her brow furrowing. \'93What\rquote s she going to Transfigure that poor dog into?\'94
\par Harry looked at his godfather grimly. \'93Oh, she\rquote ll think of something.\'94 He patted his leg. \'93C\rquote mere, Snuffles. We need your help.\'94
\par The black dog stood very reluctantly and followed Harry into the corridor. Harry smiled at Alicia. \'93Don\rquote t worry. I\rquote ll return him in perfect working order.\'94
\par When the door to Alicia\rquote s room had closed, Sirius continued to pad along beside Harry in his dog form. \'93What have you been getting up to then, eh?\'94 Harry said to him. \'93While you\rquote ve been lounging about Alicia\rquote s digs, there
\rquote s been a bit of an emergency--\'94 Harry explained the missing Aurors to him, as well as Remus being the Ministry scapegoat and Percy and Katie being among the missing. He also explained who was waiting in Maggie\rquote 
s rooms to discuss the problem. When they were right outside Maggie\rquote s door, Sirius Transfigured himself.
\par \'93That\rquote s dreadful, Harry,\'94 Sirius said, shaking his head. \'93Did you know Katie was born at Ascog Castle?\'94
\par \'93Erm, no,\'94 Harry said, genuinely surprised.
\par \'93Sam and Trina--Katie\rquote s mum--were there for a little celebration we were having when your mum completed her Auror training. Trina\rquote s water broke and my mum and your mum ended up delivering Katie, as Trina\rquote s midwife couldn\rquote 
t get there in time....\'94
\par Harry swallowed; he thought it very likely that he wouldn\rquote t be able to function very well if he had to contemplate what might have become of Katie. He remembered casting the revealing charm with her wand and seeing Rodney Jeffries\rquote 
 tent filled with pinkish magical signatures...
\par \'93Oh, and just so you know, I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  actually gathering useful information in Alicia\rquote s rooms this morning, not just \lquote lounging about.\rquote  She received an owl. I
\rquote ll have to tell you more about it later--we should probably join the others.\'94
\par Harry nodded, not making a comment about Sirius \lquote actually gathering useful information.\rquote  When they entered Maggie\rquote s sitting room, Professor Dumble
dore was in a comfortable armchair near the fire, while Snape sat in a matching armchair on the opposite side of the hearth and Ron and Hermione were side by side on the couch facing the fire. A tea tray was on the table and Hermione was pouring, but Magg
ie was preparing to leave.
\par \'93I really can\rquote t stay--I was supposed to be getting the scrying ingredients and going right back to Sybill\rquote s tower! I\rquote ll find out at lunch what\rquote s happening, yeah?\'94
\par Harry nodded at her. \'93Of course.\'94
\par When she was gone, he and Sirius 
joined the others, Harry settling down on the hearth rug with his back to the fire while Sirius joined Ron and Hermione on the couch. Dumbledore put down his tea and looked round at them all, giving each of them a small smile. \'93This,\'94 he began, \'93
would be a very nice gathering were it not for the fact that we are here for a very serious purpose.\'94 He nodded to Ron in particular. \'93
Your brother was one of the finest Head Boys Hogwarts has ever seen, and if there is any way to get him--and the others--back, we will find it. Unfortunately, I have some bad news,\'94 he said, turning to Harry, Snape and Sirius, \'93
which came while we were talking in my office: the Ministry will not be sending anyone to Azkaban. Not yet, at any rate. In that they are already down by seven
ty-five Aurors, they are understandably nervous about losing more. They are of the opinion that a battle fought on Azkaban fortress against an entrenched enemy would be a sure defeat. They may be right.\'94
\par \'93So Fudge isn\rquote t going to do anything?\'94 Snape spit, eyes flashing. \'93He\rquote s just going to leave all of those witches and wizards there?\'94
\par \'93That is assuming that any of them are still alive, Severus,\'94 Dumbledore said quietly; Harry looked at his best friend in distress; Ron grasped Hermione\rquote s hand convulsively, and Harry swallowed, thinking also of Katie.
\par \'93What about the prisoners?\'94 Sirius wanted to know. \'93They\rquote re just to be left there, without anyone to bring them food and water? Being sent to Azkaban isn\rquote t }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 meant}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to be a death sentence.\'94 Harry could see that he was thinking about what would have happened to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  if he\rquote d never broken out.

\par Dumbledore sighed. \'93The Ministry is assuming two things. First, that the prisoners were all released, so the question of their needing food and water would be moot. Second, it is a
lso being assumed that the Aurors were killed, or the owls that have been sent would have been returned with messages....Now, my worry, and not, I\rquote m sad to say, the Ministry\rquote 
s--is that the chief purpose of this may have been to spirit away the dementors, w
ho would be only too eager to serve Voldemort, in my opinion. If, as the Ministry predicts, the prisoners and dementors are indeed gone and the Aurors killed--the only thing left to do is to recover the dead. There are plans to do just that, when some tim
e has passed and it is deemed safe, but the Ministry of Magic does not see any reason to rush about that. It would be a gross misstatement to say that I merely disagree--\'94
\par \'93Please, sir,\'94 Harry interrupted, his stomach jumping about with impatience. \'93I don\rquote t mean to be rude, but--but I think I know what has to be done. And it\rquote s not to abandon the prisoners }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 or}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  the Aurors. If there\rquote s a single person alive, we should try to get them back, even if it\rquote s someone who\rquote s been kissed by a dementor. We can\rquote t just let th
em slowly starve. And even those who are dead--I\rquote m not trying to say that I\rquote m--I mean--\'94 he faltered again. \'93It meant a lot to Cedric\rquote 
s parents that I brought his body back. I could have left him there and they would have had to hunt down the place where Voldemort had got his body back, but--they didn\rquote t have to do that. They knew, and didn\rquote 
t have to wait. I think we owe the same to the families of the Aurors--and even the prisoners.\'94 Harry saw that Snape\rquote s mouth was drawn into a surly line. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Does he think I\rquote 
m being arrogant, like my father?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry wondered.
\par Dumbledore, however, bowed his head to him. \'93I\rquote d like to hear what you have to say, Harry.\'94
\par \'93Well--everyone in this room knows about my other life. And Ginny knows too--\'94
\par \'93Speaking of Ginny, where is she?\'94 Ron said suddenly, interrupting.
\par \'93I needed to ask Miss Weasley to tend to my third-year Slytherins and Gryffindors,\'94 Snape said archly. \'93She is a prefect, and that is one of the functions of a prefect.\'94 He nodded at Harry, a silent way of urging him on. }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Okay,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought; }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 maybe Snape won\rquote t shoot me down after all.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par \'93So, everyone here knows that I broke out of Azkaban, right? It seems to me that Sirius and I are the only people who haven\rquote t been kissed by a dementor who\rquote ve done this, as far as we know. We know what it\rquote s like in there and we
\rquote re also both Animagi, so we can move about the island in our animal forms and be less affected by the dementors than when in our human forms--if there }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 are}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 any left there. Hermione being an Animagus also makes her a good person for this mission. Plus, in our Animagi forms, we\rquote re all three fairly large animals and can fight in our animal forms if need be--again, if there\rquote s anyone to fight.\'94

\par \'93So }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  think the Death Eaters who were taken to Azkaban are still there, Harry?\'94 Hermione asked him, looking both a little nervous and hopeful.
\par He shrugged. \'93It\rquote s one possibility, that they\rquote re lying in wait, hoping that there will be a rescue attempt and that they can ambush whoever comes. I reckon that\rquote s one reason the Ministry doesn\rquote 
t want to go in yet, for fear of an ambush. But if we go in }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 expecting}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to be ambushed--we\rquote ll be one step ahead of them. Plus, they\rquote 
ll probably be expecting anyone who comes to use the usual approach--the small boats with prisoners go into this grotto, and there\rquote s a long stair that leads up to the fortress proper. We won\rquote t take that route. We\rquote 
ll come in from the top.\'94
\par Snape cut in now. \'93That\rquote s impossible. There are charms on the fortress that not only make Apparition impossible, as it is impossible here at Ho
gwarts, there are also anti-broomstick charms. Or rather, any object that has been enchanted to fly will be rebuffed once it gets close to the island. Flying charms do not work around Azkaban.\'94
\par Sirius nodded in agreement. \'93That\rquote s right. It doesn\rquote t matter--broom, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 motorcycle}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 --\'94 he said, smirking at Dumbledore, who had a small smile.
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Flying car,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 Hermione said, looking smugly at Ron and Harry.
\par \'93Yeah, but }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 animals}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  that can fly--like owls--can get there,\'94 Harry said.
\par \'93Well, yeah,\'94 Sirius said. \'93But we can\rquote t ride owls to Azkaban.\'94
\par \'93No, I didn\rquote t mean that. I meant--a winged }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 creature}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  can get though. That\rquote s how I escaped, after all.\'94
\par Hermione\rquote s face lit up. \'93Of course! Flying in your griffin form!\'94
\par He grinned at her. \'93Right! None of us could fly a broom onto the island--but a golden griffin could fly there.\'94
\par Sirius\rquote  eyes lit up. \'93And so could a hippogriff.\'94 Harry wondered where Buckbeak was now.
\par \'93I don\rquote t know, Harry. I still can\rquote t believe you flew to the coast from Azkaban. When I was swimming, that distance, in my dog form, I almost drowned. It probably didn\rquote 
t help that the current took me pretty far south, almost to the Firth of Forth. After I reached the mainland, I was taken in by the crew of a trawler, thank goodness. They nursed me back to health--well, healthier than I\rquote 
d been , at any rate--and happened to be heading south, to London, so I was able to escape from them and check on you in Surrey before heading north again to Hogwarts. I would never have managed the overland trip if I hadn\rquote t been able to recover fr
om the swim while I was living on the trawler.\'94
\par Snape\rquote s lip curled. \'93I have to agree,\'94 he said, as though it was very distasteful for him to agree with Sirius. \'93It\rquote s too far. You told me yourself, Harry, that you were exhausted from flying to the mainland. You\rquote 
d have the same problem flying in the opposite direction, and so would any hippogriff, especially if carrying a passenger. So, you\rquote d exhaust yourself flying there, collapse, and, if they\rquote re still there, promptly be attacked by Death Eaters.
\'94
\par Harry grinned at him. \'93No I wouldn\rquote t That\rquote s where you come in. We\rquote d need make sure we\rquote re flying a shorter distance--preferably from the deck of a good yacht. We\rquote 
ll need to rent something somewhere along the coast, not too far away. Probably Peterhead or Inveralochy rather than Fraserburgh, especially this time of year, when many of the best might be in dry-dock. And if we do that--we\rquote 
ll need an experienced sailor to be captain,\'94 he added, looking meaningfully at Snape.
\par Snape raised one eyebrow. \'93Yes, but a captain needs a crew--\'94
\par \'93I served as your first mate many times on the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 Harry told him, \'93and didn\rquote t you teach Maggie to sail, years ago? Plus, there\rquote 
s always Uncle Duncan, too. I mean--Professor MacDermid.\'94
\par Snape looked like he was considering all this, his chin in his hand as he stared past Harry at the flames. \'93Yes, yes. It\rquote 
s possible...but if we are to have a vessel tomorrow, I will need to leave now, which means I will not be able to teach for the rest of the day.\'94
\par \'93I think that, for once, we can afford to give the students a small holiday from their Potions lessons, disappointed though they will be,\'94 Dumbledore said to Snape; Harry saw the twinkle in his eye and only just managed to refrain from laughing. 
\'93And while, in many respects, this sounds like an excellent plan, Harry, there is still one problem: while dementors cannot see, and so did not detect you or Sirius leaving the prison, Death Eaters }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 can}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  see, and if they have not all fled from the fortress but are in fact lying in wait, they would very l
ikely notice a yacht moored close by, even if they were primarily looking for small boats to come into the grotto, as you mentioned, rather than hippogriffs and a golden griffin landing on the upper bluffs. For that reason, I think that I should also join
 this little excursion,\'94 he added, to Harry\rquote s surprise, but also relief. Then Harry frowned in confusion.
\par \'93How will you prevent them from seeing us?\'94 he asked the headmaster.
\par Dumbledore gave him a cryptic smile. \'93You shall see, you shall see, Harry. But }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 they}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  shall not,\'94
 he added, putting one finger alongside his nose in a conspiratorial manner and smiling slyly. \'93I think that we will also not \lquote invade\rquote 
 the prison in one fell swoop. We cannot afford to take many people, as we will need space in the vessel to remove the Aurors.\'94 Harry looked surreptitiously at Ron; Dumbledore didn\rquote t say }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 the Aurors\rquote 
 bodies.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  \'93That is seventy-five people to rescue. If we take a large contingent, it will be difficult to accomplish our goal. So--first, we need to find out whether a b
attle even needs to be fought. If we need assistance, we shall have the operatives standing by to provide it. If not--we can simply begin to coordinate the rescue operation. So--Harry, you will need to do reconnaissance first, to see what is what. Your ta
l
ent for conjuring a strong Patronus could be quite useful, in the event that any dementors are still on the island....I shall speak to Hagrid about acquiring some hippogriffs quickly, and I shall speak to the other operatives about standing by. And I will
 come with you, Severus, to acquire a vessel.\'94
\par Snape nodded at the headmaster. \'93Yes, sir.\'94
\par Ron made a face. \'93But what if you can\rquote t get the kind of boat you want? Or someone has it but won\rquote t let you use it? And who\rquote s to say you\rquote ll know how to use whatever kind of boat it is?\'94 He sighed. \'93I\rquote 
m not trying to derail my own brother being rescued, but I\rquote d feel a lot better if you were going to be sailing your own boat. I mean, you probably know that like the back of your hand, and Harry and your uncle, as well,\'94 he
 said to Snape, surprising Harry. Ron usually only spoke to Snape to complain about something. Ron sighed. \'93But I reckon you can\rquote t just shrink down the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 and put it in your pocket, then Apparate to the coast with it....\'94 he trailed off wistfully.
\par Dumbledore laughed heartily suddenly. \'93Well, it is true, Mr. Weasley that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 could not do that. Especially if you do not bring up your Transfiguration marks. Professor McGonagall was just telling me about your performance the other day, in fact. You\rquote re only the third-best Transfiguration student in your year,\'94
 he added, his eyes twinkling at Ron, whose mouth had dropped open.
\par \'93Third? You\rquote re joking! I never thought I was that--\'94 Then he looked perplexed. \'93But then who are one and two--\'94 However, he hadn\rquote t gon
e very far with this line of inquiry before a glare from Hermione told him the probable answer. Dumbledore chuckled again.
\par \'93Need I remind you that your two best friends }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 are}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  both Animagi? And while it is quite true that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  could not Transfigure Professor Snape\rquote s vessel into something small enough to carry in your pocket, and neither could anyone else here, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  can.\'94
\par Harry laughed. \'93You! I should have known!\'94
\par Dumbledore nodded at him. \'93Yes, you should have. I did, after all, teach Professor McGonagall everythi
ng she knows of Transfiguration and was the Transfiguration professor for many years before becoming headmaster. So! That was an excellent idea you had, Mr. Weasley. Despite my having the ability to do that particular Transfiguration, it nonetheless had n
ot occurred to me, and so again we all benefit from your keen--if irreverent--approach to problem solving. Ten points to Gryffindor!\'94 he declared, beaming at Ron, whose ears were quite red now. Hermione was beaming at him.
\par \'93It }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 would}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  be preferable to have the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ....\'94
 Snape admitted grudgingly, raising his eyebrows at Ron. Harry smiled up at him.
\par \'93She\rquote s a yare ship, sir,\'94 he said to Snape
\par He nodded at Harry, looking as though he were trying not to smile.
\par \'93Aye, that she is, Harry.\'94 He turned to Dumbledore. \'93In that case, we should go to the village and Apparate to Dunoon immediately, headmaster,\'94 Snape said, sounding grim.
\par \'93I agree. However, first I will need to contact a certain person I know in Magical Transportation to get a Portkey to the coast on short notice. Where did you say you landed when you escaped from prison, Harry?\'94
\par \'93Fraserburgh.\'94
\par \'93Hm...And how did you avoid being seen? A golden griffin doesn\rquote t set down on the northeast Scottish coast every day.\'94
\par \'93Well, other than the fact that I landed well before dawn--there weren\rquote t even any fishermen out and about--I landed on the roof of the Museum of Scottish Lighthouses. It\rquote 
s a former castle, quite large and high, near the beach, with a modern lighthouse nearby, which is the one they actually use now. The parapets would keep anyone from seeing us if we landed on the roof with a Portkey, especially very early.\'94
\par Dumbledore nodded. \'93Very good, very good. Now, I think the only member of our party we are missing is Madam Pomfrey, should we need someone with us who can give medical attention to those we find, and possibly to members of our own party.\'94
\par Harry bit his lip. \'93Um, well--see, she\rquote s probably on her way to Hog\rquote s End to deliver George and Angelina\rquote s babies. When we called Hog\rquote s End in Professor Snape\rquote 
s office, Fred said he was about to call her to do the midwifing....\'94
\par Dumbledore nodded. \'93Ah, I see. New Weasleys! Isn\rquote t that nice. Well then, we shall have to make certain that we all read up a bit on our first-aid charms before we depart....\'94
\par \'93What about a doctor from St. Mungo\rquote s?\'94 Ron said quickly.
\par Dumbledore looked at him inquisitively. \'93Who did you have in mind?\'94
\par Ron looked sheepish. \'93Dr. Anderssen. We\rquote re sort of friends now. Although, come to think of it--\'94 Ron swallowed. \'93After what we found at the dragon reservation, maybe she wouldn\rquote t want to risk seeing anything like that again--\'94
 Ron swallowed, and Harry wondered now whether Percy and Katie had been cut down as ruthlessly as the people on the reservation.
\par The headmaster nodded. \'93That was truly dreadful, yes. But those people had no way to defend themselves from such an attack, and indeed, were not even expecting one. I expect that seventy-five Aurors would not be so easy to overcome.\'94
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Unless they\rquote re only arriving three at a time and being picked off as they come up those long, winding stairs,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry thought grimly.
\par \'93But if she would be }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 willing}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to come--\'94
\par \'93No,\'94 Hermione said suddenly. \'93We don\rquote t know that we can trust her.\'94 Harry remembered that Ron had said he\rquote d told Hermione about Nita; what he hadn\rquote 
t told Harry was her reaction to that. Harry felt like he was no longer in the dark about this.
\par Ron frowned at her. \'93Hermione, I told you--\'94
\par \'93Yes, and I\rquote m not so sure you should believe that she\rquote s your friend until she shows some other 
signs of being truly disenchanted with the Malfoys, other than calling Draco Malfoy disloyal because he put his dad in prison. Her beloved uncle is in Azkaban--I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 hope}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
. When we first met her at St. Mungo\rquote s, frankly, she didn\rquote t really strike me as someone who was on our side in all this. She hates most Weasleys. Even though she claims she\rquote 
s not getting on with her aunt now, she did give her a place to live when she lost her home. I think that we should contact St. Mungo\rquote s after the fact if we need them to come get anyone for treatment, but asking Nita Anderssen to come along is a }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 very}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  bad idea.\'94
\par Ron looked sulky, as though she would get a piece of his mind later about this. Dumbledore shrugged. \'93If there is some question--it is probably wiser to err on the side of caution. Draco Malfoy\rquote 
s cousin, eh? I do not recall a Nita Anderssen coming to Hogwarts....\'94
\par \'93She went to Durmstrang. Her mum works for the Swedish Ministry of Magic. She\rquote s the one who organizes the annual broom race,\'94 Ron told him.
\par \'93Ah, ah, that would explain it--\'94
\par \'93Yes!\'94 Hermione said. \'93That\rquote s another thing. She went to Durmstrang, where she probably learned Dark Arts from day one. I just think--considering how sensitive this is, bringing in someone whose loyalty can\rquote t be guaranteed isn
\rquote t a good idea--\'94
\par Dumbledore nodded at her. \'93Well, in that we do not know for certain whether we will need a doctor on board, we may merely be wasting Dr. Anderssen\rquote s time, when she might be far more needed at St. Mungo\rquote s.\'94
 He gave Ron a look that said this part of the conversation was over, and Ron grimaced, his mouth in a line, as he gave the headmaster a small nod.
\par They all stood, and to his surprise, the headmaster grasped Harry\rquote s hand. Giving Harry an ironic smile, he said, \'93I knew there was a reason for you to be a golden griffin Animagus, Harry.\'94
\par Harry grinned at him. \'93Yeah, when I was in my other life, I did, too. Only, there, I thought it was so I could break out of Azkaban. Turns out it\rquote s so I can break }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 in.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

 Professor Binns drone on and on, he remembered his own stay in Azkaban, and he hadn\rquote t even realized he\rquote d been singing }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 He is an Englishman}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 under his breath until Ron put an elbow in his ribs. Harry looked up, swallowing; the entire class, including Profess
or Binns, was staring at him, and the Slytherins in particular were sniggering openly. (The Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws were at least doing it behind their hands, and although most of the other Gryffindors seemed to be trying to pretend they didn\rquote 
t want to laugh, Harry could tell it was difficult for them.) Draco Malfoy was laughing the loudest and elbowing Crabbe and Goyle good-naturedly, as they also clutched their stomachs, laughing.
\par \'93Would you care to give us all a little concert, Mr. Potter?\'94 Binns said icily, sending an extra blast of cold air toward Harry as the laughter of the Slytherins continued. \'93At this moment I am not certain that it }{

 he added, making almost all of the other students roar now. He actually looked rather pleased with himself for producing this response. (Laughter was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 never}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  heard in Binns
\rquote  lessons. Snoring yes; laughter, no.) Harry almost longed for the days when the ghostly professor didn\rquote t know his name.
\par Ron and Hermione eyed hi
m with sympathy. Harry wanted to sink beneath his desk and disappear; it seemed that the time to leave for Fraserburgh was eons away, and in the meantime, going through the motions of being a typical seventh-year student was likely to drive him mad. 

\par \'93Sorry, sir,\'94 he said softly, after the laughter had died down.
\par Binns continued droning, as before, and the class once more sank into its usual torpor. When the bell rang for lunch, Harry jerked his head up; he\rquote d fallen asleep, his chin in his hand, and he\rquote 
d been having a very vivid dream. He was in his other life again, not in Azkaban, this time, but in the Great Hall, sitting at the Slytherin table, about to begin a meal. The Bloody Baron was zooming right at him, and Harry thought he was going to tell hi
m
 to fix the timelines, as he had done on the first day of the autumn term of his sixth year, in his other life. Instead, in his dream, the Baron, the Fat Friar, the Grey Lady and Nearly Headless Nick formed a macabre sort of chorus line, their arms around
 each other, kicking up their heels, while singing lustily:

Meanwhile, Peeves was zooming around them in a dizzying display of poltergeist aeronautics, his grating voice singing a completely non-harmonious counter-melody while unseen violins played a warped-sounding accompaniment:
\par }\pard \qc \li0\ri0\sb100\sa100\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I\rquote m called little Buttercup, dear little Buttercup, though I could never tell why.\line But still I\rquote

\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Buttercup.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par Harry shook himself, picking up his parchment and quills and putting them in his bag, following Ron and Hermione down to the Great Hall in a bit of a fog. He remembered hearing Roger\rquote s cousin sing at the wedding, in August, and
 wondered again what he\rquote d done in the other world to end up in Azkaban. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Maybe he was framed}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, Harry thought, but then he remembered that in both worlds, Roger Davies had been a Death Eater. Unfortunately, the only other beings in }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 this}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  world who knew about t
he other one were the ghosts, and they very likely wouldn\rquote t know about a lone wizard and the particular reasons for his going to prison. Unless--
\par He\rquote d never had a conversation with the Grey Lady of Ravenclaw--only greeted her politely every now and then, w
hen the occasion arose. But now he thought--maybe Roger and Evan had been in school when their cousin had gone to Azkaban? Maybe there was some sort of scandal in Ravenclaw, as a result? It might be worth a try to ask her. And it would give him something 
else to think about before the trip up north.
\par He went to the Great Hall with the other students, swept along by the crowds and led by the hand by Hermione now and then, when he started to fall behind, but not really paying attention to what was going on aro
und him. When he sat at the Gryffindor table, he noticed the Ravenclaw ghost sitting at that table, having a conversation with Mandy Brocklehurst and some other seventh years. After he\rquote d eaten mechanically, not even taking notice of what he\rquote 
d chosen, he rose and walked toward the Ravenclaw table without saying anything to Ron, Hermione or Ginny.
\par Harry approached the Grey Lady and said, \'93Excuse me for interrupting,\'94 nodding at both the ghost and Mandy. \'93Could I borrow her for a few minutes? There\rquote s something I need to ask her in private.\'94
\par The Ravenclaws looked surprised, and Padma Patil\rquote s mouth was twisting unpleasantly.
\par \'93Come to ask her for voice lessons?\'94 she said. \'93You didn\rquote t sound }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  bad.\'94 The other Ravenclaws started laughing, but Harry ignored them, a
nd to his relief, so did the Grey Lady. 
\par \'93I will come with you,\'94 she said in a mellifluous voice, wafting after Harry as he left the Great Hall. He looked over his shoulder and found that Hermione, Ron and Ginny looked perplexed; he would tell them later what he was up to.
\par \'93Hello,\'94 he said to the dignified ghost a bit uncertainly. \'93I reckon I should introduce myself. I\rquote m--\'94
\par \'93I know who you are,\'94 the Grey Lady said, smiling indulgently at him. \'93What is it you would like to know?\'94
\par \'93It\rquote s--it\rquote s something about my other life.\'94
\par She frowned. \'93That world was never meant to be--\'94
\par \'93I know, I know. And I fixed it. But--but there are loads of things I don\rquote t understand about it. Like when I was in Azkaban,\'94 he said, dropping his voice lest anyone should hear him, \'93there 
was another prisoner whose cell was near mine. He was Roger Davies\rquote  cousin, and since Roger was a Ravenclaw, I reckon his cousin was too, when he was in school. I was hoping you might know something about why he went to prison in that world. He
\rquote s not in prison in this life, and this has been bothering me for a while, especially now that there\rquote s this trouble at the prison....\'94
\par She shook her head sadly. \'93No cousin of Roger Davies was in Ravenclaw,\'94 she said sadly.
\par Harry grimaced, unsure how else to find out what he needed to know. \'93Are you sure? Think--his name was Geoff. I just met him last summer.\'94
\par She nodded her head now. \'93I think I know the one you mean. But still--he was not in Ravenclaw. When he was here at the school, he was in Hufflepuff.\'94
\par Harry stared. \'93
Hufflepuff? A Hufflepuff went to prison? That just seems--wrong. I mean, how could someone whom the Sorting Hat would put into Hufflepuff end up in prison? How could someone be surrounded by all of that hard-work and loyalty for seven years and break th
e law?\'94
\par She shook her head. \'93Do you not think many Death Eaters are hardworking? And they are certainly loyal to their Master. Hard work and loyalty are as easily used for ill as ambition or bravery or a desire for knowledge.\'94 Her voice seemed to come from
 a far distance. He swallowed, digesting what she\rquote d said. \'93And I did not say that he spent seven years in Hufflepuff.\'94
\par Harry widened his eyes. \'93Did he--did he do something to get himself expelled }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 and}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  go to prison, before he was even out of school? A }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Hufflepuff}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 Harry still couldn\rquote t quite picture a dark wizard who was a Hufflepuff.
\par \'93No; it was quite simple, really. He was asked to leave because he was a Squib,\'94 she said carelessly. \'93It was quite the scandal that he\rquote d been admitted at all.....\'94
\par \'93A }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Squib}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 !\'94 Harry squeaked, before getting control of his voice again. 
\par \'93Yes, a Squib,\'94 she said, completely unperturbed.
\par \'93Well, that\rquote s--that\rquote s even }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 weirder}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 he insisted to her. \'93I mean--why would a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Squib}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  be at Hogwarts in the first place, let alone in a wizarding prison?\'94
\par She gave a small, ghostly shrug. \'93That I cannot tell you. In that other world, I did not even learn of Mr. Filch leaving the school until after he was gone. I do not recall having heard why the Squibs disappeared.\'94
\par Harry drew his lips into a line. \'93Okay. Thanks. You\rquote ve actually been quite helpful.\'94 She nodded to him and drifted through a wall, just as the bell rang for the afternoon lessons.
\par He merely went through the motions of attending
 Herbology and Care of Magical Creatures that afternoon, and when he was back in the common room at the end of the day, Ron, Hermione and Ginny tried pumping him for information about the Grey Lady, but he refused to talk. Finally, after just gazing at hi
m pleadingly for some minutes without saying a word, Ginny broke him. (}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 How did she do that?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he wondered.)
\par \'93All right, all right. You have to promise to keep this quiet,\'94 he said, relenting, leaning close to the other three. They sat in their usual spots nea
r the fire, and Harry looked around the side of his chair before saying anything; the other Gryffindor students seemed to be involved with their own lives and paying no attention to the four of them. \'93I was asking her about Roger Davies\rquote 
 cousin, Geoff,\'94 he whispered to them. \'93The bloke who sang at the wedding last summer. I was hoping she might know why he was in Azkaban in my other life.\'94
\par \'93Why\rquote d you want to know that?\'94 Ron asked, shrugging.
\par Harry grimaced. \'93I\rquote ve been thinking a lot about that, what with our planning to leave for Azkaban in the morning. Or rather, before morning. He\rquote 
s the cousin of someone we know is a Death Eater, and he was in prison in that other world. I know, I was too, but I\rquote m wondering whether he had anything to do with framing Mr. Sp
innet. After all, if Roger was doing what he was doing to protect his family--well, his cousin\rquote s part of that family and might have been convinced to help. Roger convinced Alicia to help.\'94
\par \'93So--if that\rquote s what\rquote s happened, where is Roger?\'94 Hermione wanted to know.
\par Ginny opened her eyes wide. \'93Maybe his cousin double-crossed him?\'94
\par Harry shook his head. \'93I was just trying to find out, for a start, whether the Grey Lady knew why he\rquote d gone to prison before, in case there was a fuss about it in Ravenclaw, because 
of a former member of that house being arrested and all that. But it turns out--he wasn\rquote t in Ravenclaw. He was in Hufflepuff. Except he shouldn\rquote t have been.\'94
\par Ron frowned. \'93Why not? The Sorting Hat doesn\rquote t make mistakes, does it?\'94
\par \'93According to the Grey Lady, Roger\rquote s cousin was in Hufflepuff, but he shouldn\rquote t have been at Hogwarts at all. He was a Squib, and when he was found out, he was expelled.\'94
\par The three of them gasped.
\par \'93Expelled!\'94 Ron choked out. \'93Wow! A Squib gets in, but then gets expelled. I wonder why all of that happened?\'94
\par Harry shook his head. \'93I don\rquote t know, but I mean to ask Dumbledore. He would have had the final say in whether he was expelled, I should think. I just wish there was someone else I could ask about why he might have gone to prison....\'94
\par Hermione looked at him with her arms crossed. \'93You\rquote re forgetting one of the nosiest parkers we\rquote ve ever had the displeasure to meet here at Hogwarts.\'94
\par Harry frowned. \'93I am? What are you getting at?\'94
\par Ron\rquote s eyebrows had flown up. \'93Nosy parker? Are you thinking what I\rquote m thinking?\'94
\par Hermione nodded. \'93Precisely.\'94
\par \'93What?\'94 Harry demanded. \'93Could the pair of you stop talking in code for thirty seconds?\'94
\par Ginny looked at him with her brows raised now. \'93Harry--they\rquote re obviously talking about Moaning Myrtle.\'94
\par Harry stared at her. \'93Moaning Myrtle? How do you know about Moanin--\'94
 But then he remembered that Ginny had thrown the diary through Myrtle in her first year, when she was frightened of continuing to write in it. And when the toilet backed up and Myrtle flooded t
he bathroom and corridor outside, Harry had found the small black book....
\par \'93What makes you think Myrtle would know anything?\'94 he asked them.
\par Hermione shrugged. \'93As I said--nosy parker. Roger\rquote s cousin was a Squib, and he was in Azkaban. Filch is a Squib, and he presumably disappeared with the others. What if they were }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 all}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  sent to Azkaban? Myrtle probably would have found a way to spy on Filch being taken away, I\rquote m guessing. That would be rather juicy.\'94
\par Harry nodded. \'93Could be. All right, good idea. I\rquote ll go see her, when we get back.\'94
\par \'93Don\rquote t you mean }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 we\rquote ll}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  go see her?\'94 Hermione said.
\par \'93Well, erm, I think I\rquote ll go alone.\'94
\par The three looked at each other and then Harry. \'93Why?\'94 Ron wanted to know.
\par He drew his lips into a line. \'93I just think I\rquote ll get further with her is all.\'94
\par Hermione nodded with understanding. \'93Ah, yes. Without me and Ginny. Don\rquote t want to make her jealous.\'94
\par Harry felt himself flush. \'93Well, no, not precisely--\'94
\par Ron laughed. \'93Yes, precisely. You know she\rquote s fancied you since our second year, and you want to take advantage of that, make her think you came to visit her special before you pump her for information. Good job, Harry. Yeah, you\rquote 
re right, we shouldn\rquote t go.\'94
\par \'93Fancies him!\'94 Ginny said, looking indignant. 
\par \'93Um,\'94 Harry began, \'93well, maybe she did at one time. When I was using the prefects\rquote 
 bathroom to work out the clue for the second task of the Tournament, using that screeching egg, she was in that bathroom, too. Not at first--she showed up after a little while, although I\rquote m not so sure she wasn\rquote 
t spying on me from the faucet, before I got in the tub. And she said she\rquote d seen Cedric in there, too.\'94
\par Ginny giggled a little. \'93So--she likes spying on the boys, does she?\'94
\par Harry shrugged. \'93I reckon she hasn\rquote t stopped. Not that I gave her much to spy on when I was a fourth year...\'94
\par Ginny turned beet red and murmured, \'93I always thought you looked quite nice....\'94
\par Now it was Harry\rquote s turn to redden again; he hoped Ron would ignore Ginny\rquote s comment. \'93Anyway, I don\rquote t th
ink she feels quite the same about me anymore, so I need to be careful about what I say. She was rather cross with me for fixing the timelines. I talked with her last year, and she told me how much she enjoyed herself in that other world. Loads of other m
iserable people. She was in her element.\'94
\par \'93It\rquote s just as well if she's over you,\'94 Ron said. \'93After all, what if she was finally successful in getting you to fall for her? My sister would be heartbroken--\'94 he said with a melodramatic sob in his voice, abruptl
y cut off when Ginny hurled a cushion at his head. He caught it easily, laughing.
\par Harry was laughing too, but then he noticed that Hermione was staring at the fire, her eyes narrowed in thought. \'93Yes, Harry,\'94 she said, as though answering a question. \'93Talk
 to her about how happy she was in that world. Lead her to talking about the Squibs, find out whether she was about when Filch disappeared, or whatever happened to him. If there was misery involved, she\rquote ll just }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 revel}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  in telling about it.\'94
\par Harry nodded. \'93I have to agree. She\rquote ll probably be positively gloating.\'94
\par \'93Well, speaking of being miserable, when you were talking to the Grey Lady, Sirius came to the Gryffindor table at lunch and told us that Remus has been detained by the Ministry. They\rquote re questioning him.\'94
\par Harry swallowed. \'93Erm, I hate to ask, but what are their interrogation methods like?\'94
\par Ron shrugged. \'93Well, they don\rquote t use Veritaserum as a matter of course, as it\rquote s not considered completely trustworthy. After all, if Voldemort had a mole in the Ministry, the mole could }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 say}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he was giving a suspect Veritaserum, and then slip in something that makes the suspect say the exact }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 opposite}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  of the truth every time he
\rquote s asked a question. Then they\rquote d have a real mess on their hands.\'94
\par Harry nodded. \'93So--we\rquote ve got our work cut out for us on this trip. On top of everything else, we have to clear Remus\rquote  name. Hopefully, we\rquote ll find out something at Azkaban that will make it plain that he had nothing to do with this.
\'94
\par \'93We should get some sleep,\'94 Hermione said, after yawning hugely. \'93We need to leave at about four-thirty in the morning. I switched our patrol shifts already, Harry, so don\rquote t worry about doing the fourth shift. Mariah\rquote 
s taking it for you.\'94
\par \'93Yeah,\'94 he said, \'93except I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 still}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  have to get up at the same time. Not much bloody difference.\'94
\par \'93I\rquote ve got the third shift,\'94 Ginny said, \'93so I can see all of you off on your trip. I\rquote ll be just finishing up at that time.\'94
\par Hermione nodded. \'93Snape has the third shift, like you, Ginny, so he\rquote ll probably just want all of us to meet downstairs and go after that.\'94
\par \'93Draco Malfoy\rquote s on the second shift, so he\rquote ll be back in Slytherin House by then, none the wiser,\'94 Ginny said, looking relieved. They looked at each other, the four of them; they were very careful what they said around Drac
o Malfoy now that he\rquote d promised to behave more like a Slytherin. They didn\rquote t expect it to stop with tripping Harry in the Great Hall and laughing uproariously when Harry sang Gilbert and Sullivan music in History of Magic.
\par \'93That\rquote s good,\'94 said Ron. \'93Although--how will we explain our leaving to the other people on patrol, both students and teachers?\'94
\par \'93Well, we\rquote ll be leaving with Sirius, Snape and Professor Dumbledore himself, plus Maggie, who\rquote s also a part-time teacher. We could say--\'94 She paused, her brow furrowed in thought.
\par Ginny\rquote s face lit up with an idea. \'93You could say that you\rquote re going to Hog\rquote s End because Angelina\rquote s had the babies! It might even be true by then. Hopefully.\'94 She made a face. \'93I hate to think of her spending much }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 more}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  time in labor...\'94
\par Harry grinned at her. \'93That\rquote s perfect! All right--cover story in place. Time we all got some sleep. We don\rquote t know what we\rquote ll find up north.\'94
\par Ron kissed Hermione on the mouth before going to the boys\rquote  stairs, but Harry pecked Ginny on the cheek, feeling self
-conscious in front of Ron. He thought at first he was going to have a difficult time dropping off, but he very quickly drifted off into sleep, seeing in his dreams a fortress rising from cold, dark waters, and a feeling of foreboding hovering over everyt
hing....

d already woken Ron, who was getting up slowly, moaning as he went. They\rquote d all been hoping to get some extra rest after the
 previous three nights, too, when the three of them had been down in the dungeon, because of the full moon. (He and Hermione had insisted that Harry join them and had promised not to attack each other in the morning.) They dressed warmly, wearing comforta
ble clothes and not bothering with robes. Harry knew that he wouldn\rquote t be able to scramble up a mast on the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

s. Hermione and Ron were doing the same. Harry Transfigured all of their cloaks to look like pea jackets. 
\par When they exited the portrait hole, they found Sirius waiting for them with Professor McGonagall, Maggie and Ginny. All of them but Maggie--who was also dressed for sailing--were normally scheduled to be on this shift; Sirius wanted to escort Harry, Ron a
nd Hermione down to the entrance hall, so there would be no misunderstandings or delays due to their being caught by the three other patrollers.
\par When they reached the entrance hall, they found Amelia Tadeo, a sixth-year Slytherin, along with Walter Word and
 Janet Yeager, both sixth-year Ravenclaws, waiting for the changing of the guard that would take place at four-thirty. So far, Professors Sprout and Vector had shown up to relieve Sirius and Professor McGonagall, but only Jasmine Peters, Albert Rothchild-
-both Ravenclaw fifth years--and Mariah Kirkner had shown up to relieve the other students. McGonagall squinted at a parchment she withdrew from her robes. \'93Miss Kirkner--do you know what has become of Mr. Shire? And thank you for taking Mr. Potter
\rquote s shift, by the way. He has been called away because--\'94 she hesitated, looking nervously at Harry, Ron and Hermione, standing near the large entrance doors with Sirius, Maggie and Ginny. Hermione started to open her mouth, but to Harry\rquote 
s utter surprise, the voice that came out of it was not hers but Severus Snape\rquote s.
\par \'93--because,\'94 said a ringing voice, emerging from the dungeon staircase, \'93he, Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger, among others, have received special permission to go to Hogsmeade to celebrate a birth. Two births, actually. Mr. Weasley is now an uncle,
\'94 Snape announced, walking imperiously into the midst of those gathered in the hall. \'93As it is a rather early hour, Professors Black, Dougherty and I will be escorting them to Hogsmeade.\'94 Harry grinned at him; he\rquote 
d had exactly the same thought about the alibi. He should have known.
\par Professor McGonagall looked relieved that Snape had provided the excuse. She looked at him with a small smile. \'93I would come myself, Severus, but the headmaster has also been called away
 on business at the Ministry, and I am serving in his stead while he is gone. I expect I shall be able to pay a visit to my former house-members when he returns.\'94
\par \'93I expect so, Minerva,\'94 he said smoothly.
\par He started to move toward the door, but McGonagall stopped him. \'93Oh, Severus--you didn\rquote t happen to see Mr. Shire down in the dungeons, did you?\'94
\par Snape turned, frowning. \'93Mr. Shire?\'94
\par \'93Edward Shire, sixth year. Slytherin. He is scheduled to patrol during this shift, but he did not arrive with Miss Kirkner, who is taking Mr. Potter\rquote s place.\'94
\par \'93I\rquote m taking Eddy\rquote s place,\'94 a familiar, lazy drawl said from the direction of the dungeon stairs. Draco Malfoy emerged into the light, his prefect\rquote s badge gleaming. \'93Eddy came to wake me--he\rquote s got a fever. He reckons he
\rquote ll go to see Pomfrey in the morning. He\rquote s trying to sleep it off first. I told him I\rquote d take his shift.\'94
\par Harry looked at him with narrowed eyes; was he telling the truth? When did Draco Malfoy start performing acts of altruism? 
\par \'93Very good, Mr. Malfoy," McGonagall said imperiously, "but Mr. Shire will have to make do with me in the morning. He will not be able to see Madam Pomfrey--she will still be in Hogsmeade until tomorrow evening, very likely.\'94
 She nodded at Harry, Ron and Hermione. \'93Mr. Weasley is now an uncle, and she is there attending to his new niece and nephew, not to mention their mother.\'94
\par Draco looked at Harry with narrowed eyes. \'93I see,\'94 was all he said. 
\par \'93All right, then!\'94 Professor Sprout said sleepily. \'93Let\rquote s get this new shift started. Professor Vector and I will go up to the second floor, Malfoy, you and Kirkner take the east wing--\'94
\par As the patrollers moved off, Harry saw Malfoy look over his shoulder at them as they opened the heavy front door and prepared to leave. Harry and Ginny hung back.
\par \'93Can you--can you give us a minute?\'94 he asked Snape softly. \'93Just to say--\'94
\par Snape nodded silently, and Harry caught Sirius\rquote  eye, wondering whether he should have asked him instead. Sirius turned away, and Harry couldn\rquote t tell what that meant.
\par When they were standing in the entrance hall alone, Harry pulled her to him, holding her tightly and burying his face in her hair. \'93We\rquote re going to bring them home, Ginny. I promise,\'94
 he whispered to her. She nodded and turned her head, meeting his lips with hers, holding his head still with her fingers in his hair.
\par \'93Oh ho, what\rquote s this, then?\'94 came a familiar voice.
\par Harry looked up and saw Draco Malfoy and Mariah Kirkner enter the hall; Mariah looked like she might have been trying to prevent Draco from returning. Harry wondered whether Hermione had told Mariah the purpose of her taking his place.
\par \'93We\rquote re, erm,\'94 Harry hesitated.
\par \'93You\rquote re }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 what}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? Leaving for Hogsmeade to see two new Weasley brats, leaving Ginny behind? Why isn\rquote t Ginny going? After all, she\rquote s an aunt, but all Mc
Gonagall kept saying was that prat you call a best friend is an uncle.\'94 He crossed his arms, looking at Harry with narrowed eyes, highly suspicious.
\par Harry swallowed. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Draco was making a very good point. We really messed this up.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par \'93What makes you think she isn\rquote t coming?\'94 he said, trying to keep his voice from shaking.
\par \'93Well, for starters, no one\rquote s said anything about her leaving the castle, and for another, she\rquote s not exactly dressed for it, is she? You\rquote re wearing Muggle clothes, too. Why would that be?\'94
\par Harry and Ginny looked at each other, swallowing. After what felt like an eternity, Harry opened his mouth to answer, but unfortunately, before he could, the door opened behind him, knocking into him and Ginny. It was Snape.
\par \'93I think you\rquote ve both had quite long enough to--\'94 He froze when he saw Draco Malfoy and Mariah Kirkner. \'93Mr. Malfoy. Miss Kirkner. Ever vigilant, I see,\'94 he said, voice dripping with irony. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 We
\rquote re the ones who need to be vigilant around Draco Malfoy,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry thought.
\par \'93I was just about to tell Malfoy that the reason why Ginny wasn\rquote t going to come along this early was because she was expected to want to sleep after her shift. But she\rquote s very excited about seeing the babies, so she\rquote 
d like to come with us now after all. She just needs something warm to wear for the walk to the village--\'94 He took out his wand and waved it at Ginny\rquote 
s robe, which turned into a warm winter coat with rabbit-fur trim at the collar and cuffs. She smiled at him.
\par \'93Thank you, Harry. I\rquote m glad I don\rquote t have to wait to see my niece and nephew.\'94
\par Mariah smiled at them uncertainly, looking nervously at Draco out of the corner of her eye. \'93Bring back photos,\'94 she said softly, very quickly. Ginny gave her a small smile.
\par \'93Well, we\rquote re off!\'94 Harry said a touch too loudly. When they were outside, he heaved a sigh of relief. Ron, however, was surprised and upset at seeing Ginny.
\par \'93Ginny! What are you doing here? You\rquote re not supposed to be coming!\'94 He turned to Sirius. \'93Tell me she\rquote s }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  coming--\'94
\par \'93Relax, Ron,\'94 Harry said quickly. \'93She\rquote s only going as far as Hog\rquote s End.\'94
\par \'93Hog\rquote s End!\'94 said Sirius. \'93That works out rather well. We were going there anyway, as Dumbledore thought it best to have the Portkey departure point be in the rear garden.\'94
\par \'93Okay, that\rquote s good. I have to say, though, we didn\rquote t think this part through very well. If the rest of us are going to Hog\rquote 
s End to see the babies, certainly it would have made sense for Ginny to come, too. Malfoy came back to the entrance hall and wanted to know why Ginny was staying. Or why she wasn\rquote 
t going. Whatever. He also wanted to know why I was wearing Muggle clothes, but I didn\rquote t give him an answer to that.\'94
\par They all looked at each other nervously. Finally, Sirius said, \'93We\rquote d best be going. The Portkey takes effect in one hour.\'94
\par The four of them put their shoulders to the wind and walked toward the village. Ron had his arm around Hermione\rquote s shoulder and Harry around Ginny\rquote s. It looked to him like Snape wanted to put his arm around Maggie, but he did not. Si
rius walked ahead of them all, shoulders hunched against the cold.
\par When they reached Hog\rquote s End, Ginny let them in, as she knew the password. When they were all in the entrance hall, they were suddenly surprised by Fred leaping down the stairs, grinning ear to ear. 
\par \'93What\rquote s this, then? We weren\rquote t expecting visitors already. Angelina\rquote s only half done, but so far we have the girl! Little Rowena Weasley has greeted the world!\'94 he declared. \'93George\rquote 
s upstairs, threatening to hex Madam Pomfrey if she tries to take her away from him one more time. She\rquote s just trying to clean her up, but George won\rquote t let her go!\'94 he grinned.
\par Ginny clapped her hands together rapturously. \'93Oh, what\rquote s she look like?\'94
\par \'93Beautiful! Full head of sort of brownish-orange hair, very curly, and skin like coffee with loads of cream. You can tell she\rquote s going to be absolutely gorgeous. I think even Angelina\rquote 
s going to have a hard time getting her daughter out of George\rquote s clutches!\'94
\par He looked energized by the goings-on, and Harry could tell that Ron was reluctant to tell Fred the real reason for the visit.
\par \'93Well,\'94 Harry said, \'93actually, only Ginny is here to visit. The rest of us--\'94 he nodded at Ron, Hermione, Snape, Maggie and Sirius, \'93are getting a Portkey to the coast. We\rquote re going to bring back Percy and the others.\'94
\par Fred froze, looking back and forth at their faces. \'93Oh, god,\'94 he choked. \'93The Ministry said--they aren\rquote t sending anyone. Not yet. I can\rquote t believe it. You really are?\'94 Harry nodded. Fred swallowed and looked down at his shoes. 
\'93Good,\'94 he said, looking up again. \'93Because--as much as George and I have given him a hard time right from the moment we were born--we }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 need}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 to have Perce around to keep us in line, you know? And--and Mum--\'94 Harry had never seen Fred look quite so emotional. Ginny stepped forward and put her hand on his arm. Fred put the arm around her, saying, \'93He\rquote s always been Mum\rquote 
s favorite, in a way. Oh, she loves all of us, we know that. But she and Percy had a sort of--understanding. I think that\rquote s why she went off a bit, finding out he\rquote 
d signed on to train as an Auror without a by-your-leave. If anything happened to Percy--I think Mum would--\'94 He looked very grim. \'93Well, I don\rquote t think she\rquote d be the same....\'94
\par Ginny nodded, Fred\rquote s arm around her shoulder tightly. She gazed at Harry. \'93They\rquote re going to get him back, Fred. You\rquote ll see.\'94
\par Harry swallowed, not wanting to make her a liar. He bobbed his head at the two of them. \'93Right, then. How soon does the Portkey take effect, Sirius?\'94
\par Sirius check his watch. \'93Ten minutes. Fred and Ginny, you\rquote d better stay inside. We don\rquote t want either of you caught in our wake. You could wind up halfway across the country.\'94
\par \'93I\rquote d like to go up and see little Rowena, anyway,\'94 Ginny said softly. She smiled at all of them now, not just Harry, then stepped toward Maggie and put her arms around her. \'93Good luck,\'94
 she whispered to her sister. She turned to Ron and he pulled her to him brusquely; Harry could see that his eyes were shining. 
\par \'93We\rquote re bringing him back, Ginny, you\rquote ll see,\'94 he told her, his jaw looking very tight, as though clenching it were helping him to keep control of his emotions.
\par Ginny hugged Hermione then, and even Sirius. She utterly surprised Snape by also hugging him, quickly and wordlessly, before turning to Harry. He surprised her by pulling her into the drawing room, calling over his shoulder, \'93We\rquote 
ll just be a minute!\'94 before closing the door. He just couldn\rquote t do what he needed to do in front of the others. He immediately pulled her to him and claimed her mouth, sinking his fingers into her h
air and deepening the kiss, feeling her arms snake around him, until she was trembling and he thought it very likely she would fall down if he let go of her. He slowly broke the kiss and pressed his lips to her brow. \'93Oh, Ginny,\'94
 he breathed against her skin. 
\par \'93You\rquote re scared,\'94 she said simply, whispering. He nodded.
\par \'93Going back there--I\rquote ve tried not to think about it--but it has to be done. We can\rquote t leave them there.\'94 He framed her face with his hands. \'93I have something for you. Two somethings, actually.\'94 H
e reached into his shirt sleeve and withdrew Sandy, handing her to Ginny. "I don't dare take her with me. I'll probably have to Apparate at some point." He directed his next words to Sandy. "Sorry Sandy," he hissed at her. "Ginny will take good care of yo
u." 
\par "I know, Harry Potter. Good luck." 
\par He smiled ruefully. "Thanks. I'll probably need it." Then he reached into his trouser pocket and pulled out the silver-colored basilisk amulet, looking at Ginny again. \'93I know that the last time you wore it you saw me with--someone else. And I didn
\rquote t want to make you feel violated by wearing it when we--we were still not quite together. But I want you to have it while I\rquote m away, so you\rquote ll know I\rquote m all right.\'94 He had already repaired the chain, which she\rquote 
d broken when she\rquote d pulled it from her neck after seeing him with Mariah. He placed it over her head and moved her hair out of the way so that it could rest on her sternum. She looked down at it, then up at him. 
\par \'93What if it shows me that--that something dreadful has happened to you?\'94 she whispered.
\par He put his finger under her chin. \'93Then you won\rquote t have to wait and wonder,\'94 he said softly, hoping it didn\rquote t come to that. 
\par \'93Oh, I wish I could come!\'94 she said suddenly, clasping the amulet. \'93But--but I don\rquote t know anything about sailing, like Maggie and Professor Snape and his uncle--and you. I can\rquote 
t Apparate or turn into an animal at will, like you and Hermione and Sirius. And I\rquote m not a werewolf, like Ron, with all of the abilities that that gives him. I\rquote m just about as bloody useless as they come, aren\rquote t I?\'94
 she sobbed. He held her tightly, rocking her.
\par \'93Hardly useless. And you\rquote re fabulous at dueling. This is just--yeah, we need people who can do certain things, that\rquote s true....\'94 He was at a complete loss, having no idea what h
e could say to comfort her. He had to settle for kissing her lightly and turning to open the door to the entrance hall. She put her hand on his arm, to stop him.
\par \'93Harry, there\rquote s something I have to tell you.\'94
\par \'93What?\'94 He hoped he wasn\rquote t going to miss the Portkey.
\par \'93I--I went to see Madam Pomfrey.\'94
\par He frowned. \'93So?\'94
\par She raised her eyebrows and looked at him with wide eyes. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I went to see Madam Pomfrey.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94
\par The meaning of what she was saying finally dawned on him and he pulled her to him in another crushing kiss; he was acutely aware this time of her body being pressed to his under the coat he\rquote 
d conjured from her robes, and her fingers lightly tracing his neck, the taste of a mint in her mouth that made her breath feel cool, despite the fact t
hat her mouth also felt like an inferno. He had to try very hard to pull away from her, struggling to get his breath. She smiled slyly at him. 
\par \'93I wanted to give you an incentive to come back,\'94 she said, turning quite pink. He grinned ear to ear.
\par \'93That\rquote s some incentive. Don\rquote t worry--I already had every intention of coming back. But now--\'94 He kissed her again quickly, grinning, and finally, they both returned to the hall.
\par She went to the back door to see them off, along with Fred. Once they were all standing outside in the garden, Sirius took out what looked like a child\rquote 
s spade, for playing in the sand at the seaside. The five others put their hands forward to touch it. Harry looked toward the back door of the house, seeing Ginny framed in the window there, 
her right hand pressed against the glass and her left clasping the amulet. The last thing Harry saw before he started hurtling through space was Ginny mouthing the words, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I love you,}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 at him. Then the hook behind his navel pulled him forward with the others, and Hog\rquote s End was gone.
\par They landed with a thud on the roof of the Museum of Scottish Lighthouses, as he\rquote d recommended. It was just as he remembered, only a bit colder and more wintry, as it was a good month earlier in the year than when he\rquote d escaped f
rom prison. Or was it two months earlier? After getting to his feet, Harry walked to the edge of the roof, staring over the wall at the sea, as he had when he\rquote 
d flown to this spot from Azkaban less than a year earlier, in his other life. The others were brushing down their clothes and trying to get their bearings. He turned to look at Ron and Hermione, giving them a sad smile. \'93
This was the first place I stood as a free man after escaping,\'94 he told them. They tried to smile back at him, but they looked more like they were grimacing; he knew they didn\rquote 
t like to think of him in prison. He turned to see what Maggie, Snape and Sirius were up to. 
\par He stopped smiling very quickly; something was wrong with Maggie. Her eyes had gone vacant and round, and she had col
lapsed onto the stone deck. She looked past them all at the blank, cloud-covered sky, and when she began to speak, it was in that same odd, deep voice Trelawney had used when she\rquote 
d told Harry that Peter Pettigrew was going to return to his Master....

\par \'93But--but what she said--\'94 Harry stuttered. What }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 had}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  she said?
\par Snape looked at him. \'93I heard it. I think I remember it. Hang on--\'94 He pulled out his wand, and in a moment had conjured a piece of parchment. He pointed his wand to his own temple and muttered something, then murmured something to the parchme

\par \'93What it means,\'94 Snape said tersely, helping Maggie to stand, \'93is that we are wasting time. We have to meet the headmaster.\'94
\par Harry frowned. He really wanted to understand what Maggie had just said. She slumped against Snape, still looking a bit weak. Harry hoped she would be able to help on board the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia.}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\par Ron stepped toward Snape and took his older sister from him. He picked her up easily and leapt up on the wall, then down to the ground; Harry watched him land, bending his knees. It was a leap that could break another man\rquote 
s legs, but Ron treated it like going over a low garden wall. Then he saw Ron take out his wand and cast a spell on Maggie; he didn\rquote t know what it was, but she seemed much more chipper afterward. Maybe it was something he learned at St. Mungo
\rquote s, Harry thought. He looked up at Sirius, who nodded at him; moments later, the four of them had joined Ron and Maggie on the ground next to the Museum by Apparating.
\par Sirius and Snape walked ahead; Ron walked with his arm around his sister and Harry and Hermione walked side by side, bringing up the rear. Hermione was perusing the parchment wi
th the words Maggie had spoken by the clear, bright illumination coming from the lighthouse.
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 A new world\rquote s vanguard shall you find...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  A vanguard?\'94 she puzzled.
\par \'93Ah, there you all are!\'94 Albus Dumbledore said when they\rquote d gone only a little way; he emerged from around a rather large pile of rocks, where he\rquote 
d evidently been sitting on the ground. He was holding, very carefully, what looked like a two-foot model of the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . Duncan MacDermid was with him, dressed for sa
iling, and to Harry\rquote s surprise, so was Aberforth Dumbledore, whose presence had not been expected. Then, behind Aberforth, another figure emerged.
\par \'93Sam!\'94 Harry said in shock. 
\par It was indeed Sam Bell, looking quite pale and anguished in the glow of the lighthouse, his mouth very thin. \'93Hullo, Harry,\'94 he said hoarsely, as though his throat was very tight. \'93
I talked Dick--Aberforth, that is--into letting me come. I--I had to come,\'94 he said.
\par Harry grasped his hand, eyes stinging. \'93I\rquote m glad you\rquote re here,\'94 he lied. \'93Katie will be glad of it, too,\'94
 he added, hoping he sounded more optimistic about the outcome of their excursion than he felt. Even if she was all right, Katie would probably be appalled by her father\rquote s presence. As it was, Harry was more than a little 
worried about him joining them. Sam had so very little magic left in him. Ginny could have come at this rate, he thought. With her dueling skills, she would have been more helpful than a distraught father who couldn\rquote t do magic.
\par Dumbledore was the only one among them wearing wizarding robes. Sam, like Aberforth and Duncan MacDermid, was dressed in Muggle clothes for sailing, although Harry wasn\rquote 
t aware of his having any experience at sea. Dumbledore nodded at Sirius now, who took the shrunken ship from him a
nd walked to the edge of the water with it. He placed it in the surf, then abruptly changed into a dog form, wading into the water, nudging the ship forward with his nose. After a little while, Harry could see that Sirius was having to swim while continui
ng to push the yacht into deep water enough; there were buoys indicating the locations of shoals, and Sirius had only just gone beyond them. They didn\rquote 
t want the keel to founder as soon as the ship was enlarged. From what Harry could tell, Sirius had passed a buoy marking three fathoms. Finally, Dumbledore turned to Snape.
\par \'93What do you think, Severus?\'94 Harry saw Snape nod, and Dumbledore took out his wand, pointing it toward the ship. Harry realized that he hadn\rquote t actually seen Dumbledore do much magic with 
a wand; he often just clapped his hands or flicked a finger. Now he was concentrating harder than Harry had ever seen him, his jaw clenched and an eerie light in his eyes. Harry didn\rquote 
t hear the incantation, if there was one, but suddenly a smooth stream of light which seemed to be all of the colors of the spectrum at once flew from Dumbledore\rquote s wand, and the ship began to bulge and stretch until the full-sized }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  was before them, her masts majestic against the pre-dawn sky, her lovely lines as breatht
aking as Harry remembered, the varnished wood and gleaming metal glowing in the beacon from the lighthouse. 
\par Sirius had swum back toward the shore, still in his dog form, to get out of the way during Dumbledore\rquote s spell. As soon as the full-sized ship was b
obbing in the water, white-tipped waves slapping indignantly against the hull, Sirius swam back toward it and then abruptly changed into his human form just as he reached the rope ladder that had been conveniently left hanging down for just that purpose. 
They all waited patiently for him to climb up and over the rail, although it seemed to take forever, but then they saw that he was having difficulty getting the dinghy into the water to bring the rest of them across. 
\par \'93Why don\rquote t I take Maggie over myself, Captain?\'94 Harry said, speaking to Snape, who looked surprised for a moment that Harry was calling him this. \'93She\rquote 
s the lightest one of the experienced sailors. We can help Sirius. For one thing, he should have let down the anchor first thing; at this rate, she\rquote ll be going out with the tide.\'94
\par Snape looked toward the ship, his face twisting. \'93Please,\'94 was all he said, but his voice was dripping with contempt for Sirius\rquote  inexperience.
\par Harry closed his eyes, feeling the change rush through him, the wrenching, bo
ne-deep pain coming very fast and then dissipating as his paws touched down on the frozen sand. He heard gasps, and looked up, realizing suddenly that neither Sam Bell, Duncan MacDermid nor Aberforth Dumbledore knew he was a golden griffin Animagus. The h
eadmaster explained it to them as Maggie approached him uncertainly and Hermione gave her some pointers for holding on. When Maggie\rquote 
s trouser-clad legs were gripping his sides painfully and her fingers were sunk deep into his mane, the cloth of her pea jacket scratchy against his back, he spread his wings and leapt into the cold air above the beach at Fraserburgh. 
\par He climbed for some minutes, moving past the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , then he wheeled against the sky, circling back so that he could spiral down to the clean, 
scoured deck, where Sirius was still struggling with the dinghy. Sirius hadn\rquote 
t dried himself off yet after his swim, and he was shivering and soaking in the spray that the wind was blowing across the deck, his fingers struggling ineffectually against the s
wollen ropes. Harry waited for Maggie to climb off him before he transfigured; she was already racing to the anchor. Harry took over the dinghy operation from Sirius, suggesting that he dry himself. Thanks to Maggie, the anchor chain was soon snubbing and
 the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  was firmly in place. Harry lowered the dinghy into the cold water and called to Maggie, \'93I\rquote 
ll row back; you stay here and start checking the sails. This shouldn\rquote t take long.\'94
\par \'93Aye, it shouldn\rquote t,\'94 Snape\rquote s voice suddenly said behind him. Harry w
hirled; Snape, Aberforth, Hermione, MacDermid and Dumbledore had Apparated to the ship. Only Ron and Sam still stood on shore. Harry grimaced; he should have known there wouldn\rquote t have to be multiple trips, as he\rquote 
d already brought Maggie, and Ron and Sam were the only others who couldn\rquote 
t Apparate. He scrambled down the same rope ladder Sirius had scrambled up and when he was in the dinghy he put the oars into position and waited while Snape untied the painter and tossed it down to him. The small dinghy bobbe
d violently in the wintry water, to which Harry was not accustomed; sailing on the Firth of Clyde wasn\rquote 
t exactly the Caribbean, but in the summer, it was a sight warmer than the northeast coast of Scotland in February. He bit his lip instead of crying out 
the first time the near-freezing water splashed over the transom onto his trousers, and rowed on, determined to be back on the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia\rquote s}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 deck as soon as possible; he could hardly feel his hands on the oars just moments after starting for shore.
\par On the way back to the ship, he let Ron row, as Ron pointed out that he could do it faster. Harry didn\rquote t argue; he\rquote d felt the strain all across his shoulders on the way to the shore, and he hadn\rquote 
t especially relished walking through the freezing shallows to ground t
he dinghy so Ron and Sam could get in. Harry sat in the stern this time, Sam next to him on the duckboard looking worse than Harry had ever seen him. He remembered Sam telling him about having killed his wife to protect Katie, and going to prison for ten 
years for it, even though Aberforth had strongly implied that, as an Auror, Sam could have avoided that if he\rquote d really wanted to. Now he was going to find his daughter--the daughter he hadn\rquote 
t seen between the ages of two and twelve because he\rquote d been where she was now--in Azkaban.
\par Once they were on board, Harry waited for the command to weigh anchor, but instead Snape stood with his hand on the tiller, looking at Dumbledore expectantly. He raised his wand again, that stern glint in his blue eyes as he cried i
n a slow, ringing voice, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Navis omnis obscuro}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 !\'94
\par Harry saw the ship, and indeed, all of the people on it (including him) shimmer with a strange rainbow effect briefly. He felt distinctly odd. Then it was gone, and Snape started barking orders, which Harry, 
Maggie and Duncan MacDermid rushed to obey. When the ship had been returned to its normal size, she\rquote d been facing south, so the first thing they need to do after weighing anchor was to raise the sails and bring her about. Soon the }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  was slicing through the frigid waters of the north, her sails full of the winter wind, on course for the fortress of Azkaban.

\par \line \line When they had been traveling away from the mainland for so long that Great Britain was a mere line on the horizon and the sky was starting to lighten in the east, Harry looked at Snape\rquote 
s face. He stood alongside Harry, looking straight ahead over the dark water rushing swiftly toward them. His jaw was clenched; Harry could tell he was concerned. \'93Is there a problem, Captain?\'94 he asked, trying not to let his voice shake.

w was clenched and his dark eyes had that determined look that Harry knew so well. 
\par He drew his lips into a line. \'93If I may--perhaps some reconnaissance is necessary? We could come to a full stop and let me fly on, try to determine what our heading should be.\'94 
\par Snape looked thoughtful for a moment; Dumbledore was standing nearby, and Snape looked questioningly at him, knowing, as Harry did, that he\rquote d heard their conversation. It didn\rquote 
t appear to Harry that Snape had received an answer, but he nodded at Harry as though he had. Then he gave the order to his uncle, and the anchor crashed down into the deep, which seemed to be }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 very}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  deep at this point. Duncan MacDermid stood at his station, waiting, letting out the chain more and still more. Finally, the anchor w
as firm and the chain was snubbing again, the rocking motion of the deck changing subtly in response. Snape nodded at Harry and he closed his eyes, opening them when the change was complete and his paws had touched down on the deck. Facing aft, he ran for
w
ard two steps and leapt into the air, his wings reaching for the east and west horizons. He climbed higher and higher, wheeling around and taking a north course, the frosty air slicing through his lungs painfully as he moved his wings. Soon the waves were
 far below him and the rising sun set fire to the scudding clouds in the east, off his right wingtip. 
\par He\rquote d never flown in a sky quite like this before and had to try very hard to resist the temptation to just gawp; he reminded himself that he had a job to 
do and flew on, higher and higher, trying to get the best vantage point to view the sea below him. The whitecaps were very small and thin at this height, and he hoped he wouldn\rquote t have a problem finding his way back to the }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . The idea was supposed to be to limit his flying by having the ship nearby. 
\par At length, he found that he could no longer see what was below through a thick block of clouds that seemed to go down and down; he looked to his right and tried to gauge the position of the sun relative t
o his location. Descending in a tight corkscrew, knowing that he might have to pull up quickly to avoid landing in the ice-cold water, he finally broke through the clouds. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Azkaban.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par He didn\rquote t remember it being shrouded like this. Had the Death Eaters done
 it? He started to land on a rock outcropping that was very high up, then thought better of that and flew down to a plateau which looked familiar. As soon as he set down, he knew just where he was. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 This is where I took off when I escaped.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par His heart was in his throat as he turned to face the doorway carved into rock that led to the corridor containing his cell door. As he remembered, there was no door protecting this corridor, as escape was not considered a possibility, usually, and the dem
e
ntors had no need to be sheltered from the elements. Harry took out his wand, bracing himself for a different kind of cold--the cold that the dementors sent into his very soul when they drew too near to him. He reminded himself that Ginny had been to see 
M
adam Pomfrey and knew that he could probably conjure a very, very strong Patronus with that particular happy thought. Still, the thought of dementors at all was somewhat unnerving to him. It had been a while. Every step seemed to make his heartbeat double
. 
\par Inside, it was dark and quiet; even the sound of the sea breaking violently on the rocks receded into a distant whisper. He found the door to his old cell open, and he stood there, staring at the spartan walls and floor, the hard pallet. He hadn\rquote 
t spent very much time there, but it was where he\rquote d been when he read the letter from his stepfather telling him that Ginny and his sister were dead, and that his remaining brother was mad. It was where he\rquote d been when he\rquote 
d decided once and for all, whatever it took, that he needed to bring }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 this}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  world back. 
\par He didn\rquote t walk all the way into the cell but backed into the corridor again, trying to see into the dim recesses of the prison, which had never been properly lit because dementors were blind and prisoners didn\rquote t deserve to see--and didn
\rquote t care about it either, after enough time in Azkaban. He didn\rquote t yet feel the cold of the dementors, but he didn\rquote t see any prisoners, either. Or Aurors. 
\par As he passed cell after empty cell, doors swinging open, he found himself with the uncontrollable urge again to sing one of Buttercup\rquote 
s songs, to fill the eerie silence. He finally gave in to the impulse, a smile pulling at the corners of his mouth.

\rquote t really a good thing. He stopped smiling as he thought about this. It meant that the dementors were somewhere else, probably wreaking havoc. It meant that the prisoners were all freed, and he didn\rquote

led, ending on a choking sob. Harry tried to follow the voice, but it was difficult, as the stone corridors, magically carved from the solid rock of the island, bounced the sound around in confusing ways. 
\par \'93Say something again!\'94 Harry shouted down the corridor. \'93I can\rquote t tell where you are!\'94 
\par The man was simply sobbing now, and that was no help. Also, Harry knew he should get back to the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , so he could bring the others to help. \'93Who are you?\'94
 Harry hollered now. After a half-minute of continued sobbing, the man gathered himself enough to reply. 
\par \'93James Edmundson. Jim. An Auror,\'94 he added, his voice breaking. Harry swallowed. 
\par \'93My--my dad\rquote s name was James,\'94 Harry called to him. \'93Listen--I\rquote m with some other people. Doing reconnaissance. I need to go back so I can help them get here. Don\rquote t worry--we\rquote 
re going to get you all back to the mainland.\'94 
\par But the man\rquote s sobbing had resumed, and Harry turned and ran back down the corridor until he was outdoors again. A white light was starting to illumine the cloudy 
mist surrounding Azkaban as the sun rose higher, and the resulting brightness hurt his eyes. He darkened his wand and put it away before changing back into his griffin form, making a running leap into the mist, moving his wings vigorously until he finally
 broke through and was flying over the steel-dark sea once more. 
\par He hoped he was flying in the right direction, but when it seemed that he should have seen the Patricia again and didn\rquote t, he started to panic. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Don\rquote t panic, don\rquote t panic}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , he instructed himself, trying not to think about the fact that he was in the air high over the North Sea and would need to fly for miles and miles before being able to set down if he had lost track of where the }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  was. 
\par Finally, to his surprise, he saw a speck moving abou
t in the sky far ahead of him. The speck seemed to be moving in deliberate, if erratic, circles. It was oddly shaped for a bird, and behaving even more oddly for a bird, though as Harry drew closer, he realized that there was a very good reason for all of
 that. 
\par It wasn\rquote 
t a bird, but Sirius riding in circles on Buckbeak. Harry recognized the hippogriff immediately, and wished he was able to speak in his griffin form. Sirius motioned to him to follow, when he saw him, and he turned Buckbeak so that he was sp
iraling downward very fast. Harry hesitated for only a moment before doing the same, although he was starting to get very nervous as he saw the sea approaching faster and faster.... 
\par Almost before he had a chance to brace himself, he saw the deck of the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 coming up at him, and he was able to land with his legs bent, to avoid injury, but only just. His heart was going a mile a minute, and he immediately changed back into his human form, tempted to kiss the scrubbed decking. 
\par \'93What--what happened--?\'94 
\par The others were standing about, looking uncertainly at him. Dumbledore stepped forward and gave him a hand, helping him to his feet. \'93I\rquote 
m afraid that was my concealment spell, Harry. Or rather, it is a kind of Transfiguration. My specialty. Something I took great care to keep }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 off}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 my Chocolate Frog card is the fact that I am the foremost expert in the world on the Chameleon Transfiguration.\'94 
\par \'93Chameleon Transfiguration?\'94 Harry said, frowning. \'93What's that?\'94 
\par \'93Transfiguring anything--objects, other people, large ships, even myself--so that they appear to blend in with their surroundings, rendering them invisible, effectively.\'94 
\par Harry dropped his jaw. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 That\rquote s}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  how you did it! It was Transfiguration!\'94 
\par \'93Yes. Not an easy art, the Chameleon Transfiguration. It can be very tricky, especially when casting the spell on oneself and if one is planning to move about in a varied terrain. The spell must be cast to constantly adjust the individual\rquote

\par \'93So--that\rquote s why I couldn\rquote t see the ship until I was practically crashing through the deck to the galley?\'94 Harry said, laughing. 
\par Dumbledore nodded, smiling. \'93I thought it best.\'94 
\par \'93Well,\'94 Harry said, trudging toward a coil of rope and using it for an impromptu stool; \'93I don\rquote t think we need it after all. The only person I made contact with was an Auror. The dementors and prisoners seem to be gone. And the Auror didn
\rquote t sound quite sane, frankly.\'94 He nodded at Snape. \'93I think we should change our heading, captain, so that we\rquote re heading north-by-northwest. We\rquote ve veered a bit too far east. And it will still be hard to find--it\rquote 
s been shrouded in a white mist. But we should come close, and if we don\rquote t seem to be finding it, I can do reconnaissance again.\'94 
\par Snape nodded and barked orders to his uncle and Maggie, who obeyed with a crisp, \'93Aye, aye, captain,\'94 from each of them. 
\par Harry went to stand at the prow, looking down at the solid-looking sea parting on either side of the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia\rquote s}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  slim hull. Ron and Hermione came to stand on either side 
of him, Ron helping Hermione to walk across the deck unsteadily, as she didn\rquote t have her sea legs yet. His best friends watched silently, giving him their companionship without making any demands. Ron put his hand on Harry\rquote 
s shoulder as they gazed out over the sea, the cold salt spray stinging their faces, and Hermione put her head against his shoulder as he put his arm around her. Together, they watched the mountain of mist approach that hid the fortress of Azkaban. 

\par They dropped anchor a short distance away, and Dumbledore stepped forward, his wand drawn again. \'93Well,\'94 he said in a businesslike way, \'93let us reveal our goal.\'94
 He pointed his wand at the mist and it slowly dissipated, revealing the rocky shape of Azkaban, rising from the cold sea, huge waves breaking whitely on her eastern and western flanks. 
\par Hermione gasped and Ron\rquote s grip on Harry\rquote s shoulder tightened painfully. Harry swallowed, remembering approaching it in the small boat with the Aurors who\rquote d accompan
ied him to prison. He turned, wondering whether Sam was all right, but he saw neither Sam nor Aberforth. He turned to Sirius, standing with Dumbledore, petting Buckbeak\rquote s flank with a firm hand. 
\par \'93Where\rquote s Sam?\'94 he asked him. 
\par \'93He and Aberforth are below," Sirius told him. "I forgot that when you worked for him, he was called Dick. Sam keeps calling him that.\'94 
\par Harry nodded and headed for the companionway; opening the hatch carefully, because of the pitching of the ship, he made his way below, where Sam and Aberforth were sitting at a table, having some tea (or at least, Harry assumed it was tea). 
\par \'93Oh, Dick, I don\rquote t know what I\rquote ll do if I lose her--\'94 Sam was choking out. Harry didn\rquote t have to guess what he was talking about. He cleared his throat. 
\par \'93We\rquote re here. I already found out that the dementors are gone. The prisoners too. It seems that just the Aurors are left. We\rquote re going to start getting them out of there.\'94 
\par Sam regarded him with haunted eyes, and Harry had a glimpse of how he must have looked every minute of the ten years he\rquote 
d spent in Azkaban. Sam nodded silently, his eyes round and his mouth slack, and Aberforth nodded with his mouth pulled into a grim line. 
\par \'93Why don\rquote t you two stay here until we get back with the first group? It will take a number of trips, probably.\'94 
\par The two men nodded at him again, and this time Aberforth spoke quietly, saying simply, \'93Thank you, Harry.\'94 
\par The slapping of the sea against the hull was louder in the hold than on deck, and Harry climbed back up quickly, glad to be out of the claustrophobic space. When his family had been on the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  in his other life, usually it had been his mother down below in the galley, and the twins, as well, while he and Jamie and his stepfather and Uncle Duncan had been above, concerned with
 the work of sailing. Harry never liked going below if he could help it; he far preferred it on deck. The summer he was thirteen, he\rquote d even slept on the deck instead of one of the berths below. 
\par Dumbledore reversed the Chameleon Transfiguration on the ship
, so that they should have no trouble finding their way back, and Harry soon learned that Buckbeak, as well as three other hippogriffs, had been Transfigured into mice, which Dumbledore had been carrying in his pockets. Harry was more and more of the opin
ion that there was no magical art more useful than Transfiguration, but he didn\rquote 
t dare say this while his Potions Master was standing nearby. When the other hippogriffs had been restored to their usual selves, the deck was a bit crowded; Ron claimed one, He
rmione another, and Dumbledore the third. Snape, his uncle and Maggie would stay to manage the ship and Aberforth would continue to keep Sam company belowdecks, as well as tending to rescued Aurors when they began to pour in. 
\par Harry changed into his griffi
n form again, taking off and pointing his nose for Azkaban. The four hippogriffs took off right after, flanking him, two on a side. The five magical creatures moved their wings against the cold air, on a mission. Harry landed on the plateau first, then qu
i
ckly changed and moved out of the way for the others to land. Sirius and Buckbeak could communicate without any trouble; a look was all it took, and Dumbledore said something quietly to the other three that had them standing still and to attention while t
he five of them entered the corridor to begin the search for the Aurors. 
\par Harry briefly showed them his cell; he could see tears in Ron and Hermione\rquote s eyes as they glanced around at the dismal little room; Harry thought it possible that his en suite bath at Ascog Castle was bigger. \'93
I heard a man calling to me, but I couldn\rquote t tell where he was. I think we\rquote re going to have to check each and every cell in the place.\'94 
\par They agreed, and after lighting their wands, began moving more swiftly through the corridors, finally finding the Auror named James Edmundson at the very end, in the last cell before the winding stair leading down to the next level. He wasn\rquote 
t alone, to Harry\rquote s surprise, but with another man who sat in the corner, his knees drawn up to his chest, his eyes staring. Edmundson had trouble standing; Ron pulled him to his feet and Harry clasped his hand. 
\par \'93Hello, Jim,\'94 he said awkwardly, not quite knowing what to say to this man who\rquote d sobbed to him earlier. \'93I told you I was bringing help.\'94 
\par The man looked like he would have collapsed onto the floor again, were it not for Ron supporting him, as he glanced up at Harry\rquote s scar. \'93But--but you\rquote re--you\rquote re }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Harry Potter!}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 he breathed, incredulous. 
\par Harry smiled at him, patting him on the shoulder. \'93And you\rquote re going home,\'94 he said gently, glad he hadn\rquote t told the man who he was before; he might very well have thought he was hallucinating if he heard a voice say, \'93It\rquote 
s Harry Potter here! I\rquote ve come to get you out!\'94 
\par Hermione helped the gibbering man in the corner to stand. His eyes had a vacant look that Harry didn\rquote t like. Motioning to him with his head, he asked, \'93Jim--what happened to your friend?\'94 
\par Jim Edmundson looked even more grim than he already had, which wasn\rquote t easy. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Elliott was kissed}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 he whispered, \'93and then tossed in here with me.\'94 
\par Harry shook his head; he wished he thought Edmundson could be questioned about what had occurred, but clearly it was too soon. They had to concentrate on getting the Aurors off the island. Sirius and Dumbledore said they were g
oing on, down the stairs, looking for the others. Harry helped Ron get Jim Edmundson back to the plateau, Hermione leading the docile Elliott and trying to explain to him that they were going to ride a hippogriff now. Harry held Ron\rquote 
s steed while Ron helped Edmundson mount him, and Ron climbed up behind without any effort. The animals had been fitted with proper saddles, harnesses and reins, and Ron\rquote 
s mount was worrying at the bit in his mouth. Ron put his feet in the stirrups and picked up the reins now, p
reparing to take off, while Harry turned to Hermione and her charge so that he could hold their hippogriff for them, as he had for Ron. He was amazed that Hermione hadn't balked at the idea of riding a hippogriff again; she had hated it when she was young
er. When she'd mounted hers, back on the ship, he had noticed that her lips were very white and pulled into a thin line.
\par However, as he turned, Harry saw that Elliott was silently stepping toward the edge of the precipice. Hermione was stroking her hippogriff, whispering reassuringly to it, and Harry didn\rquote 
t realize until it was too late what Elliott was going to do. He simply stepped off into space. Harry gasped, then realized that that was a waste of time; he swiftly changed into a griffin and leaped off th
e precipice to try to catch him, but it was no good. If it had been a straight drop down to the water, they were high enough that Harry might have reached him in time, but the surface below was hard, unforgiving rock, rising too quickly, and when Harry re
a
ched him and turned him over, Elliott was staring lifelessly up at the winter sky, his neck broken. Harry flew back up to the precipice where Hermione was standing, looking down in horror. When he had changed back to his human form, he took her in his arm
s, pulling her away from the edge, his own eyes stinging. 
\par \'93It\rquote s no good, Hermione,\'94 he whispered to her, feeling her entire body trembling. He knew how impotent she felt, because he felt that way too, just standing there stupidly while a man leapt to his death. \'93We\rquote 
ll have to take care of retrieving the dead at the end. Our first concern should be for the living,\'94 he said softly. She looked at him, her dark eyes full of tears, nodding, knowing he was right. He knew what it was to feel responsible for someon
e else dying, and he ached to see that she knew what this was like now, too, although he knew, rationally, that it wasn\rquote t her fault, that after Elliott had received the dementor\rquote 
s kiss he was already dead, in a way, although his body lived yet. Elliott had simply finished the job the dementors had started. 
\par She looked up at him with glistening eyes. "It's just like Maggie said..." she whispered. 
\par "What?" 
\par "The Prophecy. The one she gave at the lighthouse museum. Ron and I were talking about it while you were off trying to find this place..." 
\par "Ah. I see. What part do you mean?" 
\par "}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Insensate voids still others be,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
" she whispered, looking over her shoulder in the direction Elliot had gone. Harry put his arm around her shoulder protectively, before she could go 
diving off the cliff herself. He looked up at Ron, who looked stricken, clearly wanting to comfort Hermione himself, but he knew he had a job to do as well. He nodded at Harry and took off with Edmundson, the hippogriff\rquote 
s wings creating a strong breeze, moving Harry\rquote s and Hermione\rquote s clothes as though a gale were starting up. Harry managed to get Hermione\rquote 
s mount to calm again; when she had reacted to Elliott jumping, the nervous creature had picked up on her agitation and had started stamping and snorting. It finally seemed that they could leave him, and Harry took Hermione\rquote 
s hand and led her back into the prison. She came, reluctantly, turning her head to look at the edge of the rock, where Elliott had been only a few minutes before. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 That\rquote s two}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , Harry thought. He wondered how many more Aurors had been kissed. He hated to think what Mrs. Weasley would do if one of them was Percy.... 
\par He and Hermione found Dumbledore and Sirius on the level below, where there were more than a dozen more Aurors, most of them all right, although they were dehydrated and hadn\rquote 
t eaten in days. Three more of these Aurors had been kissed, two men and one woman, and Harry warned Sirius, \'93Stun them. We can use the dinghy to get them back, instead of the hippogriffs. We had one upstairs who--who stepped off the cliff...\'94
 he choked out, the guilt washing over him again. 
\par Sirius looked horrified, but said, \'93We\rquote ll retrieve the dead later,\'94 just as Harry had told Hermione. 
\par Ron had already returned by the time the four of them had helped the Aurors they\rquote d found climb back to the plateau with the hippogriffs. Each of them took one passenger with them, except for Harry,
 who was his own steed, and so took the two most alert-looking Aurors, both of them clinging to his mane, legs gripping his body, as he took off and beat his wings with all the effort he could muster, moving back toward the }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 That\rquote s eight}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , Harry thought when they\rquote 
d all set down on the deck. Sam had something to do now, taking care of the returned Aurors, who were all led down the companionway. Aberforth took over Ron\rquote s hippogriff while Harry helped Ron lower the dinghy into the water again, so he c
ould put his werewolf strength to good use and row to the grotto, bringing back some more people that way. 
\par They were able to bring back nine back on the next trip, as Ron could take three passengers in the dinghy (five people made it ride too low in the choppy water) and nine again after that. They\rquote 
d retrieved slightly more than one third of the Aurors who\rquote d gone missing, and Harry wanted nothing more than to go to sleep for a month. His body ached all over from doing the Animagus Transfiguration repeatedl
y and then from the flying, as well. He was also unaccustomed to carrying two passengers at once, both of them adults. As the rescue work continued, Harry understood why they\rquote 
d remained in the cells--not one of them had a wand. All of the imprisoned Aurors had been disarmed and their wands were nowhere to be found. 
\par After they\rquote d brought back over fifty Aurors, ten of them people who\rquote d been kissed (Ron had had to stun them and bring them back in the dinghy, then carry each up the ladder, slung over his shoul
der), Harry, Ron and Hermione unlocked another cell, on one of the middle levels that they\rquote d just reached going down (Ron had been working his way up from the grotto, so they were reaching the middle levels last). 
\par Harry\rquote s heart leapt into his throat; ther
e they were, curled up together on the floor, her head on his chest, his arms around her. They looked very peaceful together; he could see that their chests were rising and falling with their breathing. Suddenly, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 he
}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  looked up, seeming very alert, especially compared to many of the others they\rquote d rescued. His blue eyes were the same as Ron\rquote s, even behind the spectacles, which had one broken lens. 
\par \'93Ron!\'94 Percy Weasley cried in disbelief. He shook Katie awake, and she opened her eyes slowly, blinking and rubbi
ng them when she saw the three of them standing there, as though afraid that she was dreaming. Hermione stepped forward and helped her to stand, pulling her into an embrace. 
\par \'93Oh, you\rquote re all right!\'94 she said tearfully; Harry had thought that Hermione wasn\rquote t especially fond of Katie after he\rquote 
d started seeing her during the previous summer, but clearly she was over that now. Ron put out a hand and helped Percy to stand; he looked a little uncertain on his feet as his younger brother embraced him. 
\par Ron grinned at Percy. \'93Good thing we found you, too. Mum told me not to show my face at home again if I didn\rquote t bring you back.\'94 
\par Percy dropped his jaw. \'93She didn\rquote t!\'94 
\par \'93No, she didn\rquote t,\'94 Ron admitted. \'93But I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 felt}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  like I wouldn\rquote t be able to show my face, you know?\'94 He g
ave his older brother a lopsided grin and Percy gave him a small smile in return. 
\par Even though he didn\rquote t know where they were, Harry was glad for a moment that the dementors were gone, as they couldn\rquote t take away the relief and happiness he felt at finding them alive and unharmed. \'93Good to see you, Perce,\'94
 he said, meaning it, and hugging him quickly. 
\par \'93Good to see you too, Harry,\'94 Percy answered with a nod. Harry turned to Katie then. Hermione stepped back without a word and Harry took her in his arms, holding her tightly, thinking of what a comfort she was to him the previous summer. 
\par \'93And you--you may not be my girlfriend anymore, but--\'94 
\par \'93I know,\'94 she whispered into his neck. She pulled back from him a little. \'93I don\rquote t know when I\rquote ve been gladder to see anyone in my life.\'94 
\par \'93Your dad\rquote s here, too,\'94 he told her quietly. She covered her mouth in horror. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Here}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , as in }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 here}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par \'93No--back on the ship, waiting for you.\'94 
\par \'93Ship?\'94 
\par Hermione explained about the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  while Percy told Harry and Ron about how the operation they\rquote 
d been involved in (taking the twenty-five Death Eaters involved in the Gringotts siege to Azkaban) had gone very wrong. Apparently, Death Eaters who had not been involved in Gringotts had landed on the upper levels of the fortress, flying Swe
dish Short-Snout dragons, having fitted muzzles over the dragons\rquote  mouths and noses to contain the flames. They\rquote 
d also fitted the enormous beasts with cars that hung below their bodies, so that the dragons were like dirigibles with wings, their passengers f
lying below instead of above, except for two wizards on each dragon who were doing the driving, as it were. They\rquote 
d brought ten dragons to the island; five were to take the prisoners away, to a place where they would have the opportunity to throw in their l
ot with Voldemort; four were to take the dementors, who would probably work for Voldemort with no prompting whatsoever, and one was for the Death Eaters who had come to liberate the prison. 
\par This last group had fought the Aurors who had been bringing the prisoners in the boats. They didn\rquote 
t even try to kill most of them, disarming as many as they could and herding them into cells, locking them in. The ones who avoided being disarmed and fought back even remotely successfully were eventually killed, for the m
ost part. They were massively outnumbered and had been unprepared for fighting in the confined spaces of the corridors and stairs of the prison, whereas that was exactly what the Death Eaters were expecting to do. The ones who fought back had the dementor
s set on them by the Death Eaters, who locked them up with the other Aurors after they were thus rendered docile. Harry and Ron nodded, not telling Percy about the Auror, Elliott, whose death they\rquote 
d witnessed. It was during the fighting that some of the Death Eaters had been killed, too. They nodded again; they\rquote d already found some of the bodies, lying in the corridors, their comrades not bothering to retrieve them. 
\par Katie walked to the corridor and looked up and down it. \'93What level are we on?\'94 she wanted to know. 
\par \'93Seventh level down,\'94 Hermione told her. Katie nodded. \'93All right. We need to go down two more.\'94 
\par \'93We--what?\'94 Ron said, baffled. \'93I\rquote ve already done that level.\'94 But Harry had a feeling he knew what was going on; he shook his head at Ron and took Katie\rquote s hand, putting it in Percy\rquote 
s. He put his hand on her shoulder and nodded. 
\par \'93Let\rquote s go,\'94 he said simply. 
\par When they were in the corridor two levels down, Katie started counting under her breath, lightly touching each door as they walked slowly away fro
m the stairs. When she reached the eleventh cell on the right, she stopped and pushed the unlocked door open. She walked to the middle of the cell, turning all around. She looked at Harry. \'93Do you know where we are, Harry?\'94
 He shook his head, because technically it was true, but he had a feeling that he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 did}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  know. It was a slightly larger cell than the one he\rquote 
d had, because it was meant to be shared; there were two bunk beds with mere wooden planks in lieu of mattresses, showing that it had held four people before the 'liberation.' \'93This was where he lived for ten years,\'94
 she said softly, going to a wall under a high, barred window. \'93See this? It\rquote s how he kept track of time.\'94 
\par Etched into the wall so lightly that he had to light his wand to see it were small 
grids which clearly formed a calendar. Twelv-month cycles, repeated over and over. In December of each year, a day toward the middle of the month was marked, extra deep, and next to it was etched, over and over, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Katie}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Katie}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Katie.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry swallowed. 
\par \'93Your birthday,\'94 Harry said, to which she nodded. \'93You\rquote re what kept him going,\'94 he whispered to her. 
\par She shook her head. \'93Not exactly. He told me about that once. The thing that kept him going, day after day, waiting for the time he would be released, was the thought that I was growing up without him. Which wasn\rquote 
t a happy thought, so the dementors couldn\rquote t take it away from him.\'94 Harry remembered that Sirius had been able to keep his memory of being innocent because that wasn\rquote 
t a happy thought, either. They all stared at the makeshift calendar silently, and Harry imagined Sam, year after year, etching the grids and numbers into the wall with whatever small, jagged rock he\rquote d been able to find. He\rquote 
d certainly had nothing else to do in this place. 
\par Percy broke the silence. \'93For what it\rquote s worth, at least Katie and I ended up together,\'94 he said, moving to put his arm around her. She blushed, returning his embrace. Percy looked at the three of them. \'93I hope the three of you won\rquote 
t be embarrassed by this, but I didn\rquote t want to do this until--or if--we were rescued. When we didn\rquote t have any hope of that--it didn\rquote t seem like the right thing to do. And now--I feel like I\rquote ll explode if I wait any longer--\'94
 
\par They frowned, as Percy smiled lovingly at Katie and then slowly went down on one knee before her, causing both her and Hermione to cover their mouths with their hands. 
\par \'93Katie Bell, I love you with all my heart and all my soul, and I was prepared to die with you here in Azkaban. I thought that nothing could be more fitting than to die in your arms, and with you in mine. Now, instead, we have the chance to }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 live}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  in each others\rquote  embrace. Would you do me the very great honor of doing that with me, always? Katie Bell, will you marry me?\'94 
\par Percy\rquote s old-fashioned courtly words sounded both odd and just right, and after a moment of shock, Katie broke into tears and went down on her knees with him, throwing her arms around his neck and crying, \'93Yes, I\rquote 
ll marry you, Percy Weasley!\'94 Hermione\rquote s eyes were streaming and she suddenly threw her arms around Ron, who staggered for a moment under her assault, turning deep red, reminding Harry of their third year.
 Harry just grinned at the embracing pair, on their knees still, and found that he couldn\rquote t prevent the laughter bubbling up from inside of him; he hadn\rquote 
t seen it coming at all, and it was the best, the most appropriate thing he could imagine. 
\par His laughte
r proved infectious, and the others joined him, Percy and Katie getting to their feet again, while Harry kissed her on both cheeks, grinning. "You make every other man in the world look bad, you know, being able to come up with speeches like that, with no
 planning," he told Percy, laughing. 
\par Ron agreed. "Too right," he said, earning him a playful smack on the arm from Hermione. 
\par "No planning!" Percy said, rolling his eyes. "I've been rehearsing that in my head since we were locked up!" 
\par "Yes," said Ron, with a perfectly straight face. "Because you certainly didn't have anything }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 else}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  you could do, locked in a cell with your girlfriend..." 
\par Katie and Percy both turned deep red. "I thought about what to say when she was asleep," Percy mumbled, turning even redder, making Katie laugh. 
\par "And I seem to be making a habit of losing my old girlfriends to Weasleys,\'94 Harry added, making Katie laugh even harder. There was another round of back slapping and hugs, and then the five of them went down to the grotto, where Ro
n had tied up the dinghy, and Harry waved goodbye to them, feeling that something good could come out of this after all. Ron\rquote s strong arms moved the oars swiftly, and they disappeared down the winding passage, heading back to the }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . 
\par As he left, Ron called to Harry, \'93Find out where that ticking is coming from!\'94 
\par Harry frowned. \'93Ticking?\'94 he called back. 
\par \'93Yeah. I hear ticking. Down here somewhere. Might be someone with a watch. Someone we\rquote ve missed. Take a look around.\'94 
\par Harry went up to the nearest 
level where the hippogriffs were tethered, looking for Dumbledore, Aberforth or Sirius. He found Sirius about to take off with another kissed Auror lying across the saddle before him, stunned, and Dumbledore helping to hold the animal still until Sirius w
as firmly in his seat. 
\par \'93What is it, Harry?\'94 the headmaster said to him after seeing his face. 
\par \'93Well, some good news--we found Percy and Katie.\'94 He decided to leave it at that for the moment, so that the couple could announce their own engagement, once they were all back on deck. \'93Ron\rquote 
s rowing them and Hermione back to the ship. But he said he heard ticking down in the grotto. His ears are better than mine. I could use some help figuring out what that is. He thought it might be a watch. I thought--since we haven\rquote 
t found the dead Aurors yet--\'94 they were missing about a dozen Aurors still \'93--we might check to see whether they\rquote re down in the grotto. Someone who was wearing a watch before being killed might be responsible for the ticking noise.\'94 

\par Dumbledore nodded and stepped back from Sirius, whose steed ran forward, spreading his wings and taking to the sky. Aberforth had already left for the ship, and the two remaining hippogriffs stood waiting patiently. One of them had been Hermione\rquote 
s, but Harry reckoned he could fly it back himself, since she\rquote d already left. 
\par Wordlessly, Dumbledore turned toward Harry and together, they went back down the winding stairs to the dank grotto. When they reached the bottom of the stairs, Harry started to speak, but Dumbledore sti
lled him, putting his hand on his arm. Harry watched him close his eyes and tilt his head, listening. When he opened his eyes again, he motioned with his head. 
\par \'93This way. Mr. Weasley was right. Ticking.\'94 
\par Harry wondered how on earth Dumbledore had heard a
nything above the sound of water on stone, echoing noisily in the cave and punctuated by very loud dripping sounds. They walked deep into the grotto, the passage winding so that they could no longer see the bottom of the stairs or the entrance to the cave
. They walked with their wands lit, held high, and at length, Harry finally started hearing the ticking, too. They turned a corner and found--the dead Aurors. Bodies had been piled there, tossed willy-nilly, with a disrespect that made bile rise to Harry
\rquote s throat. 
\par With them, they also found something else. 
\par It appeared to be a trunk, but it had been partially sunk into the sand at the water\rquote s edge, and embedded in the top was a small clock, which was the origin of the ticking. At least, Harry thought it was
 a clock. It bore only suns, moons and planets on its twelve hands. Harry felt like he\rquote d seen something like it before, but he couldn\rquote 
t remember where. Dumbledore however, clearly knew what it was, and Harry had never liked an expression less than the one he saw on the headmaster\rquote s face now. 
\par \'93We should leave this place,\'94 Dumbledore said, his voice very soft as he looked intently at the trunk. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Now}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 
\par \'93But,\'94 Harry began, \'93the bodies....their families...\'94 
\par But Dumbledore was already striding away. \'93Unfortunately, that will not be possible,\'94
 he called over his shoulder as Harry sped up to stay with him; he had never realized that Dumbledore could move so quickly. When they were again near the mouth of the grotto, they discovered that Ron had already been able to return in the dinghy. 
\par \'93So,\'94 he began, \'93did you find the bodies?\'94 
\par Dumbledore nodded grimly. \'93We found them. Unfortunately, we will not be able to retrieve them, as there was something else, as well.\'94 
\par Ron frowned. \'93What?\'94 
\par \'93A bomb,\'94 Dumbledore said simply, climbing into the dinghy, arranging his robes around him. 
\par \'93A bomb!\'94 Ron said in shock. 
\par \'93Yes, Mr. Weasley, a bomb. A magical incendiary device. I now believe that the ultimate goal of this--enterprise--was to destroy Azkaban forever, with the captured Aurors trapped here, which is why they didn\rquote 
t risk their own lives to kill more of our people. I believe that it was put on a clock in hopes that rescuers might come and also be killed at the same time. We have retrieved the living. U
nfortunately, we shall not be able to do the same for the dead. It is necessary to make haste. There is no telling what effect the device will have on the spells that have been placed on the fortress.\'94
 Then he lifted his head, as though he was listening intently, and Harry wondered whether it was already too late, and the bomb was about to go off. 
\par \'93Bloody hell!\'94 he spat, the first time Harry could remember hearing him swear. \'93Do you hear that Mr. Weasley?\'94 
\par Ron nodded ruefully. \'93Yeah. Come on, Harry,\'94 he said, moving toward the stairs again. 
\par \'93What? Why? I thought we had to go?\'94 Harry was confused, but followed anyway. 
\par \'93There\rquote s someone up here, crying,\'94 Ron said shortly, and Harry wondered again how, at his age, Dumbledore could have hearing comparable to Ron\rquote s, when most younger people--like him--couldn\rquote t hear what Ron could. }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Perhaps he put a spell on himself before coming,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry thought. 
\par \'93Thought I\rquote d cleared out all of these cells,\'94 Ron said, following the sound. \'93I know that before I moved up to the next level, I didn\rquote t smell anyone else here.\'94
 Finally, Harry could hear it too. But he was shocked when he saw who it was. 
\par \'93Cho!\'94 
\par She sat in a corner of a cell, looking up at him blankly, her dark eyes empty. He wondered whether she\rquote d been kissed by a dementor, but perhaps only a little kiss. A part of her seemed to be gone. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
When did she become an Auror}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? he wondered. He really didn\rquote t know the first thing about what she\rquote d been up to since the end of his sixth year, when he\rquote d managed to contribute to the death
 of yet another boyfriend of hers. It seemed that she couldn\rquote 
t stand, but when Ron tried to pick her up, she clung to the leg of a pallet, her grip surprisingly strong. Harry tried to pry her fingers from it, but she just stared at him with wild eyes and continued to hold on. 
\par Finally, Ron got her fingers loose and picked her up easily, as she was so small. The three of them returned to the grotto. Harry looked at his best friend. \'93Listen--Ron, you row yourself and Dumbledore out of here. Sir,\'94 he said to the headmaster, 
\'93I\rquote ll change to my griffin form, and if you could lash her on securely so she can\rquote t fall, I can fly us back to the ship. That way the dinghy will be a little lighter and move faster.\'94 
\par Dumbledore nodded, and when Harry changed into his griff
in form, he heard her gasp, despite her otherwise half-witted state. Dumbledore conjured cords to lash her to Harry, then climbed back into the dinghy, which Ron started rowing with lightening speed. Harry ran back up the stairs with her still lashed to h
im, so they could take off with the advantage of height. 
\par Just as he was approaching the edge of the lowest cliff, he felt the ground beneath him start to shake; he heard a low rumbling and turned, looking up. The walls of the fortress were vibrating very q
uickly, so that it appeared his vision was blurred, and the hippogriffs that had been left on the upper precipice took off in fright, crying out with those strange noises they made, not neighs and not birds\rquote 
 calls. Cords of green and red light crackled in jagged patterns over the rocks and the fortress walls, and Harry remembered what Dumbledore had said. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 The bomb must be disrupting the security spells,}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought, as the red and green light started to become blindingly bright. Large chunks of rock started 
to fall from the fortress walls, and he turned to take flight. The shaking and rumbling from the depths of the fortress were growing by the moment. He was launched into the air rather sooner than he\rquote 
d planned to be as the rock on which he was standing brok
e away along a line of green light that crackled across it. As he fell, he moved his wings, rising into the air again, hoping they could get clear quickly. He had no thought for anything but flying as fast as he could, and he wished that the }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  was moored farther away, as he worried now about what flying debris could do to her. 
\par Down below, he could see that the swells were dangerously high, water sloshing into the bottom of the dinghy, as Ron, looking very small, rowed as quickly as he could, leaning
 into every stroke, giving it all his might. Dumbledore sat opposite him in the stern; Harry hoped he was holding on tightly. Then suddenly, it was as though an unseen hand were pushing Harry through the air, a blast sending something like a strong, hot w
ind through the atmosphere, emanating from the fortress in all directions. 
\par He continued to move his wings as quickly as he could, and then he saw that the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 was in danger; the anchor was still down, and the enormous waves that were sweeping across t
he surface of the deep, because of the tremors emanating from Azkaban, were making her rise up so high that, pulled down by the anchor, she was lying almost on her side, the masts practically horizontal. Harry saw dozens of people on the deck grabbing ont
o whatever they could to avoid being pitched overboard into that suddenly violent, already near-freezing sea, but he was also quite certain that he heard more than one splash, followed by screaming. 
\par Huge chunks of debris were flying through the air now, sm
ashing into the mizzenmast, and going right through the mainsail when she was almost righted again; more projectiles tangled in the rigging, and Harry realized that he could no longer see Ron and Dumbledore in the choppy waves. It took him a few agonizing
 minutes to find the dinghy, floating upside down in the turbulent waters, and he wanted to cry out, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Noooo!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par But then a further search revealed a very wet Ron swimming back toward the dinghy with one arm, while his other arm supported Dumbledore, now missin
g his hat and looking rather bedraggled. They managed to reach the upturned dinghy and hold on, but the subsequent waves from the disintegrating prison created swells that lifted the tiny wooden craft up over and over, while they clung to it tenaciously. 
Harry had to dodge flying debris and try to work out how to set Cho down on the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  so he could help Ron and Dumbledore. 
\par Snape had had someone weigh anchor, so that she wouldn\rquote t list so violently again, riding the swells instead, but then Harry saw the enormous gash in her side and his heart almost broke. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Our beautiful ship,}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought tragically, not caring that technically she wasn\rquote t his. He saw Severus Snape at his post, valiantly trying to steer her away from the bombed island prison, without a miz
zenmast, and with a mainsail that might as well have not been there for all the wind it held now. There were more than a few people bobbing in the cold water, crying out to be rescued, but the ship was being moved farther and farther away from them by the
 moment. Harry had a horrifying thought that they might have rescued some of the Aurors only to cause them to die by drowning, or by freezing in the North Sea. 
\par Harry took a chance and carefully set Cho Chang down on a rare clear piece of deck near Snape, then changed back to his human form so he could ask for help getting her separated from him. Maggie ran to help, and as soon as he was free, he didn\rquote 
t take time for talk but changed again, leaping into the air once more, circling overhead, looking for Ron and Dumbledore. He had to fly farther back to find them than he would have liked, but when he reached them, he found to his relief that they hadn
\rquote t lost hold of the dinghy, although the swells were huge yet and debris was still falling. 
\par He descended and la
nded on the dinghy itself, feeling it sink into the water a little when he did this. Wave after wave was hitting him, making his wings heavy with salt water. He wished he could talk, and hoped that Ron and Dumbledore would figure out what he wanted them t
o do. Ron managed to climb onto the upturned dinghy and dragged Dumbledore up with him, helping him onto Harry\rquote 
s back, then climbing on himself just as the dinghy sank beneath their combined weight; Harry shivered as his legs sank into the frigid sea, and d
id his best to move his waterlogged wings, trying to gain height and get away from the water. A huge wave was swelling again, sending the dinghy flying. It was smashed violently to pieces on a sharp rock thrusting up through the black water, and soon noth
ing but overlarge splinters were floating in the froth, the only remnants of the craft that had been Ron and Dumbledore\rquote s escape from Azkaban. 
\par At last, they were in sight of the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  again, which was quite some distance from Azkaban now, despite the damage she\rquote 
d suffered. The sea was still quite violent and the current had been altered by the force of the bomb and the fortress shivering itself to pieces; Harry judged that it was pushing them due south, away from the former prison. He set Ron and Dumbled
ore down on the deck, then collapsed and became human again, hoping he might find the strength to change into his griffin form again to try to rescue the other people who had fallen overboard. 
\par Hermione stumbled across the deck, still awkward; she fell on Ron, then Harry, hugging and kissing them both in relief, while Aberforth helped his brother to stand, his arm around his shoulders solicitously. Harry couldn\rquote 
t muster the strength to stand, so he stayed where he was, sitting on the deck, trying to get his breath. \'93Have to go,\'94 he panted. \'93They--went--overboard--\'94 
\par \'93No, Harry!\'94 Hermione cried above the noise of the crashing waves. \'93You rest! Sirius went on Buckbeak to try to get them. I think they\rquote re going to be all right. He\rquote s throwing lines to anyone whos
e head is above water and towing them back.\'94 Harry heaved a sigh of relief, feeling for once like the weight of the world wasn\rquote t on his shoulders. 
\par Cho Chang was sitting nearby, her eyes blank and staring again, and Harry crawled to her, trying to get her to respond in some way. \'93Cho! Cho! Please answer me!\'94
 he cried, taking her hands in his, feeling like an utter failure despite their having rescued so many people--even Aurors who\rquote d been kissed. He shook all over. He\rquote d always felt Cho was his failure; the fact that he\rquote 
d contributed to Cedric\rquote s death and then Viktor\rquote 
s (after doing his best to get her and Viktor to fall in love, no less) ate at him, and he wondered now whether it was his fault that she had become an Auror, which had led to her current state. \'93I didn\rquote t know you\rquote d become an Auror, Cho,
\'94 he said softly. \'93I--I can\rquote t picture you doing that. It just seems unlike you--\'94 
\par \'93That\rquote s because she\rquote s }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  an Auror,\'94
 said a harsh voice nearby. Harry looked up to see Percy and Katie standing there, arms around each other as though they were never going to be parted again. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 She}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  didn
\rquote t come with us, taking the Death Eaters to the prison. She came with }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 them}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 Percy said, sending an icy glare at Cho Chang. 
\par Harry gasped; she\rquote d been with the Death Eaters! He didn\rquote t know whether she\rquote d joined them before Viktor had died (perhaps she hadn\rquote t really been on their side in the fight in the Forbidden Forest?) or after. She still loo
ked at him with vacant eyes. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Well}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , he thought, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 being with the Death Eaters didn\rquote t protect her from the dementors}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . The other Death Eaters had evidently abandoned her when they realized that she was damaged enough that she would no longer be any good to Voldemort. 
\par He pulled her left arm toward him and pushed her sleeve up past her elbow. There, on the inside of her forearm, was the Dark Mark. He looked up at her empty eyes, feeling like this was all his fault. \'93I\rquote m sorry, Cho. So sorry--\'94 
\par Ron pulled him to his feet, giving her a look of contempt. \'93Don\rquote t waste your time with her, Harry. Snape needs you.\'94
 Harry looked at him, stricken. Could no one understand that he felt responsible for her? He looked down at her small huddled figure, rocking herself as she stared into the distance. 
\par As he walked unsteadily toward Snape, Harry heard a cry go up, and he turned momentarily, seeing Sirius land Buckbeak on the aft deck, while a dozen Aurors ran to the rail to help their comrades back up onto the ship. Harry grabbe
d a bulkhead to keep from falling, as the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 was still pitching quite violently. He had good sea-legs, but even he was having trouble staying upright in these choppy waters. Now that the rolling was so violent, Hermione was only able to walk by clutc
hing onto parts of the ship which did not move. (She discovered the hard way that a coil of rope isn\rquote t necessarily a good thing to hold onto if it isn\rquote t actually coiled around }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 something}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .) Ron was relativel steady on his feet, so she usually simply held onto Ron to keep from falling. 
\par Harry reported to Snape, who explained what he needed; Harry and Maggie were the youngest on the crew and would climb t
he masts to remove the sails, which had just been bent at the end of the previous summer, so they were almost new. Snape wanted them stowed below. \'93We can\rquote 
t afford for them to take any more damage. Repairing them, even with magic, is going to be quite the job. A wind is kicking up, and the swells are bad enough already. We don\rquote t need to be blown onto the shoals. The ship\rquote 
s too heavy with all of these people on it, she\rquote s already riding far lower than is safe. My uncle has repaired the hull and the fo\rquote csle an
d is manning the pump for any other water we might take on. Think I can have Weasley collect the sails after you throw them down?\'94 
\par \'93Yeah, he\rquote ll be fine,\'94 Harry told him. \'93And we should have Hermione, Sirius and Dumbledore transfigure the stunned Aurors. It won\rquote t matter to them if they\rquote re small animals. That will help with the weight,\'94 Harry said. \'93
Maggie and I will take care of the sails.\'94 He turned to Ron. \'93You catch them when we throw them down, and the Captain will tell you how to fold them up.\'94 
\par Maggie had been standing nearby and said, \'93Aye, Captain,\'94 to Snape, quite smartly, as though she wasn\rquote 
t in the habit of sitting on his lap in his office. Harry admired the way she scrambled up a mast like a young boy, and then turned to his own work. It came bac
k to him as though no time had passed at all, pulling himself up, minding the sway of the mast on which he perched. He watched the people on the deck continue to pull the rescued Aurors back onto the ship, while Snape yelled irritably at Sirius, \'93
Get them below before they go overboard again! And we need your help to lighten the load!\'94
 He called for Hermione and Sirius to do as Harry suggested, Transfiguring the stunned Aurors into small animals. As his cold fingers struggled with the ropes, Harry thought h
e heard Dumbledore offer to help with that as well. Snape, he suspected, had not felt comfortable about the idea of ordering the headmaster to do anything. 
\par Then, as Harry threw the topsail down to Ron, something made him look up. His eyes were drawn to th
e north, where Azkaban was a smallish lump on the horizon now. Suddenly, what was left of the fortress was blown high into the air, the island breaking up into a multitude of fragments, still crackling with red and green light, and when the air had cleare
d, a green shape as huge as the former fortress itself was hovering in the air over where it had been, and Harry could see very clearly the shape of it: an enormous skull, with a long snake instead of a tongue protruding from the mouth. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 The Dark Mark.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Harry swallowed, shivering as he thought of the bodies of the dead Aurors that would never be retrieved, and thinking also of the fact that if they\rquote 
d taken even a little while longer to get there, they would have found that gruesome mark in the sky over the former location of the prison and nothing else--no Aurors, living, dead or kissed. Nothing and no one. 
\par Azkaban was no more. 
\par But even as he continued to watch the fragments of rock rain down into the sea, Harry realized suddenly what would follow that last great cataclysm which had utterly shattered the fortress. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Batten down the hatches!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 he cried to Snape. \'93We\rquote re going to have to ride out another big one!\'94 
\par He saw now that Snape had been watching the final blow to Azkaban as well, through his Omnioculars
. He slowly lowered the instrument from his face, looking grim, and ordered everyone belowdecks with far more urgency than before; Sirius and Duncan had already been sending people below. Ron was still on deck because he was stowing the sails Harry and Ma
g
gie were throwing down, but when he was done he dashed for the hatch, looking up at Harry for a moment and nodding; he was the last one belowdecks. There wasn't time for Harry and Maggie to get down from their perches. Snape quickly took out his wand and 
p
roduced ropes with it to lash himself to the tiller. The cold salt spray had completely soaked him now, and his hair clung wetly to his head, making his hawkish nose appear even more prominent. He put his wand away and stood at his post with his feet brac
ed, trying to keep their suddenly fragile-seeming craft on a steady course as far as that was possible. Harry took out his wand briefly too, also conjuring cords to bind him to the mast, and he saw Maggie do the same. 
\par He looked up and saw the enormous wave bearing down on them, larger than any they\rquote d yet seen from the previous explosions. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Ginny,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought. }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I love you. Never forget that.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  It seemed so unfair that, after everything he\rquote d been through, he might die at sea, especially after all of the careful training he\rquote 
d received when he was young, in his other life. He had also, however, been told repeatedly that the sea didn\rquote t play favorites, nor only kill inexperienced sailors. When a ship went down, both old salts and those who didn\rquote 
t yet have their sea legs died. 
\par But the Firth of Clyde had never been like this, and now he thought of the poor Muggle fishermen in their trawlers, who might also find their final resting places in the watery deep because of the destruction of Azkaban. The thought made him choke
 with anger and grief, tears running down his cold face. Despite the magical cords already binding him to the mast, he wrapped his arms around it, silently telling the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 how much he loved her and had missed her, tears running down his face. The wave kept coming and coming. Harry\rquote s stomach turned over as he anticipated the impact, and yet still he didn\rquote 
t expect it when it came. It took his breath away, the strength of it, the effect of that monstrous force on a mere piece of timber. Creaking in protest, the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 tilted up and up until she was almost standing on her beams; when Harry looked up, there was the bow, moving inexorably forward, it seemed. He swallowed, clinging tightly to the almost-horizontal mast, both hoping the bindings held and wond
ering if it was the best idea now to be lashed to the mast, as he waited for the deck to tilt more, to be over his head, waited to be plunged into the merciless sea, tied to a mast pointing down into the churning water. 
\par But just when it seemed that the deck was pointing straight up to the heavens, it began to go down again; the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 rode on the crest of the wave, up and over, and when she smashed down on the far side, with a report like a thousand simultaneous gunshots, Harry felt the entire ship shudder with the impact as though she might break into a million pieces. 
\par He swallowed, then heaved a sigh of relief, but it was too soon; another wave almost as large as the first lifted up the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , but this time she didn\rquote 
t point quite straight up before 
riding up and over the wave. The impact when she landed on the far side of that watery hill felt no less earth-shattering (or ship-shattering) than the previous one, however, and Harry started to wonder whether after a few more waves like that }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  would be smashing herself to bits. 
\par Wave after wave came, more like the second than the first, but every time, Harry was certain she was going to split her hull in two. At last, he noticed that when a wave picked her up, she was listing a little less, and eve
n landing less violently afterward. They\rquote d ridden out the worst of the waves caused by the bomb. It wasn\rquote t smooth sailing yet, but it probably would be soon. 
\par Harry wasn\rquote t certain how long he\rquote d been perched on the mast; he untied himself now with shaking, numb fingers; the ropes he\rquote 
d conjured had rubbed him raw, even through his clothes, and when he reached the deck, he lifted up his jersey and found that he had a deep red welt around his middle. 
\par But there was no time for that now. They unbattened the hatc
hes and people started pouring onto the deck again; Hermione and Ron were among the first on deck; they launched themselves at Harry and threw their arms around him. Everything was happening very quickly, but Harry could have sworn that }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 both}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  of them kissed him on the cheeks, and Hermione was weeping. 
\par Finally, he gasped, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I can\rquote t breathe}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 from under their crushing embrace; he didn\rquote 
t want to tell them that they were touching the huge welt under his jersey and making it far more painful than it would have been otherwise. They both backed up from him; Hermione was laughing slightly hysterically. 
\par \'93I--we thought--kept going up--\'94 she sputtered, looking green, then ran for the rail and spewed up whatever was left in her stomach. Harry and Ron followed her, both 
rubbing her back sympathetically until she was just clutching at the rail, trying to get her breath. She turned around, leaning gratefully on them both, Ron\rquote s arm around her. She was a rather ghastly shade of yellow now. 
\par They looked up to see Maggie final
ly jumping down from her mast, after having extricated herself. She had a desperate look, pushing her way through the throng that was trying to spill onto the deck now, many of the Aurors running to do what Hermione had just done, the collective sound of 
retching threatening to make Harry follow suit; he tried to put it out of his mind. 
\par They saw that Maggie had finally reached her goal, throwing her arms around Severus Snape and kissing his face all over. Harry expected Snape to be deeply embarrassed, as w
hen he and Ginny had surprised the two of them in his office, but instead, he looked as desperate as Maggie, his arms tight around her. He did not hesitate for a moment, clearly not caring who might be watching, holding her face up to his and claiming her
 mouth. Harry felt a smile creep across his face, but then he thought of Ron, and turned to see whether he was going to have a fit. To say that Snape seemed to be glad that she was all right would have been putting it lightly. 
\par To Harry\rquote s surprise, Ron was simply gawping at them, his mouth open. He seemed to feel Harry\rquote s eyes on him, though, because he turned and met his best friend\rquote s gaze, snapping his mouth shut and looking a bit sheepish. 
\par \'93Is--is that how it looked to you when you saw him kissing your mum?\'94 Ron said, his voice so soft it was a strain for Harry to hear him above the pounding of the waves and the commotion on the deck from the other people. Harry wasn\rquote 
t used to the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  being so crowded. 
\par \'93Erm, well--\'94 
\par Hermione laughed, starting to get some pink into her cheeks again. \'93He wouldn\rquote t know. He refused to look when we were in Snape\rquote s Pensieve. I thought }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 he}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 was going to spew.\'94 
\par Harry stuck his tongue out at her. \'93I saw my mum and dad kissing plenty in my other life. Well,\'94 he amended, remembering the rift between them that had been filled by Sirius; \'93when I was younger....\'94 
\par When Harry saw that Snape and Maggie had ended their kiss, he strode over to them and stood, grinning. 
\par \'93You brought us through, Captain,\'94 he said with a nod. 
\par Snape had never seemed more like his dad as he said, \'93Don\rquote t be a prat, Harry.\'94 To his surprise, Snape pulled him into a quick embrace before backing up again. Harry looked at him in amazement. 
\par Then Maggie turned to him, practically jumping up and down with glee. \'93We did it!\'94
 she crowed, also hugging him. After being released, he backed up from her, wincing; they were holding hands now as Snape kept his other hand on the tiller, continuing to keep the course steady, in spite of the rough waves still pushing them sou
th from the former wizarding prison. Cold spray blew over the rail and Harry shivered, pulling his jacket around himself protectively, wincing again as a twinge of pain went through him. 
\par "Everything all right, Harry?" Snape asked, frowning. He nodded at Harry\rquote s middle. \'93Show me.\'94 
\par Harry reluctantly opened the jacked and lifted his jersey, feeling the fabric stick momentarily to a couple of places where there was blood on the surface. He winced again. 
\par \'93Oh my god, Harry!\'94 Maggie said in horror. 
\par He dropped his jersey again. \'93I\rquote ll be fine,\'94 he said through gritted teeth. He looked up at the bare masts. \'93Right now I\rquote d say we could use some sails.\'94
 He looked at Snape, who nodded at him. Ron and Hermione helped them take out the stowed sails again and soon Harry and Maggie were scrambling up and down the masts. When the wind filled the repaired mainsail and the }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  could sail under her own power again, instead of being buffeted about by the sea, Harry felt like the world had almost been set to rights. His mi
ddle hurting a bit less now, he leaned on the rail, watching the wake of the ship disappear into the frothy waves. Suddenly, Ron and Hermione appeared at his side. 
\par "We want to talk to you, Harry," Ron whispered urgently. "When you were flying off to find Azkaban--" 
\par "--we were thinking about Maggie's new prophecy," finished Hermione. "And now that we've been there, it seems pretty clear what it all meant." 
\par "Right," Ron agreed as Harry turned to look at them, waiting to hear what they had to say. 
\par "Well?" he prompted them. 
\par Hermione withdrew from her pocket the parchment on which Snape had caused the words of the prophecy to appear. "Well, starting at the top--that's all pretty clear. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Seekers of the Warriors of Light / Be warned, for sorrow lies ahead...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 " 
\par "Yeah," Harry agreed. "Hard to argue with that." 
\par She continued, "}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Some are bound by walls of might, / Others dwell now with the dead.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 " 
\par "Right," Ron said. "Percy and Katie and others were locked up, and others were killed." 
\par Hermione hesitated, then read with a catch in her voice, "}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Present in body, not in mind, / Insensate voids still others be...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 " 
\par Harry nodded grimly. "The ones who were kissed." The other two also nodded, silently agreeing. 
\par "But this was where we were baffled before going: }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 A new world's vanguard shall you find / Within the fortress on the sea.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 I thought it meant that we were letting you fly right into danger!" she said, her voice squeaking. "I thought--Voldemort's vanguard! That can't be good!" 
\par "And then you came back," Ron added, "saying that they seemed to be gone...so that clearly wasn't it." 
\par Harry turned back to the sea, thinking, watching the hypnotic patterns of the waves. "Read the rest," he said quietly, almost in a trance. 
\par "}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 The Hopeless Ones shall walk the earth / And Happiness this world shall flee / Until the Lion finds their berth / When Night and Day must needs agree.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 " 
\par Harry stared at the waves some more, finally saying, "The Hopeless Ones are the Dementors. That's why Happiness will flee, because they'll be wandering aroun
d, kissing people... And the vanguard..." A thought suddenly popped into his mind. He turned and faced the two of them. "The kissed Aurors are the vanguard," he said, suddenly sure of this. 
\par "What?" Ron said, frowning. 
\par But Hermione could also see what Harry meant now. "Oh! They're the vanguard because they're--they're what's coming. More people kissed by dementors. And--and--" she seemed at a loss for how to continue the thought. 
\par "--and people in that state might as well be working for Voldemort," Ron finished in a whisper. "They're certainly useless for fighting him. And like you said--they won't be the last." 
\par "What are you three up to?" Sirius said suddenly, making them all jump. He and Percy and Katie strode over to them. 
\par Harry, Ron and Hermione looke
d at each other grimly; bringing up the subject of people kissed by dementors didn't seem like such a good idea with Sirius, who'd been in Azkaban for a dozen years, and Percy and Katie, who might have been kissed instead of getting locked up. 
\par "Erm--" Ron started to say, glancing at Harry, waiting for a signal. 
\par Then Harry noticed how grim Sirius looked. Harr glanced back and forth at his face, Percy's and Katies, frowning. \'93What?\'94 
\par Katie said slowly, \'93It was Lucius Malfoy who locked us in that cell. And he--he said some things--\'94 
\par Harry willed his heart to go on beating. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 What?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 he breathed. 
\par Percy drew his mouth into a line. \'93He took the time to torture me a bit first, for taking his fortune from him--\'94 
\par Katie put her arms around his waist and looked up at him. \'93He said horrid, horrid things--\'94 
\par The others waited, and suddenly, it came from Percy in a rush. \'93He said that I obviously wasn\rquote t missing Penelope much.\'94 He nodded at Katie. \'93And he said that he wo
uld soon be back where he belonged. He said that he was going to make his son\rquote s girlfriend do things for him, to teach him a lesson about betraying his father, and that if Draco behaves himself, he\rquote 
ll forgive him and see to it that his son receives a reward when this is all over. He said--\'94 Percy choked for a moment. He went on in a whisper. \'93He said that my little sister would be writhing on the ground under his son--\'94 
\par Percy closed his eyes and shuddered. When he opened them, he was looking at Harry. \'93Where is she, Harry? Is she all right?\'94 
\par Harry had difficulty speaking. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Lucius Malfoy was free and out to get the Weasleys.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  \'93He\rquote s not going to make Ginny do anything, Percy,\'94 he said, shaking. \'93
For one thing, she\rquote s not his son\rquote s girlfriend anymore. She\rquote s my girlfriend now. Ginny\rquote s fine. She\rquote s at Hog\rquote s End. Angelina is having the babies. Well, actually, she\rquote 
s already had the girl, Rowena. Madam Pomfrey is there, helping. She\rquote s probably had the boy now, as well. We had to take Ginny with us before using the Portkey to go to Fraserburgh. Malfoy was wondering why Ginny wasn\rquote 
t going with us, as we said that we were going to Hog\rquote s End because of the babies being born....\'94 
\par Percy gripped his arm. \'93Draco Malfoy knows she\rquote s there? He can tell his dad!\'94 Harry swallowed. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Oh god, he\rquote s right...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par \'93I\rquote ll go,\'94 Sirius said suddenly. \'93I\rquote m not as knackered as the Aurors or the rest of you, I\rquote m not a student, and I\rquote m not needed to sail the ship. If Lucius Malfoy tries to attack Hog\rquote s End, he\rquote 
ll have me to deal with.\'94 His voice was very hard. Sirius put his hand on Harry\rquote s shoulder; Harry looked up at him. 
\par \'93Take care of them,\'94 he whispered, missing Ginny dreadfully and now worried that she might yet again be targeted by Lucius Malfoy, as she was in her first year of school. Sirius nodded and took out his wand. 
\par \'93Tell the headmaster where I\rquote ve gone. When I get there, I\rquote ll also summon the operatives we had standing by for additional help. It\rquote s not the reason we told them we might need help, but that doesn\rquote t matter. No one\rquote 
s going to attack Hog\rquote s End on my watch.\'94 
\par He disappeared in the blink of an eye, and Sam came striding across the deck, frowning. \'93What\rquote s going on? Where\rquote s he off to?\'94 
\par They all looked at each other nervously. Harry didn\rquote t like the idea of lying. He nodded at Percy. \'93Tell him. I\rquote ll go speak to Dumbledore.\'94 
\par When Harry returned to them, he wasn\rquote t clear whether Sam\rquote s original question had been answered. Instead, it seemed that they were telling Sam that Katie and Percy were now engaged. Harry forced a smile; it was good n
ews. Was it so wrong for them to want to focus on something good? 
\par \'93--and then he went down on one knee--\'94 Katie was telling Sam, looking up at Percy with a glowing face, holding her fianc\'e9\rquote s hand and looking positively delirious. 
\par Sam looked flabbergasted. \'93Well, I\rquote ll be--\'94
 He was rendered speechless, and Aberforth came over to them to find out what was happening. When Katie and Percy told them, Aberforth cried out happily and hugged Katie firmly. Then he backed up from her, holding her by the shoulders, grinning. 
\par \'93I can\rquote t believe our little Katie is engaged!\'94 he said happily. 
\par \'93Oh, Uncle Dick--\'94 Katie said, coloring. \'93I\rquote m not a little girl anymore.\'94 
\par Harry frowned, then realized that of course Katie had been accustomed to calling him Uncle Dick. He\rquote d been her father\rquote s closest friend from the time he\rquote 
d been released from Azkaban. When Aberforth had released Katie, Percy put his arm around her protectively again. 
\par \'93I just wish we didn\rquote t have to wait to get married,\'94 Percy said quietly, looking at Katie as though no one else in the world existed. Behind Percy\rquote 
s head, the western sky was filled with orange ribbons, and Harry was shocked to realize that the sun was going down. They\rquote d embarked on their voyage before sunrise. The days wouldn\rquote t be longer than the n
ights for another five weeks, but it still surprised him. The }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 was moving with a gentle swaying motion now, and Harry turned to see Severus Snape at her helm, looking as at peace as he had in his other life when he was sailing. Maggie was at his side, beaming up at him. Suddenly, a }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 brilliant}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  thought occurred to him. 
\par \'93If you like--you }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 don\rquote t}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  have to wait,\'94 he said to Percy. 
\par Percy frowned, as he always did when he didn\rquote t think someone was making sense according to his strict definition. \'93What are you talking about?\'94 
\par \'93You don\rquote t have to wait. Snape could marry you. He\rquote s the captain of the ship. We\rquote re at sea. If he agrees, we could have the ceremony right now, as the sun\rquote s going down.\'94 
\par Now it was Percy\rquote s turn to look flabbergasted. \'93I--I never thought of that. But--but don\rquote t you want a big wedding?\'94 he said, to Katie. \'93A gown, party after, all that? Your dad to give you away--\'94 
\par Katie put her arms around him. \'93My dad is already here. As for a big wedding, a gown and a party, I never wanted any of that. In fact, I thought when we did get married we\rquote 
d just go to a registry office with our closest friends and some family, then have a nice dinner at Hog\rquote s End after. Instead of the registry office, we can have the ceremony here, and we can still have a nice dinner at your house after. I don
\rquote t care about the rest of it. I just care about you,\'94 she said quietly, gazing up at him. 
\par Percy grinned down at her, then glanced uncertainly at Sam. \'93How--how do you feel about this, sir?\'94 
\par Sam looked appalled. \'93I think that if you call me sir one more time I shall have to see whether they have taught you how to defend yourself from gardeners during that Auror training of yours,\'94 he said, abruptly breaking into a grin. \'93
I told you the first time we had dinner together, I\rquote m just Sam. And--and I think the idea is just brilliant.\'94 he said, smiling lovingly at his daughter. \'93I was half afraid--well, more than half-afraid--that I wouldn\rquote 
t be coming home with a daughter, and find instead that I may be gaining a son.\'94 
\par Percy pulled Katie to him in a kiss after that, and when they separated, they were both grinning like mad. \'93So, then, are we actually doing this?\'94 Percy asked, incredulous. 
\par \'93Doing what?\'94 Maggie asked, suddenly appearing at her brother\rquote s side. 
\par \'93I can\rquote t believe we\rquote re doing this,\'94 Katie said, shaking her head in wonder. \'93But I\rquote m so glad,\'94 she added, looking happily at Percy. 
\par \'93And we\rquote ll have that dinner at Hog\rquote s End tonight!\'94 Percy said with determination. He looked at Harry defiantly, as though Harry had suggested that this wouldn\rquote t be possible. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Keep them safe, Sirius,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry prayed. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 We\rquote ll be there later, with a wonderful surprise....}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 This was a good thing, he felt. It was something happy to distract them for a little while, before returning to their real lives and havin
g to face the fact of those who hadn't made it because their bodies were at the bottom of the sea now, or because they'd been kissed. 
\par \'93Doing what?\'94 Maggie asked again. "Having dinner at Hog's End? That sounds lovely." Percy and Katie turned to her, grinning. 
\par \'93We\rquote re getting married,\'94 Katie told her. Maggie gasped and hugged each of them, laughing. 
\par "When?" she wanted to know. 
\par "Now!" Percy said, shocking his older sister. Her jaw dropped open. 
\par \'93Oh!\'94 Hermione said suddenly. \'93It\rquote s perfect! You know what today is, don\rquote t you?\'94 
\par Maggie had let Percy and Katie go; they frowned now. \'93No,\'94 Katie said. \'93We lost track of time while we were in there. Friday? Is that good, getting married on a Friday?\'94 
\par \'93No, that\rquote s not what I meant!\'94 she said, rolling her eyes and laughing. \'93It\rquote s Valentine\rquote s Day!\'94 
\par Percy and Katie grinned at each other. \'93You\rquote re right, Hermione,\'94 Percy said, looking down at his bride. \'93It\rquote s perfect.\'94 
\par Ron laughed. \'93Charlie won\rquote t like it.\'94 His older brother looked at him blankly. Now it was Ron\rquote s turn to roll his eyes. \'93Bloody hell, am I the only one in the family who remembers when birthdays are? Today is Charlie\rquote 
s thirty-second birthday. And from now on, Charlie\rquote s birthday will also be your anniversary.\'94 
\par Percy flushed. \'93Sorry, Ron. I\rquote ve always been very bad at that. But there }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 are}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  other people in the family who remember birthdays; the twins }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 always}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  remember Ginny\rquote s...\'94 
\par Maggie gave Ron a mystified look. \'93Ginny\rquote s birthday is April Fool\rquote s Day,\'94 Ron told her. \'93The twins don\rquote t remember her birthday as }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 such}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
; it happens to be on the same day they think should be a national holiday....\'94 
\par His older sister smiled at him. \'93So there will be two special things our family will celebrate on this day in future. A birthday--and an anniversary,\'94 she said, looking lovingly at Percy and Katie. Her gaze settled on Katie and she laughed. \'93
And I\rquote m getting another sister!\'94 she crowed, gathering Katie into her arms for another hug. 
\par When she released her brother\rquote s bride, Katie looked a little frightened. \'93And I\rquote m getting quite a lot of brothers and sisters,\'94 she said softly. \'93I hope no one expects }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to memorize birthdays for quite a while, though,\'94 she added, looking slyly at Ron. 
\par \'93No one will expect you to,\'94 Ron reassured her. Then he looked like he remembered something. \'93Wait! There will actually be }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 three}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 Weasley birthdays and an anniversary today. We forgot about George and Angelina\rquote s kids!\'94 He smiled at Percy and Katie, shaking his head. \'93I can\rquote t believe the pair of you are getting married...\'94 
\par \'93We just need to ask the captain,\'94 Harry said, nodding in Snape\rquote s direction. \'93Come on, I\rquote ll go with you.\'94 He pulled Katie by the hand, and Percy brought up the rear. The three of t
hem wove around the others who had come back on deck, finally reaching Severus Snape at the tiller; he was now speaking to his uncle about the damage to the ship. 
\par \'93Captain?\'94 Harry said uncertainly. Snape turned away from his uncle. 
\par \'93Excuse me a moment,\'94 he said to Duncan MacDermid, before turning to Harry. \'93Yes, Mr. Potter?\'94 Something in his eyes told Harry that he was back to regarding him as a fellow sailor now. Harry didn\rquote t mind being \lquote Mr. Potter\rquote 
 again instead of \lquote Harry;\rquote  in his other life, when he\rquote d been on board with his dad, he\rquote d always been called \lquote Mr. Potter,\rquote  and he\rquote d called Jamie \lquote Miss Potter\rquote  at those times as well. 
\par He didn\rquote t see the expression in Snape\rquote s eyes change when he explained what they were after. He glanced over Percy and Katie\rquote s faces, seeing the hope and anticipation there, and said, \'93
Certainly. I will have my uncle take over for me here. Clear some space on the foredeck. I shall be there in a minute.\'94 
\par Harry started leaving with the thrilled Percy and Katie, but Snape\rquote s hand on his arm detained him. \'93Harry,\'94 he hissed between his teeth. \'93I\rquote ve never done this before.\'94 
\par \'93You can do it. You\rquote re the captain--\'94 
\par \'93I know that I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 can}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  do it. I never }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 have}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  done it,\'94
 he said, his jaw clenched. Harry realized that he was nervous. He tried not to grin and tease him about this. 
\par \'93You\rquote ll be fine. You\rquote ve been to weddings before,\'94 he added, consciously avoiding mentioning that the last one was Alicia and Roger\rquote s. This one promised to be very different. 
\par Snape looked at him doubtfully, the uncertainty i
n his eyes still. He disappeared belowdecks briefly, to get ready, and Harry went to Percy and Katie, who were standing with Sam, Ron, Hermione, Maggie, Aberforth and some other Aurors now, who were hugging and kissing them in congratulations. 
\par \'93Save that for after the ceremony,\'94 Harry said, grinning. \'93The captain will be ready in a minute.\'94
 Aberforth took out his wand and moved it delicately, pointing it toward the sails; fairy lights appeared to be clinging to the sailcloth now, glittering in the dusk, se
nding a glow over all of them. With another wave of his wand, the frigid air surrounding them gradually grew warmer, until it felt more like it was the middle of May, rather than the middle of February. 
\par Suddenly, Ron pulled Harry aside. He looked uncomfortable and nervous. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 You\rquote d think he was the one getting married,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry thought. \'93Everything okay, Ron?\'94 
\par Ron grimaced and looked over his shoulder to where Percy was standing with Katie. \'93I just thought of something, Harry.\'94 
\par \'93What?\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Mum}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 
\par \'93I promise, I won\rquote t say anything.\'94 He paused. \'93But--what am I keeping mum about?\'94 
\par \'93I didn\rquote t say \lquote keep mum,\rquote  I said \lquote Mum.\rquote  As in }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 our}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  mum. Mine and Percy\rquote s and Maggie\rquote s. }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 That}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  mum.\'94 
\par \'93Oh,\'94 Harry said simply, having nothing else he could say. Then suddenly, it dawned on him what Ron meant. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Oooooh}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94
 he said now, understanding why Ron looked a bit sick. Molly Weasley would be furious when she learned that Percy had married without her being present. Harry\rquote s mouth twisted as he regarded Percy and Katie. \'93Bit hard to stop things now, don
\rquote t you think?\'94 
\par Ron raised his eyebrows. \'93Oh, I have no intention of stopping them. As far as I\rquote m concerned, they have every right to do this.\'94 He looked at Percy again and took a deep breath. \'93
I just hope he realizes that it may mean another row with Mum when he gets back.\'94 
\par Harry shook his head. \'93No, you didn\rquote t see her when we called the Burrow from Snape\rquote s office. She\rquote ll be thrilled just to see him alive.\'94 
\par Ron looked shrewdly at him. \'93You haven\rquote t spent all that much time around my mum, remember. Even after it seems she\rquote s over it, she won\rquote t let this go for years to come. Trust me.\'94 He watched Percy and Katie kiss. \'93But I won
\rquote t say a word beforehand. He\rquote ll put a stop to it if he remembers. It\rquote s better this way. Don\rquote t mention anything to him.\'94 
\par \'93Right. Mum about the mum.\'94 He and Ron laughed conspiratorially for a moment. Harry agreed with Ron. Fear of what Mrs. Weasley would say shouldn\rquote t stop the wedding. 
\par \'93Places!\'94 Hermione called, clapping her
 hands imperiously. Harry grinned at Ron, who backed up to get out of her way; Harry had seen that Ron had become rather good at recognizing the right time to give Hermione a wide berth. This was definitely one of those times. 
\par Dumbledore stepped forward and held out something to Hermione which made her drop her jaw. \'93I believe we could use some music, Miss Granger, and I understand that you know what to do with one of these.\'94
 He was handing her a beautiful cello, the varnished golden-brown wood gleaming in the setting sun. Her mouth was open in a slightly unflattering pose. Glancing up at the headmaster, she snapped it shut again. 
\par \'93How--but why wasn\rquote t it smashed to bits--?\'94 
\par He smiled warmly at her, his eyes twinkling. \'93I just transfigured a chair that was in the hold. It may need to be tuned,\'94 he acknowledged, as though this made it an imperfect Transfiguration. 
\par She took it from him, along with the bow, gazing down at it wonderingly. \'93But--but a Transfiguration like this is very, very complicated. Most people could get something that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 looks}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  like a cello, but for it to really }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 work}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 --\'94
 She stopped and swallowed, as though remembering to whom she was speaking. Instead, she stroked the bow across the strings briefly, and a deep, mellow beauty emanated from it that made her catch her breath. \'93Oh!\'94
 she said, and Harry knew that her inability to say more was in its way a more telling sign of her pleasure than if she had been able to go on at length about it. 
\par Harry thought Dumbledore looked rather pleased with himself. \'93After all,\'94 he said, \'93what would a wedding be without music?\'94 he said softly, looking at her over his spectacles. She grinned at him, and Harry wondered whether she\rquote 
d want to go back to using her old cello after this. 
\par He realized that this would only be the second wedding he\rquote d ever been to in this life, Alicia\rquote s being the first. In his other life, there had been his mother and stepfather\rquote 
s wedding, as well as various weddings for family friends. (He\rquote d never been taken to weddings of the Dursleys\rquote  family and friends, but was usually packed off to Mrs. Figg\rquote 
s on the rare occasion that someone wanted one of the Dursleys to witness their nuptials.) 
\par As the sun sank lower, the orange and apricot streamers in the sky turning to deep red and gold, Hermione began to play the cello. Maggie, the maid-of-honor, walked down an improvised aisle between the \lquote guests\rquote 
--Aurors and their rescuers--with a bouquet of tiger lilies that Harry had seen Aberforth conjuring. Next came a beaming Sam with his daughter on his arm. The tattered robes she\rquote d been wearing in the prison cell hadn\rquote 
t been Transfigured at all, merely cleaned with a spell. Katie carried herself with a dignity that couldn\rquote t have been surpassed had she been wearing a gown made for a princess. She also held a 
bouquet of tiger lilies; they picked up the colors of the dusky sky, as well as the Weasley hair. Sam smiled lovingly at his daughter when they reached Percy, leaning over to kiss her on the cheek. Percy was also in his old dusty robes, which made him app
ear absurdly dashing. Ron was by his side as his best man. 
\par Snape wore an immaculate navy blazer with white flannels, making Harry wonder whether Dumbledore had been running around the ship Transfiguring everything in sight (everything except Percy and Katie\rquote s robes). When Hermione finished the piece she
\rquote d been playing, there was polite applause and Aberforth handed her another tiger lily bouquet; Harry escorted her down the aisle to stand next to Maggie as another bridesmaid, while he took his place as a groomsman, next to Ron. 
\par The fairy lights twinkled above the crowd as they stood silently, respectfully, waiting for Snape to begin. He looked impassively at Katie and Percy, then gazed around at them all, finally beginning to speak: 
\par \'93Since time immemorial, it has been the happy privilege of the captain of a ship to join two people in marriage,\'94 he intoned. The corners of his mouth turned up ever so slightly as he looked at Katie and Percy. \'93
But I doubt any other captain has ever had the privilege of bringing two people out of a prison where they might have perished and launching them forward into a new life within the same twenty-four hour period.\'94 
\par \'93You just got out of prison, mate! Why sign on for more \lquote ard time already?\'94 shouted a voice from the crowd of 
Aurors, causing a ripple of laughter to roll through their audience. Percy and Katie joined in the laughter as they stood before Snape, holding hands. 
\par \'93It\rquote s only a prison if you aren\rquote t volunteering for it!\'94 Percy called back, never taking his eyes from his bride and looking happier than Harry had ever seen him. 
\par When the laughter had died down again, Percy turned to Snape. \'93I know this is spur of the moment, sir, so we\rquote ll just do our own vows, I think.\'94 
\par Harry thought Snape looked very relieved. \'93Thank you,\'94 he said with feeling. 
\par Katie handed her flowers to Maggie and the two of them faced each other, holding hands. Percy smiled at Snape for a moment before looking at his bride again. \'93Do you want me to go first?\'94 he whispered to her. 
\par She shook her head. \'93No,\'94 she whispered back. \'93I have no idea what I\rquote m going to say, but I think I should do it before I\rquote m crying too hard to speak,\'94
 she said, laughing nervously. Tears were already wetting her cheeks, but Harry could tell they were happy tears. Percy nodded and grasped her hands a little more tightly. 
\par \'93The first time I ever saw you,\'94 she said, her voice lifted now, carrying across the stillness of the crowd, \'93was when I was a first year and you were a fourth year, helping your brothers onto the train with th
eir trunks. All that year--and in the many years since--I saw them play prank after prank on you, making you the butt of every joke they could come up with. And yet, when all was said and done, you still behaved toward them as you did on that first day I 
saw you. You\rquote re their big brother, helping them and guiding them and holding no grudges. No matter what they\rquote ve done to you--and they\rquote ve done quite a lot,\'94 she added, causing a ripple of laughter to move through the crowd again; 
\'93--you never tried to get revenge,\'94 she finished softly. Katie started crying a little harder and wiped away her tears with the back of one hand, murmuring, \'93God, I didn\rquote t know it would be so hard not to cry...\'94
 Hermione discreetly passed her a handkerchief, which she accepted gratefully. 
\par When she had returned the handkerchief to Hermione, she steeled herself, looking up at him again, taking hold of both of his hands once more. \'93That\rquote s just who you are, Percy Weasley. You don\rquote 
t hold grudges. You look out for others whether or not they want you to, and whether or not there\rquote s anything in it for you.\'94 She swallowed and smiled at him. \'93
I take you to be my husband, Percy Weasley, because I love you with all my heart and with all my soul, and because you are my inspiration and my guide, and I can think of nothing I would rather do than share my life with you and love you all my days.\'94 

\par Harry thought Percy looked very much like he might want to kiss Katie before it was time; he gazed at her with a look that burned, and Katie returned the look, shaking a little. \'93I\rquote m done,\'94 she whispered to Percy. \'93It\rquote 
s your turn now.\'94 
\par Percy laughed out loud and continued to gaze at her. \'93A couple of years ago, I never thought I\rquote d laugh again,\'94 he said. He looked very sober now, and Harry remembered the fate o
f poor Penelope, and Lucius Malfoy saying that it looked like Percy hadn\rquote t been thinking about her. Harry knew that it had been quite hard for Percy to get over Penelope. 
\par \'93We have been living through terrible times and terrible deeds,\'94 he said, his voice quiet, yet still carrying across the deck, his words making Harry think again of Lucius Malfoy. \'93
We have all lost loved ones, people whose friendships we treasure, people who were signposts on our way.\'94 Harry wasn\rquote t certain, but he thought that might be Percy\rquote s way of mentioning his first love. He tightened his grip on Katie\rquote 
s hands. \'93I have been fortunate enough to find another person whom I love, someone whose friendship I treasure dearly, and someone who is not only a signpost on my way, but--\'94 He looked
 up, squinting, at a loss for words; as he scanned the horizon over Katie\rquote 
s shoulder, where the setting sun was disappearing behind a lighthouse on the shore that was already beaming its silent warning to all ships at sea. He grinned and looked into Katie\rquote s eyes again. 
\par \'93I\rquote ve felt so lost for much of the last four years. Now I shall never be lost again. It doesn\rquote 
t matter that we are marrying on a ship, with no fixed point, no permanent location. You are my true north, my way and my destination, all in one. And now you will be my wife. You found me; you found me, and your love is the beacon shining me home.\'94 

\par Hermione covered her mouth with her hand, giving a little gasp and starting to cry. Ron smile at her affectionately, while Maggie was gazing at Percy, looking frightfully proud of him. Harry thought Katie would utterly dissolve into tears any moment. He w
ished Ginny were there, in his arms. He knew she'd also cry, and then he could dry her tears.... 
\par \'93I believe,\'94 said a slightly amused voice, \'93that it is time for the rings?\'94 Dumbledore had stepped forward, holding out two dark grey metal rings that appeared
 to have been transfigured from links of the anchor chain. Percy and Katie looked at him gratefully; he\rquote d thought of everything. 
\par When he withdrew again, each of them took a turn putting the ring on the other person\rquote s hand, murmuring, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 With this ring, I thee wed....with this ring, I thee wed....}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
\'94 
\par Maggie returned Katie's bouquet to her. Percy and Katie gave each other enormous grins and turned to Snape, holding hands. Harry was gratified to see that he was smiling back at them both, looking wonderfully like the man he\rquote d called \lquote Dad
\rquote  for so many years. 
\par He lifted his strong voice again, saying, \'93By the power invested in me by international maritime law, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may--\'94 Katie slid her arms up around his neck
 and Percy gathered her to him, pressing his mouth to hers, one hand holding her face up to his. \'93--kiss the bride,\'94 Snape trailed off, watching them. 
\par Harry saw Maggie catch Snape\rquote s eye and smile. A cheer went up from the crowd, and when Percy and Katie s
eparated their mouths, Katie threw her bouquet into the air, laughing. It seemed to hang there, suspended for an eternity, before it plunged down directly into Maggie\rquote 
s hands, so that now she had two bouquets. She laughed, looking at Snape, and Harry saw t
hat their eyes were still locked as the crowd of Aurors descended upon Percy and Katie, thumping him on the back and kissing the laughing, happy bride. The lighthouse behaved as their own personal spotlight, adding to the illumination that the fairy light
s already lent to the impromptu festivities, while the stars wheeled overhead and the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  sailed south toward Dover.

\par Dumbledore conjured champagne for the celebration of Percy and Katie\rquote s wedding, but Harry had something else on his mind. After kissing the bride and shaking Percy\rquote 
s hand, he left the celebrating throng on the deck and went down the companionway into the hold, lighting his wand so that he could see in the dimness. When 
he found a lantern hanging on a beam, he lit it and was able to extinguish his wand. He gazed around the dank-smelling space, which was oddly quiet save for the slapping of the water on the hull. 
\par In addition to transfiguring the Kissed Aurors into small a
nimals--chiefly hamsters--Dumbledore, Hermione and Sirius had conjured small cages in which they would be safe, no matter how turbulent the seas became. Harry went from cage to cage, peering at them; they were very still, some of them on top of their comp
anions in rather undignified poses, presumably from the rough seas they\rquote d experienced. It was strange for Harry to see their dark little eyes staring into space, unblinking. If he hadn\rquote 
t been able to see the very small movements indicating that they were still breathing he wouldn\rquote t have believed that they were alive. 
\par He stared at cage after cage, but none of the Kissed, Transfigured Aurors stirred. He tapped the side of one of the cages with his index finger. Nothing. He sighed. Then he remembered that they\rquote 
d all been stunned, in addition to being Transfigured. No wonder they weren\rquote t moving. 
\par But suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he did see a movement. One of the hamsters, a sleek black one, was twitching its nose, sniffing at the other animals in the 
same cage. Very carefully, Harry opened the door and took it out. Something about the look in its small dark eyes was familiar to him, and he held it close to his face, whispering, \'93Cho? Is that you?\'94 
\par He reckoned they hadn\rquote t stunned her before turning her into a hamster. She still seemed somewhat dazed, looking at him as though she wasn\rquote 
t really seeing him, sniffing at his hand as though that would tell her all she needed to know about him. 
\par He stroked her back and rubbed her between her small ears, taking
 out his wand. He started to remove the spell from her, to turn her back into a human, but then he remembered what Percy had said and thought better of it. He sighed and put her back in the cage, closing the door carefully. She continued to sniff lethargi
cally at the other hamsters in the cage with her, before settling down to sleep. Harry turned to leave, but immediately bumped into someone. 
\par \'93You left the celebration, Harry,\'94 Dumbledore said gently. Harry had the feeling that he\rquote d been watching him with Cho; he wondered whether he\rquote d hidden himself using the Chameleon Transfiguration to be invisible, but didn\rquote 
t dare ask. 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93I\rquote m happy for them, and it was even my idea, but in some ways, I\rquote m not feeling that much like celebrating now.\'94 He waved his hand at the cages. \'93
All of these people are going to end up living the rest of their lives in St. Mungo\rquote s, and we didn\rquote t manage to get the dead off the island before we had to run for it. So to speak.\'94 
\par Dumbledore put his hand on Harry\rquote s shoulder. \'93Well, I think you all did very well, considering what we were up against....\'94 
\par Harry looked at him with narrowed eyes. \'93It\rquote s a good thing that both you and Ron have such good hearing, so we knew about the bomb. Only--I know Ron\rquote s reason for being able to do that. What\rquote s yours?\'94 
\par Dumbledore gave him that sly look that always preceded an instance of his telling Harry, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 You\rquote ll know when it\rquote s time}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, or something similar. Harry grimaced, waiting for it, but to his surprise, Dumbledore nodded at him. 
\par \'93I thought you might have forgotten about that.\'94 Harry shook his head. \'93Well, I\rquote ll tell you what Harry. You offer some guesses as to why you think I have exceptional hearing, and I\rquote ll tell you if you hit the mark.\'94 
\par Harry sighed. \'93I was rather hoping you might just }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 tell}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  me something for once.\'94 He tried not to sound irritated, but he wasn\rquote t sure he succeeded. 
\par Dumbledore chuckled. \'93Ah, I see. After almost seven years of my cryptic answers, you\rquote ve grown rather weary of my whimsical nature, have you?\'94 he said cheerfully, not sounding a bit offended. Harry grinned at him. 
\par \'93Maybe I thought that being Head Boy would mean I wouldn\rquote t have to follow clues and work out riddles every time you opened your mouth, that I\rquote d be in the inner circle at last.\'94 
\par Dumbledore nodded. \'93And well you might think that.\'94
 He looked intently at the cage where the hamster Harry was sure was Cho was sitting, still awake, looking at the two of them, it seemed. The ship rocked gently beneath their feet and Harry noticed for the first time that Dumbledore s
eemed to have natural sea-legs; he hadn\rquote t stumbled or been awkward, that Harry had seen, since he\rquote d boarded the ship. He wasn\rquote t sure whether that was part of the hearing mystery or not. 
\par \'93Why don\rquote t you let her out again, Harry?\'94 he said softly. Harry nodded and did as Dumbledore suggested. He held her in his hand, feeling her tiny heart beating rapidly against his palm. \'93Bring her up on deck, why don\rquote 
t you, give our former Head Girl some fresh air?\'94 
\par Dumbledore\rquote s voice sounded st
range to Harry, but he did as he suggested, following the headmaster back up the companionway. He and Harry walked slowly toward Ron and Hermione, where they stood near the starboard rail, sipping champagne. The fairy lights shed an ethereal glow over all
 and the wind filled the sails, pushing them on down the coast. 
\par \'93Harry!\'94 Hermione said when she saw him. \'93Oh, hullo, Professor Dumbledore,\'94 she said, nodding respectfully to the headmaster. \'93Where did you both go?\'94 
\par \'93I went to check on Cho,\'94 Harry said, nodding at the hamster he was holding. Hermione\rquote s mouth became very thin. 
\par \'93I\rquote m glad she was Kissed,\'94 Hermione said bitterly. \'93I never thought I\rquote d say that about anyone, but I\rquote m glad. You know, when we were down in the hold and thought we might all die, I tr
ied to think of other things, to keep my mind off that. Well, to keep my mind off that and spewing,\'94 she admitted, with a glance at Ron. \'93
And something occurred to me--Ron told me that she left him to face Evan on his own last year, in the forest. But what if she was actually working }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 with}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  him? What if she }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 knew}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  about Viktor being Voldemort\rquote s heir, what if she was already a Death Eater }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 last year}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, when she was Head Girl? She might not have needed to be under Imperius at all to give poor Professor Flitwick that potion! She could have just given him poison and killed him! And then after }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  she received the Order of the Phoenix!\'94 
\par Harry felt the small animal in his hand squirm against his fingers, as though trying to get away. Suddenly, the bright eyes didn\rquote t look so glazed over anymore; they looked terrified. He tightened his grip and said grimly, \'93
You may be right, Hermione.\'94 
\par Dumbledore nodded. \'93Speaking of honors,\'94 he said idly, gazing out at the dark beyond the ship, \'93you do realize that I will be recommending that you all receive the Order of Merlin for what you have done.\'94 
\par Hermione gasped and Harry was so surprised that he almost dropped the squirming little hamster. Cho was growing steadily more agitated. 
\par \'93While--while we\rquote re still }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 in school}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 Hermione choked out. Ron was simply standing with his mouth open in shock. 
\par \'93Yes,\'94 Dumbledore continued. \'93I shall also recommend that we have the ceremony in the Hogsmeade village hall, instead of at the Ministry. It holds nearly as many people as the Great Hall at H
ogwarts and should work nicely. There will be a little time required to process some paperwork and for me to convince Cornelius--but I have no doubt that I shall prevail. You needn\rquote t look so worried, Harry.\'94 
\par \'93It\rquote s not that,\'94 Harry told him, frowning as he struggled to keep Cho confined in his grasp. \'93It\rquote s just--you }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 can\rquote t}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 give us the Order of Merlin while we\rquote re still in school.\'94 
\par Dumbledore\rquote s brows lowered over his eyes. \'93And why not?\'94 
\par Harry grimaced. \'93Because poor Snape would--he\rquote d have a meltdown. I remember how he was near the end of my third year, when he thought he was going to get the Order of Merlin for bringing in Sirius, and it didn\rquote 
t happen because Hermione and I helped him esc--\'94 He stopped, seeing the horrified looks on Ron and Hermione\rquote s faces. \'93Erm,\'94 he managed to say. \'93He\rquote s standing right behind me, isn\rquote t he?\'94
 His voice shook and his two best friends nodded slowly, confirming what he had already had guessed. 
\par He turned, expecting to see a very irate Severus Snape, but instead, Snape was looking at him with amusement, one corner of his mouth turned up. \'93Nice to finally hear you admit to it, Harry,\'94 he said sardonically. \'93
Did you think that Sirius Black and I had worked together for almost three years without my asking him how exactly he managed to do me out of the Order of Merlin?\'94 
\par Harry grinned at him. \'93Well, now you\rquote re going to get it. First Class, I should think,\'94 he said, looking sideways at Dumbledore, who nodded. 
\par \'93And I think that if Miss Granger and Sirius receive Third Class, Severus might not have a \lquote meltdown,\rquote  as you put it,\'94 he said softly, his eyes twinkling at Harry over his half-moon spectacles. \'93
I would recommend my brother as well, but he already has the Order of Merlin, First Class.\'94 
\par Harry\rquote s face dropped. \'93What about Ron? He saved your life!\'94 He looked in distress at Ron, who seemed both a bit disappointed and yet resigned. But Dumbledore clapped him on the shoulder and smiled gently. 
\par \'93As did you, pulling us from the sea in your griffin form. And while I do not think that my life is more important than the other lives saved, I will use that as a very good excuse to recommend Second Class for you and Mr. Weasley as well,\'94
 he said with a wink. 
\par Ron was standing in open-mouthed shock again, as Hermione launched herself at him, hugging him tightly. Harry slapped him on the back, grinning, and Snape didn\rquote t even appear to object to this. 
\par However, as he congratulated Ron, he lost his grip on the hamster, and after Cho landed on the deck, she went scampering away from him. To his relief, Dumbledore was on top of things and pointed his wand at her. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Finite Incantatem!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 he cried. 
\par Harry gasped; he was taking the Transfiguration spell off her! Suddenly, Cho Chang appeared before them all, standing in a slightly crouched position, her short sleek hair swinging around her chin, looking very alert and not the }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 least}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  bit as though she\rquote d been Kissed by a dementor. Ron immediately lunged for her, but Dumbledore put his hand out to stop him. 
\par \'93You nearly got us blown up!\'94 he snarled at her, not really trying to get past Dumbledore; he obviously didn\rquote t want to hurt him. \'93Trying to bloody }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 rescue}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 you! Just because you wanted to throw your life away doesn\rquote t mean that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 we}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  did!\'94 
\par Hermione stepped forward and, surprisingly, slapped Cho across the face. Harry reluctantly pulled her back; she struggled against him. \'93You were trying to kill Harry and Ron, pretending to be Kissed,\'94 she spat. \'93
You were trying to get as many people killed as you could, but we were too quick for you, pulling all of the Aurors out of there the way we did. It spoiled your plans. So you were going to take Harry and Ron with you....\'94
 she choked, as Harry held her. 
\par Cho didn\rquote t look at Ron and Hermione, though they were the ones leveling accusations at her; she was looking at Harry, her dark eyes very cold, her mouth twisting in a smile. He shivered, but he didn\rquote 
t wonder for a moment how she had come to be like this, how she had become a Death Eater. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 It\rquote s all my fault.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Then suddenly she turned and said simply, \'93You were right, Hermione,\'94
 before abruptly changing before them all. Suddenly, a very large eagle was standing where Cho had been; she leapt up onto the rail and launched herself into the night, her enormous wings beating against the cold February air. 
\par Hermione gasped. \'93She\rquote s an Animagus!\'94 
\par Harry sprang for the rail. \'93I\rquote ll change too, and go after her!\'94 
\par But Dumbledore put his hand on Harry\rquote s shoulder; he looked up at the old man, who was still taller than him. He was shaking his head, looking grim. \'93She did exactly as I expected her to do,\'94 he said simply. \'93
She learned to take on the form of an erne while studying under Professor McGonagall, taking rather longer than you and Hermione, more than three years. She didn\rquote t finish, in fact, until after she 
completed her seventh year. She finally registered with the Ministry last summer ...\'94 Hermione gasped; Harry could hardly believe it. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Cho had trained to be an Animagus too!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\'93I was starting to think she would wait until we docked to make her escape, so that she wouldn\rquote 
t have as far to fly. In her presence I made a great show of talking about how concerned I was that Sirius might splinch himself, going back to the Burrow from the ship. I had hoped that she might be leery of Apparating from the ship, and I dar
esay she was, as she exposed herself to the rest of you as an Animagus. No, this is far better....\'94 
\par Harry\rquote s mouth dropped open, much as Ron\rquote s had. \'93You--you mean you did that on purpose? Let her get away?\'94 He nodded. Harry was utterly confused. \'93And how is this better?\'94 
\par \'93And what\rquote s an }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 erne}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 Ron wanted to know. 
\par \'93An }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 erne}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  is a large sea eagle. And this is better because, as of this moment, she believes we are going down to Dover,\'94 Dumbledore explained calmly. 
\par Hermione frowned. \'93We\rquote re not?\'94 
\par \'93No. We never 
were. I originally suspected that she might decide to Apparate away at some point--which is why I wanted her to believe that only the Hogwarts Apparition teacher would be likely to do it successfully--and notify other Death Eaters of our location. That is
 why I allowed her to hear me speaking to Severus about Dover while in her hearing. It so happens that you all heard as well, and believed that to be our goal.\'94 
\par Harry looked at him shrewdly. \'93So, you were never fooled by her for a minute.\'94 
\par In the glow from the fairy lights, Dumbledore looked very old as he said, \'93No, I was not.\'94 
\par Ron crossed his arms. \'93So if we were never going to Dover, where }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 are}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  we going?\'94 
\par \'93To Snape,\'94 Dumbledore said simply, raising his eyebrows. Harry, Ron and Hermione stared at each other, baffled. 
\par \'93Erm,\'94 Ron began. \'93Professor Snape is right here,\'94 he said slowly, as though speaking to a simpleton. 
\par Dumbledore looked at him indulgently. \'93To Snape, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Suffolk}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 he said this time. \'93We shall need to navigate up the River Alde first. Nothing
 our fine captain cannot handle,\'94 he added with a nod to Snape. 
\par Harry laughed. \'93So, we\rquote re actually going to a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 town}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  named \lquote Snape.\rquote \'94 
\par Dumbledore shrugged. \'93There is a very old regional Ministry office there, not far from the bridge, in the Snape Maltings. Lovely concert hall there; you would enjoy their music festival in June, Miss Granger. It is quite famous.\'94
 He smiled gently at his Head Girl. \'93It will be possible for the three of you, Severus and Miss Dougherty to return to Hogsmeade by Floo, as well as t
he new Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Sam. Aberforth can use Floo to go to the central Ministry offices in London with the Aurors who were imprisoned and Kissed, and a definitive list of the dead can be compiled after the fact. For the identities of the Death E
aters who were killed during the fighting, we shall have to rely upon eyewitnesses. And I believe that all of the Aurors who were imprisoned, after a bit of rest, shall have their hands quite full running to ground all of those escaped prisoners.\'94
 He didn\rquote t mention the dementors, and Harry tried not to shiver at the thought of them. \'93After he helps to sort out the Aurors in London, my brother can come to Hog\rquote s End for the celebration, and I will return Severus\rquote 
 vessel to her proper place in the Firth of Clyde.\'94 
\par \'93Yes, what about the wedding dinner?\'94 Hermione asked. 
\par \'93Ah, yes, quite. Well, having it this evening is really out of the question, isn\rquote t that right, Severus? How long is the river?\'94 
\par \'93About twenty-one miles. The entry point is at Shingle Street in Orford. We\rquote ll actually be navigating the Ore at the start; between Orford and Aldeburgh it changes to the River Alde, but I couldn\rquote t tell you where. I haven\rquote 
t been in these parts for years...\'94 
\par Harry narrowed his eyes, thinking hard. \'93Before your parents died, you came here one summer with your uncle for the yacht races held by the Aldeburgh Yacht Club,\'94
 he said softly, vaguely remembering something his dad had said to him in his other life. He looked up at Snape, who swallowed, nodding. 
\par \'93That was over twenty-five years ago,\'94 he replied in a quiet, even voice. Clearing his throat, he turned to the headmaster again. \'93
The entrance is shingle, but the banks can get very muddy, if I remember. It is a tidal river, and we shall need the high water level that is pre
sent much of the night in order to navigate up to the bridge; at low tide it is little better than a narrow stream and you are lucky if you can avoid grounding a dinghy.\'94 
\par \'93So perhaps we shall arrive by morning?\'94 Dumbledore asked. Snape nodded. 
\par \'93It will be necessarily to do so well before that, else we\rquote ll be sitting in mud when the tide goes out. But there is no reason we cannot. As the moon has only been waning for one night, the high tides are very high yet, especially as we\rquote 
re getting close on the start of spring. But that also means the low tides are }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 very}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 low, and will expose most of the hard. There is a fair breeze from the northeast at five knots, but it is not storming. It\rquote ll do.\'94 
\par Dumbledore nodded to him, then turned to Harry, Ron and Hermione. \'93Once we arrive in Snape and reach the Snape Maltings, it won\rquote t be long before you\rquote re back in Hogsmeade. Percy and Katie shall have their wedding banquet,\'94
 he said, his eyes twinkling. Harry felt his heart swell; he would see Ginny at Hog\rquote s End! He thought again of why Sirius had Disapparated from the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 and prayed again, silently, for the safety of everyone in that house. \'93I think that if you return to the castle by Monday morning,\'94 Dumbledore finished, \'93no harm will be done.\'94 That sounded fine to Harry
; more time with Ginny away from Hogwarts. 
\par But now Hermione looked still more distressed. \'93But--but--Harry and I will miss the Sunday night prefects\rquote  meeting!\'94 
\par Ron and Harry both laughed. He was strongly reminded of the end of their second year, when Hermione had been so upset by the exams being canceled. \'93I honestly think you can miss a meeting for once, Hermione,\'94 Ron said, grinning at her. 
\par \'93I\rquote m not so sure,\'94 Harry said, chuckling more than he knew he should be. \'93She might go into withdrawal or something.\'94 He had seen that Hermione }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 loved}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 being in charge of the prefects\rquote  meetings. They were always run strictly by Robert\rquote s Rules of Order, had firm agendas, and moved along quickly, if rather brusquely at times. She brooked very little discussion. 
\par Hermione stuck her tongue out at them both and crossed her arms. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Someone}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 has to keep the prefects from thinking they can just do anything they want. Eddy Shire takes any opportunity to take points away from a house other than Slytherin.\'94 
\par Harry saw Snape\rquote s mouth twisting as though he was trying to stifle his laughter as well. \'93And that is a problem }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 why}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94
 he asked her, raising his eyebrows. She flushed and Harry and Ron laughed. 
\par \'93So we probably won\rquote t dock until near morning?\'94 Ron asked. \'93When I thought we were going to Dover, I reckoned we\rquote d still be on our way through tomorrow and part of the way into Monday.\'94 
\par \'93How soon before we begin our journey along the Alde, Severus?\'94 Dumbledore asked him. 
\par \'93We\rquote re nearly to Orford now, actually,\'94 Snape informed the headmaster. Harry saw that Duncan MacDermid was at the tiller now. He saw where Harry was looking and said, \'93
I shall take the tiller myself before we get to the estuary and onto the river proper. There is a shifting shingle bar across the entrance. It is notorious in sailing circles for being unpredictable. We don\rquote 
t want to be swept onto the shoals. Most boats in these parts never actually cross the bar; they stay to the Ore, Alde and Butley rivers. And as we shan\rquote t be needing to secure a buoy in Orford, we needn\rquote t bother the harbormaster there.\'94 

\par \'93Will you need me, Captain?\'94 Harry asked Snape, who shook his head. 
\par \'93Get some rest, Harry. There are markers all up the Alde that show where the shallows are, but we shan\rquote t need to worry about that for hours, when we\rquote re closer to low tide.\'94 He put his hand on Harry\rquote 
s shoulder and Harry felt very much like he had his dad back; he\rquote d felt that way several times during the trip, but never as much as at this moment. 
\par \'93Yes, sir,\'94 he answered obediently. He, Ron and Hermione bade the others good night and went down the companionway into the hold; Harry led them to the berths in the fo\rquote 
castle and Ron and Hermione climbed into one bunk together, fully clothed. He chose one of the others, wishing that Ginn
y was with him. He hoped again that she and the rest of her family were all right. His eyes finally closed and he slipped into dreamless slumber, lulled by the gentle rocking of the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{

e could see it well by the moon beaming in through the porthole above his bunk. He felt surprisingly well-rested and decided to leave Ron and Hermione, still sleeping peacefully, to go up on deck. 
\par He pulled his woolen pea coat close around his body when h
e reached the deck; the spell that had earlier made the air on the deck feel spring-like, for the wedding, had faded, and the air that struck him full in the face was hard and cold and full of winter once more. There was a mild wind pushing gently at the 
s
ails, and he saw Duncan MacDermid stowing the topsail, in fact, which Maggie had just thrown down to him; they not only wouldn't need that kind of thrust in the narrow channel, it would make it harder for Snape to steer properly. They had to tread a fine 
line between going quickly enough to beat the ebbing tide and yet be able to prevent the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  straying into shallow water. 
\par He found Snape near the tiller, staring hard at the water to either side of the hull; Harry saw that tree branches had been thrus
t into the mud banks to indicate the deeper water. In the moonlight, Harry could see that some of the branches had fading red or green paint on them; he asked Snape about this, hoping he wouldn\rquote t think he was a pest. 
\par Snape continued to watch the water carefully; Harry could see a good bit of damp wood below the high-water marks on the withies, and he wondered how soon the water level would be dangerously low. \'93Red for port, green for starboard,\'94
 Snape told him shortly. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Ah, right,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry remembered. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 That way you know to which side of the withy is deep water.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  \'93
Right, sir. Forgot.\'94 Harry had to squint to see even a trace of paint on some of the branches, though, as it was so faded. He realized that this was why Snape was concentrating so hard; before he moved 
his hand on the tiller, he needed to make certain he knew whether the withy was directing him to the left or right. An error meant being grounded, most likely. 
\par Maggie ambled over to them, looking rather weary. \'93Do you need me up here, or can I go below for a while?\'94 
\par \'93We are past the marsh,\'94 Snape told her. \'93My uncle should be able to help if we actually need to do any tacking, which is doubtful with the wind so mild. Get some rest; Harry's here now, too, should the wind kick up.\'94 
\par \'93Take the bunk I was using in the fo'castle,\'94 Harry told her. \'93Ron and Hermione are down there, too.\'94 
\par She smiled at him and quickly pecked Snape on the cheek before leaving; he gave her an affectionate look before going back to staring at the withies; he couldn't afford to be di
stracted and she knew that. After she was gone, they both remained silent for some time, Harry keeping an eye on the withies, should Snape\rquote s eyes prove to be weary. He watched the older man\rquote 
s hand on the tiller and saw him moving in the expected ways. Harry had to squint very hard at times to spot the paint color on the branches. 
\par At length, Harry could see the bridge in the distance; it was an old Roman style structure, a single stone arch giving the impression that you could go under it and continue up the river, but the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  would never fit under such a space. Harry leapt onto the dock when they had drawn alongside it, tying up the painter with a flourish, feeling exhilarated. They\rquote d done it; they\rquote 
d rescued the Aurors and would soon be going back to Hogsmeade, going home. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 It\rquote s not your home,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he had to remind himself suddenly. But in some ways, it would always be his home. He knew that he really shouldn\rquote 
t have been surprised that his feet had taken him to Ginny\rquote s bedroom during the summer; it had felt 
as natural to him as breathing. He had lived there for over ten years, even though it was only during the summer months and the Christmas and Easter Holidays since he had turned eleven. She had been an occasional guest in that house for only a few years, 
since Percy had purchased it with the money that used to belong to Lucius Malfoy. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Lucius Malfoy.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  That wasn\rquote t a good thought. He had no earthly reason to like Weasleys. When he left Percy in Azkaban to die, he\rquote 
d probably thought that justification for Percy having \lquote stolen\rquote 
 his money. Percy and Katie had just married; nothing would touch them, Harry promised himself. There was also no love lost between the Bells and Lucius Malfoy, either; it was because of him that Sam had gone to prison and Katie had been pl
aced under Imperius, ordered to pursue Harry during his fifth year. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 And I\rquote ll never let Lucius Malfoy hurt Ginny again,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 he thought with determination, remembering the sight of her frail little body in the Chamber of Secrets. 
\par Harry leapt back to the deck, looking to Snape for further instructions. \'93You\rquote re very keen, Mr. Potter,\'94 Snape said to him. 
\par \'93Please, sir--I want to make certain everything\rquote s all right at Hog\rquote s End. Lucius Malfoy--\'94 
\par Snape nodded. \'93Of course. It\rquote s natural to be concerned,\'94 he said slowly. 
\par He met Harry\rquote s eye and the familiarity of the situation was almost painful. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 You were a good dad,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry wanted to tell him. He\rquote 
d told him this before, but he still wasn\rquote t certain Snape believed it. 
\par It took some time to roust everyone from sleep and hus
tle them onto the dock. Aberforth and Sam led the Aurors to the local Ministry Office, some of them carrying the cages containing their erstwhile comrades. Harry wondered what the good people of Snape, Suffolk would think if they looked out their windows 
and saw this queer parade of bedraggled wizards walking toward the dark concert hall. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Probably tell themselves they're still dreaming and go back to bed,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 he realized, knowing that Muggles' brains were very good about helping them cope with otherwise inexplicable sights. Harry, Ron and Hermione hung back, waiting for Dumbledore, Maggie and Snape. When they\rquote 
d all disembarked, Dumbledore untied the painter and withdrew his wand from his robes again; after the ship was reduced in size once more, he summoned it neatly into his hands and walked along with them, just as though he were toting a model of a ship. 

\par They proceeded past a pub called The Plough and Sail until they finally reached the Snape Maltings. Dumbledore led them to a blank wall in side of the buildi
ng which suddenly became a door when he waved his hand casually in front of it. They all entered, finding not a concert hall, but a dingy little office overflowing now with Aurors. Harry thought that it was probably just as well that no one who normally w
orked in the office was around at four-thirty in the morning; they'd probably be completely overwhelmed. 
\par Aberforth made his way to them through the crowd. \'93About half have gone through to London,\'94 he told them. \'93I think the supply of Floo powder I found in the clerk\rquote 
s desk will do for all of us. You might want to leave a note for the poor bloke, Albus, explaining where all of it\rquote s gone. He might take it better if it comes from you.\'94 
\par They waited for more of the Aurors to go through, and then Percy, Katie, Hermione, Ron, Aberforth and Sam finally went. Harry nodded at Snape, Maggie and Dumbledore before he stepped toward the fire, but suddenly, Dumbledore thrust his hand at him. 

\par \'93Good work, Harry,\'94 he said simply, looking at him over his half-moon spectacles. 
\par Harry grinned at him. \'93Thank you, sir,\'94 he said before throwing his powder into the fire and crying, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Hog\rquote s End!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Harry stumbled out of the drawing room fire, coughing a bit from the soot. Percy, Katie, Hermione, Ron, Aberforth and Sam were standing about talking to each other, along with Fred, Sirius, Mrs. Figg and another wizard he knew he\rquote 
d seen before. Ginny was standing to the side, and the moment he saw her, alive and well, he lost all semblance of self-control and launched himself at her. She met him half-way, and then there was nothing in the world but Ginny\rquote 
s arms around him, Ginny\rquote s mouth opening under his, Ginny\rquote s hair caught in his fingers.... 
\par When they came up for air, they noticed that everyone else in the room had stopped to gawp at them, and Harry felt himself redden. He\rquote 
d been followed out of the fire by Maggie and Snape, who looked highly amused. Fortunately, Harry noticed that not only were Ron, Fred and Percy }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 looking hostile, they also seemed somewhat amused, and Katie was giving him and Ginny a gentle, friendly smile while clutching Percy\rquote s arm. Sirius strode to him and enveloped him in a hug. Harry grinned at him and hugged back. 
\par \'93So,\'94 he said, \'93is it too much to hope that when Lucius Malfoy attacked you all stupefied him and turned him over to the Ministry?\'94 
\par \'93Actually, it\rquote s too much too hope that he attacked. We haven\rquote t a clue where he might be. It\rquote s been quiet as a church around here, except for--\'94 
\par An ear-splitting wail was suddenly heard from the upper reaches of the house and Harry turned to Fred, grinning. \'93The babies?\'94 
\par Fred nodded, looking very tired. \'93Rufus finally arrived yesterday at about three o\rquote clock. I don\rquote t think we\rquote re ever }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 really}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 going to have peace around here again. Tell me once more why I moved in with my brothers after leaving home?\'94 
\par Ron laughed. \'93When I finish school, maybe we can get a flat together and you can escape the Wailing Ones,\'94 he said, only to receive an instant glare from Hermione. Ron was frowning now. \'93What? What did I say?\'94 he demanded, as Hermione\rquote 
s brow furrowed and she drew her lips into a very thin line. 
\par Harry and Ginny looked at each other, shaking their heads and smiling; in some ways, when it came to Hermione, Ron was still as thick as when he was in his third and fourth years. 
\par Fred, however, picked up on it. \'93That\rquote d be fine with me. You }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 are}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  in the habit of walking about in the morning with nothing on, right Hermione?\'94 he asked innocently,
 raising his eyebrows. 
\par \'93Oh, er, on second thought--\'94 Ron said quickly, finally catching on. 
\par The rest of them laughed, and soon after they were in the large old kitchen, eating whatever food was available, sitting round the long table talking and making plans for the special dinner that would come later, to celebrate Katie and Percy\rquote 
s wedding. The wizard Harry hadn\rquote t been able to put a name to was Mundungus Fletcher; he remembered that Fletcher had been at the ceilidh, wearing Clan MacGregor, like him. Fletcher and Mrs. Figg had come to Hog\rquote s End at Sirius\rquote 
 bidding, to protect against the Death Eater attack that wasn\rquote t. 
\par When George entered, carrying one of his children in each arm, looking very proud, a roar went up, and Maggie and Hermione each claimed on
e of the babies, while Katie took turns cooing at each of them. Even Ron took an interest in the newest Weasleys, declaring that Rowena looked like she would favor her mother, which was a lucky thing, as he wouldn\rquote 
t wish for any girl to look like George. Rufus would just have to tolerate being told he looked like his dad. 
\par George merely laughed at this; he looked happier than Harry had ever seen him, with the possible exception of the time he\rquote d caught George and Angelina in bed together during the infamous 
Christmas party in his fifth year. The thought of what they were very likely doing during that party made him shift uncomfortably in his chair, and when Ginny asked him whether he was all right, his reply of, \'93Never better,\'94
 came out a bit squeaky, making her stare. 
\par At length, they heard footsteps in the corridor outside the kitchen and Molly and Arthur Weasley entered, stopping short when they saw everyone. \'93Oh! I came to check on the babies. Why didn\rquote t anyone say that you\rquote d returned?\'94
 Mrs. Weasley exclaimed, pulling Percy and Ron to her. She didn\rquote t have to talk Maggie into anything; as soon as she\rquote 
d handed little Rufus over to Katie, she was throwing her arms around her mother and brothers both. Mrs. Weasley also had to hug Hermione and Harry, but Harry n
oticed Katie standing nervously to one side, awkwardly rocking Rufus to and fro, waiting. Finally, Percy took the baby from her and handed his nephew back to Maggie. He put his arm around Katie\rquote s shoulder and brought her to his mother. 
\par \'93We\rquote ve something to tell you, Mum.\'94 
\par Harry watched Mrs. Weasley\rquote s face very carefully as she learned that she had a daughter-in-law. He saw the initial flash of anger, but that was quickly pushed down as she gathered Katie to her, hugging her firmly. She looked at Percy over Katie
\rquote s shoulder, and Harry had a feeling that she didn\rquote t want another row with him, after very nearly losing him. Then she held Katie at arm\rquote s length, saying, \'93Aren\rquote t you pretty? And also an Auror, yes?\'94
 Katie nodded; Harry could see that she was shaking. Mrs. Weasley seemed to be biting back a comment about Katie\rquote s job. They all waited while she continued to regard Katie; the silence was deafening. 
\par \'93Well,\'94 she finally said, \'93these days--I reckon no one has the time to plan weddings,\'94 she said, her jaw clenched rather tightly, looking at George out of the corner of her eye. \'93And it\rquote s not as though }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 your}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  father was there either,\'94 she added cheerfully, as though this was a comfort to her. Katie looked uncertainly at Percy; Mrs. Weasley evidently didn\rquote t know that Sam 
}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  there, that he had in fact given Katie away. 
\par Arthur Weasley broke the uncomfortable tension by stepping forward and kissing Katie on the cheek. \'93I am very happy to have another daughter,\'94 he said warmly. Then he noticed Sam hovering nearby and put his hand out to him. \'93And Sam Bell!\'94
 he cried happily. \'93It\rquote s been years! And now we\rquote re family!\'94 
\par Sam flushed and shook Mr. Weasley\rquote s hand; Harry could tell that Sam felt awkward about seeing people again whom he\rquote d known before going to prison. They all }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 knew}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 why he hadn\rquote t been about for years. \'93Well, actually, Mrs. Weasley--\'94 
\par \'93Molly,\'94 she insisted, patting his arm sympathetically. 
\par \'93Er, yes, Molly. You see, the thing is--I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  there.\'94 Sam looked at her earnestly. 
\par Silence. 
\par The expression in Molly Weasley\rquote s eyes was not one Harry ever wanted to see directed at }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . He whispered to Ginny, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Let
\rquote s get out of here}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 She nodded and they managed to slip inconspicuously into the butler\rquote s pantry, which led to the dining room. However, Harry had forgotte
n that this was now the office from where Weasley Wizard Wheezes was run. Percy had a large desk in here sitting behind a couch which faced the fire. He didn\rquote 
t particularly care where they were, though, as he pulled Ginny to him and lowered his mouth to he
rs. She responded at first, but then she just turned her head and clutched at him, her cheek against his shoulder, and he felt tears wetting his sleeve, her body beginning to convulse with sobs as the shock of it all finally took her over. 
\par \'93There, there,\'94
 he said gently, leading her to the couch, pulling her onto his lap. As she cried into his neck, he rocked her and whispered soft reassurances in her ear. Finally, she lifted her tear-stained face to him and pulled the amulet out of the neck of her blouse
. \'93I--I--\'94 she tried to say, hiccuping and looking so adorable that Harry had to try very hard not to smile. \'93I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 saw}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94
 she finally managed to say, holding out the amulet to him. He knew what she meant. He was horrified, remembering being on the horizontal mast, the ship going up and up, the bone-shattering impact when they\rquote 
d gone over the first really massive wave. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 She must have thought she was going to see me die,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he realized. 
\par He kissed her face all over, feeling tears steal into his eyes as he thought about what he\rquote d put her through. \'93I never should have given you the amulet...\'94 he said to her, full of remorse. 
\par She took it off and placed it over his head. \'93You have it again, Harry. It was my gift to you in the first place,\'94 she added, her voice ending on a
 croak. As she drew her hand away, he saw something on her right palm, and he held it up to his scrutiny now, staring at it; fading but still visible was the dark pink image of the basilisk. She had been clutching it so tightly for so long that it was in 
her very skin. 
\par He looked at her in distress. \'93Did you stop holding it for a second while we were gone?\'94 
\par She bit her lip. \'93Once. When Angelina had had Rufus and I held him. But that was it. I gave him back to her quickly; I wanted to make sure you were all right....And when I saw you pull Ron and Professor Dumbledore from the sea....\'94
 She was crying again, or still--he wasn\rquote t completely certain she had ever stopped. \'93Thank you,\'94 she whispered. \'93Thank you for saving him. And Percy....\'94 
\par He\rquote d been living all of it so quickly, everything coming in a rush, that it hadn\rquote t occurred to him how it would look to Ginny, how she would be constantly on edge, sitting in Hog\rquote 
s End, clutching the amulet. He gazed at her affectionately and cupped her cheek in his hand, then
 lowered his hand in order to draw her palm to him, imprinted with the basilisk. He brought it to his lips, kissing the image gently, making her gasp at the sensation. When he use his tongue to lightly trace the great snake\rquote 
s outline on her skin, he could feel her trembling at his touch. He started to work his way up to her wrist, then kissing the inside of her forearm, pushing up her sleeve. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Hello, Harry Potter.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par He almost jumped out of his skin when a small green head poked out from under the fabric and looked calmly up at him. He sat staring at her for what seemed a long time while he waited for his heart to slow down again. He swallowed and finally said, \'93
Hello, Sandy,\'94 then looked up at Ginny. \'93So,\'94 he said, his voice sounding slightly strangled. \'93You\rquote ve been wearing Sandy on your arm.\'94 
\par \'93Yes,\'94 Ginny said, also having regained the ability to breathe normally (although he liked the fact that he had been responsible for her recent very erratic breathing). \'93She\rquote s been quite chatty since you left. Wish I knew what she\rquote 
s been saying. After Sirius arrived, I was half afraid that every time she said something it was about Lucius Malfoy attacking.\'94 She gently withdrew the garden snake from her sleeve and Sandy wrapped herself around Ginny\rquote 
s hand while Ginny stroked her smooth length. \'93Even though I didn\rquote t know what she was saying, I enjoyed taking care of her, though. She feels very nice. I remember the first time you let me touch her...\'94 
\par Harry laughed; suddenly, everything they were saying seemed like a double entendre, and he just couldn\rquote t help himself. 
\par \'93What?\'94 Ginny said with wide-eyed innocence. 
\par Suddenly the door opened and Ron and Hermione crept in, their backs to Harry and Ginny. \'93Do you think Mum saw us leave?\'94 Ron whispered to her. 
\par \'93I don\rquote t think so,\'94 Hermione said softly. \'93She was just sort of glaring at Percy and Sam. And Maggie and Snape.\'94 
\par \'93Good,\'94 Ron said quietly, pulling her to him and starting to lower his mouth to hers. Before their lips made contact, however, he stopped cold, having noticed Harry and Ginny sitting on the couch, staring back at them. \'93Erm,\'94
 Ron began awkwardly. \'93So this is where you two have hidden.\'94 He turned Hermione to face them and said needlessly, and too loudly, \'93Hermione! We\rquote ve found Harry and Ginny!\'94 
\par Hermione rolled her eyes, a smile pulling at the corners of her mouth. \'93Yes, because Harry and Ginny are just }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 so dim}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  that they really believe that\rquote 
s why we came in here,\'94 she intoned. Ron shuffled his feet a little, embarrassed. 
\par Ginny laughed. \'93No, we thought you were here for the same reason }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 we}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  are--to get away from the kitchen before Mum\rquote s temper starts making the pots and pans fly about.
\'94 
\par Ron grinned. \'93Too right. She was fine until Sam had to go and tell her that he\rquote d been at the wedding.\'94 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93I know Sam. I reckon he decided that they should begin as they mean to go on. His relationship with your parents, I mean. He\rquote s Percy\rquote s father-in-law. He wanted to be honest with
 your mum. Think what a row there would be if she only found out }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 later}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 that Sam was there! This way the blow-up will be out of the way and everyone can get on with their lives. Besides, she has the babies to distract her now, as well. She\rquote ll be fine, and Percy and Katie and Sam will be fine.\'94 
\par Hermione shook her head. \'93I don\rquote t know. Mrs. Weasley doesn\rquote t seem very inclined to get over this soon. I mean, we can\rquote t exactly turn back the clock and get her to the ship, can we? She can never }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 really}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  attend Percy\rquote s wedding, even if another ceremony is held. It\rquote s not quite the same.\'94 
\par Harry\rquote s mind suddenly lit up with the solution. \'93There doesn\rquote t have to be another ceremony.\'94 He stood suddenly, surprising Ginny, but he simply picked her up when he did this, and then deposited her on her feet. He bolted out of Percy
\rquote s office, grinning, and he heard the others following after as he returned to the kitchen. 
\par Mrs. Weasley was sniffling into a handkerchief while Percy and Katie stood nearby. \'93Please, Mum,\'94 Percy wheedled. \'93It wasn\rquote t like we had a big wedding and invited other people but not }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , now is it? It was all very spur of the moment. Sam happened to be there because he was worried about Katie . I proposed to her when we were still in Azkaban, but I never }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
intended}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to marry without you being present.\'94 
\par \'93That\rquote s all my fault, Mrs. Weasley,\'94 Harry said suddenly, stepping up to her. \'93If you want to blame anyone for that, blame me.\'94 
\par Mrs. Weasley glanced up at him, startled that he was suddenly involved in the conversation. Percy put his hand on Harry\rquote s arm. \'93You don\rquote t have to do this, Harry.\'94 
\par He looked Percy in the eye. \'93But I should. It\rquote s the truth. She shouldn\rquote t be angry with you or Sam or Katie, or with Professor Snape for performing the wedding, or Ron and Maggie for being best man and maid of honor.\'94
 He turned back to Mrs. Weasley. \'93I should have considered how you\rquote d feel, but I didn\rquote t. It just seemed like--well, like we\rquote d all just been through so much horrid stuff and needed something }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
good}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to celebrate. I saw men and women who\rquote d been fighting Death Eaters, who\rquote d seen their comrades killed or Kissed by dementors, and people who hadn\rquote t eaten for days clapping and cheering and }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 smiling}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  when Percy and Katie were pronounced husband and wife,\'94 he said softly to her. \'93When we opened those cells, the Aurors looked ready to die, and fully expected to.
\'94 He looked fondly at Katie. \'93Percy and Katie reminded them all that there\rquote s still plenty to live for.\'94 
\par Mrs. Weasley faltered for a moment. \'93I see, Harry. Well, far be it from me to be so selfish,\'94 she started to say, sounding contrite; \'93although I didn\rquote t know it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  selfish to want to attend one\rquote s own son\rquote s wedding,\'94 she added, the contrition leaving as quickly as it had come. Harry grinned at her. 
\par \'93You can still attend the wedding,\'94 he told her. She looked up, frowning, and Percy and Katie looked very alarmed. 
\par \'93Now see here, Harry old boy,\'94 Percy started to say. 
\par Katie looked exasperated. \'93I already }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 said}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  that I didn\rquote t want a big wedding to beginning with; just a trip to a registry office. And now we\rquote 
re supposed to do it all }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 over again}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par Harry smiled secretively. \'93Not at all.\'94 He turned to Mrs. Weasley. \'93You can see them get married for the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 first}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  time.\'94
 He tried not to laugh at her baffled expression. \'93I have a Pensieve, Mrs. Weasley. I\rquote ll put my memory of the wedding in there, and you can go in and see it. It\rquote ll be just as if you were there, but without the seasickness,\'94
 he added, catching Hermione\rquote s eye, grinning. 
\par He was unprepared for Mrs. Weasley throwing her arms around him and hugging him tightly. \'93Oh, you dear boy!\'94 she exclaimed, as he struggled to breathe. When she had released him, she turned to Ginny. \'93
Well, we have work to do, putting together a wedding dinner in only a few hours, and I\rquote ll need your help,\'94 she said, very brisk and businesslike now. 
\par Harry grinned at Ginny. It had worked! Mrs. Weasley was no longer angry, and they could get on with the business of celebrating. As Mrs. Weasley swung into party-planning mode, with Katie, Ginny, Hermione and Maggie to help her
, Sirius pulled him aside, nodding at him. 
\par \'93Good work, Harry. Keeping a mother-in-law in line is a good thing to be able to do }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 before}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  getting married.\'94 
\par \'93Yeah, but Katie hadn\rquote t been around Mrs. Weasley much, she didn\rquote t know that--\'94 
\par \'93I wasn\rquote t talking about Katie,\'94 he said, his dark eyes snapping with mischief. 
\par \'93Sirius! We\rquote re--we\rquote re just--\'94 
\par His godfather laughed. \'93I\rquote m sorry, Harry. I won\rquote t joke about it again. You can be very crafty when you want to be, that\rquote s all. You know very well that you\rquote re the last 
person in the world Molly Weasley would ever be angry with, so you took the blame.\'94 
\par \'93I wasn\rquote t lying about that. It }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  my idea. I wasn\rquote t just taking the blame--it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 belongs}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to me.\'94 
\par Sirius was still smiling broadly, and now Snape, Mrs. Figg and Mundungus Fletcher had joined their small circle, along with Ron, Percy and Fred. \'93At any rate, we need to discuss security for this little party.\'94 He nodded at Percy. \'93
I'm not saying you shouldn't be celebrating--but we can't let our guard down. We still have to stay on our toes. Your mum will be needing to get some supplies for that, and she\rquote 
ll need an escort. I recommend going to some Muggle stores, avoiding wizarding places.\'94 
\par Percy nodded. \'93
Right. Katie and I will go with Mum to do the shopping. I have some Muggle money, left over from before the Gringotts siege ended. Should be enough for everything we need. And we're not going to be contacting anyone who isn't already in the house.\'94 

\par \'93Good. Keep it exclusive. Less of a security risk that way. All right,\'94 Sirius said, nodding. \'93Now--house security. We\rquote 
ll need to take turns securing the north, south, east and west facades, and inside, someone to keep an eye on the fire. I don\rquote t think we shoul
d take the house off the Floo network, though. I do think we should put anti-Apparition wards on the place. Just because Lucius Malfoy hasn\rquote t attacked yet, doesn\rquote t mean he isn\rquote t going to. He\rquote 
d love to break up a party like this, after all. He\rquote s probably furious that Cho Chang led them all down to Dover for no reason. Or at least, I hope she did, as Dumbledore told me that he\rquote 
s going to have the Ministry send a contingent of their best Aurors to ambush them. Hopefully he won\rquote t work out ahead of time that it was a ruse. We very likely won\rquote t learn whether that went well until later. Oh, and that reminds me--don
\rquote t forget to keep an eye out for an especially large eagle.\'94 
\par Mrs. Figg and Fletcher were baffled by this, so Sirius explained. Harry caught Ginny\rquote s eye across the room, as she listened to her mother\rquote 
s plans for the party. She smiled back at him and he felt that everything was getting close to being all right. Or it would be, if only they knew what Lucius Malfoy was up to.

\par They\rquote d cleared the drawing room of furniture to use it for da
ncing, although they had to settle for the wireless, as there was no time to hire a small ensemble. Harry was drinking some punch and talking to Ron and Hermione when Ginny walked toward him, her hand out, and soon he was thrusting his cup of punch at Ron
 and following her onto the dance floor. 
\par He remembered holding her in his arms the previous summer, at a very different sort of wedding. She\rquote d looked so beautiful, but it was hardly surprising, as she\rquote d taken great care with her hair and makeup, and Alicia
 had dressed her. She looked like her normal, everyday self now, and even more lovely, he thought, than when she\rquote d been Alicia\rquote s bridesmaid. 
\par Harry was able to hold her close to him without wincing; before the party, he\rquote d gone up to the new nursery, where Angelina and Madam Pomfrey were bathing the babies, and Madam Pomfrey had examined his welts and healed them quickly. He\rquote 
d started to go, but the babies had rather fascinated him, and Angelina had let him hold little Rufus after his bath, swaddled in a tow
el with a small hood attached. His creamy tan skin was a dark pink in places, after his bath, his bushy reddish-brown hair still slightly damp. He really did resemble George, if George\rquote 
s features were softened a bit. He smiled up at Angelina, rocking Rowena, who\rquote d been fretful during her bath. 
\par \'93Why the name Rufus?\'94 he had asked. 
\par \'93Ah, you think you know the reason for the name \lquote Rowena,\rquote  do you?\'94 she had asked him slyly. 
\par He\rquote d laughed. \'93I take it that means she wasn\rquote t named for Rowena Ravenclaw.\'94 
\par Angelina had shaken her head. \'93Not at all. The name \lquote Rowen\rquote  means \lquote red-haired.\rquote  So does the feminine form, \lquote Rowena.\rquote  But we didn\rquote t want to name one of them \lquote Rowen\rquote  and one of them \lquote 
Rowena.\rquote  It so happens that Rufus also means \lquote red-haired.\rquote \'94 
\par Harry had laughed. \'93That Weasley hair does have a way of cropping up, doesn\rquote t it?\'94 
\par She\rquote d shrugged. \'93We reckoned that even if their hair was more brown than red they were good names. Twin names should sound well together. I quite like the sound of \lquote Rufus and Rowena.\rquote \'94 
\par Harry had nodded. \'93It\rquote s good. Coming down to the party?\'94 
\par She\rquote d shaken her head, gazing down into Rowena\rquote s little face as she yawned and stretched her little arms, tiny fists flailing in the air. \'93My party is right here,\'94 she\rquote d said dreamily, leaning down to press 
her lips against the soft buttery cheek. 
\par Harry held Ginny closer to him as they danced, his face buried in her hair; he\rquote d been afraid that he\rquote d never hold her like this again, and now, here they were, dancing in the drawing room of his home. In a way. He 
gazed down at her and remembered Percy\rquote s vows; he knew just what he meant now. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Ginny\rquote s my home,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 he thought, gathering her to him again as a new song emanated from the wireless. 
\par After a few more songs, the news came on, being reported by a woman with a cul
tured voice that was not unlike what Harry was accustomed to hearing on the BBC. Percy was about to turn the wireless off, but he stopped when he heard what the report was about: 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 The Ministry of Magic has announced that a daring rescue mission headed by 
Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore has been successful in retrieving the Aurors who went missing after the Death Eaters convicted in the Gringotts siege were transported to Azkaban. Minister Fudge is overjoyed at Dumbledore\rquote s success.}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Fudge\rquote s voice was heard now, saying, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Everything went as planned. We regret that we needed to tell the relatives of our brave Aurors that nothing was being done for the moment, but it was necessary for security reasons that news of the mission not reach the wrong ears, if 
you know what I mean. I always had the utmost confidence in Albus and knew that if anyone could do it, he could.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93Liar!\'94 Harry cried indignantly. Ginny clutched at his arm, looking worried. 
\par The woman\rquote s voice returned. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 The returned Aurors are being debr
iefed now and should be back to work after a short holiday to regain their strength and visit with their families. Casualty lists will be released shortly. In a controversial move, Dumbledore included Hogwarts students on the mission, namely Head Boy, Har
ry Potter, and Head Girl, Hermione Granger, who are both to receive the Order of Merlin, an unheard of honor for a wizard and witch still in school....}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Hermione looked up, frowning. \'93Why isn\rquote t she mentioning Ron?\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Hogwarts instructors Sirius Black and Severus Snape were also part of the mission. Relatives of missing Aurors should send owls to the Ministry for more information.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 

\par When the music started again, they looked at each other, stunned. There was nothing about Ron, nothing about him, Sirius and Sn
ape receiving the Order of Merlin; nothing about the dementors being loose and the prisoners having been freed by the Death Eaters (such as Lucius Malfoy); nothing about the purpose to which the missing Swedish Short-Snouts had been put; and finally, noth
ing about Azkaban being destroyed. There was also nothing about whether Remus Lupin would be declared innocent and cleared of all charges. Harry was feeling very much like throttling Cornelius Fudge. 
\par He put his arms around Ginny and resumed dancing with her a bit stiffly, feeling somewhat distracted by the news report; he watched Ron and Hermione carefully. Ron\rquote 
s face was dark with anger, but also a kind of resignation. When he and Hermione left the drawing room, Harry was worried and followed after a minute, Ginny holding his hand. 
\par To his surprise, he found them in the large entrance hall, standing about six feet apart, doing }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 kata}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . Ron\rquote 
s jaw looked like he was clenching it, but gradually, as he swept his arms in a slow dance identical to Hermione\rquote 
s, lifting his legs in exaggerated kicks and turning with pinpoint precision, he began to relax and the red light left his eye. Finally, he and Hermione finished and closed their eyes, bowing deeply, and Ron looked up and acknowledged Harry\rquote 
s and Ginny\rquote s presence for the first time. He seemed }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 much}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  calmer. 
\par \'93You all right, Ron?\'94 Harry asked uncertainly. His best friend nodded, taking a deep breath. 
\par \'93I\rquote m fine now. There are just times I have to remind myself that I can\rquote t stop every idiot in the world from having anti-werewolf prejudices. I\rquote d go mad trying. I\rquote 
m not going to let it get to me. I used to be one of those idiots after all, and think how thick }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 my}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  skull is,\'94 he added with a smile. \'93
I never expected to get the Order of Merlin at all, let alone while still a student. If they don\rquote t want to honor a werewolf, there\rquote s not much I can do about it.\'94 
\par Harry remembered the unfairness of Ron not being able to play professional Quidditch, and now this. He looked at his best friend grimly, thinking, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 But maybe I can do something about it.}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  He didn\rquote t say anything though, not really having any idea how he would push for Ron to be recognized for what he\rquote 
d done. Hermione looked at him pleadingly and he nodded at her; they seemed to be in agreement that something needed to be done. 
\par \'93Don\rquote t look like that, Harry!\'94 Ron said, slapping him on the back. \'93Let\rquote s all go back to the others. I\rquote m over it, really. It\rquote s just a stupid little award. It\rquote s not important to me.\'94 
\par But as he watched Ron square his shoulders and walk back to the drawing room with Hermione, he remembered the boy who had looked into the Mirror of Erised and crowed, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I\rquote m Head Boy!...I\rquote 
m wearing the badge like Bill used to--and I\rquote m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup--I\rquote m Quidditch captain, too!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par And yet, Ron was the one who had the strength of mind not to return to the mirror when Harry had not been able to resist. Somehow, Harry had a feeling that if Voldemort had tempted Ron with }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 his}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  deepest desire, Ron wouldn\rquote t have fallen for it. 
\par He hugged Ginny to him as they returned to the drawing room, and she looked up at him shrewdly. \'93You have something planned, don\rquote t you?\'94 she said softly. He grinned down at her. 
\par \'93Not exactly. I plan to have something planned. Does that count?\'94 
\par She kissed his cheek softly. \'93You\rquote re a very good friend, Harry. I do hope Ron appreciates you.\'94 
\par He nodded. \'93He does. That\rquote s why I plan to have a plan. Ron shouldn\rquote t be shut out in the cold. I just don\rquote t know what the plan }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 is}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  yet.\'94 
\par \'93Well, we\rquote ll have to spend some more time dancing. I\rquote ve heard that helps the thought processes.\'94 
\par He gave her a lopsided smile. \'93You have?\'94 he asked, holding her more tightly. 
\par \'93Well, no, but I want you to dance with me some more, so I\rquote m trying to give you a good excuse,\'94 she laughed. 
\par Harry would have been co
ntent to dance with Ginny all night (and he did indeed have the beginning of a plan in his head after all of the dancing), but by midnight, Hermione was reminding him, Ron and Ginny that they had to return to Hogwarts in the morning and needed to get some
 rest. There was some scrambling required for rooms, as the spare room next to George and Angelina\rquote 
s had become a nursery, and the next one over was already being used by Madam Pomfrey, who joined the party briefly, but largely seemed to be wanting to retur
n to the nursery to help Angelina with the babies. Angelina also came downstairs for just a few minutes, looking very tired but happy. 
\par Percy and Katie were in Percy\rquote s room, of course, and Sirius and Sam were using Lee\rquote s, as he was still on a trip. Fred, g
rumbling a bit, offered his room to Maggie, trying to ignore that it seemed to be a certainty that Snape would be in there as well. Harry reckoned that he and Ron would share the same room they had when they\rquote 
d stayed over before the Quidditch match at Hogwarts during the summer, and that Ginny and Hermione would both be in what he thought of as \lquote his\rquote  old room. He wasn\rquote t certain where Fred was going to be, as he couldn\rquote 
t picture him sharing with Madam Pomfrey (although the thought made him want to laugh out loud). 
\par Harry and Ginny were standing outside her room and he was pulling her to him, kissing her good night, when he was startled by a finger poking his shoulder. It was Ron. \'93Don\rquote t you think you\rquote ve done enough of that today?\'94 
\par Harry raised his eyebrows at him. \'93Do you think you\rquote ve snogged Hermione enough today?\'94 he retorted, gesturing at Hermione with his head; she was standing further down the corridor, outside what Harry thought of as Jamie\rquote 
s room, where he and Ron would be sleeping. He looked down at Ginny and sighed, leaning over to kiss her cheek. \'93I reckon what Ron\rquote s trying to say is that it\rquote s time to say good night.\'94 
\par She smiled and kissed him lightly on the chin. \'93Good night, Harry,\'94 she said, gently slipping her hands out of his and turning to walk toward Hermione. 
\par \'93Erm,\'94 he began awkwardly. \'93Where are you going, Ginny? This is your room--\'94 
\par But then he turned and saw, to his surprise, that a sign had been created and hung on the door; it bore a simple script legend which read, \'93Harry\rquote s Room.\'94 
\par He turned to her, unable to say anything. \'93But--but you like this room so much--\'94 he started to say. She shook her head, smiling shyly. 
\par \'93It\rquote s your room now, Harry, any time you stay here. It\rquote s official.\'94 
\par Harry raised his hand to the simple sign, slowly tracing the letters with his finger, his throat feeling very tight. \'93Thank you,\'94 he said with feeling. 
\par \'93And }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 now}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 Ron said, clapping a hand onto his shoulder, making him wince; \'93you won\rquote t be wandering into the wrong room in the middle of the night after goin
g to the loo, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 will you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par Harry laughed. \'93No, that\rquote s true.\'94 The girls laughed and said goodnight again from the other end of the corridor before going into the room they were sharing. Just as Harry was about to turn the knob and enter \lquote his\rquote 
 room, another large red-haired figure pushed between him and the door, opening it before he had the chance. 
\par \'93Awfully good of you to let me stay with you blokes tonight,\'94 Fred said cheerfully. He crossed the room and patted the cushioned window-seat. \'93This\rquote ll suit me. I don\rquote t need anything more. You two take the bed, I\rquote 
ll be just fine.\'94 To Harry\rquote s surprise, Fred stretched out on the large window-seat--which actually had room to spare. Harry and Ron smirked at each other. Fred was probably going to want to burn the mattres
s in his bedroom in the morning, Harry thought, but he didn\rquote t dare say anything. 
\par His exhaustion finally catching up with him, Harry lay down on the large bed, closest to the door, and Ron undressed and stretched out on the other half, snoring loudly withi
n seconds, it seemed. Fred was also quickly making very loud buzzing noises (Harry had forgotten how filled with snoring the Burrow had been on summer mornings when he was younger.) But even though he was thinking grumpily that he\rquote 
d never fall asleep with that racket, he was soon completely unaware of their noise as he drifted into a deep sleep.

Harry felt the mattress shift as Ron rose; he was vaguely aware of his best friend padding to the door, and hearing the door open and shut. He had started to drift off again when the door opened once more and light footsteps moved toward the bed. Ron laid
 down again, but he wasn\rquote t making the mattress tip quite so much as before. Harry opened his left eye a very small amount, seeing red hair before him. He closed his eyes again. 
\par He wasn\rquote t sure how many minutes later it was that he heard a strange whistling sound and his eyes flew open as he realized that when he\rquote d seen the red hair, it had been }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 long}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  red hair. He reached out and touched her shoulder. 
\par \'93Ginny,\'94 he whispered. The whistling continued and Harry shook her shoulder slightly. \'93Ginny,\'94 he said a litt
le louder. She rolled onto her back and sleepily opened her eyes. Harry was finding it hard to breathe. He brushed some hair from her eyes and her hand drifted up to his face, brushing over his stubble. He looked into her dark eyes, growing larger and lar
g
er as he lowered his face toward hers. She brought her other hand up to the other side of his face, guiding his lips to hers. He let her control the kiss. There was a rushing noise in his ears; she gently opened her mouth and he felt her soft lips under h
is, her smooth skin under his fingers. He slid his arm around her waist, pulling her closer to him, even though it could never really be close enough. 
\par He couldn\rquote t believe they were in bed together at last. Her hands slid down from his face gradually, her f
ingers moving sinuously, like a slow trickle of water flowing over his shoulders, his arms, his back. As usual, he had gone to bed in nothing but his boxers and Sandy around his left upper arm, although he was also wearing the amulet now. The sensations f
l
owing from her fingers were inflaming him; all of his skin felt extraordinarily sensitive to her touch, and he moved his mouth to her soft neck, stifling his cry of surprise when her slim, agile fingers continued down to the small of his back and then sli
pped quickly under the fabric of his boxers. 
\par He licked his way up her neck and over her chin, then into her mouth again, and she opened it wide, welcoming him. He shivered under her delicate caresses, which were having a more profound effect upon him than 
he thought possible. She was barely touching him, her fingers merely making glancing repeated contact with his skin. He moaned into her mouth because of what her hands were doing and brought one of his hands around to her front, covering her right breast 
through her borrowed night dress; now she was making a gurgling noise in the back of her throat, and he could feel the hard tip under his palm, through the thin fabric. 
\par He lifted his face from hers after delicately kissing her lips, her cheeks, her nose. He gazed into eyes that looked black as a moonless night and whispered, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I love you, Ginny}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 
\par \'93I love you, Harry,\'94 she said without hesitation. She kept one hand under the fabric of his boxers, and with the other she pushed between his shoulder blades, gent
ly but insistently, and he lowered his mouth to hers again. Under his hand, he could feel her chest rising and falling more rapidly; he removed his hand from her breast, causing a small whimper of protest to disappear into his mouth. His hand crept down h
e
r stomach to her thighs, then he slowly started pulling up the fabric of the night dress until he could feel her skin beneath his fingers. He moved his hand higher under the fabric, gently tickling, glancing over the surface as she had done with him. He f
elt her breath catch in her chest, and she tensed up for a moment. Harry hesitated, wondering how mentally ready she was for all this, despite having gone to Madam Pomfrey for the potion. 
\par He moved his hand higher still, very slowly, should she feel compell
ed to put a stop to it. He would do whatever she wanted; there was never a question of anything else in his mind, even though he was reacting very strongly to both her hands and her reactions to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . She tensed up even more and gasped into his mouth. The h
and still under his boxers flattened against his skin, her warm palm making him feel that his temperature was skyrocketing. He moved his mouth down her throat at the same time that he moved his hand up; he could feeling her shivering under his touch as sh
e whispered his name. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Oh, Harry}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ....\'94 
\par He moved his mouth down to the breast that had been ignored previously; he put his mouth against the thin night dress, sending his warm breath through it to her even warmer flesh, as he continued to move his fingers. 
He could feel her entire body trembling under him, and he tried to concentrate, glancing up at her enraptured face, her eyes closed, wondering whether he\rquote d ever seen her look quite so beautiful.... 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 SNERT!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Suddenly, a loud snort met their ears, followed
 by an even louder buzzing noise. Ginny looked over at the window seat, her eyes very wide. Harry knew from the look on her face that they were both having the same thought at the same time. Pulling themselves into upright positions, they put that thought
 into words simultaneously as well. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Fred}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 !\'94 
\par Harry wasn\rquote t sure whether her face was quite that shade of red because of what they\rquote d been doing, or because of what they\rquote d been doing }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 in the same room with her brother}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . His face felt very hot, but it was the only part of him that felt that way now. Fred\rquote s snoring was like a very, very cold shower to Harry. Their double shout had apparently penetrated Fred\rquote 
s sleep-hazed mind, and he blinked and yawned, then shot straight up himself, his eyes open }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 very}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  wide now. 
\par \'93Harry! Ginny!\'94 His mouth was open as well. Harry didn\rquote t quite know what to say. Then Fred swallowed and said to her, \'93Tell me I\rquote m dreaming and you\rquote re Ron, not my little sister in bed with Harry.\'94 
\par \'93Erm, Fred,\'94 Ginny began, biting her lip; \'93you see--\'94 
\par Fred covered both of his eyes with his hands. \'93No! }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 No no no no no}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ! I definitely do }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

\par \'93Fred!\'94 Ginny implored. \'93We both have our clothes on!\'94 
\par Fred peeked out between two fingers. \'93Harry doesn\rquote t!\'94 
\par \'93Boxers!\'94 Harry said quickly, moving the sheet out of the way so Fred could see one of the legs; he certainly didn't want Fred to see more than that, as it would have been quite incriminating. \'93And a snake!\'94 he added, pointing at his arm. \'93
Speaking of which--you couldn't have }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 said}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  something, Sandy?\'94 he hissed at her. Ginny had said she'd been so \'93chatty\'94
 while he was gone. She slowly opened her eyes and regarded him sleepily. 
\par \'93Unlike some people, I speak when I have something to say,\'94 she responded, before closing her eyes again. 
\par \'93Is that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 all}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 Fred said indignantly, ignoring Harry and Sandy's hissed exchange. \'93Oh, then }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that\rquote s}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  all right. My sister\rquote s wearing an almost transparent night dress,\'94 he said, followed by Ginny bring the sheet up to cover her chest; \'93and }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you\rquote re}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  wearing boxers. Oh, well, that\rquote s }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 much better}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Nothing}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

\par Still clutching the sheet to her front, Ginny drew herself up, kneeling on the bed, her face reddening with anger now. \'93Now, you listen to me, Alfred Weasley. Sooner or later }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 something\rquote s}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  going to happen. You\rquote re just going to have to learn to live with it. I\rquote m not a little girl anymore. I love Harry and he loves me.\'94 
\par Fred rolled his eyes. \'93It\rquote s not that--well, it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 is}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  that I don\rquote t want to think of my sister in bed with anyone, because that\rquote 
s like--well, eating one of those dung-flavored Bertie Bott\rquote s Beans. Only worse. You know what I mean. And I know you\rquote re not a little girl. I know Maggie isn\rquote t either, but that doesn\rquote t mean 
I want to think about her and Snape in my bed--\'94 Fred made a dreadful face. \'93Oh, rot. Now I\rquote ve thought of it. Thanks a lot.\'94 Harry laughed, but stifled it quickly when Fred gave him a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 look}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . \'93Can\rquote t you at least sleep with a shirt on, Harry?\'94 he grumbled, floundering about for another thing to complain about. 
\par \'93I never do when I can help it. Feels like I\rquote m being strangled in my sleep.\'94 He shrugged, as though this were completely out of his hands. 
\par Fred grimaced. \'93How did you get in here, anyway?\'94 he asked Ginny. \'93And where\rquote s Ron?\'94 
\par Ginny raised her eyebrows and looked quite smug. \'93For your information, this was all Ron\rquote s idea. He showed up in our room and booted me out. I asked him, \lquote What am I supposed to do, get in bed with Harry now?\rquote  And he said, \lquote 
If you like.\rquote  Which rather surprised me, but I didn\rquote t argue with him....\'94 
\par Harry smacked himself on the forehead. \'93He probably reckoned that with Fred here as a kind of chaperone, nothing was likely to happen....\'94 
\par Ginny grumbled, \'93Well, he might have mentioned it to me. I didn\rquote t know Fred was sleeping in here, and I didn\rquote t notice him when I came in. He\rquote d stopped snoring for a while, I suppose. There\rquote s a first time for everything,\'94
 she added. Fred glowered at her, then stomped to the door, looking very grim. 
\par \'93Well, there aren\rquote t going to be any first times for }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , at least not tonight,\'94 he declared. \'93I\rquote m going to get Ron back in here.\'94 
\par \'93I--wouldn\rquote t do that if I were you,\'94 Harry told him ominously. Fred stopped dead, his hand on the knob. 
\par \'93Why not?\'94 he asked suspiciously, looking at Harry through narrowed eyes. 
\par \'93Well, first off, you know his reflexes. If you invade that room quite suddenly, you\rquote re taking your life in your hands. Plus, if they\rquote re still, erm, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 doing}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 anything, I doubt that Hermione would take it well that you\rquote d be seeing her in that sort of situation, and you\rquote d also be seeing }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Ron}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  in that situation, which--\'94
 
\par \'93--is the last bloody thing I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ever}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  want to see,\'94 Fred agreed, shuddering. 
\par \'93Yes, it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 would}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  be the last thing you\rquote d see, once those two got through with you,\'94
 Ginny added, smirking. Harry laughed, not bothering to stifle it this time, even though Fred glared. 
\par \'93Come on, Fred. Go back to the window seat. We\rquote re just going to go to sleep, no need to worry. You\rquote re our chaperone. Ginny\rquote s virtue is quite safe,\'94 Harry said, trying to reassure him. 
\par Fred slumped back to his makeshift bed. \'93Yeah, nothing for the pair of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to worry about; you can just drop off to sleep, no problem. Me? I won\rquote 
t sleep another wink for the rest of the night.\'94 However, he could barely get this out before he was yawning and rubbing his eyes. 
\par \'93Why not?\'94 Ginny asked. 
\par \'93You don\rquote t think I\rquote m going to sleep on the job, do you? Now I ruddy well have to sit up all night and watch over }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 He crossed his ar
ms and glared at them. \'93You see if you like what\rquote s in your breakfast tomorrow morning,\'94 he mumbled, and Harry remembered that it was never wise to take food from one of the twins, even when they were in a good humor. 
\par \'93Suit yourself,\'94 Harry said, shrugging. \'93Now that we\rquote re both thinking about your being here, sleep is absolutely all we have in mind. That\rquote s a guarantee.\'94
 To emphasize this point, he threw himself back on his pillow and closed his eyes. Ginny curled up next to him on her left side, with her right arm across his chest. He smiled and, eyes still closed, said, \'93Good night, Ginny.\'94 
\par He felt her press her lips to his shoulder. \'93Good night, Harry.\'94 
\par There were only a few moments of silence before Fred\rquote s voice broke it again. \'93Look, why don\rquote t you sleep on the window seat, Ginny, and I\rquote ll take the bed with Harry.\'94 
\par Ginny giggled. \'93Harry\rquote s my boyfriend, Fred. Find your own.\'94 
\par Fred was sputtering now. \'93That\rquote s not what--I was just--\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Good night, Fred!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 they chorused. Harry cracked his eyes open, seeing h
er face very close to his, smiling mischievously. She kissed him quickly and put her head down again. He pulled her to him, his arm around her shoulders, and closed his eyes once more, feeling quite content despite being watched over by Fred Weasley. If, 
for now, this was what it took for him to be able sleep with Ginny in his arms, he would take it.

s End to take them back to the castle in the morning. Harry decided it would be wisest to wait to eat bre
akfast until he was in the Great Hall, well away from Fred Weasley. To his surprise, when he, Hermione and Ron walked into the Great Hall with Sirius, Snape and Maggie, most of the assembled students stood and started cheering, pounding the tables with si
l
verware and making a general ruckus. Dumbledore was back, standing at the head table clapping decorously with the other teachers, who were also standing. Harry saw Mariah, Millicent and a few other people standing at the Slytherin table, but not Draco Mal
foy, Crabbe, Goyle, Nott or Zabini. Most of the Slytherins who were standing were chanting \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Snape, Snape, Snape...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94
 as though they needed to show that they were paying tribute to him, not to the others. Obviously, the news of the mission hadn\rquote t just been on the wireless, but Harry wished he could see whether the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Prophet}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  had been more accurate than the report they\rquote d all heard the previous evening. He didn\rquote t yet know whether it was just shoddy reporting or the Ministry meddling. 
\par Sirius, Snape and Maggie made 
their way to the high table and Harry, Ron and Hermione went to the Gryffindor table, Ginny following behind. Once they were actually in reach of the other Gryffindor students, it was something of a free-for-all. Will Flitwick was grinning at Harry and pu
mping his hand, Dean and Seamus were hugging Ron and Hermione, other students, some of whom Harry only knew by sight were Gryffindors were grabbing his hand and patting his back. 
\par \'93Please, settle down everyone,\'94 Dumbledore said above the din, and, miraculously, they did. He smiled at Harry, Ron and Hermione and waved his hands at Snape, Sirius and Maggie. \'93
I am very pleased that our Head Boy and Girl were successful in their mission, as well as the Gryffindor Quidditch captain,\'94 he added, nodding at Ron, \'93an
d our Apparition and Potions Masters, as well as Miss Dougherty. I am in communication with the Ministry about when the ceremony will be held to bestow the Order of Merlin upon them, and rest assured that you all will learn of it. That is all I can say fo
r now. I believe we should let them eat their breakfasts now and wait until later,\'94 he said firmly, looking over his spectacles at the students, \'93to pump them for information. Thank you.\'94 
\par He sat again, as did all of the teachers, and a ripple of noise move
d across the Great Hall as the students all sat as well. Harry sat next to Ginny, feeling that everything just might be all right. He was back at Hogwarts, which was the first place where he\rquote 
d ever felt at home in this life, and she was by his side. He\rquote d been incredibly happy to wake up in the place he\rquote d thought of as home in his }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 other}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 life, with Ginny in his arms. Everything was coming together, it seemed. Now if only they knew what Lucius Malfoy was up to.... 
\par They had Transfiguration after breakfast, and to Harry\rquote 
s surprise, the first thing McGonagall did was to ask him to come to the front of the room. All of the other seventh years were watching and waiting, and Harry was wondering what he would have to do; he didn\rquote t remember what the homework was he sh
ould have done, and wouldn\rquote t have had any time for it anyway, as he\rquote d been out of the castle all weekend. Swallowing, he hoped he\rquote 
d be able to convincingly fake it, or at least be able to use the his brand new I-was-on-a-mission-with-Dumbledore excuse. 
\par \'93All right, Potter. Show the other students.\'94 
\par Harry looked at her uncertainly. \'93Um, show them what, ma\rquote am?\'94

\'94 
\par She nodded. \'93I understand that,\'94 she said too quietly for the other students to hear. \'93He wanted to get the Aurors back as badly as you did. But now the cat\rquote s out of the bag, so to speak,\'94 she said, a rare smirk pulling at her mouth. 
\'93Time to face the music. No charges will be filed, of course; you had permission to wait to register. But now that everyone in the wizarding world knows you are an Animagus, there isn\rquote t much point to putting it off any longer, is there?\'94 

\par He nodded, understanding her point. \'93Of course.\'94 
\par \'93So,\'94 she said more loudly again, in his brisk teacher\rquote s voice. \'93Show the other students,\'94 she intoned, waving her hand at the dozens of other seventh year students filling the room. 
\par \'93Show them--?\'94 
\par \'93Your Animagus form,\'94 she said, as though he were daft. 
\par \'93Oh! Y--yes. R-right,\'94 he stammered out. 
\par \'93And then you will answer any questions they have.\'94 
\par He looked at her in alarm, then leaned in. \'93What about Hermione?\'94 
\par McGonagall spoke softly again. \'93No one knows about her, and that is how it will stay for now. You decided to let others see that you are an Animagus,\'94 she said, as though he had had much choice. \'93You are on your own, Potter.\'94 
\par He sighed, looking out over the heads of the other students. Suddenly, Draco Malfoy caught his eye. He was glaring coldly back at Harry. Harry forced his eyes away; this wasn\rquote t the time to get into a staring contest with Draco Malfoy. He\rquote 
d no doubt seen him walking up the stairs with his arm around Ginny\rquote s shoulder. 
\par He closed his eyes, not trying to rush the Transfiguration, as there was no reason to go quickly. He opened his eyes as his feet w
ere touching down on the floor, making many of the students gasp and back away. He saw that Neville was smirking at Dean and Seamus, who were looking very alarmed to see what appeared to be a full-grown lion before them. 
\par \'93I knew,\'94 he was saying smugly to them. \'93For years now! He was sleeping that way once, and I--\'94 
\par But Neville\rquote s jaw just hung open and his boasting ceased when Harry spread his wings. 
\par Harry was very glad when the bell rang. As they made their way to Defense Against the Dark Arts, Harry sighed with relief. He planned to sit well to the back of the classroom and take a break after being the center of attention in Transfiguration. 
\par However, it turned out that Mrs. Figg wanted him to spend ninety minutes discussing dementors and the effects of 
people being kissed by dementors. Hermione started shaking, tears running down her face; Harry knew she was still having trouble coping with feeling responsible for Elliot\rquote s death. Harry set his jaw stubbornly. 
\par \'93I don\rquote t think so, Professor Figg,\'94 he said to her firmly. \'93I think Ron and I should take Hermione to the hospital wing,\'94
 he declared, as Ron helped her to stand and Harry took her arm, helping her to the door. They were surprised when, before they could close the door, Draco Malfoy had run to the front of the room and declared, \'93I\rquote ll help them, Professor Figg.

\par He had slipped out the door and shut it before she had a chance to object. The three of them glared at him while he smirked at them, looking quite pleased with himself. 
\par \'93So, ducking out of class by faking a little nervous breakdown at the mention of dementors? Isn\rquote t that supposed to be Potter\rquote 
s thing, Granger? Or has Weasley taken to dressing up like a dementor when he wants some from you? That would certainly be enough to put you off dementors--\'94 
\par Harry wasn\rquote t completely certain why she decided to do it, as he only saw how enraged she was for a split second before she abruptly changed into her wolf form and leapt at him. Draco Malfoy\rquote 
s head hit the hard stone flags with a sickening thud and he stared up in wide-eyed horror at the huge grey she-wolf sitting on his chest, snarling at him, a touch of red in her eyes as she snapped her jaws mere millimeters from his nose. 
\par Harry and Ron saw him reaching for his wand, and Ron said, \'93I wouldn\rquote t, if I were you. You\rquote 
ll just set her off. See, when she bonded with some wolves over in America, she really learned how to let go of her human mind and completely take on a wolf mind. She\rquote s not really Hermione right now, except that she knows that she hates }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . You need to behave as though you really do have a murderous wolf on you and make sure you don\rquote t antagonize her,\'94
 he said calmly, while Draco Malfoy shook all over and stared up at Hermione\rquote s slavering jaws. 
\par \'93She--she\rquote s an Animagus }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 too}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 he gasped in horror. \'93But--what if--if she--\'94 
\par \'93Tries to kill rip your throat out?\'94 Harry said casually, twirling his wand as if he hadn\rquote t a care in the world. \'93Oh, I doubt she would actually do that. Well, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 probably}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  not...\'94 he added, meeting Ron\rquote s eye, which had a mischievous glint in it. 
\par \'93Get her off me!\'94 he yelled now as a low growl began emanating from Hermione\rquote s throat, her eyes never leaving his. 
\par Harry watched him squirm for a minute more, then said, \'93That\rquote s probably enough, Hermione. We don\rquote t want him to soil himself, after all. Think of the smell.\'94 
\par He grunted with pain when Hermione dug her hind paws into his thighs before leaping over his head and landing on the stone floor. She turned around and walked slowly to Harry and Ron, her careful predator\rquote s gait as men
acing as her relentless gaze. She stood between Harry and Ron, looking balefully at Draco Malfoy as Ron reached down and stroked her shaggy coat. 
\par Harry walked to Draco Malfoy and stood over him. \'93So--}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 who\rquote s}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  ducking out of Defense Against the Dark Arts, Mal
foy? Get back in there. Professor Figg may need you to explain what it\rquote s like to be initiated as a Death Eater.\'94 
\par He stood, turning pink with anger, brushing down his robes angrily and then taking his wand out of his pocket. \'93You won\rquote t get away with this, Granger,\'94
 he said ominously, but this time, she used a more traditional approach. She'd reverted to human form in the blink of an eye. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Expelliarmus}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 !\'94 she cried, having whipped out her wand. Draco Malfoy\rquote 
s wand flew out of his hand and he went hurtling backward into a narrow stone niche which might once have held a very long, thin piece of statuary, or a prized lance or pike. Draco Malfoy appeared to be wedged in the small space. Harry had never had a mor
e difficult time restraining his laughter. 
\par He grunted, trying to extricate himself and failing. Hermione carefully placed his wand on the floor about six feet away from him, then stood and crossed her arms, smirking. \'93Your wand is here whenever you want it, Malfoy. Good luck.\'94 
\par They walked away from him, hearing him grunting and groaning, trying to free himself from the niche. Ron was grinning ear to ear. 
\par \'93That was fun!\'94 he said. But when they\rquote d turned a corner, Hermione slumped against Harry, and Ron quickly helped support her. \'93Hermione?\'94 he said gently, looking at her with concern. She raised her eyes to them both. 
\par \'93I still--I still feel like going to Madam Pomfrey for a little something,\'94 she said softly. \'93I need--I need to feel better for longer than it takes to humiliate Draco Malfoy....\'94 
\par Ron smiled at her and kissed her brow. \'93You are rather good at it, you know,\'94 he told her, making her smile a little. 
\par \'93Yes, but--it\rquote s not a skill that would have saved Philip Elliot\rquote s life,\'94 she said quietly. Harry should have known that Hermione would want to know the Auror\rquote 
s full name. He thought of the way Elliot had just stepped off into space again and shivered. Azkaban would never again turn people into quivering bags of bones, huddled in corners, but if the d
ementors were wandering about in the world at large, people wouldn\rquote t need to be in Azkaban to experience this. However, if the Ministry didn\rquote t acknowledge that there was a problem and try to do something about it.... 
\par \'93It\rquote s just like with the Squibs,\'94 he said, thinking aloud. \'93I remember my mum saying that. The Squibs all just disappeared and no one ever did anything about it....\'94 He stopped and looked at Ron and Hermione. \'93
You can go with her to see Madam Pomfrey, right?\'94 
\par Ron frowned. \'93Well, sure. But where are you going?\'94 
\par \'93To see Myrtle. I still haven\rquote t asked her about the Squibs.\'94 
\par Ron and Hermione both exchanged knowing glances. \'93Ah, off to cheat on Ginny?\'94 Ron said merrily. 
\par Harry was also laughing now. \'93Temporarily, if Myrtle will have me. I wonder whether she\rquote s over her disappointment at my having fixed the timelines. And she wasn\rquote t thrilled about the time she found me and Hermione--\'94
 He stopped, reddening, remembering that the time he was thinking of was the night before Ron\rquote s sixteenth birthday, in the prefect\rquote s bathroom. He saw that Hermione was also turning a bit pink. 
\par \'93We\rquote ll be off now,\'94 she said shortly, her voice a little higher than usual, perhaps hoping that Ron wouldn\rquote t pick up on their discomfort. \'93Good luck with Myrtle.\'94 
\par When he entered Myrtle\rquote s bathroom, as it was a very cloudy day out-of-doors, it was rather dark at first before the torches on the walls sprang to life. He didn\rquote 
t hear a sound except for some dripping water in one of the sinks and his own slow, even footsteps. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Is the passage still there that leads to the Chamber?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 he wondered. But he knew he had to focus on other things. 
\par \'93Myrtle!\'94 he called, his voice echoing on the hard surfaces of the bathroom. \'93Myrtle, it\rquote s Harry! Thought I\rquote d stop by for a visit--\'94 Did that sound convin
cing? How would he get the information he wanted out of her without it seeming like the information was the only reason for his coming? 
\par Suddenly, she came swooping through the door to one of the stalls, stopping and looking enraptured at first, clapping her ghostly hands together and grinning, then doing an excited loop around the room. \'93You\rquote ve come! You\rquote ve come! You
\rquote ve finally come!\'94 
\par Harry felt his face growing warm. \'93Yeah, well, I--\'94 
\par \'93And just in time for Valentine\rquote s, too!\'94 she said, even more rapturously. \'93Or close enough, at least, as it was just a couple of days ago!\'94 
\par Harry swallowed. \'93Erm, right. Well, how\rquote ve you been?\'94 he asked, feeling awkward. He wasn\rquote t all that certain how to chat up girls in general, despite having seen Draco do it a hundred times in his other life (he still didn\rquote 
t understand how his former best friend had that kind of nerve). He certainly wasn\rquote t clear about how he was to chat up a very sensitive ghost who had made no secret of the fact that she fancied him. 
\par \'93Oh, you know how it is\'85.The older students never come in here, and the occasional first year does something }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 unforgivably rude}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94
 she said, her voice taking on an angry edge, \'93which just means I have to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 teach them a lesson!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 Her voice rose on a shriek, and she zoomed up to t
he ceiling, around the perimeter of the room, and back down to the sinks, where she perched on the edge of a basin, suddenly quite composed again. \'93So I don\rquote t get to talk to much of anyone at all\'85\'94 
\par \'93\'85and you don\rquote t get to see people very much, unless you go to the prefects\rquote  bathroom,\'94 Harry said, smirking at her. 
\par Her jaw dropped and he wondered whether saying this was a mistake. \'93You haven\rquote t }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 told}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  anyone about that, have you?\'94
 she said, her eyes narrowing and her voice suddenly a low growl. Harry swallowed. 
\par \'93No, of course not. You--you\rquote ve got to have your hobbies, after all--\'94 He shut his mouth quickly then, as he wasn\rquote t sure this was the right thing to say again. 
\par She looked at him suspiciously, crossing her arms. \'93Why are you here? Really?\'94 
\par He drew his lips into a line; \'93I have to be honest with you, Myrtle. I need some information.\'94 
\par She swooped carelessly about the bathroom, moaning. \'93And what information would }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  have that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 could possibly need?\'94 
\par \'93Well--it\rquote s about my other life,\'94 he said slowly. She 
stopped in mid-air and charged at him, stopping abruptly when she was an inch away from his nose, making him feel like his heart had stopped. She was very close now, and he was shivering violently from the cold emanating from her. 
\par \'93Yes,\'94 she said in a low, angry voice. \'93I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 liked}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  that world, and }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you\rquote ve}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 taken that away from me.\'94 
\par \'93Well, I was wondering,\'94 he said, trying to avoid squeaking. \'93Did you see what happened when Argus Filch disappeared? How did the Death Eaters get into the castle to take him? And what did they do with the Squibs once they had them?\'94
 He would have thought that the Death Eaters would have been ordered to kill them, but then that didn\rquote t explain why Buttercup was in Azkaban. 
\par She grinned knowingly, flying about his head in dizzying circles. \'93Ah, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that\rquote s}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  what you want to know. I see. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 That\rquote s}{

 Myrtle wailed, rushing up to the ceiling and circling about before swooping down and abruptly bringing herself face to face with Harry. \'93Do you want to know what happened to the Squibs?\'94 
\par He nodded, biting his lip. \'93Very much. I would really appreciate it, Myrtle.\'94 
\par She looked smug. \'93Well, the next time you need information, come to me }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 first}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , not to that full-of-herself Ravenclaw ghost. Not that Ravenclaws know anything about }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 people}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , either. Noses always buried in books,\'94 she sniffed. 
\par \'93Um, Myrtle,\'94 he hesitated; \'93Squibs?\'94 
\par \'93Oh, yes. The Squibs. Well, you wanted to know how the Death Eaters got into the castle to get at Filch?\'94 Harry nodded anxiously. She smiled and shook her ghostly head. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 They didn\rquote t}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 she said mysteriously, clearly enjoying his confused reaction. 
\par Harry frowned. \'93Did they get him when he was shopping then? Or on holiday?\'94
 But the thought of Filch going anywhere on holiday was a very strange one; he tried to picture him at the seaside, or going on long walks in the country to do some bird-watching, or gazing
 at art in museums. Nothing seemed quite right; as far as he could tell, Filch had only one purpose in life--to terrorize the students of Hogwarts. He couldn\rquote t picture him ever leaving the castle. 
\par \'93No, he was fetched when he was here working at Hogwarts,\'94 she said tantalizingly. \'93But it wasn\rquote t Death Eaters who took him.\'94 She paused, taking in his shock with evident glee. 
\par \'93It wasn\rquote t Death Eaters?\'94 he said, perplexed. \'93Is that why they couldn\rquote t work out who\rquote d done it? It was someone else entirely? Then who?\'94 
\par Her smile became more and more wicked. \'93I remember when they came to arrest you,\'94 she said dreamily, floating up above the stalls now. Harry tried to remain patient, but it was difficult. \'93
I remember those two who took you away....the parents of that boy who likes the plants so much....\'94 
\par \'93Likes plants? You mean Neville? Oh, right. The Longbottoms arrested me. That\rquote s what you remember.\'94 
\par She nodded, sitting comfortably on the ceiling. \'93The same ones came for }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 
\par His face dropped, disappointed. \'93Oh. So Filch did something to get himself arrested and the Longbottoms came and got him?\'94 He\rquote d been so close. \'93Drat. I didn\rquote t realize that. I had hoped that he\rquote 
d disappeared in the same way as all of the other Squibs....\'94 
\par She zoomed down to look him in the eye. \'93Oh, but he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 did}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 
\par He froze. \'93You mean--\'94 He couldn\rquote t process it. \'93Do you mean that the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Ministry}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 took the Squibs away? That the Longbottoms just stood there and tried to tell my mum that they cared about finding out what had happened to the Squibs and }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 they}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 were what happened to the Squibs?\'94 He realized suddenly that he was shaking with impotent rage; it was truly impotent, though, because he was angry with people who had never done that in this world, people sitting in a mental ward at St. Mungo\rquote 
s, unable to remember anything, including their son\rquote 
s face, for more than a few minutes at a stretch. Then, recalling who the Minister of Magic had been in his other life, he realized that this decision had probably been made by Barty Crouch, who was dead in the wor
ld that had come to life again when Harry had fixed the timelines. There was no one to blame, no one against whom to retaliate. 
\par \'93Where did they take them?\'94 
\par \'93Oooh,\'94 she said, enjoying making him wait for his information. \'93I was curious about that too. So I followed Argus very quietly. I reckoned the Ministry would never find out; they only told me that I couldn\rquote t haunt Olive Hornby anymore.
\'94 She sniffed, sounding a bit miffed, but Harry was looking at her attentively, so she continued. \'93It was a kind of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 camp.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 Up in the mountains. The Ministry told them it was for their protection.\'94 
\par \'93Like the werewolf camps!\'94 he cried. \'93Myrtle! I cold kiss you!\'94 He couldn\rquote t, of course, but she looked quite pleased that he should say so. \'93But--do you have any idea how someone who\rquote 
d been in one of those camps would end up in Azkaban?\'94 
\par She shrugged. \'93The same way that anyone ended up there, probably. He must have committed a crime.\'94 
\par Harry paced, wracking his brains. What could Roger Davies\rquote s cousin have done? But then he realized he knew. He had probably done what Harry would do in a similar situation. He looked up at Myrtle. \'93
Did you ever hear of anyone trying to escape from the Squib camp? Did you stick around there for very long?\'94 
\par \'93Not }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 very}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  long, but now that you mention it, I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 did}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  hear of an attempted escape....\'94 
\par \'93And? And? Did the person get sent to Azkaban?\'94 
\par She shrugged. \'93I\rquote m sorry, Harry. I don\rquote t know. Honestly. I\rquote m not just saying that,\'94 she said simply, looking genuinely sad. 
\par But he was grinning ear to ear at her. \'93I know you\rquote d tell me if you knew for sure, Myrtle,\'94 he said warmly. \'93Thanks so much for everything. You don\rquote t know how helpful you\rquote ve been....\'94 
\par As he turned to leave, she sighed, \'93Yes, leave now that you have what you came for....\'94 
\par He paused at the door and said, \'93Tell you what, Myrtle. I\rquote ll come back later and do some of my homework here. Keep you company some more, all right?\'94 
\par She rushed at him, stopping abruptly a couple of feet away. \'93You promise?\'94 
\par He grinned. \'93I promise,\'94 he said, meaning it, as he wanted to find out whether there were a lot of other things she knew about that other world. He waved to her as he left.

Just then, the great heavy door slowly opened and a tall man in his twenties entered. They all turned toward him, and Harry saw the immediate reaction from Hermione and Ginny. A handsome man with short, dark hair curl
ing tightly against his head, he was recognizably Mariah\rquote s brother, with the same large brown selkie eyes, almost no white around them. He otherwise didn\rquote t look especially remarkable to Harry; the girls\rquote 
 reaction to him, however, seemed to be to go weak at the knees; their eyes looked rather glazed over as he strode toward his sister with concern. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Mariah!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 he cried, taking his sister in his arms, hugging her quickly. She sobbed on him. 
\par \'93Munro,\'94 she managed to say through her tears, \'93what }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 happened}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par He looked very grim, glancing around at the others. When he met Hermione\rquote s and Ginny\rquote s eyes, they looked like they just might swoon, and Harry was feeling more than a little irritated. He could tell that Ron was as well. 
\par \'93Before you do anything else,\'94 he said with an edge to his voice, \'93could you turn off the selkie charm a bit? You\rquote re--distracting them,\'94
 he said to Munro Kirkner, motioning to Ginny and Hermione, who was gazing at him much as she had gazed at Gilderoy Lockhart in her second year. 
\par He looked up, startled. \'93Oh, er, sorry.\'94 He glanced at his sister. \'93How mainy people know aboot--?\'94 
\par \'93They\rquote re me frainds, Munro. They }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 know}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 
\par He looked resigned to this, but not particularly happy. \'93Waill, thain they can hear what I need t\rquote taill ye.\'94 He swallowed, holding her shoulders, shaking a little. \'93Lucius Malfoy didnae jest kill our dad an\rquote  take our mum,\'94
 he said slowly. \'93He--he also took yer }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 skin}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 
\par Mariah cried out and collapsed, and Draco went to her, holding her closely, looking very concerned. Mariah was shaking her head, her eyes so wide Harry could actually see a little white around the darkness. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 No, no, no, no, no....}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94

\par Harry drew his lips into a line. \'93Don\rquote t you remember, Ron? If you steal a selkie\rquote s skin, you can make her do anything you want.\'94 Hermione came to stand with them, putting her arms around Ron\rquote 
s waist; he smoothed her hair affectionately. They were all feeling very shaken. 
\par Harry looked fearfully at Mariah Kirkner, being rocked in Draco Malfoy\rquote s arms. Ginny crouched by her side as well, rubbing her back, sympathetic tears running down her face. She had been expecting to be Lucius Malfoy\rquote 
s target, but instead it was Mariah. Harry looked at the three of them, shaking his head. 
\par \'93Lucius Malfoy was never planning to go after Ginny,\'94 he said softly to Hermione and Ron. \'93We thought he meant }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 her}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  when he said he was going to get his son\rquote

\par Ron and Hermione watched Harry pace the length of Sirius\rquote  sitting room as Sirius finished writing a letter at a desk tucked into a corner. 
\par \'93Where are you going to look for him?\'94 
\par Sirius paused in his writing. \'93Drat! A blot.\'94 He took out his wand to fix it. \'93I don\rquote t know yet, Harry. I\rquote m trying to write to the other operatives, some of whom are in places where they cannot be reached by Floo.\'94
 He waved his hand at some other rolled bits of parchment on the desk. \'93So if you don\rquote t mind....\'94 Sirius went on writing. 
\par Hermione burrowed into Ron\rquote s arms on the couch before the fire, her eyes large and worried. Ron held her tightly as though someone would steal her away next. Harry paced some more. 
\par \'93What will you do to him when you find him?\'94 
\par Sirius sighed and looked up at Harry. \'93That rather depends upon our reception, don\rquote t you think?\'94 He bent over the letter again. 
\par Harry frowned. \'93What\rquote s that supposed to mean? If he offers you tea and crumpets everything is okay?\'94 
\par Sirius sighed again as he put his quill down. \'93Do you want me to finish writing this letter or not, Harry?\'94 
\par Harry swallowed. \'93I\rquote m sorry. It\rquote s just that--he can make her do anything he wants with that selkie skin. It\rquote s not like someone who\rquote s placed under Imperius. You can fight Imperius. This is her }{

\par Then he realized that that was exactly why Slytherin chose the 
curse that he did. It was his revenge. The woman he was going to marry had made him feel that he had no choice but to be in love with her, and when she broke his heart he turned her into a selkie, not just a seal, because if someone else had the skin, }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 she\rquote d}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  know what it was like to have to do things against her will, which was how she had made him feel.... 
\par He explained this theory to Ron and Hermione. Sirius was thoroughly distracted now. \'93What are you going on about, Harry?\'94 
\par \'93
Mariah told Harry the story of how her family was cursed by Salazar Slytherin himself, so that all of the children in each generation are selkies, but only the daughters pass it on....The first one he cursed was his fiancee, whose twin sister married Godr
ic Gryffindor,\'94 Hermione said in a breathless rush. 
\par \'93They were Muggles,\'94 Harry said, nodding. \'93And after that, Slytherin tried to get the school to stop taking Muggle-borns, and he wasn\rquote t thrilled about Gryffindor, either, since his fiancee had fallen for him.\'94 
\par Sirius looked at Harry thoughtfully. \'93Twin sister married Gryffindor, you say? Muggle?\'94 He stared into space, his quill poised over his parchment. \'93Hmmm...There\rquote 
s something I read in a book when I was young....Or maybe it was a story my mum told me....I don\rquote t remember anything about selkies, but there was something about Gryffindor\rquote s wife...\'94 
\par \'93Well, Rowena Ravenclaw\rquote s son married the sister of Gryffindor\rquote s illegitimate son, the one who was born to the other sister. Which means that Mariah\rquote s family is descended from one of the founders, Ravenclaw herself.\'94 
\par \'93Huh,\'94 Sirius said, as though he wasn\rquote t paying this much heed. \'93Right. Ravenclaw married a Muggle by the name of--damn, now I can\rquote t remember that either...\'94 
\par Hermione brightened. \'93Perhaps it\rquote s in the library?\'94 She looked anxious for something useful to do. Ron looked sympathetically at her. 
\par \'93Right. I could help you look for it, if you like,\'94 he said quickly. 
\par Sirius signed his letter with a flourish and rolled it up. \'93If it is, it\rquote ll be in the Rest
ricted Section. I think they started that section of the library as far back as when the Founders themselves were still running the school. Their diaries and journals are in there, in addition to early class registers, timetables, you know the sort of thi
ng.\'94 
\par Hermione frowned. \'93Why would those things be in the Restricted Section? And why didn\rquote t they just include all of that information in }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Hogwarts, A History}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par Sirius shook his head. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Hogwarts, A History}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  was first written centuries ago, specifically to be a gloss on what really goes on here. It\rquote 
s updated every fifty years or so by someone approved by the school governors to continue to present an impeccable image to the wizarding world. No, the real dirt on the school history has been shunted into the Restricted Section for years, Hermione. Don
\rquote t trust all of the sanitized claptrap you read in }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Hogwarts, A History.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Hermione looked highly offended. \'93I know not to do that. I told Harry and Ron }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 years}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  ago that it just glossed over the less savory parts of the school\rquote 
s history, in that there\rquote s nothing in over a thousand pages about the house elves who\rquote ve been enslaved here,\'94 she said with a sniff. 
\par Ron put his arm around her shoulders. \'93Well, seeing as we can\rquote t get what we need elsewhere, we\rquote ll definitely have to check out the Restricted Section.\'94 He smiled at her, clearly hoping this would cheer her up. 
\par Instead, she crossed her arms grumpily. \'93Yes, but even though I\rquote m Head Girl, I don\rquote t have carte blanche to just skip into the Restricted Section and browse through the stacks for hours on end.\'94
 Harry wondered how she knew this; had she bothered Madam Pince about this before? He imagined that this would be her ultimate fantasy. 
\par Ron shrugged. \'93Didn\rquote t say you did. Sirius will give you a pass, though, won\rquote t you Sirius? You\rquote re a teacher,\'94 Ron reminded him, raising his eyebrows. 
\par Sirius hesitated a moment, then nodded. \'93All right.\'94 He signed and waved the letter he\rquote d written. \'93I should get this up to the Owlery before I go.\'94 
\par Hermione had hastily scribbled out a note for her to show Madam Pince; Harry watched her write, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I give Hermione Granger permission to research the marriages of the Founders in the Restricted Section.}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  She thrust it at him. \'93I just need your signature.\'94 
\par Sirius glanced at it quickly, then scribbled his name across the bottom. \'93She\rquote ll probably wonder, of course, what the Apparition teacher is doing having you look this up, especially as you have your license and aren\rquote 
t my student anymore, but hopefully she won\rquote t think about those things....Well done, though, Hermione. You\rquote ve made it specific enough that she won\rquote t think you\rquote re just on a fishing expedition for, say, potions you shouldn
\rquote t know how to make....\'94 
\par She went beet red while Sirius winked at her and Harry and Ron laughed, remembering the Polyjuice
 Potion in their second year. Hermione and Ron left the staff wing to go to the library, and Sirius was about to go back through the tapestry in order to have some school owls deliver his notes, but Harry put his hand on his arm to stop him. 
\par \'93Sirius--can I ask you something else? Are you going to be leaving the castle at all to see anyone?\'94 
\par Sirius nodded. \'93Yes. Some of our operatives are pretending to live as Muggles; I don\rquote t want anyone seeing owls flying to their hiding places. Why?\'94 
\par \'93Well, if you happen to be down in Surrey, could you--could you find out how my uncle is? Based on the last letter he sent me, I don't think he\rquote s getting on very well without Aunt Petunia. When did you see her last?\'94 
\par Sirius thought about this. \'93Not too long ago, although obviously before we went to Azkaban. She was all right; very excited about Jeffries\rquote 
 upcoming event. In Muggle villages and especially the larger cities there are notices all over the bollards about it, and in every shop window you can imagine. It\rquote s on the radio and telly as well, and in every paper. It\rquote 
s also on our Wireless and in the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Daily Prophet}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
. Jeffries is all over the international press as well; people will be traveling from around the world for this, wizard and Muggle. It\rquote s going to be huge.\'94 
\par Harry frowned. \'93Doesn\rquote t that worry you? It sounds as though it\rquote s really getting out of control. That many people in one place, wizards and Muggles mingling...\'94 
\par Sirius shrugged. \'93The Ministry doesn\rquote t restrict wizards from going to Muggle events, you know, Harry. If wizards want to go see Manchester United play or attend Wimbledon or go to a concert at the Royal Albert Hall, they\rquote 
ve every right. The wizards just aren\rquote t supposed to let the Muggles see them doing magic. As long as that restriction is observed, there shouldn\rquote t be any trouble.\'94 
\par Harry was unconvinced of this, given the way the wizards at the Quidditch World Cup couldn\rquote t resist \'93showing off,\'94 as Mr. Weasley liked to put it. He was still troubled. \'93But what about the Ministry? Do they realize that Jeff
ries might actually doing magic, of a sort? Does they know that Jeffries seems to have acquired this power from Voldemort, and that he turned my aunt into a witch?\'94 
\par Sirius put his hand on Harry\rquote s shoulder. \'93Now you\rquote re onto Jeffries again. I thought you wanted me to check in on your uncle?\'94 
\par Harry grimaced. \'93On second thought, he\rquote d probably slam the door in your face.\'94 But then he had a thought, and he brightened considerably. \'93But perhaps you could go to see the vicar, or Dr. Forbes. Or both; if you don\rquote t 
find Dr. Forbes in his surgery, he might be at the vicarage, playing chess with Mr. Babcock. Maybe you can talk one of them into checking on him, making sure he\rquote s getting on all right...\'94 
\par Sirius laughed. \'93Since when do you care about Vernon Dursley?\'94 
\par Harry swallowed. \'93Well, if it weren\rquote t for me, he wouldn\rquote t be all alone, would he? Without my aunt and Dudley.\'94 Harry sighed. \'93I wonder if this was exactly what he was worried about when I was young, that if they didn\rquote 
t stamp the magic out of me he\rquote d end up
 alone. I mean, he was always a lot more insistent about it than my aunt. She and Dudley thought he was a complete nutter the way we were driving across the country and backtracking to avoid my Hogwarts letters. And it was his idea to lock me in my room a
nd put bars on the windows, and to tell people that I go to St. Brutus\rquote  Center for Incurably Criminal Boys.\'94 
\par Sirius guffawed, but was quelled by a look from Harry. \'93Sorry. I\rquote ll go see your Mr. Babcock and Dr. Forbes, Harry. Perhaps one or both of them can check in on your uncle and make certain he\rquote s all right.\'94 
\par After Sirius was gone, Harry walked down the corridor toward Maggie\rquote s rooms, where Ginny, Draco Malfoy, Mariah and Munro Kirkner were. Maggie herself was there as well, and Snape, who nodded at Harry when he slipped in the door. 
\par \'93Sirius has sent letters off to some of the operatives and is going to visit others in person. Lucius Malfoy will be tracked down, don\rquote t you worry, Mariah,\'94 he tried to reassure her. Draco Malfoy had his arm around her and Mariah\rquote 
s eyes were a bit bloodshot. Snape stepped forward with a steaming goblet and held it out for Mariah. 
\par \'93Miss Kirkner,\'94 he said stiffly, \'93drink this. It will help you to rest.\'94 
\par She looked up at her head-of-house with a blank expression, then took the goblet and slowly drank it, looking a bit disoriented when she was done. \'93Oh,\'94 she said, putting her hand to her head. \'93I dinnae know how I\rquote ll get back to me dormit
\rquote ry....\'94 
\par Maggie helped her to stand. \'93You\rquote re not going anywhere. I insist that you stay here. You\rquote ve already missed your morning lessons. Professor Snape\rquote s draught will help you to rest. Don\rquote 
t worry--everything will be taken care of--\'94 
\par Ginny helped her walk Mariah to the bedroom and Harry threw himself into a chair, looking dolefully at Draco Malfoy and Mariah\rquote s brother. But it was Snape who spoke. 
\par \'93Mr. Kirkner,\'94 he said slowly to Mariah\rquote s brother, sounding more than a little suspicious. \'93Please tell us precisely what happened.\'94 
\par Munro Kirkner looked very white. \'93I--I had gone to me favorite pub after wairk.\'94 He looked a bit embarrassed. \'93It\rquote s--it\rquote s not hard to meet gairls whain--\'94 He hesitated, but Harry nodded. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
When you can turn on the selkie charm any time you want,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought. Munro had his lips pressed tightly together and continued. \'93I was at this gairl\rquote s flat all night...\'94 
\par \'93Where was this?\'94 Snape said suddenly. 
\par \'93Inverness,\'94 Munro answered quickly. \'93I dinnae want to have to go too far to gait hame in the mornin\rquote .\'94 He flushed now. \'93I\rquote m not the baist at Apparatin\rquote . Passed on me thaird try, but whain I\rquote m knackered...\'94 

\par Snape waved his hand impatiently. \'93Yes, yes. When you returned to your parents\rquote  home, what did you find?\'94 
\par His dark eyes looked wet now. \'93I--I was afraid to go inside. When I arrived in the garden--I usually do that so me mum \lquote n\rquote  dad wouldnae bump into me, nor me into thaim--I saw--saw--\'94 He swallowed. \'93The Dark Mark was over the house.
\'94 There were all silent, digesting this. After a minute he was finally able to go on. \'93I--I found me dad just inside the door, daid, with the kist in \lquote is hands, open fer all the wairld t\rquote  see...\'94 
\par Harry frowned. \'93The what?\'94 he said, perplexed. He noticed that Draco Malfoy }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 wasn\rquote t}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  looking confused. He hadn\rquote 
t said a thing said since Munro started talking. Something about the word }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  vaguely familiar
 to Harry. If he had time to think, really think, he could almost remember something from his other life.... 
\par Snape looked at them all. \'93The family treasure chest. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Kist}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , from }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 cistum}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . Box.\'94
 He turned to Munro. \'93What treasures did your family keep in there? Where was it usually hidden?\'94 
\par \'93Under the hearthstone in the kitchen. Our skins used to be in there,\'94 he said dully. \'93All three--Mum\rquote s, Mariah\rquote s and mine. I asked to take mine oot whain I finished school. I wanted ta be able to keep it with me so I could h
ave it whainaiver I wanted. That made Mum nairvous, but she agreed....An\rquote  now I\rquote m glad I did it.\'94 He withdrew what looked like a shapeless brown oilskin from inside his robes. \'93I\rquote ve still got me skin, but Mariah\rquote 
s is gone, and our mum\rquote s too. An while I sat there with me dad, hardly believin\rquote  what I was seein\rquote , I knew I should go upstairs an\rquote  look for me mum, but thain an owl flies into the open door and drops this in me lap...\'94 

\par He withdrew a parchment from his pocket and handed it to Snape, who read it silently, his eyes darting over the page. He nodded grimly. \'93Your mother was kidnapped and Lucius Malfoy took both her selkie skin and your sister\rquote s.\'94 
\par Munro Kirkner nodded miserably, his dark eyes hooded. Draco Malfoy squirmed, visibly uncomfortable. Munro looked up at Snape and said, \'93He knew. About Mariah and our mither,\'94 he said, slipping more firmly into the Orkney way of speaking. \'93
Ye can taill from the laitter. Someane told\rquote im.\'94 His eyes slid over to Malfoy\rquote s face; Draco was squirming even more. 
\par \'93I didn\rquote t tell him!\'94 he said suddenly. \'93I didn\rquote t!\'94 
\par Harry crossed his arms and narrowed his eyes. \'93Then how did he know?\'94 
\par Draco Malfoy clamped his mouth shut and wouldn\rquote t meet Harry\rquote s gaze. Harry looked at Snape, who raised one eyebrow. \'93I think you should come with me, Mr. Kirkner. Have you been to the Ministry?\'94 Mariah\rquote s brother shook his head. 
\'93This should be done properly. We will get you an appropriate escort.\'94 Snape raised his eyebrow at Harry again, as he led Munro Kirkner out of the room, and he nodded almost imperceptibly at Malfoy. Harry caught on and nodded back. 
\par He turned to Malfoy and surveyed him; he was worrying his robes with his hands, a nervous habit which did }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  make him look cool, calm and collected. \'93You care about her,\'94
 he said to him suddenly, making him jerk his head up and glare at Harry. 
\par \'93Of course I do, you prat. Why do you think I hit you after I saw the pair of you in that big oaf\rquote s hut?\'94 he spat at Harry. 
\par \'93I don\rquote t mean Ginny,\'94 Harry said quickly, although he was surprised--and more than a little disturbed--that that was the first thing Malfoy thought of. \'93

\par But Draco Malfoy had his mouth clamped shut again. Ginny emerged from the bedroom, holding the door open slightly. She looked at Draco. 
\par \'93She\rquote s asking for you. Just--be with her. Keep her company. She\rquote s still not dropping off; her mind is too restless...\'94 
\par Draco looked triumphantly at Harry. \'93You doubt she\rquote ll come near me again, do you?\'94 
\par \'93She\rquote s not going to accuse you right now. She\rquote s distraught. But she won\rquote t stay that way. You know she\rquote s got a temper. When this really hits her--watch out. If you\rquote re not part of the solution, she\rquote

\par \'93I don\rquote t need your warnings, Potter,\'94 Malfoy said as he walked to the bedroom.

s father was murdered and her mother kidnapped, the Order of Merlin medals were to be awarded at the Hogsmeade village hall. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Sirius and Snape were al
l getting the Order of Merlin, and Ginny secured special permission to go along, ostensibly to see her brother get the highest honor in the wizarding world, making him the first werewolf ever honored in this way. This also meant that she would see Harry g
et his O.M., second class. 
\par Harry looked out over the crowd filling the village hall. Ron and Hermione sat next to him. Glancing at Ron out of the corner of his eye he could see that he was producing enough perspiration from his brow to turn the Hogwarts la
ke into a Scottish version of the Dead Sea. Hermione was the color of parchment, and on her other side, Sirius was compulsively twisting his robes in his fingers. Harry swallowed; if anything, looking at the others and seeing their signs of terror had mad
e him more nervous, not less. 
\par Ginny was sitting in the front row with Hagrid and Professor McGonagall, who had turned to beam at him. Harry almost fell off his chair at that sight, hardly a common one, but his gaze was drawn back to Ginny, who was listenin
g attentively to something Hagrid was saying. Some of Hagrid\rquote s gruff voice carried above the din of voices echoing in the hall. Harry thought he heard, \'93...}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 wonder where yer parents learnt it all}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 He was evidently regaling her with the tale of the first time he and Harry had met, which made him smile. It was one of his better memories, finding out that he was a wizard, and that he didn\rquote 
t have to live with the Dursleys year round any more, nor go to Stonewall High and wear Dudley\rquote s old clothes dyed grey, like elephant skin that had misplaced the elephant. 
\par Harry looked fondly at her and Hagrid, and just then she turned and met his eye. His breath caught; the love and trust he saw there made all of his nerves disappear, and he knew everything was going to be a
ll right. She saw that he was looking right back at her and she smiled. Then he noticed that Maggie, on the other side of Professor McGonagall, was also smiling at someone on the stage. He turned his head, seeing that Snape had met her eye and was letting
 the corner of his mouth to turn up subtly. 
\par Suddenly, under his robes, Sandy hissed at him, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 The wolf shall howl.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Bloody hell}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , Harry thought. That\rquote s just what we all need, for Hermione to be getting up in front of this crowd, making speeches about house 
elves. And sure enough, while she and Ron were waiting, she was saying something to him about \'93hundreds of them,\'94 and \'93no choice\'94 and \'93the Ministry has got to do something.\'94
 He grimaced, wishing he dared just Apparate out of the hall. He had been looking forward to this, but now... 
\par The ceremony finally officially began; the }{\f54\ul\cf2\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 wizarding anthem <http://www.soalinux.commune.firenze.it/holmes/GodSave.Mid>}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

\par }{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Over a thousand witches and wizards stood respectfully for the anthem, hats off, and sat again afterward. Cornelius Fudge stepped to the podium and began what Harry thought must have been the world\rquote

\par He didn\rquote t hear the rest of what Fudge said. He was startled by the applause ringing through the hall, which baffled Harry, as he could o
nly think that everyone must be as grateful as he was that Fudge had stopped speaking. He joined in automatically, but half-heartedly. To his surprise, Sirius was shaking Fudge's hand while the applause continued. On Sirius' robes the Order of Merlin, thi
rd class was gleaming, a bronze image of a wizard\rquote 
s hat bearing various runes and astrological symbols, behind which rose a castle. Most of the applause seemed to come from the Weasleys in the front row, plus Hagrid and Professor McGonagall (and Maggie, who
 was a Weasley by blood, if not by name). Harry, Ron and Hermione were also clapping as loudly as they could, and Ron was stomping his foot on the wooden stage floor, making Harry\rquote 
s teeth rattle, but he just laughed and joined in the foot-stomping. He met Sirius\rquote 
 eye as he bowed his head slightly, acknowledging the applause. For the first time, Harry noticed the people ranged around the perimeter of the hall, standing and clapping, and he realized that they were Aurors, and from the look of them, Aurors who
\rquote d been rescued from Azkaban. (More than a few of whom had also been rescued from the sea by Sirius and Buckbeak.) 
\par The noise ebbed again and now Fudge was speaking about Hermione. \'93It now gives me even greater pleasure,\'94 he finally said, \'93to award the Order of Merlin, third class to--Hermione Granger.\'94 Hermione was shaking Fudge\rquote 
s hand and wincing as he leaned over to plant a rather damp kiss on her cheek after he'd pinned the bronze emblem to her robes; to Harry's surprise, she didn\rquote t seem inclined to mak
e a speech of any kind. Harry clapped more enthusiastically now, hoping that if she changed her mind about speaking, the noise of the clapping would make it impossible for her to be heard. 
\par Hermione sat again, her face glowing, and Ron leaned over to give her a kiss, grinning hugely at her and making her turn deep red, although Harry heard the applause increase noticeably in volume when Ron did this. 
\par There was a buzzing in his head and he realized that Fudge had said, \'93--the Order of Merlin, second class, to Harry Potter.\'94
 His name came next in the alphabet, but he still wasn't quite prepared, standing up awkwardly and walking what felt like twenty miles to where Fudge was standing, waiting to pin a silver version of the emblem to his robes. The noise was a
 bit louder than it had been for Hermione and Sirius, and Harry saw Katie and Percy standing at the edge of the hall, both beaming at him and clapping loudly, while Ron engaged in more foot-stomping and Sirius joined him. As he turned to sit, feeling like
 his face was flaming, he glanced at Ginny, whose mouth was forming the words }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I love you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , even as she continued to clap. 
\par \'93And now,\'94 Fudge said, as the applause finally began to fade, \'93we have that rarity, an Order of Merlin, first class. For his leadership
 and bravery, for his level-headed thinking and outstanding ability as a sailor, having brought home to their families both the fine men and women who were taken prisoner at Azkaban and those in the rescue party itself, I award the Order of Merlin, first 
class to Severus Snape.\'94 
\par The gold version of the emblem was on a wide purple ribbon, and Snape bent to allow Fudge to place it around his neck, where it shone brightly in the dim hall. The applause was polite, but it didn\rquote t satisfy Harry. He stomped as lou
dly as Ron had done, pounding his heel into the floor, bashing his hands together so hard that they were starting to go numb. Maggie and the Weasleys, Hagrid and Professor McGonagall also joined in very enthusiastic applause for Severus Snape. When he wal
ked past Harry to his seat again, he was actually smiling. Harry caught Ginny\rquote s eye again and she grinned at him. 
\par Finally, Fudge stood to announce Ron\rquote s award. Harry watched Ron\rquote s face as the words echoed around the hall. He seemed very tense, anxiously biting his lip. \'93--Order of Merlin, second class to Ronald Weasley,\'94
 Fudge managed to get out, looking like he was going to be ill. The jowls of his pasty face were quivering with indignation, and Harry wondered what Dumbledore had done to browbeat Fudge into giving Ron the O.M., second class. At least Harry hadn\rquote 
t needed to decline his own award, which was what he had been prepared to if the Ministry had overlooked Ron. 
\par Applause began moving through the hall again; Harry and Hermione grinned at each other as they clapped loudly, and Harry saw that Snape was also striking his hands together with a solemnity that bespoke more than doing his duty by Maggie\rquote 
s brother. Ron stood before Fudge now, but he didn\rquote t come closer to him as the others had done, to allow him to pin the silver emblem to his robes; instead, he put his hand on Fudge\rquote 
s arm, to stop him trying to lift the medal up, and the applause in the hall petered out as those gathered began muttering in confusion. 
\par Ron cleared his throat, looking more nervous than Harry had ever seen him. \'93Minister, I\rquote m sorry, but I can\rquote t accept this.\'94 Harry dropped his jaw and looked at Hermione, who looked as shocked as he felt. Clearly, Ron hadn\rquote 
t warned her about this. And then Harry realized how stupid he\rquote d been to think that \lquote the wolf\rquote 
 would be Hermione, rather than Ron, the werewolf. The confused murmuring quickly grew to a deafening rumble, and Ron tried to motion to the crowd to quieten again. \'93I\rquote m sorry, I should explain,\'94 he said loudly, his voice carrying easily o
ver the rumble, which again began to subside. \'93I can\rquote t accept this,\'94 he said again, his voice ringing out now into the silence, \'93
while Remus Lupin still stands accused of having any part in the Death Eater attack on Azkaban, and while werewolves all over B
ritain are treated like scum, like worse than scum, like the nasty residue you have to clean out of a cauldron after making a really nasty potion...\'94 Ron paused. \'93Oh, bugger,\'94
 he said clearly, the word echoing across the hall, causing some tittering. He reddened. \'93Sorry, Mum,\'94 he said quickly, glancing down at Molly Weasley. 
\par \'93That\rquote s all right, love,\'94 she said stoutly. \'93You go on.\'94 Harry saw how proud she looked. 
\par \'93I--I\rquote m no good at speaking like this unless I\rquote ve written it down first,\'94 he explained to the hundreds of witches and wizards as he took a parchment out of his pocket, his ears turning red. He cleared his throat and began again. \'93
As I was saying, I can\rquote t accept this while an innocent man is being used as a scapegoat,\'94 Ron read now from the parchment, \'93and while werewolves are second-class citizens. We\rquote re }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 people}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  most of the time, decent people, Muggles and wizards both, and yet the Ministry hasn\rquote t done anything to make Wolfsbane Potion universally available to all werewolves. I\rquote m lucky that our Potions Master--
\'94 he nodded at Snape, \'93--is able to brew it, so I can take it every month. And it wasn\rquote t Remus Lupin\rquote s fault that Professor Snape wasn\rquote t around last year to make it for him, and that the place where he was hiding as a wolf w
as set on fire. He was doing everything he could to avoid hurting someone. Werewolves don\rquote t plan to attack people. Remus Lupin didn\rquote t want to bite me, but he did it, and since then I\rquote 
ve found out a thing or two about how friendly some people in the wizarding world can be,\'94 he said bitterly. 
\par \'93When the Ministry finds out a Muggle has been bitten, you know what they do?\'94 he asked rhetorically, his voice rising; he was hitting his stride, Harry realized, and he watched, fascinated, as his best friend continued. \'93
They basically kidnap them and take them off to be registered. Suddenly these people who didn\rquote t even know magic existed and who\rquote ve just been mauled by what they thought was a wild animal are being told what to do by a government they didn
\rquote t elect, and }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 still}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  can\rquote t elect because they\rquote re not witches or wizards.\'94 Harry digested that; he\rquote 
d never really thought before about Muggles gaining an entry into the magical world by becoming magical creatures, werewolves. The only problem was that they didn't fully enter into the magical world, they were forced to remain at the perimeter. \'93
And someone like me, or Remus Lupin?\'94 Ron continued. \'93Do you think people are lining up to give us jobs? I had a job, a good job. I was playing Quidditch for England!\'94 
\par Some scattered cheering erupted from various spots in the hall, and a particularly loud wizard shouted, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Best Chaser they\rquote ve had in years}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 !\'94 
\par Ron smiled shyly now, almost as though he just realized what he was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 doing}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . \'93Thanks,\'94 he said to the Quidditch fans. \'93But I had to stop, didn\rquote t I? It wasn\rquote 
t just because England lost--and I did }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  throw that game!\'94 he exclaimed, as though someone had just accused him. \'93My best friend,\'94 he gestured toward Harry, \'93
just happens to be a brilliant Seeker. He caught the Snitch before our Seeker and Wales won, fair and square. Anyone who says I threw the game is insulting Harry Potter. He didn\rquote 
t need help with anything but staying alive, as a rogue Bludger was coming after him.\'94 Harry saw that he\rquote d abandoned his notes. \'93But did the Departme
nt of Magical Games and Sports do anything about that? Not a thing. And did the Ministry go get the Aurors in Azkaban? No, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 we}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  did. This has gone on long enough!\'94
 He turned to Cornelius Fudge. \'93You need help from everyone who\rquote s willing to fight Voldemort,\'94 random gasps moved through the hall at the sound of the name, \'93but you don\rquote t seem to get that! I\rquote 
d never dream of joining him, but if I heard that another wizard werewolf had done it, I wouldn\rquote t be at all surprised, the way the Ministry treats werewolves. What have you done to make werewolves feel they owe anything to the Ministry? I\rquote 
m sick of it, and every werewolf I\rquote ve met since I registered is sick of it, too,\'94 he finished, sounding disgusted. Fudge had backed up against the podium and was visibly shaking. 
\par The hall was utterly silent. 
\par Very slowly, a single pair of hands at the rear of the village hall began clapping slowly. Harry couldn\rquote t see who it was; he thought it was coming from a slim hooded figure standing in a far corner, with spectacles glintin
g from under the hood. Harry stood and started clapping as well, and Hermione sprang to her feet immediately after him. Everyone in the front row was now standing and clapping, the twins and Charlie roaring their approval, while Bill, Maggie and their par
ents were applauding more sedately. Harry saw that Ginny was crying as she stood clapping, looking at Ron proudly. 
\par Harry stepped forward as the applause grew; he removed his Order of Merlin emblem from his robes and placed it in Fudge\rquote s hand, followed by H
ermione and Sirius. Finally, giving Harry a solemn nod, Severus Snape stepped forward and took off his Order of Merlin, first class, and handed it to a flabbergasted Cornelius Fudge. The noise in the hall was deafening. Then Harry saw him; Remus Lupin was
 
being led down what passed for a center aisle (although it was crowded with witches and wizards) by Professor Dumbledore. They climbed the few steps to the stage when they reached the front and Dumbledore quickly subdued the crowd with a gentle wave of hi
s hand. 
\par \'93Ladies and gentlemen, I am dreadfully sorry that we were delayed in getting back here from the Ministry, but it seems that there is something which you all should know. The Ministry have apprehended eight of the Death Eaters involved in both the A
zkaban attack and the siege at Gringotts, and although they did try to implicate Remus Lupin,\'94 he said, putting his hand on Remus\rquote  shoulder, \'93
it was easily determined that they were all lying, trying to discredit a good man who has worked tirelessly agains
t Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Of course, these Death Eaters knew that the Ministry would be eager to credit their claims that Remus had colluded with them,\'94 he said, looking pointedly at Fudge, who was quailing under his gaze; \'93
but I knew better, and now the Ministry does, too.\'94 
\par He looked at Harry, Ron, Hermione, Sirius and Snape. \'93Goodness, Cornelius, aren\rquote t you taking quite a lot of time to give out a handful of awards? May I offer you my assistance?\'94 Fudge nodded dumbly and Dumbledore presented the 
emblems all over again, first taking Sirius and Hermione\rquote s bronze O.M., third class emblems from Fudge\rquote s trembling hand, then Harry\rquote s silver one, and finally, Snape\rquote s gold O.M., first class on the wide purple ribbon and Ron
\rquote s silver emblem, which he finally allowed Dumbledore to pin to his robes. 
\par \'93I have brought another award with me from the Ministry,\'94 he went on, \'93one that is a bit overdue, I believe...\'94 He took another wide purple ribbon out of his pocket, another gold Order of Merlin, first class dangling from it. \'93
For your outstanding work in bringing the Gringotts siege to a peaceful conclusion, you were recommended for the Order of Merlin, first class, and now you shall finally have it,\'94 he said, smiling at Remus Lupin. He placed the ribbon around Remus
\rquote  neck, where the shiny purple ribbon and gleaming gold medal caught the light and shone in high contrast to his shabby brown robes. 
\par Dumbledore turned calmly to the assembled company and said, \'93Go on. You know you want to.\'94 He smiled and clapped his ha
nds, turning to look at the six of them. Sirius had caught his old friend in a fierce hug and Ron was grinning ear to ear at his mentor as the cheers and whistles and clapping bounced off the rafters and windows and walls. 
\par At length, it broke up in a most disorganized fashion, with a photographer from the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Daily Prophet}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 asking them to pose together in a dizzying number of configurations, until Harry couldn\rquote t see anything because of the flashes blinding him. He was strongly reminded of having to pose for pho
tos on the day Alicia had married Roger Davies. But although he couldn\rquote t see very well, he could hear. 
\par \'93So,\'94 the cold, distinctive voice was saying, \'93would you say that the Ministry should approve stricter interrogation policies if the words of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 eight}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  pris
oners concerning the involvement of a ninth co-conspirator aren\rquote t enough?\'94 
\par He finally reached her through the crowd; she wore sweeping robes of deepest black and her long pale hair was bound up in a twist, secured by a green parrot\rquote s feather. She clasped 
a parchment notebook; a Quick Quotes quill danced over an open page. 
\par He didn\rquote t notice to whom she was speaking; instead, he walked straight up to her and said, \'93Hello, Mrs. Malfoy. Or should I say--Daisy Furuncle?\'94 
\par She froze, then got that look he remembered, as though she were being forced to smell something putrid. \'93Worked that out finally, did you?\'94 she said acidly. \'93Well done,\'94
 she added, voice dripping with sarcasm, as though a flobberworm that had been dead for two weeks would have known in five seconds. 
\par \'93I knew about you some time ago. And even though I know you\rquote re supposed to ask the questions, I have a question for you: }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Where is your husband, Mrs. Malfoy}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 

\par Her mouth twisted unpleasantly. \'93I don\rquote t know. That\rquote s the truth. He\rquote s probably assuming that I\rquote m being watched. That\rquote s the usual sort of thing, isn\rquote t it? The Ministry would be daft if they }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 didn\rquote t}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  keep an eye on the wife of an escaped convict.\'94 She glanced disdainfully at the silver medal on his chest. \'93Not that the Ministry is displaying an ino
rdinate amount of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 sense}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  these days,\'94 she sniffed. 
\par Harry was finding it very difficult not to throttle her. \'93Not while they don\rquote t lock you up, no,\'94 he agreed. 
\par She examined him with cold amused eyes. \'93I\rquote ve done nothing wrong.\'94 
\par \'93No?\'94 he said. \'93Writing lies isn\rquote t wrong?\'94 
\par She laughed. \'93Truth is in the eye of the beholder,\'94 she drawled lazily. \'93If you\rquote ll look at my work, you\rquote ll find that it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 is}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 truthful. There are certain aspects of the truth that some may find distasteful, when given a public airing. Rita taught me that,\'94 she said. 
\par He grimaced. \'93I should have known that you would become friends with Rita Skeeter.\'94 
\par \'93Ah, that\rquote s where you\rquote re wrong. We were already friends. She came to me long before my husband went to prison and I lost my home. She wanted to kn
ow whether my son ever included interesting information about you in his letters. I suggested that she ask him herself, and she did. It was soon after that Mudblood captured her and Rita was trapped into working for your headmaster that she and I came up

\par \'93Sometimes other people turned in your articles. Was one of them your niece?\'94 
\par Narcissa Malfoy\rquote s mouth curled up at the edge with amusement. \'93Not quite full marks, but getting closer. Yes, Nita helped me sometimes, when a little bird told me that certain people were watching the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

 She sounded very, very bitter now. \'93I have found accommodations elsewhere,\'94 she sniffed. \'93Ungrateful, that\rquote s what she is. Everything my husband did to help her in her career...\'94 
\par \'93Ungrateful because she\rquote s finally thinking for herself?\'94 Harry said, making a face. \'93Those people she saw at the reservation
 in Sweden were ruthlessly cut down by the same people who used those dragons to help your husband and others escape from Azkaban.\'94 
\par She lifted her chin and looked at him through narrowed eyes. \'93You have no proof of that. No one knows where those dragons are.\'94 
\par \'93The Aurors who were taken prisoner testified that that\rquote s what happened!\'94 he said angrily. 
\par \'93You mean those poor deluded souls who were hallucinating after days and days without food and water?\'94 she said innocently. \'93Yes, they had some interesting tales to tell...\'94 
\par \'93You claim to write the truth, but what you really do is }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 twist}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  the truth to fit your own twisted goals,\'94 he growled at her. \'93Just because they hadn\rquote t eaten doesn

\par \'93Oh, really? How interesting. You have the most }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 interesting}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  version of events that I have heard. Unfortunately,\'94 she added, her mouth twisting again, \'93
you do not have a friend in the press who will print your }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 interesting}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  version.\'94 
\par \'93You didn\rquote t think they were deluded when some of them told you about my being a golden griffin Animagus. Even though that\rquote 
s true, that sounds a lot more far-fetched than the rest of the truth. But once again, it was something that you were able to twist...\'94 
\par \'93Twist? I? I can\rquote t be held responsible for what people tell me...\'94 
\par Harry felt very close to hexing her. \'93Your husband }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 will}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  be caught, Mrs. Malfoy. And if there\rquote s any justice, you\rquote 
ll be sent to prison too, for aiding and abetting him.\'94 She looked startled for a second, as though Harry had hit the mark, but then she recovered. 
\par \'93Aiding and abetting? Is that what you call corresponding with my son? And then corresponding with my husband, to tell him how his son is doing? While he was still in prison, of course. I already said that I don\rquote t know where he is no
w. Draco wasn\rquote t feeling inclined to write to his father. I felt he had a right to know how he was doing in school...\'94 
\par \'93Since when are you and Draco on speaking terms?\'94 
\par She ignored this. \'93You may have all day to chit-chat, but I do not. Thanks to }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  I do need to work for a living, so I think I\rquote 
ll just be filing my story about this little travesty--\'94 she said, waving her hand at the hall, \'93--before my deadline, if you don\rquote t mind. Thank you for your time, Minister,\'94 she said to the person to whom she\rquote d been
 speaking before Harry had accosted her. He saw now that it was Cornelius Fudge. In the blink of an eye, she had withdrawn her wand and Disapparated with a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 pop}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, leaving Harry sputtering at no one. Fudge\rquote s eyes wouldn\rquote t meet Harry\rquote s, and Harry started to move toward him, determined to find out what he\rquote 
d told Narcissa Malfoy. But Ginny had finally made her way through the crowd to him, throwing her arms around him; he hugged back half-heartedly and she frowned. Ron and Hermione also made their way toward him. 
\par \'93What\rquote s wrong, Harry?\'94 Hermione wanted to know. 
\par \'93I was trying to talk to Fudge,\'94 he said impatiently, kissing Ginny on the cheek quickly, then whipping his head around; Fudge was gone. Had he Disapparated? He\rquote d once been very friendly with the Malfoys. Harry didn\rquote 
t trust him for a minute, but he wasn\rquote t sure who would believe him if he started accusing the Minister of working with Death Eaters. 
\par \'93Why?\'94 Ron wanted to know. 
\par \'93I just noticed that Malfoy\rquote s mum was talking to him before I started in on her. I told her that I know she\rquote s Daisy Furuncle.\'94 
\par Hermione frowned. \'93Should you have done that, Harry? Wouldn\rquote t it be better to let her think you don\rquote t know?\'94 
\par He grimaced and shrugged; Hermione had a point, but it was a bit late for that. \'93Probably. I didn\rquote t think of that. I just--I couldn\rquote t }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  tell her off.\'94 

\par Ron nodded. \'93I don\rquote t blame you, Harry. If you told her off, she definitely had it coming.\'94 
\par \'93How can you say that?\'94 Hermione exclaimed. \'93After telling }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  not to get on Rita Skeeter\rquote s bad side? You were r
ight about that. And then there were the howlers I got...\'94 She shuddered. \'93I think Harry was very stupid,\'94 she declared hotly. \'93There\rquote s no telling what she\rquote ll write now.\'94 
\par Harry frowned at her. \'93Thanks for your support. I can take whatever she can dish out...\'94 
\par Hermione glared at him. \'93That\rquote s what I thought. And I hadn\rquote t got on the bad side of a woman whose husband I sent to prison, and whose son was turned against her.\'94 
\par \'93I really doubt it would be possible for Mrs. Malfoy to like me }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 less}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  than she already does, so I don\rquote t see the harm. As for Malfoy, he\rquote 
s been writing to his mum.\'94 Suddenly, his eyes widened and he smacked his forehead with the heel of his hand. \'93That\rquote s how his dad knew about Mariah! He must have told his mum, she told his dad...\'94 
\par Then he noticed that Ginny was glaring at Hermione. \'93You\rquote ve got a lot of nerve, calling Harry stupid...\'94 
\par Hermione glared right back. \'93Well, I\rquote m not his girlfriend anymore, so I don\rquote t have to pretend that I think the sun rises and sets on him...\'94 
\par \'93When did you ever?\'94 Harry asked her, feeling rather irritated with both of them. 
\par \'93Here now, here now,\'94 Ron said, gently putting his arms around his sister and his girlfriend. \'93Let\rquote s settle down now, shall we? I know Daisy Narcissa Malfoy Furuncle has got all of our knickers in a twist, but we shouldn\rquote 
t let her bother us...\'94 
\par \'93Quite right,\'94 Sirius said, appearing at Harry\rquote s elbow. \'93That\rquote s for others to worry about.\'94 
\par \'93You might, for instance, let me worry about it,\'94 came a familiar voice at Harry\rquote s elbow. He turned and saw
 the hooded figure that had started the applause for Ron from the rear of the hall. She carefully took down her hood and Harry saw that it was Nita Anderssen. He just realized that the slight lilt in her voice was probably leftover from her childhood in S
weden. 
\par \'93Let you worry about it?\'94 Ron said, raising his eyebrow. \'93I thought you weren\rquote t on speaking terms with your aunt.\'94 
\par \'93I\rquote m not. But I could be on lecturing terms, if required,\'94 she said, giving him a small smile. Sirius cleared his throat and Ron looked as though he\rquote d awoken from a nap. 
\par \'93Oh! Sorry, of course. Erm, I told you about Nita, when we were in Sweden, didn\rquote t I, Sirius? This is Nita Anderssen, Draco Malfoy\rquote s cousin. Nita, this is Sirius Black, Hermione Granger, and my sister, Ginny.\'94 
\par Nita shook Sirius and Hermione\rquote s hand in a no-nonsense way, although it seemed to Harry that she hesitated for a moment about Sirius. Ginny had her hand out as well, but suddenly Nita, biti
ng her lip, leaned forward and hugged Ginny briefly. Ginny patted her back awkwardly; Nita stepped back quickly, her cheeks a little pink. \'93I, er, Ron told me all about you,\'94 she said quickly. \'93You\rquote ve really stood by him.\'94 
\par Harry frowned; Hermione had stood by him as well, and she wasn\rquote t getting any hugs. Ginny\rquote s brow was furrowed as she regarded Nita, who suddenly pulled her hood up again, peering around the edge of it warily. \'93
Sorry to be paranoid, but you never know who\rquote s watching these days,\'94 she said softly. 
\par \'93Such as--?\'94 Sirius asked her. 
\par \'93Such as Death Eaters no one knows are Death Eaters. Believe me, the ones the Ministry knows about are only a drop in the bucket. I have to be very careful at work these days. If it weren\rquote t for the fact that I went to Durmstrang--\'94 
\par \'93You went to Durmstrang!\'94 Sirius exclaimed too loudly. They all shushed him and he looked quite abashed. \'93Sorry. I mean--I was just wondering--did you study under Karkaroff?\'94 
\par She nodded. \'93But he wasn\rquote t headmaster until I\rquote d left. I finished school ten years ago, you realize,\'94 she added stiffly, as though he was someone else holding her youth against her. To Harry\rquote s surprise, Sirius bristled. 
\par \'93And I finished school twenty years ago, not that it matters....Why were you saying, \lquote If it weren\rquote t for the fact that I went to Durmstrang?\rquote \'94 
\par She peered around the edge of her hood again, the candlelight glinting off her glasses. \'93I had to be tough to get through Durmstrang. A lot of students--well, that place can chew you up and spit you out pretty quickly if you\rquote re not careful. It
\rquote s not for the faint of heart.\'94 She looked fondly at Ron. \'93I wanted to congratulate you for your Order of Merlin, and here you must think I\rquote m a great coward for not wanting to be seen...\'94 
\par Ron shook his head. \'93No, not after seeing the way things are run at St. Mungo\rquote s. I wouldn\rquote t be surprised if they held against you that you were cheering for the \lquote wrong\rquote  Quidditch team.\'94 
\par She gave him a rueful half-smile. \'93Well, my \lquote wrong\rquote  Quidditch team are the League Champions, so I hardly 
think anyone can hold that against me. But I know what you mean. Yes, every little thing about you is held up to scrutiny right now to determine what side you\rquote re on. I don\rquote t want the Ministry to think I\rquote m on my uncle\rquote 
s side, but on the other hand...\'94 She looked around furtively again. \'93There are more than a few of my colleagues who probably }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 are}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  on his side, and I don\rquote 
t want them to think that I\rquote ve lost }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 all}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  family loyalty. It wouldn\rquote t exactly be safe.\'94 She lowered her voice to a whisper. \'93I\rquote ve been trying to
 get information that suggests that certain doctors and nurses have been helping wounded Death Eaters. People with loads of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 burns}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , if you know what I mean.\'94

\par Sirius looked very keen to hear more. \'93Have you actually seen anything?\'94 
\par She shook her head, her lips drawn very thin. \'93No. But my senior keeps bothering me about whatever it is I did for }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 she said to Harry, surprising him. \'93
You know--when you were so miraculously cured of those burns last summer. I keep telling him I didn\rquote t do anything, but he seems to think I\rquote m holding something back...It\rquote s been more than a little }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 inconvenient,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 she added, giving Harry a hostile glare. 
\par Harry swallowed. \'93Well, I might as well come clean about that. It was Rodney Jeffries who healed me.\'94 
\par They were all utterly silent for a fully a minute before Nita said, \'93You mean that Muggle faith-healer?\'94 She looked like that was the last thing she expected. \'93He\rquote s all I\rquote ve been hearing about for months now. Some of my c
olleagues have even gone to him. So--he can really }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 heal}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 she whispered in awe. 
\par Harry nodded. \'93Evidently. He did it for me, at any rate.\'94 
\par She looked like she needed to sit down, but settled for clutching the back of a chair. \'93I miss that so much...\'94 
\par Hermione looked concerned and put her hand on Nita\rquote s arm. \'93What?\'94 
\par Nita looked at her blankly. \'93Before I started my formal training at St. Mungo\rquote s, I--I could }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 heal}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . Oh, I probably couldn\rquote t do what this Jeffries did for }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 she said to Harry. \'93But I--I could do more than I can now. It\rquote s--it\rquote s as if }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 learning}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  about the \lquote proper\rquote  ways of doing things has driven the other way out of me...\'94 
\par Harry spoke very softly to her. \'93Maybe--maybe you don\rquote t believe anymore that you }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 can}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  do it. If you did believe--maybe you still could. But }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 learning}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  about the \lquote proper\rquote  way, as you call it--perhaps that\rquote 
s keeping you from believing in yourself, in your own abilities. When Jeffries cured me, he told me to believe. I tried and I did--and I was cured...\'94 
\par She looked at him strangely, not answering, and he couldn\rquote t tell what was in her eyes. But he didn\rquote t have a chance to work it out, because suddenly, Hermione was prancing about excitedly and clapping her hands together. 
\par \'93Oh! I\rquote ve just had the most wonderful idea!\'94 she said. \'93Sirius, I\rquote 
ve been reading in the Muggle papers about this huge gathering that Jeffries is going to be holding. Do you think--do you think Ron and I could go? You know the one. It\rquote s a Friday evening, but--but what if he can }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 cure}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Ron?\'94 she said breathlessly. 
\par Ron was clearly alarmed by the idea. Sirius looked back and forth between the two of them; he could see Ron\rquote s reaction for himself. \'93Well, I\rquote ll speak to the headmaster about that. We\rquote ll see,\'94 he said noncommittally. 
\par \'93And Harry could visit with his aunt!\'94 Hermione said excitedly, suddenly full of plans. Harry thought about this. 
\par \'93I would like to make sure she\rquote s all right...\'94 he conceded. 
\par \'93Well,\'94 Sirius said, clapping his hands together, \'93if we do this, one thing I can say is the man certainly knows how to put on a show. You know that, Harry. Whether or not anyone is \lquote healed,\rquote \'94
 he said, looking pointedly at Hermione, \'93if we go, it\rquote s probably best to just expect a good show, an interesting time, and nothing more. I wouldn\rquote t get your hopes up.\'94 
\par Nita surveyed him, her eyes narrowed behind her glasses. \'93So you don\rquote t think he really heals people?\'94 
\par Sirius shrugged. \'93I\rquote ve been to my share of his shows and seen loads of people who seem to be healed. And they really seem to think they\rquote re healed. He makes them happy, and entertains me, certainly. I don\rquote 
t really see any harm in him. He seems to mean well.\'94 He sighed. \'93I\rquote ll talk to the headmaster about it, all right? But he may want to be very cautious. Don\rquote t get your hopes up.\'94 Hermione n
odded, but she was still smiling rapturously, her hands clasped together. Harry felt a doubt prickle at the back of his mind, but he didn\rquote t say anything; there would be time for that. \'93At any rate,\'94
 Sirius was saying to Nita, extending his hand again, \'93it was very nice to meet you.\'94 
\par Nita shook his hand briskly. \'93Yes, and you,\'94 she said, nodding. She turned to Ron. \'93And I\rquote ll see what I can do about taming my aunt\rquote s poison pen,\'94 she added with a small smile before taking out her wand and Disapparating with a

\rquote t turned up, and Mariah was by turns hysterical or confined to the hospital wing in
 a state of near-catatonia. Ginny was visiting her quite a lot, and frequently came back looking very disturbed, saying that Draco had come to visit, so she thought it best to leave. Her face looked strange when she said this, and Harry wondered what he
\rquote d said to her. 
\par He and Ginny sat in chairs near the common room hearth along with Hermione, who was doing N.E.W.T. preparation for Astronomy and trying to interest Harry and Ron in it. Both boys groaned simultaneously.

\par \'93Yeah, but what have we been learning in Astronomy that has to do with that? And isn\rquote t this dangerously close to Divination?\'94 he said, smirking.

Starting this year, and every year for the next three years, at the time of the equinoxes and solstices, the earth will be aligned with the center of the galaxy, which only occurs once every six to seven thousand years. And the first equinox is the ve

\par Harry was jolted. \'93Oh. So you\rquote re saying that something significant is supposed to happen that day? The same day we might be going to see Jeffries?\'94 
\par \'93Not only that,\'94 she said, warming to her subject, \'93But next Thursday, there\rquote s going to be a solar eclipse. It\rquote s supposed to take place right in front of Regulus, which is in the center of the constella

\par Ron was sitting up very straight now, looking at how alarmed Harry was. \'93That\rquote s enough, Hermione,\'94 he warned her. Harry felt like there was a block of ice in his stomach, as though he was hurtling forward into something he couldn\rquote

robably have a lot more people than that. But I thought I told you what happened? Or weren\rquote t you paying attention--}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 again}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 she said pointedly. 
\par \'93Erm, what?\'94 Harry said guiltily. 
\par \'93Parliament has declared that he can have as many people as he wants at Stonehenge. Can you believe it? They\rquote 
ve overridden the National Trust. At least he has a lot of followers who are wizards; if people tromp all over the place, they can discreetly put it right again...\'94 
\par Harry frowned, more disturbed than ever. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Why would Parliament do such a thing?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Unless-- 
\par \'93Did Harrington-Smythe have anything to do with it?\'94 he asked her, but Ron was dragging her to the portrait hole now, grinning. 
\par \'93Sorry Harry,\'94 he said, \'93but I have declared that she has been working too hard and needs some rest and relaxation now...\'94 
\par \'93Yes,\'94 Hermione called as they left. \'93I already told you that she did, Harry. Don\rquote t you pay any attention when I\rquote m reading things from the Muggle papers to you at breakfast?\'94 
\par But he couldn\rquote t respond, as she and Ron had both disappeared into the corridor. Hermione hadn\rquote t exactly been fighting Ron; she\rquote 
d practically leaped out at the last moment. Harry sighed, looking across the hearth at Ginny; she looked disgruntled. 
\par \'93Where are they going?\'94 she wanted to know. 
\par \'93Probably to Fluffy\rquote s old lair,\'94 he told her. \'93Hermione and I used to--\'94 
\par He stopped himself, his face feeling hot again. Ginny smiled ruefully. \'93Ah. I see.\'94 
\par He clamped his mouth shut, breathing through his nostrils. He\rquote d been going mad since returning to the castle, thinking about being with her, about the fact that she\rquote 
d taken the potion, but she seemed to spend all of her time visiting Mariah, or they had Dueling Club, or Quidditch practice, or }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 something}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 to occupy their time. This was one of the first times they\rquote d just been sitting about, not doing anything in particular, since returning, and that was only because Ron had \lquote convinced\rquote 
 Hermione to lay off the N.E.W.T. revision, for the moment. He thought about what Hermione had said about Regulus, the \lquote heart\rquote  of the Lion. \'93I don\rquote t suppose--when they get back, you\rquote d, um, want to--\'94 
\par Ginny made a face. \'93I\rquote m sorry, Harry. It\rquote s just that--I\rquote m not sure how Ron stands it. Knowing that you and Hermione--that the two of you were together, in the same place--\'94 
\par He nodded. \'93I understand. But I doubt Ron has considered that at all.\'94 He thought for a minute. \'93There\rquote s that dungeon where we spend the full moon with Ron. I mean, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 they\rquote ve}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  been there, um, together, but I was never down there with Hermione...\'94 
\par \'93A }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 dungeon}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? Not only does my brother not }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 think}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , he--\'94 She stopped abruptly. \'93I\rquote 
m sorry, Harry. It\rquote s not that I\rquote m saying }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you\rquote re}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  not thinking...\'94 
\par Harry }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  feeling a little insulted, and a bit like she was being fussy. But then he thought, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
A dungeon? How romantic. Just because Ron and Hermione--}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

\par \'93We could go into the corner for now,\'94 Ginny suggested softly, nodding across the room; she hadn\rquote t noticed that Sandy had spoken. Ginny\rquote s words had sent Sandy out of his head. \'93At least until }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
they}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  get back.\'94 
\par Harry dropped his jaw. \'93The corner?\'94 
\par She laughed. \'93Don\rquote t be silly! I\rquote m not suggesting--just--well, there are some other things we }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 can}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  do...You look like you coul
d use a little rest and relaxation yourself,\'94 she added with a wicked smile. 
\par He nodded and tried to smile back. It was something, at least. Now that he was thinking about this--it seemed to be }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 all}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he could think about. \'93
Right, right. Sorry. Being thick.\'94 
\par She rose and held out her hand to him, laughing. \'93No, you\rquote ve just got the same thing on your mind all of the time that I have.\'94
 He swallowed, his pulse quickening upon hearing her say this, following her willingly across the room, the other students ignoring them. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 She was thinking about this all of the time?}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought. 
\par When they reached the corner armchair, which was already facing the two walls, Harry sat down and Ginny draped herself across his lap, putting her arm around his shoulder. \'93We\rquote ll think of something,\'94 she whispered. \'93
Maybe you can ask Sirius if I can come to Stonehenge with you and Ron and Hermione...\'94 She traced his cheek with her finger before removing his glasses. He nodded, not interested in }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 thinking}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  as he pulled her face down to his, feeling her open her mouth and slide her fingers into his hair. He trembled, loving her so much, wishing Fred hadn\rquote t been with them that last night at Hog\rquote s End.... 

\par He moved his lips down her neck and she nimbly slipped her fingers under his shirt, her palm
 burning against his skin. Her breathing grew more erratic as he traced his tongue down to her clavicle and moved his hand up her leg. She sighed his name and he covered her mouth with his again, shivering. He didn\rquote 
t know how much longer he could take what they were doing. He was only human.... 
\par But she didn't seem to be stopping, and so neither was he--yet. He had slipped his hand into her robes and was cupping one breast through her blouse, causing her to make an undulating animal noise in the back of her
 throat. That was almost his undoing; he pulled his mouth away from hers reluctantly, but before he could speak, she was moving her mouth up to his ear, sending an electric jolt through his body and making him momentarily forget how to speak English. 

\par \'93Mmrrmm--Gin--er--ah--Ginny!\'94 he finally managed to say, breathing with difficulty. She raised her head, fine beads of sweat on her upper lip and a glazed look in her eyes. 
\par \'93Too much?\'94 she whispered breathily. He nodded vigorously, holding her tightly. \'93I\rquote m sorry, Harry. I--I want you so much, and--\'94 
\par \'93Ginny!\'94 he said again. \'93Much as it\rquote s nice to know that--hearing it actually doesn\rquote t help me very much....\'94 
\par She laughed. \'93Let\rquote s just sit and hold each other,\'94 she said, taking her hand from under his shirt. \'93We\rquote ll think of something.\'94 
\par He closed his eyes, holding her tightly, trying to calm down. \'93I know, I know...\'94 he murmured into her neck, But he wasn\rquote t sure he knew anything of the kind. Ginny, however, seemed determined to solve the problem; it was a challenge. 
\par \'93Yes.\'94 She sounded more sure than he felt. \'93We\rquote ll think of something,\'94 she repeated. After a little while, she lifted her head and put her mouth near his ear again. \'93I\rquote ve just thought of something,\'94 she whispered. 
\par He looked at her mischievous face. \'93What?\'94 
\par \'93Well--I\rquote ve decided that I\rquote m feeling like taking a shower.\'94 
\par He furrowed his brow. \'93What?\'94 he said again. 
\par She gave him a lopsided smile, putting her hand inside his shirt and bringing out his basilisk pendant. \'93And you have this convenient little gift I gave you....\'94 
\par The meaning of what she was saying--and what Sandy had said--finally dawned on him. \'93Oooh,\'94 he said, feeling daft. He swallowed. \'93Are--are you sure?\'94 
\par She gave him a very naughty-looking smile. \'93Well, if I\rquote m inviting you to look, it\rquote s hardly wrong for you to do it, right?\'94 
\par She stood and walked toward the stairs to the girls\rquote  dormitories. Harry put his head around the side of the chair, watching her, then sat back in the chair again, holding the amulet tightly, wondering whether this was }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 really}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 a good idea. He saw her walking up the winding spiral stairs with a hypnotic slowness that was making him feel like his blood was being heated in a cauldron. She entered the sixth-year girls\rquote  dormitory, where Z
oey Russell and Annika Olafsdottir were sitting on the floor, books spread out between them, rolled bits of parchment scattered amongst the books. She walked past them to a corner of the room; he saw her close the hangings on one side of her four-poster, 
t
o conceal from her roommates what she was doing. She began to undress slowly, as Harry continued to clutch the amulet, his mouth going dry. When she was undressed down to her underwear, she donned a dressing gown and slippers and padded through the room a
gain, past Zoey and Annika, then across the landing to the shower room, next to the lavatory. 
\par He released the amulet, aware that his breathing had grown rather erratic. Even though she\rquote d virtually given him a written invitation, he still wasn\rquote t completely 
sure he should be doing this. He sat, staring into the corner, trying to work out whether he should or shouldn\rquote 
t touch the amulet again, when he found that his hand had already crept toward it and he was clasping it firmly once more, unable to resist doing this. 
\par He gasped; he wasn\rquote t sure how many minutes had gone by since he\rquote 
d let go of the amulet, but Ginny had completely disrobed and was standing under the shower spray. Harry felt like he was holding his breath; she was so beautiful, and not at all like 
the too-thin Ginny in his other life. He had seen the way she ate after going on morning runs; she had a healthy appetite, and it showed. She looked strong and solid, not like she would break if bent too far, and he was starting to wish they\rquote 
d snuck down to the girls\rquote  prefects bathroom, so they could do this together (although at this hour they\rquote d be risking someone else intruding upon them, and it was another place where he\rquote 
d been with Hermione). The water cascaded over her body as she tipped her head back, wetting her hair, and he felt that he\rquote d been incredibly stupid for not having done this before, and wondered how many times Draco Malfoy }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 had}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  done it, without being specifically invited. 
\par He watched her wash her hair, wishing those were his hands sinking into the red tresses, washing it for her, watching the soap run down her body, caressing her curves, starting to make him feel like he was going mad.... 
\par \'93Harry?\'94 
\par He screamed without meaning to, releasing the amulet, and staring around wildly. Neville was standing over him, looking concerned. 
\par \'93Are you all right, Harry?\'94 
\par \'93Erm, what? What is it, Neville?\'94 he sputtered. 
\par \'93You were over here making very odd noises. I thought Ginny was still with you,\'94 he added, turning deep red, \'93but then I remembered seeing her go upstairs. Are you sick?\'94 
\par Harry wondered whether his thoughts were }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 very}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  obvious; he fought the urge to move his hand to cover the evidence. \'93No, I\rquote m fine. I just--think I\rquote 
ll go have a lie-down...\'94 
\par \'93Okay, Harry. As long as you\rquote re all right...\'94 
\par Harr
y bolted for the stairs and skipped every other step on his way up to the top of the tower. He clasped the amulet again when he reached the top, panting, and the sight of Ginny made it completely impossible for him to consider releasing the amulet again. 
He opened the door and immediately ploughed into Dean and Seamus, sitting on the floor, building a card castle with a pack of Exploding Snap cards. Most of it blew up in their faces. 
\par They waved their arms to dispel the smoke, coughing. \'93Damn, you, Harry!\'94 Dean choked. \'93Look what you\rquote ve gone and done.\'94 
\par Seamus was examining his singed hair in the mirror on the nearest wardrobe door. The mirror was jeering at him and starting to say a rude limerick. \'93Look what you've done to me, Harry! You wanker!\'94 
\par Harry sped from the room again, still clutching the amulet and thinking, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Yeah, Seamus, that\rquote s about right}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
. All thoughts of prophecies, Stonehenge and Rodney Jeffries fled his brain as he bolted for the lavatory on the other side of the landing and locked the door securely behind him.

A few days later, Harry and Ginny were sitting next to each other at the Gryffindor table, eating lunch, when Ginny whispered to him out of the corner of her mouth, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I\rquote m finished. I\rquote

\par He had watched her take another shower the day before, but he wanted to be }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 in}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  the same room with her...it was driving him mad. He hoped she\rquote d come up with a solution; he
\rquote d suggested the Muggle Studies classroom, where they\rquote d met in his other life, but she\rquote d told him that room was locked with a password now. When he reached the library, he found her at a table in the rear, far from Madam Pince\rquote 
s desk. As the rest of the school were still eating lunch, the library was deserted. \'93What is it?\'94 he asked anxiously. 
\par \'93I\rquote ve talked to Maggie about our situation, and she said we could use }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 her}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  rooms,\'94 she whispered. \'93Isn\rquote 
t that perfect? Especially since it means that we could actually spend the night together, instead of just rushing out of there again. This way we don\rquote t have to wait for the trip to Stonehenge.\'94 They\rquote 
d received permission to go, accompanied by Sirius, Remus, Maggie and Snape. She smiled sweetly at him. \'93I did like sleeping next to you, though, in your old room. Even with Fred there.\'94 
\par Harry gazed into her eyes and ran his hand up her arm. \'93I did, too. That would be brilliant, to not have to run off. But--where will Maggie be?\'94 
\par Ginny smirked. \'93Maggie hasn\rquote t actually slept in her own bed for ages, if you get my meaning...\'94 
\par Harry shook his head. \'93Well, there goes that theory.\'94 
\par She frowned. \'93What theory?\'94 
\par \'93Well, erm,\'94 he hedged, wishing he hadn\rquote t brought it up. She nodded with understanding. 
\par \'93You mean the theory that Professor Snape needed regular shagging to be a nice person.\'94 
\par He covered her mouth with his hand. \'93Ginny! You shouldn\rquote t--\'94 
\par She grinned against his hand, then kissed his palm and slowly ran her tongue along his life-line, making him gasp and pull his hand away again. She was still grinning wickedly when he could see her mouth again. \'93
I was saying what you were thinking. And he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 is}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  happier. You can see it if you look. But he has his reputation to maintain. Now--he seems to be }{

\rquote s selfish of me, but I think it would be odd next year to be calling my brother-in-law \lquote Professor Snape.\rquote \'94 
\par Harry\rquote s jaw dropped. \'93You think they\rquote re going to get married?\'94

\par Harry laughed too. \'93I wouldn\rquote t dream of it. So they\rquote re keeping quiet about it for now?\'94 
\par \'93Yes. Maggie said she was just telling me, but she said it was okay for me to tell you. Ron doesn\rquote t even know, or Hermione. They\rquote ll go public eventually, but for now--\'94 
\par \'93--for now they\rquote re living in his quarters and not letting on that she\rquote s not using hers.\'94

\par She pulled out a parchment with the patrol schedule on it. \'93Exactly. That\rquote s why I have this. We need to know what we\rquote re doing.\'94
 They pored over it together; Harry kissed her on the cheek, grinning at her, and she grinned back, then bent over the parchment, brushing a stray lock of hair behind her ear, which was somehow very distracting to Harry. \'93Okay, now, we\rquote 
re on duty together during the second shift on Sunday,\'94 she began; \'93after our shift is over, we could just go to the staff wing and spend the rest of the night there.\'94 
\par Harry stared at it. \'93We\rquote d have to avoid Mrs. Figg--I mean, Professor Figg--returning after her shift. She\rquote s on with us. Not to mention--won\rquote t Ron wonder where I am in the morning? And I\rquote m not sure it\rquote

\par She frowned. \'93Good point. Oh, wait--don\rquote t you have Friday morning free?\'94 
\par \'93Yeah, I do,\'94 he said, catching on, perusing the schedule for Thursday. \'93Oh, and this is perfect! You\rquote re on the first shift Thursday and I\rquote m on the second, with Hermione. We can get her help with Ron. Let\rquote 
s see--you can use my Invisibility Cloak to go through the corridors safely and I can go right to the staff wing after I\rquote m done. Hermione will help us
, I know she will; if Ron has questions about where I am during the night or in the morning, she can tell him I agreed to fill in for someone else. And let\rquote 
s see...The staff on the second shift are Flitwick and Hagrid. Hagrid goes back to his hut, and Flitwick isn\rquote t difficult. I\rquote ll just walk upstairs slowly; he goes amazingly fast; he\rquote 
ll be back in the staff wing in a blink, certainly by the time I get there. You meet me there in the Cloak and I\rquote ll let us in.\'94 
\par \'93And on Friday morning, we\rquote ll just make sure we get out of the staff wing before Trelawney and Vector get back from their shift.\'94 
\par He nodded. \'93We can share the Cloak to get back to Gryffindor Tower. None of the prefects on that shift are Gryffindors, so we won\rquote t run into any of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 them}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 
\par They looked at each other, grinning. It was the perfect plan. She threw her arms around his neck and kissed him soundly as the bell marking the end of lunch sounded. \'93I love you. See you later,\'94 she said, turning to dash out of the library. 
\par He watched her go, still grinning uncontrollably. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 It was perfect.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

t sure he liked the sound of it, at any rate, and he didn\rquote t want to get into a long hissed conversation by asking Sandy what she meant. She probably wouldn\rquote t be able to tell him anyway. 
\par He wished he knew how to perform Dumbledore\rquote s Chameleon Transfiguration. He pr
essed himself up against a stone wall, his heartbeat like a bass drum in his head. He hoped Ginny was all right; he was glad she had the Invisibility Cloak. At least he knew she couldn\rquote 
t be seen by any of the staff or prefects patrolling the corridors. He waited for footsteps to pass; Mandy Brocklehurst and Darren Ellerby, who\rquote d been appointed to take Evan Davies\rquote 
 place as the seventh-year Ravenclaw prefect, were moving with maddening slowness. He hoped that the surprise was a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 good}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  one. Surprises could cut both ways. 
\par Finally, he reached the tapestry hiding the entrance to the staff wing. He whispered the password to the wall, then looked over his shoulder at the corridor, whispering, \'93Are you here yet, Ginny?\'94 He started to reach for his amulet, fumbling in
 his robes for it so he could see her. \'93We need to hurry before someone co--\'94 He felt someone\rquote s eyes on him, but it wasn\rquote t Ginny\rquote

 he began, not sure what to say next. He stopped trying to reach the basilisk amulet. 
\par Her mouth was very thin and her normally mild eyes were blazing as he let the tapestry fall. \'93I am returning from greenhouse number six to see to the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Erechtheus dracunculoides giganthes}{

 She blanched and put her hand over her chest, looking faint. \'93Are you--are you and she--}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 meeting}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  in a teacher\rquote

\par Harry\rquote s mouth worked without a noise emerging. To make it worse, a silky voice behind him said, \'93Yes, Potter. Please explain yourself. Are you so
 unconcerned about your academic career that you are arranging assignations in the middle of the night in the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 staff wing}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94
 He turned to find Snape regarding him with one of his nastier expressions. Professor Sinistra was with him, looking more alert than most people who patrolled in the dead of night, as she slept during the day and got up after dark to teach Astronomy. 

\par Harry was feeling grumpy about being called up on the carpet by Snape, given what he knew about his relationship with Maggie. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Considering that you\rquote 
ve proposed marriage to one of your students, you can hardly talk. Even if she is in her twenties...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  He didn\rquote t dare speak, though, regardless of the acid remarks leaping to his tongue. Or }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 especially}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  considering the thoughts he longed to say, and there was also the fact that he wasn\rquote 
t supposed to know about the proposal. Harry swallowed, suddenly very glad that Ginny didn\rquote t seem to be about; she must have had a hard time getting past some other patrollers. 
\par \'93Well, um, yes,\'94 he said to Professor Sprout. \'93I tried to convince Ginny to meet me here, but I can see she had the sense not to do it. I\rquote m sorry. It was stupid and thoughtless. You\rquote re quite right. I\rquote 
ll just be going back to Gryffindor Tower,\'94 he said, turning. 
\par \'93Not so fast, Potter,\'94 Snape said smoothly, putting a hand on his shoulder. Even Sinistra was looking disapprovingly at him, her arms crossed on her chest. Harry wondered whether Maggie had told Snape about the plan. \'93
I believe that, along with that night that you claimed that Mr. Malfoy and Miss Kirkner had drowned in the lake,\'94 he said, his mouth twisting with what passed for amusement for him, \'93this would make your }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
second}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  time being out-of-bounds after hours for }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 no good reason}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . Please tell me if I am mistaken,\'94 he added, crossing his arms
 and staring down his nose at Harry, 
\par Harry forced himself to look him in the eye. \'93No, sir,\'94 he said. \'93You are not mistaken.\'94 
\par Snape\rquote s eyebrows flew up. \'93You admit then that you have no legitimate reason for being out of your house at--\'94 he checked his pocket watch; \'93--two-fifteen, which would make this your }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 second}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  infraction. If you recall, Potter, the headmaster was very clear in September that the first infraction would warrant }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 three}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 detentions, which you served with me,\'94 he added. Harry knew, of course, that Snape knew that he had a perfectly good reason for thinking that Draco and Mariah had drowned, but Professors Sprout and Sinistra did not know this. \'93
The headmaster was also very clear that the second infraction would mean--\'94 he said, inclining his head toward Harry, waiting for him to answer. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 No,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry thought. He wouldn\rquote t. He won\rquote t. He--}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 would he}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? 
\par Harry didn\rquote t say anything, his mouth hanging open in shock, so Snape finished his own sentence: \'93Suspension, Potter,\'94 he said, as though relishing every syllable. 
\par Harry couldn\rquote t keep the distress from showing on his face. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Suspension?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  But sir--\'94 
\par \'93Unless you have a legitimate reason to present to explain why you are out-of-bounds--\'94 
\par \'93I put him up to it!\'94 Ginny said suddenly, coming round the corner, her robes and hair flying out behind her. All three professors were startled to see her. Harry felt his stomach drop into his shoes, and Professor Sprout looked faint again. 
\par \'93Miss Weasley! Well! I never!\'94 
\par \'93Well, I do, Professor Sprout!\'94 she said stoutly. \'93Don\rquote t you remember catching me in the greenhouse with Draco Malfoy last year?\'94 Sprout clutched at the wall for support. 
\par \'93Ginny!\'94 Harry hissed at her. \'93You shouldn\rquote t--\'94 
\par \'93What? Tell the truth?\'94 
\par \'93Um, Ginny,\'94 he hissed at her, \'93you and Malfoy }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 didn\rquote t}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  do that, so why are you--\'94 
\par \'93That\rquote s right!\'94 Ginny said loudly, drowning him out and looking squarely at Professor Sprout. \'93I\rquote m a--a--scarlet woman!\'94 she said with some hesitancy, perhaps thinking about how all of this would sound to her mother, H
arry thought. Then he shuddered to think what Molly Weasley would think of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . He thought he\rquote d much rather be suspended from school than face Ginny\rquote 
s mother on charges of attempting to seduce her baby girl. 
\par Harry covered his face with his hands; peering between his fingers he saw that Snape had an evil-looking half-smile. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Oh, you\rquote 
re just enjoying this to pieces. Harry Potter, Head Boy, suspended for sneaking into the staff wing with his girlfriend. Brilliant.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par \'93Well, Miss Weasley, you may be whatever color of the rainbow you choose, but you }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 cannot}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  do it outside of your house after nine o\rquote 
clock at night. As this is your first infraction you will serve three detentions. With, I should think, Professor Sprout,\'94 he said, nodding to his colleague, who was surve
ying Ginny with tight-lipped disapproval. Ginny looked more than a little cowed by this prospect. 
\par \'93As for what to do with the two of you tonight, Professor Sinistra and I will escort you both back to Gryffindor Tower. After that we will inform Professor McGonagall of what has occurred here.\'94 He bowed slightly to Professor Sprout. \'93
I expect you are tired from your greenhouse duties, Professor. You will be wanting to go to your rooms...\'94 
\par She nodded to him, patting her hair, still appearing quite flustered. \'93Yes, Professor. Thank you for taking care of this.\'94 She surveyed Ginny with a gimlet eye. \'93I\rquote ll see you for detention at seven o\rquote 
clock sharp tomorrow morning, my girl,\'94 she said to Ginny. 
\par Her jaw dropped. \'93Detention in the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 morning}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 !\'94 
\par \'93Until nine o\rquote clock,\'94 Professor Sprout pronounced. 
\par Harry protested, \'93But we usually go running at that time. And she\rquote ll miss breakfast!\'94 
\par \'93Well, she should have thought of that before planning this little tryst with }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , shouldn\rquote t she?\'94 Professor Sprout sniffed. She glared at Ginny. \'93Seven o
\rquote clock sharp, down at the greenhouses,\'94 she intoned before turning and entering the staff wing. A very subdued Harry and Ginny followed Snape and Sinistra through the corridors, sneaking glances at each other periodically. Harry longed to 
reach out and take her hand; she really had been magnificent. She could have got away without getting into any trouble at all. He was glad that this was her first time being caught out-of-bounds, so she wouldn\rquote 
t be suspended. Mrs. Weasley might not hear about Ginny\rquote s detentions with Professor Sprout, but if Ginny were sent home to the Burrow, the reason for it would be bound to come out. 
\par When they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady, Harry gave the password and started to follow Ginny into the common room; Snape detained him. \'93Go ahead, Miss Weasley. Professor Sinistra will escort you up to your dormitory.\'94
 He nodded to his colleague. \'93I need to discuss Mr. Potter\rquote s suspension with him.\'94 
\par Ginny gave him a sympathetic smile as she entered Gryffindor Tower, followed by Sinistra. Harry turned to Snape, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 feeling that there was a particular resemblance between him and his old dad at this moment. This Snape was behaving far too much like the one who\rquote d spent Harry\rquote s first year making his life a misery. And second year. And third year.... 

\par \'93You will report to the entrance hall with your luggage at seven o\rquote clock sharp, Potter,\'94 he said in a quietly ominous voice. \'93I will accompany you to the village hall, along with another operative, where you can Apparate to my uncle
\rquote s apothecary in Dunoon. It is no longer possible to Apparate in and out of Ascog Castle, and the fireplaces can only be used to communicate. There has been a security lockdown there in anticipation of your arrival...\'94 
\par Harry frowned. \'93What? }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 In anticipation}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par Snape sighed. \'93Use your head, Potter. No progress has been made in finding Lucius Malfoy for the last three weeks. With Draco Malfoy living here, as well as Miss Kirkner, whose selkie skin is in Malfoy\rquote 
s possession, it is generally agreed that Hogwarts castle is no longer the safest place for you. I have been finding it extremely tedious to keep track of you during this time,\'94 he said, sounding quite irritated, and Harry dropped his jaw. He\rquote 
d been }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 spying}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  on him! Snape ignored his reaction. \'93Malfoy
 has managed to infiltrate the school before. We are taking every precaution to prevent him from doing this again, but the headmaster agrees that it would be prudent to also remove you from the premises, without making it seem planned. You will be permitt
ed to continue with your studies while you are away for a fortnight, by which time we will hopefully have Malfoy in custody.\'94 He looked amused now as he said to Harry, \'93Luckily, young people have }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 rather}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  predictable hormonal urges....Oh, and hand over the map.\'94 
\par Harry wanted to say a thing or two about Snape\rquote s own \'93hormonal urges,\'94 but he instinctively put his hand over his pocket. He tried to make this seem innocent. \'93What map?\'94 Did he sound unconcerned about it? he wondered. \'93
And what are you saying? Was--was all of this a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 set up}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 he demanded, incredulous. Was even }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Dumbledore}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  in on it? He was unpleasantly reminded of when he'd gone on trial for causing his mother's death, in his other life... 
\par Snape peered at him. \'93Miss Dougherty told me what her sister ask
ed of her. I had already expressed my concerns to her and the headmaster that if Lucius Malfoy found a way to influence or control Draco Malfoy or Mariah Kirkner, you could be in danger, especially if Malfoy managed to deliver his son to the Dark Lord, wh
o
 could bend him to his will. We still need to be concerned about that Obedience Charm. After I spoke to the headmaster we both agreed that if you were suspended it would be an excellent cover story to explain your leaving the castle, to avoid there being 
any appearance of paranoia concerning Mr. Malfoy\rquote s and Miss Kirkner\rquote 
s presence here. Miss Dougherty provided the perfect means to accomplish that, and she is hopeful that her sister will forgive her quickly, as the goal was to keep you safe. If you hadn\rquote t been }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 planning}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to be out-of-bounds, we would have needed to invent a reason, so for once your predilection for rule-breaking is }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 useful}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94
 he said dryly, raising one eyebrow. \'93You will be safe at Ascog; during the interim we can monitor Mr. Malfoy and Miss Kir
kner, as well as continuing to try to locate the elder Mr. Malfoy. Several operatives will be living with you at Ascog, and the concealment spells have been altered so that even magical people can no longer see the castle. It will appear, to Muggles and m
agical folk alike, to be an abandoned old wreck, just the shell of a centuries-old tower house on the edge of the loch. The only way anyone can find it is if the Secret Keeper divulges the location to them.\'94 
\par Harry was shocked. \'93Secret Keeper! Who\rquote s the Secret Keeper?\'94 
\par Snape\rquote s mouth had gone very thin. \'93Never mind. I\rquote ve said too much. Professor Sinistra will be back any moment. Be in the entrance hall at seven o\rquote clock. Now, I\rquote 
ll say it again: hand over the map. We need it to keep track of Mr. Malfoy and Miss Kirkner. They are members of my house; I have a right to do this. Surely even }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 cannot object.\'94 
\par Harry grimaced as he removed the map from his pocket. \'93Here,\'94 he said reluctantly. \'93To activate it you say, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 To deactivate it you say, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Mischief managed.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Snape\rquote s mouth was twisting again. \'93How--like your father and his friends,\'94 he said sardonically, forcing Harry to bite back a retort. Snape pocketed the parchment. \'93Goodnight, Potter.\'94
 He nodded at Harry, who began to climb into the common room. 
\par \'93Good night,\'94 Harry said, feeling more than a little irritated. He didn\rquote t add a \'93sir\'94 this time. Professor Sinistra appeared and climbed out of the portrait hole, a distinct look of disapproval in her dark eyes. 
\par He felt betrayed. Had Ginny had a part in it? He didn\rquote t think so; Snape had said it was Maggie who\rquote d told him. He was seething in general now, and stomped across the common room to the stairs, feeling like he wouldn\rquote 
t sleep at all, he was so angry. He understood that it was for his safety, but that didn\rquote t make him feel any better about it all. He'd been wanted to spend the night with Ginny, not with a proper snit and a general feeling of
 discontent. Knowing that Snape was going back to the staff wing, where Maggie was waiting for him, only made matters worse. He spent a good deal of time punching his pillow into shape before finally attempting to sleep, imagining, with each blow, that th
e pillow was Severus Snape.

d accompanied them, reached the village hall the next morning, Harry had turned to Snape and said bitterly, \'93I reckon this means that I can\rquote t go to see my aunt on the twent
ieth of March, now. Sirius was going to ask Professor Dumbledore for permission for me to do that, but now that\rquote ll be my first day back, after my suspension.\'94 
\par Snape\rquote s eyes betrayed no emotion. \'93I am aware of that arrangement, and on the contrary--it will 
be a further excuse for you to be away from the castle. We will not tell anyone that you are going, naturally. And everyone involved will be disguised. But that has not been canceled. I will also be with you.\'94
 Harry nodded; that was something, at least. He\rquote d be able to see Ron and Hermione again, and maybe even spend the night with Ginny, if Ron didn\rquote t interfere. 
\par Even though his suspension was essentially a ruse, Harry felt more than a little abashed when Sirius\rquote  mother met him at the harbor where Duncan M
acDermid had tied up the yacht he used to get them down to the Isle of Bute from Dunoon. (It was a borrowed vessel, as the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Patricia}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 was being given a much-deserved rest, and they didn\rquote t want anyone recognizing their craft.) When Harry had Apparated to the apothecary shop with Fletcher, Snape\rquote 
s uncle had greeted him tersely, his mouth drawn into a grim line; Remus Lupin was already there, waiting for them. Harry had had to leave Sandy behind with Ron, but Remus said that he\rquote d probably be able to fetch her fo
r him within a couple of days; he needed to go to Hogwarts to have a meeting with Dumbledore and Sirius concerning the Lucius Malfoy situation, and Remus said he might also come to Stonehenge with them. 
\par Remus was at least a bit friendly upon seeing Harry (friendlier than Harry\rquote 
s sixth-year Potions Master), but he also looked a bit distracted. Initially, he told Harry to remain belowdecks during the short trip down the Firth of Clyde, but he reminded him that MacDermid would probably need his help. Finally,
 Harry switched clothes with Remus, who stayed as close as possible to Harry without getting underfoot. Fletcher, for his part, spent the time spewing over the side. Remus also looked green from time to time. 
\par Sirius\rquote  mother was silent while driving him, Remus and Fletcher to Ascog Cottage, though which they all had to enter Ascog Castle. When they had drawn near to the castle, Harry got quite a shock, even though he\rquote 
d been warned about it. He could no longer see it as it really was, a rebuilt tower house r
eaching up to the sky; he saw instead a ruin with partial walls around its square foundations, the grey late-winter sky not the least bit obscured by the crumbling carcass. He swallowed, but Sirius\rquote 
 mother seemed cheerful enough as she drove, so he tried to remain calm and remember the house as he\rquote d last seen it. 
\par When he\rquote d reached the Hogwarts entrance hall that morning, to his surprise, Snape had told him where to find the Black house; Harry wondered why on earth he would do such a thing, but then Harry had realized }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
He\rquote s the Secret Keeper.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Of all people to be protecting the Black house! Harry hadn\rquote t thanked him. He didn\rquote 
t speak during the entire time they were walking to the village hall. He was more than a little cross with Severus Snape for his part in setting him up to be suspended. He wasn\rquote t interested in pretending to be all right about it, plus he\rquote 
d given Harry a long essay to write while he was suspended. 
\par After four days at Ascog, Harry was pacing his room, feeling like a caged animal, even though he knew that he had the run of the house. He\rquote d gone down to the pool every day, which helped relax him a little, and he\rquote 
d written some letters to Ginny, Ron and Hermione, which the Blacks' owl had delivered for him (he'd left Hedwig at Hogwarts), but he was still feeling at loose ends. He could work on Snape\rquote s essay, and another for McGonagall, but he wasn\rquote 
t feeling very motivated. Finally, he decided to explore; he\rquote d never taken the time to get to know Ascog. He couldn\rquote t run around the loch and didn\rquote t have 
lessons, Quidditch or trying to sneak off with Ginny to occupy him, so he thought he might as well learn more about the Black home, which was also his home now. 
\par Sirius\rquote  room shared the top floor with his bedroom; there wasn\rquote t much to see, but on the wall above the desk Harry noticed a familiar photograph: Sirius and Harry\rquote s parents on his parents\rquote 
 wedding day. They were all young and happy, laughing at something probably long forgotten. Harry reached out to touch his mother\rquote s face, then withdrew his hand a
gain; he no longer wondered what it would be like to grow up with her. He knew. He thought of the day she\rquote 
d broken down in her office and confessed that she did love him, but was afraid to love him at the same time, because he was destined to be a Death Eater. 
\par \'93You never meant me to be a Death Eater, Mum,\'94 he said softly, looking at her young, unlined face. The face he\rquote 
d come to know in his other life had become care-worn, dark circles under her eyes, even a few grey hairs amidst the deep red. He had seen 
her by turns frustrated, angry, strict, disappointed and distraught (especially when Stuart died). When he and his brothers and sister had been very young, she\rquote 
d even been indulgent, at times. He remembered her hugging and kissing him goodnight when he was
 very small and she was expecting the twins, calling him her little lion cub. He briefly patted the image of his laughing father, remembering his ghost scolding him in the Quidditch changing rooms. \'93She\rquote s back with you, where she belongs,\'94
 he whispered. 
\par Other than the one photo on the wall, Sirius\rquote  room was like a monk\rquote s cell. Even snooping in the desk drawers didn\rquote t net Harry anything more interesting than some old }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Daily Prophets}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . He went down a flight, where he decided to skip over both the guest room and Alan and Ursula\rquote s bedroom. He continued on down to the second floor, where the children\rquote 
s rooms were. Like the other bedrooms, these also had large bay windows overlooking the ground floor courtyard. He tried Leo and Orion\rquote s first. Now that Orion was off at Hogwarts, Leo had it to himself, but he didn\rquote 
t seem especially happy about this. 
\par Leo Pierson was sitting at his desk, writing, when Harry knocked at the door, which was already slightly ajar. Leo put down his quill when Harry pushed the door open a little and poked his face in. \'93Hullo. Didn\rquote t realize you were home.\'94 

\par Leo\rquote s mouth was open very slightly; he looked as though he was thinking }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Harry Potter is in my room! Harry Potter is in my--}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 He snapped his mouth shut again, evidently realizing that he was gawping at Harry. \'93Yeah,\'94 he said, his still-high voice sounding a bit strangled. \'93
It actually takes a bit longer for us to get home from school these days. We used to take Floo to our cousin Ian\rquote s, then get the school bus from there, since it can\rquote t trave
l across water. Now Dad drives us over to Wemyss Bay on the first ferry of the morning. He\rquote s not upset, though; he finally talked Mum into letting him buy a car.\'94 
\par Harry laughed. \'93Your grandmother used his car to drive us from the harbor. I noticed it\rquote s a Mercedes,\'94 he said, remembering how Leo\rquote s sister had come by her name. Leo nodded. 
\par \'93Yeah, but you may also have noticed that it\rquote s a really old one. It\rquote s all he could afford. It was made the same year that Uncle Sirius was born.\'94 
\par \'93That old, eh?\'94 Harry grinned. Leo didn\rquote t seem to understand why. 
\par \'93It\rquote s ancient. And Dad loves messing about with the engine. Mum says he\rquote s just like Uncle Sirius used to be about his motorbike.\'94 
\par Harry was glad that Leo had relaxed; he was speaking quite naturally now, and Harry realized that he\rquote d hardly had any chance at all to get to know the ten-year-old during the Christmas holiday or during the previous summer. 
\par \'93Well, I\rquote m getting to know your house a bit better. Can I have a tour of your room?\'94 
\par Leo\rquote s eyes opened wide and he sprang to his feet. \'93Sure. Okay, erm, well, there\rquote s my desk,\'94 he said feebly, waving his hand over the messy surface. 
\par \'93Homework?\'94 Harry suggested. 
\par Leo shook his head. \'93Letter to Orion.\'94 He frowned. \'93I can\rquote t wait until I get to go to Hogwarts. I\rquote ve got a calendar where I\rquote m counting off the days until I can get my wand.\'94 
\par Harry grinned at him. \'93I used to have a calendar where I marked off the days between the terms every year. I could never wait to get back to Hogwarts.\'94 
\par Leo looked at him in awe now. \'93But--but you were }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 suspended}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 he breathed. \'93For a fortnight. And--you\rquote re }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Head Boy.}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Harry pressed his lips together. \'93I did something stupid. Being Head Boy is no guarantee that you\rquote re never going to do something stupid. It\rquote s also no guarantee that you\rquote re going to escape punishment if you do something stupid.\'94 

\par \'93In fact,\'94 came a high, soft voice from the doorway, \'93it\rquote s probably a guarantee that you\rquote re }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 going to escape punishment. They had to make an example of you,\'94 Mercy Pierson said, watching Harry and Leo with her arms crossed. 
\par Harry was startled, but Mercy was an inherently startling child. Her pale eyes shone out from under her dark brows, luminous and disturbing. 
\par \'93Hullo, Mercy. How are you?\'94 He decided to look at her chin while speaking to her. 
\par \'93Why is it,\'94 she began, \'93that adults think they can distract children by just being polite?\'94 
\par Harry frowned; he hadn\rquote t been trying to do that. \'93An adult? Me?\'94 He stopped and thought for a moment. \'93I certainly don\rquote t feel like an adult.\'94 
\par \'93But you are,\'94 Leo said quickly. \'93You\rquote re of age. You have your Apparition license. And remember, last summer Uncle Sirius said we\rquote re to behave for you, like the other adults.\'94 
\par \'93Well, I can\rquote t exactly Apparate here,\'94 Harry reminded him. 
\par \'93Yeah. Mum\rquote s not too happy,\'94 Leo said, grimacing. \'93And Nana and Granddad. Aunt Cass and Uncle Floyd are }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 really}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  upset. Dad\rquote s the only one who doesn\rquote 
t mind. He can\rquote t Apparate very well.\'94 
\par \'93And he gets to have another Mercedes now, besides your sister,\'94 Harry said with a grin. 
\par Mercy looked cross about that, folding her arms more tightly. But to his surprise, she didn\rquote t comment on her father\rquote s car. Instead, she said, \'93That was much better.\'94 
\par \'93What was?\'94 Harry asked in confusion. 
\par \'93The way you changed the subject. A lot smoother than just saying, \lquote How are you?\rquote \'94 
\par \'93Erm, okay,\'94 Harry said awkwardly. \'93You interrupted us, you know. Leo was showing me his room.\'94 He\rquote d been trying to put her in her place, but he didn\rquote t think he succeeded. 
\par \'93Thank you,\'94 Mercy said to this. Harry frowned again. He had thought that maybe he didn\rquote t understand eight-year-old girls, but he was quickly coming to the conclusion that his problem was with }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 this}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  eight-year-old girl in particular. 
\par \'93Thank you for--\'94 he prompted her. 
\par \'93--for telling the truth.\'94 
\par Harry felt more than a little cross. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 You\rquote d think everything I ever said was a lie.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I like that girl}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 a voice hissed from under his shirt. 
\par \'93You stay out of this,\'94 Harry hissed back at Sandy. Remus had brought her from Hogwarts the day before. Different operatives had been circulating in and out of the house since he'd arrived. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 There is no need to be snippy}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 Sandy informed him, sounding a bit snippy herself. 
\par \'93Ooh!\'94 Leo said suddenly. \'93That\rquote s right! Uncle Sirius told us about your snake. I almost forgot that you speak Parseltongue. Can I see her? Your snake?\'94 
\par Harry took out Sandy and let the children see and touch her, followed by Leo finishing the tour of his room and Mercy showing him her room, while Leo made disparaging remarks about her dolls. She stuck her tongue out at h
er brother and Harry had to stop himself from giving them detentions, reminding himself that he wasn\rquote t at school. 
\par \'93You be nice, Leo Pierson, or I\rquote ll take out my eyeballs,\'94 Mercy said to him 
\par Harry dropped his jaw. It seemed like an odd threat. He turned to Leo. \'93She doesn\rquote t mean that.\'94 
\par Leo looked guilelessly at Harry. \'93Oh, she does,\'94 he said calmly. \'93She knows I hate it.\'94 He gave a little shudder. \'93It\rquote s like looking into something with }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 bloody}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  eyes...\'94 
\par Harry shuddered himself, remembering the bloody eye-sockets of the blinded basilisk. He looked at Mercy. \'93You shouldn\rquote t say things like that, Mercy.\'94 
\par The disturbingly eyes looked calmly at him. \'93I\rquote m not just saying it. Mum hates it, but not as much as Leo. I\rquote m blind,\'94 she said simply to Harry. \'93No one told you?\'94 
\par \'93No! I\rquote d no idea. You get around so well, and you never bump into things. Those are glass eyes? They look so real!\'94 And yet, he thought, they could look }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 more}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 real. That certainly explained a lot, he thought. 
\par Leo laughed. \'93Oh, she\rquote s not }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 really}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  blind. Well, she is. What I mean is--\'94 
\par But Mercy had taken out her eyes after all and was holding them in her hands; empty eye-sockets stared at Harry from beneath beetle-black brows. He fought back the scream trying to get out of the back of his throat. \'93
What he means is I have magical eyes.\'94 
\par \'93Don\rquote t }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 do}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  that!\'94 Leo complained, covering his own eyes so he couldn\rquote 
t see her. Without hesitating, she popped the magical eyes back into place; they swiveled uncertainly for a moment, then righted themselves and stared directly at Harry. He felt a bit faint. 
\par \'93Erm,\'94 was all he could think to say. 
\par \'93You weren\rquote t expecting that, were you?\'94 she said, correctly judging this. 
\par He swallowed. \'93Not for a minute,\'94 he admitted. \'93I--I know someone else with a magical eye,\'94 he said, trying to forgot how she\rquote d looked without her eyes. \'93Mad-Eye Moody.\'94 
\par She nodded. \'93I know all about him. All magical eyes used to be like his, too strong, but they got better at making them more like normal eyes. The way they behave, anyway. But since
 he was an Auror he wanted to have one of the old-style eyes, from before they improved them so that people weren't seeing through wall and things. As if }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that's}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 an improvement. I know they say it's a distraction to see through things, but still...When I first heard about his eye, I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 begged}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Mum and Dad to get }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  eyes that could do that, but they said I get into enough trouble without being able to do that.\'94 
\par Harry breathed a little easier. \'93So, you can\rquote t--\'94 
\par \'93--I can\rquote t see through walls or my own head, no,\'94 she admitted. She sighed. \'93When I grow up I\rquote m going to get some really }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 good}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  eyes. These are so }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 boring}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93Most people don\rquote t have that option. Were--were you born blind?\'94 
\par She shook her head. \'93Accident. Dad had bought some magical fireworks, and when I was four and Orion was eight, we got into them. One exploded without warning, and--\'94 
\par Harry winced. \'93Ow. Sorry.\'94 
\par She sighed. \'93It was the bright light that did it, really. You have to be careful with magical fireworks. I looked right at it, from about two feet away. It\rquote s meant to be seen when it\rquote s far up in the sky, at night.\'94 
\par \'93Worse than looking right at the sun,\'94 Leo confirmed. 
\par \'93And magic couldn\rquote t just--just }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 heal}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  you?\'94 
\par Mercy scrutinized him, and he tried not to be distracted by the fact that he knew her eyes weren\rquote 
t real. He realized that another disturbing thing about them, apart from the very pale silvery-grey color, was that the pupils never changed size, the way a normal person\rquote s pupils would in different lights. \'93There\rquote s only so much mag
ic can do, you know. It was easier to take out the damaged ones and put in magical replacements.\'94 
\par \'93Didn\rquote t they have a variety of colors?\'94 he ventured, hoping she wouldn\rquote t be insulted. 
\par She laughed. \'93I could have chosen a darker color. Except for blue; those are the ones like Moody's. I chose this pair because they look cool. Other people think they\rquote re weird. They can\rquote t ignore me.\'94 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 That\rquote s for sure,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry thought, unable to take his own eyes off her pale irises. 
\par He thanked the children for the tour and continued down the stairs, going past the bedrooms belonging to Mr. and Mrs. Black and to Sirius\rquote  oldest sister and her husband. In the sitting room he found Sirius\rquote 
 mother sitting by the fire, reading a newspaper. \'93Oh, hullo, Mrs. Black,\'94 Harry said politely. She smiled placidly at him. 
\par \'93Hello, Harry. Out and about, I see.\'94 
\par He nodded. \'93I reckon I could spend a fortnight in just my room and the pool, but then I\rquote d probably be sent off to St. Mungo\rquote s after that, instead of back to Hogwarts.\'94 
\par She looked rather sternly at him now. \'93I know that Sirius is in charge of you, but when he and your father were suspended during }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 their}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 seventh year, I made them stay upstairs and didn\rquote t allow them to use the pool,\'94 she said stiffly. Harry goggled at her. 
\par \'93My dad and Sirius were suspended? Why?\'94 But even as he asked, he knew why. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 The Prank.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Trying to get another student killed. Only--his dad had saved Snape. 
\par She cleared her throat. \'93Well, it\rquote s not really my place to say...\'94 
\par \'93Was it because Remus almost killed Snape?\'94 he asked her. \'93Because I don\rquote t see why my father should have been suspended for that. He saved Snape\rquote s life.\'94 
\par She patted down her robes. \'93Ah, you know about that. Well, at the time, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  didn\rquote t even know that Remus was a werewolf. So the story the school gave us
 was that Sirius and your father had been out after hours, sneaking into Hogsmeade, and were trying to lure another student into leaving as well. I didn\rquote t learn of what occurred until last year.\'94 
\par Harry nodded. \'93That\rquote s right--Dumbledore was trying to keep Remus a secret.\'94 
\par She sniffed. \'93There is such a thing as }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 too many secrets}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , in my opinion.\'94 
\par Harry agreed. \'93I know what you mean.\'94 He sighed. \'93For instance, my aunt and uncle never told me anything about my parents when I was growing up. I only recently learned about my grandmother having been in Clan MacGregor, but I still don\rquote 
t know much at all about the Potters. Don\rquote t I have }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 any}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Potter relatives?\'94 
\par She drew her mouth into a line. \'93Not by blood. You have an elderly aunt by marriage. Great aunt, actually. Or great great. Something like that. She\rquote s in Alaska, I think. If you\rquote 
d like to look through the old family Bible, you could find out more. It was rescued from your poor parents\rquote  house after they died...\'94
 She rose and pulled down a book from the shelves near the fireplace; it was quite as large as some of the largest spell books in the Hogwarts library. The leather cover bore a symbol that looked like an upside-down \'93V.\'94 \'93That\rquote 
s a drafting compass,\'94 she explained. \'93The Masonic symbol. And this is a pickaxe,\'94 she continued, moving her finger to that image. 
\par Harry frowned. Strange things to have on a family Bible. She laid it on the low table before
 the sofa and opened it in the middle; there were a number of thick parchment pages inserted between the whisper-thin pages of the actual Bible. The thicker pages bore the record of the family births, baptisms, marriages and deaths. Harry flipped to the l
ast parchment page with writing on it and found the record of his own birth. Only one event appeared after that--someone had written the date that his parents had been killed. 
\par He sat next to Callisto Black on the squashy sofa and turned the pages backwards, seeing the record of his parents\rquote  marriage, of his own father\rquote s birth, of his grandparents\rquote  marriage. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Elspeth King to Henry Potter at St. Andrew\rquote s, Glasgow.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  His grandfather\rquote s birth in Godric\rquote s Hollow, Wales. His great-grandfather\rquote s birth, and the birth o
f his brother, Jeremy, who later married an Othalie Chatham. There were no children from the marriage. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 She must be the aunt-by-marriage who\rquote s in Alaska,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought. 

\par Harry continued moving backwards through the nineteenth century, and then the eighteenth and seventeenth. To his surprise, the very first name in the book--a birth--recorded in the late sixteenth century was not }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Potter}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  but }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Pitter}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . He reckoned that a lot of people weren\rquote 
t very good at writing in those days. But then he looked much more closely at the other early entries; they all said \'93Pitter.\'94 He hadn\rquote t been looking very closely at the last names, assuming them all to be the same. 
\par \'93Erm,\'94 he said uncertainly, \'93did my father mention the family name changing?\'94 
\par Mrs. Black looked where he was pointing and nodded. \'93Oh, that wasn\rquote t unusual. And I remember that your grandfather actually told me that before that, the story in the family went, the name was just plain }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Pitt}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . It had been changed from }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Pict}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , before that. Very old family, you have. The Picts w
ere here long before the Scots came to the west coast of Scotland, from Ireland.\'94 
\par \'93So,\'94 he said, frowning, \'93that still doesn\rquote t explain why the changes were made.\'94 
\par \'93Well, you know mining has been going on here in Britain for quite some time. It was about 
a thousand years ago that coal started to replace wood and charcoal as a common fuel in the British Isles. Henry the Third granted a Royal Charter for the mining of coal at Newcastle over seven-hundred years ago. Your family were miners going way back. Wh
y do you think there\rquote s a pickaxe on the front of that Bible? That\rquote s what a Pitter is, after all. One who goes \lquote doon the pit,\rquote  as they say.\'94 
\par \'93As }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 who}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  says?\'94 
\par She laughed. \'93The pit means down into the mines. Colliers. That's where the Black family name comes from as well. 'Coleman' was another common name for colliers. Harry once told me--\'94 Harry looked at her, very confused, so she explained, \'93
I mean your grandfather, of course. That\rquote s what everyone called him. He once told me that the family wasn\rquote t called \lquote Potter\rquote  until moving to Godric\rquote 
s Hollow. Trying to get away from the mining tradition, put it behind them. His dad was Muggle, but his mum was the last heiress to the fortune of Bowman Wright. That\rquote s where the money comes from, of course.\'94 
\par \'93Bowman Wright?\'94 The name sounded familiar to him, but he wasn\rquote t sure why. He knew he\rquote d heard it somewhere. 
\par \'93You didn\rquote t ever wonder? Bowman Wright invented the Golden Snitch. He became a rich man because of that.\'94 
\par Harry dropped his jaw. \'93You mean, the Snitch I go after when I play Quidditch?\'94 
\par She nodded at him. \'93You\rquote re descended from the inventor. Yes.\'94 
\par Harry shook his head. \'93I never knew. Wow. I\rquote m related to a famous wizard!\'94 he crowed, then colored, remembering that he was rather famous himself. 
\par She raised an eyebrow at him. \'93You have no idea. And it\rquote s not as though you\rquote re the only one. Bowman Wright came from Godric Gryffindor\rquote s line, but then, so did others.\'94 
\par Harry dropped his jaw. \'93Gryffindor? I\rquote m--I\rquote m actually related to Godric Gryffindor?\'94 
\par She sniffed. \'93Well, he had three children, you know, and they all married. Oh, of course, the son was illegitimate and didn\rquote t have his name, and his daughters didn\rquote 
t carry on his name either. He was the first and last one to have the surname, \lquote Gryffindor.\rquote \'94 
\par Harry narrowed his eyes, thinking. \'93Wait--I\rquote m remembering the story now. His son was the one born to his wife\rquote s sister, the one who was supposed to marry Slytherin...\'94 
\par It was Callisto Black\rquote s turn to look surprised. \'93Well! I\rquote m surprised you know that story! That one didn\rquote t make it into }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Hogwarts, A History}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, after all. Too risqu\'e9 for some, I imagine. How do you know it?\'94 
\par He looked at her grimly. \'93That\rquote s why I\rquote m here, in part. Because of the descendent of Slytherin\rquote s fiancee, the one he cursed and turned into a selkie. My--my friend, Mariah, is descended from her. She\rquote 
s a selkie. And her mum, too. She\rquote s the one Lucius Malfoy kidnapped, and he stole Mariah\rquote s selkie skin, too. Mariah told me the story.\'94 
\par Mrs. Black shook her head. \'93No family loyalty, that man. I shouldn\rquote t be surprised...\'94 
\par Harry frowned again. \'93What do you mean?\'94 
\par \'93Well, he\rquote s a distant relative, but a relative nonetheless. But he shows no respect...\'94 
\par \'93What?\'94 
\par \'93Malfoy. That was the surname of the twin sisters who were to marry Gryffindor and Slytherin. Gryffindor married his bride, of course. But Slytherin never married the other, and when she bore Gryffindor\rquote 
s child, she gave the child her own surname, Malfoy.\'94 
\par Harry couldn\rquote t believe it. \'93Godric Gryffindor\rquote s son was named }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Malfoy}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par She shook her head. \'93I couldn\rquote t believe it when young Draco Malfoy showed up here last summer. I had to bite my tongue at how funny it was to have all of you under the same roof. You, also from Gryffindor\rquote 
s line, young Malfoy, and then all of those Weasleys...\'94 
\par \'93What do the Weasleys have to do with anything?\'94 
\par She smiled. \'93I thought you knew the story? There were two brothers who married Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff. They were named Weasley. I reckon I shouldn\rquote t have been so surprised that you all happened to be here last sum
mer, now that I think about how terribly inbred some wizarding families are...\'94 She stopped quickly, reddening. \'93I\rquote m sorry. I didn\rquote t mean to imply--\'94 
\par \'93That\rquote s okay. I\rquote m trying to remember...Didn\rquote t Rowena Ravenclaw\rquote s son go up to Orkney with Gryffindor\rquote s son and marry Gryffindor\rquote s half-sister? So, she would have been a Malfoy on her mother\rquote 
s side, and she married a Weasley...\'94 He had to stop and laugh. Draco Malfoy would }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 die}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . It also meant that Draco and Mariah were probably very distantly related. As well a
s Draco and Ginny, and the rest of the Weasleys. 
\par \'93Wait--if I come from a Potter who married a Wright, who came from Gryffindor\rquote s son, who was named Malfoy, then }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I\rquote m}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  related to the Malfoys!\'94
 he said in horror. 
\par She patted his arm sympathetically. \'93Many quite decent people are. But actually, I think the Wrights came from one of Gryffindor\rquote s daughters. Don\rquote t take it to heart. It was a long time ago. A thousand years! I wouldn\rquote 
t worry about it...\'94 
\par He shook his head. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Even if the Wrights came from one of Gryffindor\rquote s daughters, their mother was still a Malfoy. Maybe that was the real reason the Sorting Hat wanted to put me into Slytherin.}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  He realized that, like Draco, he was also distantly related to Mariah, whose ancestor almost married Slytherin. She was devious enough that she probably }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 would}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  have been a good match for Slytherin, he realized. And considering that he had originally intended to give the amulet to his bride, and Harry might be one of her many descendants, it didn\rquote 
t seem so wrong for him to have the amulet. 
\par He took the amulet out of his shirt. \'93This is how Slytherin saw his bride betray him.\'94 
\par Now Callisto Black looked truly shocked. \'93Where on earth did you get that? No one\rquote s seen it for centuries! It was always assumed lost...\'94 
\par He grimaced. Should he give the version where he lived another life and gave it to himself, or the version where Munro Kirkner got it out of the lake and pawned it at Borgin and Burkes, where Ginny bought it? \'93It\rquote s a long story,\'94
 he said simply, fingering it lightly. 
\par She stared at him, speechless.

ams--at least they seemed so while he was dreaming them--which he could not remember in the morning. A general feeling of weirdness and forboding was all he retained from them. 
\par They took the Portkey from the entrance hall of the castle, arriving in the wiz
arding pub with their hoods up, obscuring their faces. While he still had his hood up, Harry concentrated and made his hair grow out so that it was covering his collar now, and he did the same with his facial hair, which he hadn\rquote 
t bothered shaving that morning. It wasn\rquote t as long as when he\rquote 
d gone to the British Museum in his other life, but it was all a lot longer than he usually wore it. He smoothed his fringe over his scar and took off his glasses, putting them in his pocket. The world around him was rather blurry now, but that couldn
\rquote t be helped. When he took down his hood, Sirius was jolted. 
\par \'93Hullo! I, erm, wasn\rquote t expecting that...\'94 
\par Harry grinned at him. \'93Just don\rquote t forget to call me \lquote Neville.\rquote  It\rquote s my alias, ever since third year. Long story. Herm--I mean, one of my best friends goes by \lquote Lavender.\rquote \'94 
\par Sirius smirked. \'93Oh really? And how did you do that, anyway? With your hair?\'94 
\par Harry shrugged. \'93Animagus training. Don\rquote t you do that?\'94 
\par He grimaced. \'93I reckon that\rquote s the difference between being trained up properly and cadging what you can out of books.\'94 He took what looked like a wrapped sweet out of his pocket. \'93Thank goodness for Weasley Wizard Wheezes,\'94
 he said, popping it into his mouth. He still had his hood up and was turned away from the bar patrons. After he\rquote 
d chewed and swallowed, his face starting to look as though it was in flux, the features and coloring shifting and pulsing, until it finally resolved itself into Aberforth Dumbledore, alias Dick Abernathy. Harry grinned at him. 
\par \'93Nice one, that. Hullo, Dick.\'94 
\par \'93Watch yer mouth, Neville.\'94 Sirius grinned at him with Aberforth\rquote s leathery face. 
\par \'93The thing is,\'94 Harry said, starting to worry, \'93how will the others know we\rquote re }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 us}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par \'93Perhaps it will be through your inimitable talent to be painfully }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 obvious}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94
 came a familiar voice at his elbow. Harry whirled, seeing the face of Duncan MacDermid (and hearing his voice, as well) but seeing a look in the eyes that was pure Severus Snape. He assumed that it was Maggie standing next to him; she bore the appeara
nce of a dark-haired witch he\rquote d never met, and her arm was laced through his. 
\par \'93Shall I call you--Peggy, perhaps?\'94 he said to her. 
\par \'93That could work,\'94 she agreed. \'93But then again--anyone who sees me who knows me will call me Dorcas Sinclair, so you should probably do the same.\'94 
\par When the others came forward, Harry had to get used to Ron being about six inches shorter and having short brown hair and dark eyes, Hermione being willowy and blonde and several inches taller than she\rquote d been, with hazel eyes, and Ginny-- 
\par \'93Erm,\'94 he said uncertainly. \'93Katie?\'94 
\par She grinned. \'93No, it\rquote s Ginny,\'94 she whispered in Katie\rquote s voice. \'93But you should probably call me Katie.\'94 He nodded, dumbfounded that she\rquote 
d taken on the appearance of his former girlfriend. He was also finding it interesting that Hermione was a blonde, and one that bore more than a passing resemblance to Fleur Delacour. He could tell that this also wasn\rquote t lost on Ron. 
\par \'93Remus is on another assignment, unfortunately, so he won't be joining us. Shall we be off?\'94 Sirius said in Aberforth\rquote s voice. 
\par They joined a long procession of robe-wearing people, many of whom Harry though had to be Muggles, based on their speech and behavior. They were playacting at being witches and wizards, which was mildly bizarre to him since the last time he\rquote 
d been out in a large crowd of wizards, for the Quidditch World Cup, the wizards were supposed to be imitating Muggles. He could spot some real witches and wizards i
n the crowd, who were visibly sneering at the Muggles and their games of pretend. Their clothes also had an air of authenticity, whereas the Muggle robes all looked too clean, too perfect. Their hats were especially odd looking. Snape saw him looking at a
 very stiff wizard\rquote s hat going by on the head of a Muggle wizard-wannabe. 
\par \'93Mass-produced,\'94 he sniffed. \'93The best hats are still hand-made.\'94 
\par Harry tried not to smile; he was still a bit cross with Snape. As they drew nearer to the standing stones, Harry looked around at the crowd in which he found himself; there were }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 people}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  as far as the eye could see. On the green plain around their goal there was also a sea of tents where some people had been camping out, which he was fairly certain would normally be frow
ned upon by the National Trust. It looked like it was shaping up to be far more than the thirty-thousand Hermione said were expected for the summer solstice, which was still three months away and usually more popular than the spring equinox. 
\par It was difficult for him to think of the tall blonde girl as Hermione, but he said to her, as she walked beside him, \'93Why are there so many people? This is just the spring, after all.\'94 
\par She grimaced. \'93Well, it\rquote s also Jeffries, isn\rquote t it? Not to mention that since you went away on suspension, there\rquote s been the whole NHS debacle...\'94 
\par He frowned. \'93What NHS debacle?\'94 He didn\rquote t know much about the National Health Service, but he had acquired his glasses through the NHS since he was very small. The thought made him take his glasses out and put them on, to see better. 
\par \'93Oh, they probably don\rquote t get any Muggle papers at Ascog, do they?\'94 She grimaced. \'93It\rquote s that Harrington-Smythe woman again. She\rquote s dismantled the National Health Service. I mean, if he cures Ron of being a werewolf, 
that would be one thing. It isn\rquote t as though he could just walk into a doctor\rquote s surgery and ask for something like that. But that\rquote 
s something--well, really extraordinary. The Prime Minister himself has been encouraging people to go to Jeffries as an alternative, even for little things, if you can believe it.\'94 
\par They finally drew near enough to see the ring of standing stones properly. With his glasses on, Harry could see that there was a broad stone in the center, over which Rodney Jeffries himself stood, wit
h his arms raised, welcoming the faithful. He wore a robe of purest white and presided over the huge stone as though it was an altar, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 his}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 altar, the place where someone or something would be sacrificed to the glory of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . Harry looked at Jeffries and swallowed.

As they approached the ring of standing stones, Harry looked about; for acres around, Salisbury Plain was a seething mass of humanity. Harry wondered how far away some of the Muggles had had to park. Shading his eyes with his hand and looking tow
ard the village from which they'd walked, he thought he saw a cluster of buses in a car park near where the village ended and the plain began. Had Jeffries been }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 busing}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 people to this event? he wondered. 
\par He heard music and turned his head; people were up o
n top of the stones that served as lintels, resting on top of the huge uprights that formed the ring. The lintels formed a circular walkway far above the ground. A murmuring rhythmic sound was coming from the people up there; Harry realized that they were
 singing the percussive beginning of Jeffries\rquote  theme song, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 The Impossible Dream}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .

\par The choir had to be a hundred strong, rather than the two dozen or so singers Harry had seen in Surrey. They were
 all wearing long apple-green robes, the color of spring. Many of the singers had wreaths of flowers on their heads. Beside him, Hermione clutched at his arm, a shocked look on her unfamiliar face. The blonde woman whose appearance she taken on was much p
aler than Hermione usually was, and her face was growing paler still. 
\par \'93What are they }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 doing}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94
 she said, aghast. Harry frowned. She tried to stand still, but the crowd made that impossible and they had to move forward whether they wanted to or not. Ron was on Hermione\rquote s other side and Katie--no, Ginny--was on Harry\rquote s right. 
\par \'93Well, you\rquote ve heard of singing, right?\'94
 Harry said, motioning with his head to the people on top of the stones, some of whom were starting to sing the lyrics while others continued to be a human orchestra, humming the chords in strict rhythm. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 To dream the impossible dream....To fight the unbeatable foe...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93Of course I\rquote ve heard of singing, Harry,\'94 she said acidly. \'93I mean--well }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 look}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  at them!\'94 she said, pointing. 
\par Ron, Harry and Ginny looked; they didn\rquote t know what Hermione was going on about. But then Maggie--he still had to ge
t used to her looking like Dorcas Sinclair, let alone calling her that--rushed up and grabbed Snape's arm, doing just what Hermione had done. 
\par \'93What are they }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 doing}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 Maggie exclaimed, also as though she had not heard of singing. \'93Every Muggle here will need to be memory-charmed!\'94 
\par Hermione looked at her triumphantly. \'93Thank you!\'94 she said, nodding at Maggie. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 To bear with unbearable sorrow...To run where the brave dare not go...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Harry turned to Snape, whom he had seen as Duncan MacDermid before, at the ceilidh in Hogsmeade in his fifth year. \'93I take it,\'94 Snape said to Maggie and Hermione, not bothering to imitate his uncle\rquote s accent, \'93
that you have both seen Muggle photos of this monument?\'94 Maggie and Hermione both nodded at him. His mouth went very thin. \'93Well, what is not generally known is that the people who created this did }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  allow it to fall into disrepair--they were probably the first magical people who thought to protect t
heir monuments by using a Confundus Charm to make Muggles believe that it was a ruin. It looks perfectly normal to those who are magical as long as they have never seen a representation of the ruined version }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 first}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . If that is what you expect to see, then it very likely appears to you at this moment as if those people are walking on air--\'94 he said, nodding to the singers atop the stones, \'93
--rather than on solid rock. The monument is actually completely intact. Just tell yourself it is so,\'94 he said to Maggie and Hermione. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 To right the unrightable wrong...To love, pure and chaste from afar...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Harry looked at Ginny, who took her sister\rquote s hand. Maggie nodded. \'93Like when I couldn\rquote t see Ascog Castle right off because I\rquote d seen a photo of the ruins first?\'94 Snape 
nodded to her. She closed her eyes, clearly concentrating very hard. Hermione held Ron\rquote s arm and did the same; when they both opened their eyes, they gasped. 
\par \'93Oh! I see it! You\rquote re right, it\rquote s there! Amazing! All this time!\'94 Hermione exclaimed. 
\par \'93Yes, but even though they assumed that the ruins would make it uninteresting, they didn\rquote 
t reckon on many things. For some time now the Ministry of Magic has had to work closely with the Prime Minister to ensure that the National Trust--which is about half wizard--keeps too many people from coming here,\'94 Snape told them. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 To try, when your arms are too weary...to reach the unreachable star!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par He snorted and added, \'93That idea has clearly gone up in smoke. The Muggles here also won\rquote t believe people can be walking on the air up there for very long; soon they\rquote 
ll all be able to see it for what it really is: a completely intact monument from thousands of years ago. And once they start seeing through }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 those}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  charms...\'94 
\par Hermione gasped. \'93Will they--will they start seeing through others?\'94 
\par Snape looked very grim. \'93It\rquote s a danger. We usually have walls separating the magical and Muggle worlds....This Jeffries is trying to bring them crashing down,\'94 he said quietly. Harry didn\rquote t think Snape shared Sirius\rquote 
 view of Jeffries\rquote  harmlessness. He swallowed. 
\par \'93No wonder he wanted my aunt working for him,\'94 Harry said slowly. \'93A witch who doesn\rquote t think about keeping magic hidden, who\rquote s had no formal training...\'94 
\par Sirius finally spoke, although Harry was still thinking of him as Aberforth. \'93Now, Harry. I\rquote ve never seen your aunt perform magic while working for Jeffries...\'94 
\par \'93Maybe she behaves herself when you\rquote re around, so you can\rquote t grass on her!\'94 he said hotly. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 This is my quest! To follow that star! No matter how hopeless! No matter how far!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93I saw what my aunt was capable of when she thought no one was watching. Her best friend caught her at it, cleaning the kitchen back in Surrey! She\rquote s never done }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 anything}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  in moderation, whether it\rquote s hating me or spoiling Dudley and Dunkirk. We have to find her!\'94
 he said in frustration, frowning at the sea of bodies moving steadily toward their goal, albeit more slowly than Harry would have liked. 
\par \'93The staff headquarters are in that large tent,\'94 Sirius said, pointing. They were approaching from the west, 
but they could easily see the huge white tent about thirty feet northeast of the stone circle; a steady stream of people were going in and out. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 To fight for the right...without question or pause...to be willing to march into hell for a heavenly cause!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93Your aunt will be there, probably giving out the press passes and checking credentials. We need to do a little swimming upstream to get there, but I think we can manage it.\'94 
\par They stuck together very closely and tried to make their way toward the large tent, but they kept getting pushed off-course and having to veer north again to compensate. 
\par The choir continued to sing while they moved toward the tent. Harry could see Muggles pointing at the stones, patting some of them and exclaiming, and he knew that t
he charms that had kept non-magical people from seeing Stonehenge as it truly was for thousands of years were no longer having any effect upon many of Jeffries\rquote  ecstatic followers. 
\par Glancing again at Ginny, who was wearing Katie\rquote s form, Harry was suddenly reminded of casting the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Revelatio}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  spell in Jeffries\rquote 
 tent and seeing the images of the Muggles, as though every person present had performed magic. And now he realized that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 they had.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  It wasn\rquote 
t necessarily to do with the music, as he\rquote d thought the previous summer. 
\par He turned to Snape. \'93Is--is seeing through a concealment charm itself a kind of magic?\'94 he wanted to know. 
\par He rubbed his chin--or Duncan MacDermid\rquote s chin--with his hand, looking thoughtful. \'93One might consider that to be magic...\'94 
\par \'93Because I think that\rquote s why there were magical signatures in Jeffries\rquote  tent! Last summer, I--er, Katie, that is--cast a Revelatio spell to find out whether he\rquote d been doing magic at his shows, and it looked like }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 everyone}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  there was doing magic. I think }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 this}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  is what they were doing. They were }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 believing}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ! That was the magic that was being performed!\'94 
\par Hermione stopped, gawping at him. \'93Are you saying that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 believing}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  something is the same as doing magic, Harry?\'94 
\par He was very excited. \'93It\rquote s a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 kind}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  of magic. Come on. We need to believe in what we\rquote 
re doing to cast spells. And if having the ability to believe that I can do something lets me do it, why shouldn\rquote t Muggles }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 believing}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  something also be a kind of magic?
\'94 They were farther from the singers now and the music had receded into the background. 
\par \'93When everyone knew about witches and wizards and magic, Muggles saw magic because they expected to, I reckon,\'94 Sirius said thoughtfully. \'93When magical people started hiding themselves from Muggles, it became rarer and rarer for most peop
le to see magic, and even when they did, much of the time they didn\rquote t think that was what they were seeing....\'94 
\par \'93They didn\rquote t }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 believe}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 Harry said excitedly. \'93They convinced themselves that they were seeing what they }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 expected}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to see, which is to say }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  magic...\'94 
\par \'93Is that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 also}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  a kind of magic?\'94 Ginny wondered softly. 
\par Snape seemed to consider this. \'93Self-delusion? In its way...\'94 
\par \'93They\rquote re just believing something else, but they\rquote re still believing,\'94 Harry said walking faster now in his excitement. \'93And they have to do that, convince themselves that they\rquote 
re seeing what they expect to see, because otherwise the world wouldn\rquote t make sense to them, and the world }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 has}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to make sense, or they\rquote d go mad.\'94 
\par Ron nodded. \'93I can speak from experience,\'94 he said grimly. 
\par Something else was percolating in Harry\rquote s brain though; he slowed down and walked on in silence, Ginny\rquote 
s arm linked in his. He stared into space, hardly paying attention to the other people around him as he tried to work though this new theory. 
\par \'93Well, here we are,\'94 Sirius said as they approached the tent. \'93I\rquote ve been to see Mrs. Dursley a number of times, so hopefully there won\rquote t be a problem...\'94 
\par \'93Aunt Petunia!\'94 Harry said suddenly. \'93That\rquote s it!\'94 
\par \'93What\rquote s it, Harry?\'94 Ginny wanted to know. 
\par He grinned at her. \'93That\rquote s how Aunt Petunia became a witch!\'94 
\par Sirius\rquote  brows drew together. \'93What }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 are}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  you talking about, Harry?\'94 
\par \'93Hear me out....When my grandmother was dying of cancer, Aunt Petunia wanted my mum to cure her. She }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 believed}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  that magic would save their mother. Then, when }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 she}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  got cancer, and she went to Jeffries, he told her to believe, and she }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 did}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ! But }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 what}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  she believed was that if she became a witch she could cure }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 herself}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286

\par He paced excitedly. \'93And Jeffries....he tells that story about Voldemort attacking him in Westminster station. Perhaps it was because Voldemort had just got his body back and his magic wasn\rquote t quite normal again yet, I don\rquote 
t know, but when he attacked Jeffries, I think that because he was a Squib, Jeffries believed that if only he was magical, he could do something to protect himself. That\rquote s what he believed was necessary for him to be safe and when Voldemo
rt cursed him }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 that\rquote s what happened!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  He became a wizard! Perhaps his }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 belief}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 interacted with Voldemort\rquote s spell somehow. And I think since then Jeffries has worked it out--that the basis of all magic is }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 belief}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , and that if you can }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 truly}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  believe something you can make it so. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 That\rquote s}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  why he tells people to believe. But I don
\rquote t think he can make just anyone magical--I think he can only do it for people who }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 know}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  about magic, and who believe that that\rquote 
s what they need. Someone like my aunt would know about magic because of my mum, and she was convinced that magic would cure }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 her}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  mum, so I think that\rquote s why she thought }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 she}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  needed to be a witch. Jeffries knows about magic because he\rquote s a Squib. Or was one. You see?\'94 
\par \'93I think so,\'94 Hermione said uncertainly. \'93But magical g
enes are still what determine what sort of magic you can do, and how powerful you are. Your aunt had a magical sister, and probably had some magical genes already. Jeffries was a Squib, so he had magical parents and also probably already had some magical 
genes, just not enough, until the Westminster attack...\'94 
\par \'93So, a combination, then, of belief and magical genes. But remember what Dumbledore said about Muggles collectively doing magic? When they put their magical genes together in one place, along with belief...\'94 
\par He felt very excited, very close to figuring something out, bouncing on the balls of his feet as Sirius drew back the tent flap and ushered them inside one of the less-well traveled openings. The tent seemed to be divided up into a maze of cubicl
es; it was very stuffy, despite sweeping up and up. It was several stories high and listening to the noise contained within it was like holding up a conch shell to one\rquote 
s ear, except that the roar of the ocean had been amplified a thousand times. And it was
 just as intelligible. Hermione and Ginny immediately put their fingers in their ears. A middle-aged balding man in a spring-green robe was passing by in a sort of corridor between the cubicles, but when he saw them he immediately stopped and entered the 
cubicle into which they\rquote d all stumbled, pointed his finger at them accusingly. 
\par \'93\rquote Ere now, \lquote oo are }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par \'93Armin!\'94 Sirius said, extending his hand, grinning. The man didn\rquote t take it. Sirius was confused. \'93It\rquote s me. John--\'94 
\par Snape suddenly trod heavily on his foot, and Harry was standing close enough to him to hear him whisper, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Wrong face, you idiot.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93Erm,\'94 Sirius said feebly. \'93My--my friend John Norwich said I should come see you. Didn\rquote t he say anything? We\rquote re here to see Mrs. Petunia Dursley.\'94 
\par Armin looked surprised; what hair he had left was very dark, as were his heavy brows, under which his small suspicious eyes surveyed them all warily. \'93I dunno \lquote bout that. Mrs. Dursley don\rquote t take kindly to people botherin\rquote 
er on setch a busy day...\'94 
\par \'93She\rquote s my aunt,\'94 Harry said. \'93I came a long way. I haven\rquote t seen her in months.\'94 
\par Armin looked Harry up and down. \'93Well, I reckon you\rquote re about as she said you are. Wot\rquote s yer name again?\'94 
\par \'93Harry,\'94 he said simply, not giving his surname, should any wizards be nearby. Armin continued to examine him and he self-consciously smoothed his fringe over his forehead. 
\par \'93Wait \lquote ere,\'94 Armin said at last, disappearing into the maze of cubicles. Soon he was back and Harry\rquote s aunt was with him. When he saw her he dropped his jaw. 
\par She looked at him with narrowed eyes. \'93Don\rquote t gawp like that. You look dreadful! Is that what you do every year when you\rquote 
re off at school? Let your hair grow like a hippie? And what on earth are you doing here? I have work to do. Six American reporters turned up with no credentials. They claim that they write for \lquote web sites,\rquote  if you please...\'94 
\par \'93Oh, they\rquote re files that people upload onto computers called servers that are connected to--\'94 Hermione started to say brightly, but Petunia Dursley frowned at her and backed up w
arily. Harry realized that the members of the party who had used the Polyjuice sweets were not going to be recognizable to his aunt. 
\par But there was one person his aunt thought she knew. She turned to Ginny, still holding onto Harry\rquote s arm. \'93Oh, hello there Kitty,\'94 she said to her, evidently thinking that she was Katie Bell. \'93I didn\rquote 
t realize you two were still together,\'94 she added a little stiffly, nodding at Harry. \'93I just saw your father a few minutes ago. Did he become separated from the rest of you? We\rquote v
e tried to warn large groups to stay together, and in the packets we sent out we recommended that groups traveling together wear matching outfits or have flags they can wave, to make it easier to find each other,\'94
 she said briskly, sounding very much like an event organizer. In that his aunt was indeed one of the most frightfully organized people he knew, apart from Hermione, it seemed like a good fit for her. 
\par However, he had a new problem: Sam was here. \'93Are you sure it was Sam?\'94 he asked, his voice shaking. \'93Where? When?\'94 
\par She sniffed. \'93I really haven\rquote t time for this. You should keep better track of--\'94 
\par \'93Aunt Petunia!\'94 Harry said quickly. \'93I\rquote m sorry, I\rquote m letting myself get distracted. I--I mainly wanted to come see you to make certain that you\rquote re all right,\'94
 he said, trying again to assimilate her new appearance. As far as he could tell, her face hadn\rquote t changed. But she looked }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 very}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  different despite this. She\rquote 
d dyed her hair dark red. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Is she trying to look like my mum?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he wondered, noting that s
he was wearing it the way that his mother had worn her hair in his other life, long but with some of it gathered together on her crown with a clip, so it wouldn\rquote 
t be in her face. It actually made her look absurdly youthful, he thought, but the very strange thing was that, in combination with her face, she could, for the first time Harry could remember, very easily pass for Lily Potter\rquote 
s older sister. He glanced uneasily at Sirius, wondering whether he\rquote d seen her look like this before and why he hadn\rquote t said anything to Harry after one of his many trips to check on Jeffries. 
\par \'93I\rquote m just fine,\'94 she said quickly, checking her watch. \'93Although if I don\rquote t get back to work the reporters will start finding dreadful things to say....\'94 
\par Harry drew his lips into a line. \'93Uncle Vernon misses you!\'94 he said suddenly, before he lost his nerve. She froze. 
\par \'93Vernon Dursley,\'94 she said, ice in her voice, \'93misses someone to clean up after him, cook his meals and wash his clothes. He misses clean towels after his bath and fresh sheets when he\rquote s ready to sleep at night. If you\rquote 
re so concerned about him, I recommend that you inform him that all of those services are available from fine hotels.\'94 She pursed her lips more tightly even than McGonagall could have managed. 
\par He stepped toward her. \'93I don\rquote t think that\rquote s the only reason Uncle Vernon misses you--\'94 
\par She looked a little guilty as she backed up from him. \'93Nonsense. He\rquote s taken me for granted for over twenty years. I\rquote ve had enough. And I have to get back to work now, so if you\rquote ll excuse me....Enjoy the show, everyone!\'94
 she said brightly, as though she hadn\rquote t just been discussing her husband in the coldest possible terms. \'93Do be certain to fill out the form in the program--you did all get programs?\'94 She looked at their empty hands ner
vously, then rushed over to a large crate sitting in the corner of the cubicle, practically throwing thick programs, like glossy magazines, in their general direction. \'93We\rquote 
re trying to compile data about why each person has come, where they first heard about Rodney....\'94 
\par When she was done giving them all programs, she walked off, calling behind her, \'93Don\rquote t forget to complete the forms! I must fly!\'94 
\par When she\rquote d gone, Harry turned in shock to Sirius. \'93Did you know she\rquote d dyed her hair?\'94 
\par Sirius looked guilty. \'93Well--I wasn\rquote t sure how you\rquote d take it. I didn\rquote t think I should even mention it, since by the time you saw her she could have changed her mind...\'94 
\par \'93And }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Sam\rquote s}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  here...\'94 Harry shook his head at Sirius, surveying his tanned skin and white hair, the familiar twinkling blue eyes. \'93I wish you really }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 were}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Aberforth; I wish I could ask him what he thinks he\rquote s doing, letting Sam come to this thing...\'94
 Then Harry bit his tongue, remembering that he'd once thought Rodney Jeffries would be a perfect solution to Sam's problem. That seemed a very long time ago. 
\par Ginny looked up at him, her eyes moist. Harry had to keep reminding himself that she wasn\rquote t Katie. \'93You know why he\rquote s come...\'94 she said softly. 
\par Sirius nodded. \'93Right. He just wants to be back to normal--for a wizard. The way he was before Azkaban. Remember, he was a powerful Auror. But in prison, he didn\rquote t have the option of turning into an animal, like me. Dementors didn\rquote 
t get to me the way they did to most prisoners. And he had cellmates, others going mad around him, which may not have helped his state of mind. The sanest man in the asylum will probably eventually go mad. Just from proximity...\'94 
\par \'93Or if he wasn\rquote t mad, he\rquote d seem so by comparison. After all, isn\rquote t it mad to be in an asylum if you aren\rquote t mad?\'94 Ron said in a sardonic voice. 
\par Harry swallowed. \'93Yeah, I used to think Sam could be 'fixed' if he went to Jeffries, but now--I don\rquote t know. I don't trust Jeffries,\'94 he whispered cautiously, looking around, lest any of Jeffries\rquote  lackeys should hear him. \'93I think 
we should try to find Sam...\'94 
\par As they were leaving the tent, Hermione pulled on his arm to delay him. \'93Was that a dig, Harry?\'94 she wanted to know. 
\par He frowned at her. \'93A dig?\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Ron}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  is here so he can be cured by Jeffries, or did you forget? But you just said you don\rquote t trust him. He cured you, but Ron doesn\rquote t deserve the same treatment?
\'94 she said acidly. 
\par He snorted through his nose. \'93I was burnt. And even Sam--well, he used to be able to do magic and now he can't. I can understand why he's here. But Ron\rquote s fine as he is. He doesn\rquote t }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 need}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to be changed, Hermione, and you don\rquote t even know that Jeffries could do it. Not to mention, this was all your idea. I haven\rquote t once heard Ron say that he wants to be cured, have you? He\rquote s here for }
{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . He doesn\rquote t want to be here, I don\rquote t think. But at this point...I think he\rquote s afraid you\rquote ll leave him if he doesn\rquote 
t go through with it...or if it doesn\rquote t work...\'94 
\par \'93I wouldn\rquote t do that!\'94 she exclaimed, her unfamiliar light eyes large and worried. 
\par Harry looked at her very directly. \'93Don\rquote t tell me; tell Ron,\'94 he said grimly. They exited the tent, joining the others. Harry swept his eyes quickly over the sea of humanity, despairing of finding Sam in such a crowd. \'93We\rquote 
ll never spot him in all this...\'94 
\par \'93Well, he\rquote ll have to go forward to be healed, won\rquote t he?\'94 Ron said logically. \'93There\rquote s a queue for it. Let\rquote s take a look at who\rquote s waiting.\'94 
\par They wove their way very slowly through the crowd, the singing sounding louder again as they drew nearer to where Jeffries stood at the
 altar stone. There were about six people waiting on either side of him, wearing rough robes that appeared to be made from sacking. Harry looked back in the queue and saw Jeffries\rquote 
 people carrying armfuls of the simple robes, helping people into them, crea
ting a procession of identically-clad pilgrims, all eagerly awaiting the moment when Jeffries would lay his hands upon them. Harry anxiously scanned the faces of the waiting faithful, hunting for Sam\rquote 
s auburn hair and work-tanned face. It was Ginny who clutched his arm tighter and pointed. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 There!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Sam was very close to the front of the part of the queue still outside the circle, already wearing a rough robe. It was strange for Harry to see him like this; he\rquote d only seen him in Muggle clothes. A month earl
ier, when giving his daughter away to Percy Weasley, he\rquote d been all smiles. He looked anxious now, peering around nervously, as though worried that someone might recognize him. He didn\rquote t seem to have noticed Sirius, who was wearing Aberforth
\rquote s face, nor Ginny, who was now his daughter\rquote s double. Harry wondered whether the real Katie knew he was here. 
\par There was a roar from the crowd and Harry redirected his attention to Jeffries, who was being hugged by a large middle-aged woman, her robe pulling tightly over
 her massive body. She was smiling and crying all at once and looked like she just might end up strangling Jeffries, from the hold she had on his neck. But he was laughing along with her, and gave her a kiss on top of the head (this was easy, as she wasn
\rquote t
 any taller than Mrs. Weasley). Some of his retinue helped her along, moving her out of the way so that he could turn to the man on his left. The singing had been reduced in volume, Harry realized, the elevated choir humming lightly, but now a crescendo o
f noise grew again from the singers, and they belted out the chorus again with renewed fervor: 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 This is my QUEST, to follow that STAR...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Harry winced; they\rquote d just passed under one of the lintels and the noise seemed to have suddenly been dropped down on 
top of his head quite violently. Looking up, he saw the choristers link arms; perhaps that would keep anyone who had vertigo from feeling dizzy and falling. Above them the sky was a perfect blue with large, white fluffy clouds filling most of the sky, hel
ping to cut the sun\rquote 
s glare, drifting before the sun periodically, but not oppressively. There were a few dark clouds near the horizon, but they seemed too far away to worry about. He looked around again; they were inching through the crowd very slowly, the
 sound of the singing pounding in Harry\rquote s ears. Sam still seemed miles away, progressing through the queue, only two pilgrims between him and Jeffries now as the music grew louder still.... 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 And the world will be better for this,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 they all sang in unison; \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
that one man, torn and covered with scars...still strove with his last ounce of courage...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par They inched forward some more; Harry didn't know how long it took. Just as he saw that Sam was second in the queue, the sun seemed to go out. He looked up; an enormous fluffy cloud that he\rquote 
d seen in the sky only minutes earlier had drifted in front of the sun, but instead of making the light only a little dimmer, it appeared now that a raging storm was going to strike, it was so dark. The center of the cloud was d
eep grey shading to black here and there, although the cloud was still quite light around the edges. There were no longer dark clouds at the horizon. Harry frowned. How could the cloud have filled with moisture so quickly? Why was the darkness so oddly-sh
aped, and why did the cloud seem to be so low? 
\par He pointed and said to Hermione, \'93Do clouds usually look like that before rain?\'94 
\par She tipped her head back, shading her eyes with her hand. \'93Rain? Oh, god, I hope it doesn\rquote t rain. With all of these people here, that would be complete chaos!\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 My brothers and sisters shall come.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93What?\'94 Harry said to Sandy quickly. \'93What did you say, Sandy?\'94 He\rquote d been glad of the opportunity to bring her with him, since he\rquote d arrived by Portkey, but at the same time, her predictions always made him very apprehensive. 

\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 My brothers and sisters shall come.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93What is it, Harry?\'94 Ginny said, clutching his arm more tightly. \'93What did she say?\'94 
\par \'93Who?\'94 Hermione and Maggie said together. 
\par \'93Sandy,\'94 Harry said slowly. After he\rquote d told them, the girls all immediately lifted up their robes and looked around their ankles. Sirius snorted and Hermione glared at him. 
\par Ron frowned at Hermione and his sisters. \'93What the hell are you all doing?\'94 
\par \'93Snakes!\'94 Hermione exclaimed. \'93Sandy told Harry that there are going to be snakes! Who knows how many!\'94 Snape raised one eyebrow and Harry nodded at him. 
\par Maggie looked at Harry and he could see she was thinking very hard. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Is that what Sandy said, Harry?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  she asked him, this thought appearing inside his head suddenly. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Well--yes. Kind of. But I never know when--}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I--I had a strange dream last night, Harry,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  she told him now. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 I wasn\rquote t sure whether I should say anything. It\rquote 
s possible that she doesn\rquote t literally mean \lquote snakes\rquote ...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par A scream went up from somewhere and Harry lost his concentration; Maggie\rquote s thoughts disappeared from his mind. He looked around frantically. \'93What happened? Who screamed?\'94
 He searched the ground, wondering whether he could talk to dozens of snakes simultaneously, whether they\rquote d listen to him if he asked them not to hurt anyone... 
\par \'93Look up!\'94 Hermione cried. Harry froze; somehow he\rquote d never seen something he liked when she\rquote d said those two simple words. But when more screaming erupted from the crowd, he
 threw back his head and saw two huge shapes descending through the low, dark cloud. They were the reason why the cloud had appeared to have large, bulky shapes within it. They were hiding above it, far up in the sky (even though it was lower than clouds 
usually were), and now they were descending in tight corkscrews, each with a small rider. And the first two were followed by two more, and two more after that.... 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Dragons,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 he whispered in awe, watching the enormous forms draw nearer with a fatalistic fascination. Around him he heard strange }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
pops!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  and }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 cracks!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  punctuating the screaming, but he couldn\rquote t move. He felt like his feet were bolted to the ground. 
\par \'93The Swedish Shortsnouts, from the reservation,\'94 Ron breathed. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Bloody hell}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . The Death Eaters are going to attack all of these people with }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 dragons}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 
\par \'93More to the point, Ron,\'94 Hermione said with a shaking voice, pulling her wand out of her pocket, \'93they\rquote re going to attack }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 us}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, too. And we need to try to stop it,\'94 she added, sounding terrified but determined. 
\par \'93Stop it?\'94 Ginny said, her voice going up an octave. \'93Just }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 how}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , might I ask? When Harry went up against a dragon he at least had his broom...\'94
 She was now gripping his arm quite painfully and trembling head to toe. Hermione\rquote s mouth had gone very thin; she had no answer for Ginny. \'93
And what about the restriction on underage magic, for me? Or restrictions on doing magic in front of Muggles?\'94 Ginny demanded. 
\par \'93There will just have to be memory charms afterward,\'94 Snape said tersely. 
\par \'93And as for you being underage...well, let\rquote s worry about all surviving this first,\'94 Harry said softly, his insides clenching with fear for her as he gave Snape a worried look. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
If anything happened to Ginny...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Ginny took out her wand. \'93Right. Good point. I have no intention of going back to my parents in a coal scuttle,\'94 she said in a low, determined voice. She looked up at the dragons, her face very hard. \'93The Ministry be damned,\'94
 she added, sounding less convincing. Harry tried to forget about his old nightmare, Ginny turning into a skeleton.... 
\par \'93One thing is for certain,\'94 Ron said his wand also out now as the dragons drew nearer to the earth and the crowd around them began running in all directions, panicked and clueless. \'93We know now why all of these people have been gathered here.\'94
 He looked levelly at Harry. \'93Jeffries must be in league with You-Know--I mean Vol--Voldemort.\'94 
\par Harry shook his head. \'93We don\rquote t know that. I\rquote m not defending Jeffries. I wouldn\rquote t put much past him. But this might be just as much of a surprise to him
 as to us. I once thought that Voldemort might not like Jeffries, and maybe this is just confirmation of it. There are loads of Muggles and Muggle-friendly wizards here; he also hates }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 them}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , and this gives him a lot of them in one place to attack. Very convenient.\'94 
\par \'93Get under the stones!\'94 Snape yelled, hustling them to the nearest megaliths. The choir had ceased singing; they were almost all crouched on the enormous lintels, huddled in shaking groups of three and four. They were only about fifteen feet in t
he air, but the crowd was too thick around the megaliths; it was impossible for them to just jump down. Harry was trying to work out how they could help the singers, but this train of thought was brought to a halt as one of the dragons abruptly stopped sp
iraling down and suddenly }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 swooped}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 down over the landscape, making a terrific chorus of screams erupt from tens of thousands of throats. The great beast was heading toward some people on the edge of Salisbury Plain, from what Harry could see. It was quite so
me distance from where they were, pressed against one of the enormous stones ringing the ancient circle. 
\par In its way, the Swedish Shortsnout was quite beautiful, with its shimmering silver-blue scales. Harry could see now that the dragon\rquote s rider had a helm
et and was controlling the dragon with a bit and reigns, sitting on a saddle that was carefully strapped around the beast\rquote 
s ribs. As he watched from a distance, Harry saw the dragon expel a huge blast of fire into the air over the heads of the crowd, causi
ng the people to scatter before it. No one actually appeared to be hurt, however; it looked to Harry as though the wizard rider had pulled the dragon up at the last minute, so that the fire didn\rquote t go too low. 
\par \'93Why\rquote d he do that?\'94 Ron said, having noticed the same thing. Harry bit his lip. 
\par \'93Dunno. Since when are Death Eaters afraid of hurting people? Seems that if you come to a crowd like this riding a dragon, your goal is probably to hurt people.\'94 
\par Ron shook his head, frowning. \'93Yeah. I don\rquote t get it. And we }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 still}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  don\rquote t have any ideas for how to fight the bloody things.\'94
 He held up his wand as though it were utterly useless. \'93I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 knew}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 I should have gone on that trip with Mum and Dad to Romania. Maybe Charlie could have taught me a thing or two about dragon-handling. Sirius recommended that Conjunctivitis Charm for you, even though he didn\rquote t get to tell you about it, but I haven
\rquote t learned it and I don\rquote t think you have either.\'94 
\par \'93No, it was a good thing I summoned my broom...\'94 He opened his eyes wide. \'93That\rquote s it! We need brooms. Loads of them, not just for us, but for any other witches or wizards who might be here. Although...\'94 he went on, thinking, \'93
I could have sworn I heard some people Disapparating. Any witches or wizards who }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 were}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  here might be gone now...\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 If}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  they can Apparate. Not everyone can,\'94 Hermione reminded him. 
\par \'93Hermione!\'94 Harry said urgently. \'93Listen, you need to go back to Hogwarts and get help. Not just brooms, although they would be good. You have to tell Dumbledore what\rquote s happening. He can
 contact the operatives. And see if he can bring some teachers, or maybe the Dueling Club. And the Elven Army. But not all of them. We don\rquote t want to leave Hogwarts defenseless, in case this whole thing is meant to be a distraction...\'94 
\par \'93Some bleeding distraction!\'94 Ron said, watching two more dragons fly over the crowd at the edge of the plain and breathe fire over the heads of the running, panicked people. 
\par \'93You never know with Voldemort,\'94 Harry said grimly. 
\par Sirius had heard what Harry had said. \'93I\rquote ll go w
ith Hermione. After we Apparate to Hogsmeade we can both change into our animal forms and run to the castle much more quickly that way. I can talk to Dumbledore while Hermione collects brooms. Once he knows what\rquote 
s what he can make an announcement for certain people on the staff and Dueling Club to go to the entrance hall. And he can contact the Ministry for Aurors.\'94 
\par \'93Right,\'94 Snape agreed suddenly and unexpectedly. \'93But don\rquote t take too long. We\rquote re going to need those brooms,\'94 he said tersely, watching the dragons with his uncle\rquote 
s dark, troubled eyes. Sirius and Hermione Disapparated with a double }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 pop}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ! 
\par They continued to watch apprehensively, the only still people in the enormous, frightened crowd. Four dragons were at the edge of the plain, as though assigned
 to the cardinal points, and two others were swooping over the sea of people, making them run back and forth in panic. From what Harry could see, the dragons were breathing plenty of fire, but whenever they seemed to be flying too low, their riders pulled
 up, to keep the fire above the crowd. They seemed very purposefully to avoid hurting anyone. The crowd had gone from running }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 away}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  from the standing stones to running }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 toward}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  them; the dragons made it impossible for anyone to leave the plain. Suddenly the ri
ng of stones seemed like a haven, away from the dragons, even though they could fly to the circle in a trice. 
\par Harry saw Ginny drop her jaw. \'93They\rquote re }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 herding}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  the crowd!\'94 she cried suddenly. \'93Don\rquote t you see? They\rquote re trying to get everyone in the center!\'94 

\par They all stood watching in shock as the crowd surged toward them, and Harry could also see numerous people who were being knocked down and trampled in the process. This was going to be very bad, he could tell. He looked up, his mind working furiously. 

\par \'93We need to do some herding of our own, then. First--can you and Ron try to get as many people as possible into the big tent?\'94 he said to Maggie. He turned to Ron. \'93Put a fire shield charm on it first. And it\rquote s a good thing you\rquote 
re strong--if anyone resists being taken into the tent, just pick them up and carry them. They\rquote ll probably go along pretty quickly when they find out they can\rquote t fight you. The three of us,\'94
 he went on, indicating Snape and Ginny in addition to himself, \'93will try to get the choir down to t
he ground. They could be fried to a crisp up there. Oh, and expand the interior of the tent, too. We need an enormous fire-proofed space where we can put all these people.\'94 Maggie and Ron ran off, hand in hand, and Harry turned to Snape and Ginny. \'93
What do you reckon we should do to get them down? Sir,\'94 he added, addressing Snape. 
\par Severus Snape regarded the frightened people above them with narrowed eyes. \'93If there weren\rquote t so many already milling around I\rquote d recommend softening the ground and getting them to jump, but there\rquote 
s no room. We could Transfigure them into small birds, but then they\rquote d just fly off in fright and we wouldn\rquote t be able to remove the spells again....\'94 He frowned, clearly frustrated. There were just too many people, Harry thought. And stil
l more dragons had descended from the clouds; there were eight of them now, driving the multitudes toward the center of Salisbury Plain, and the screaming of the terrified people was so constant that it had become a kind of white noise to Harry. 
\par \'93I could change into a griffin and fly a few people down at a time, but that could take a while, and I'd still need more space than we have right here...\'94 He swore. \'93I\rquote m starting to miss fighting giant spiders,\'94
 he said bitterly, glad that Ron had gone off with Maggie so he wouldn\rquote t hear Harry say this. \'93For some reason that didn\rquote t seem so bad, compared to this...\'94 
\par Ginny\rquote s eyes lit up. \'93That\rquote s it!\'94 
\par Harry and Snape both frowned at her. \'93What\rquote s it?\'94 Harry wanted to know. 
\par \'93Don\rquote t you remember? The way we got the peop
le away from the spiders? The pulley system, conjured ropes flung over broomstick handles. Well, this is actually an easier problem to solve. All we need to do is conjure some ropes for each stone bridging two of these tall stones and secure them. Then th
e people can just climb down the ropes! Or we could conjure ladders, but the ropes would take up less space. And ladders could be knocked over by the crowd and end up hurting people.\'94 
\par \'93Yes, \'94 Snape agreed, \'93that would be the best thing, probably.\'94 
\par Harry eyed the dragons, still hovering around the perimeter of the plain; he could see that the riders were watching the panicked, screaming crowds converging on the standing stones. Ginny was right; they were definitely }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 herding}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  the people into position. And Harry had a very bad feeling that once they were all where they were \'93supposed\'94
 to be, the dragons would be allowed to vent their full fire-breathing ability on the crowd... 
\par \'93I may still have to change into a griffin before this is all over.\'94 He looked at the abject terror on every face in sight. \'93Of course, with so many people seeing dragons, I think it\rquote 
s already a foregone conclusion that loads of memory charms will be needed.\'94 It was time to forget everything they\rquote d ever learned about hiding magic from Mugg
les; Harry, Ginny and Snape aimed their wands at the high lintels and long ropes erupted from the tips, wrapping themselves tightly around the top stones and hanging down within a few feet of the ground. 
\par Harry pointed his wand at his throat and said, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Sonorus}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 He looked up at the terrified people, none of whom had attempted to start climbing down, \'93Just climb down,\'94
 he told them. \'93The ropes will hold. You can\rquote t stay up there, you\rquote re targets if you do. Those dragons are Swedish Shortsnouts; they can turn you all into cinders in a few seconds. Climb down now!\'94 he ordered them. He took the }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Sonorus}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  spell off himself again. 
\par \'93Harry!\'94 Ginny said anxiously, watching the crowd around them as people on the ground had taken notice of what he\rquote d said. \'93You\rquote re going to panic everyone!\'94 
\par He grimaced, seeing that she was telling the truth; some people were running in aimless circles now that he\rquote d explained just how bad it was. \'93They need to know!\'94 he shouted so she could hear him over the screaming of the crowd. \'93Look! They
\rquote re doing it!\'94 Some brave souls had begun to test the ropes and were sliding down to the ground. Harry smiled, turning to Ginny. \'93Come on! We need to have ropes all around!\'94
 He pointed his wand at the next lintel, while Ginny aimed at the one just beyond
 that. Soon all of the stones in the circle had ropes and the choir members were sliding down. Ginny had seen that some of the people were in pain from rope-burns and she started to move toward them with her wand out, but Harry barked at her, \'93There
\rquote s no time for that! They have to get to the tent. They can\rquote t stay out in the open!\'94 
\par He, Ginny and Snape tried to send as many people as possible in the direction of Ron and Maggie, near the tent, pushing people along who weren\rquote t moving quickly enough, but the m
ass of bodies still seemed largely to be moving in aimless circles. Harry moved back to the standing stones to see just how many people were outside the ring on the open plain; it seemed to be tens of thousands still. Everywhere he looked there were peopl
e, people.... Ginny and Snape were with him again, also mesmerized by the sight of the dragons swooping over the crowd. There were some stragglers who seemed to be trying to make a break for it, at the southern edge of the plain. 
\par \'93Oh, no,\'94 Harry breathed, 
as one of the dragons turned, the rider pulling on his reins, bearing down on the breakaway group. Harry saw the rider crack a whip; a split second later the dragon emitted a cloud of fire, blue-hot, incinerating the would-be escapees. Ginny\rquote 
s scream felt like it pierced his eardrum; Snape\rquote s face (or rather, Duncan MacDermid\rquote 
s) was utterly white, sweat pouring down it. He clutched his wand tightly, impotently. The mob of people nearest the casualties screamed even more loudly when they saw the bodies, running straight at the circle of stones to try to escape the same fate. 

\par \'93Where are they with those damn brooms?\'94 Snape growled. Harry held Ginny and patted her back while she sobbed into his shoulder, forcing himself to look at the blackened corpses. One or t
wo figures were still leaping about, seemingly made of flames, screaming horribly, just as Harry remembered Evan Davies doing, a sight he still saw in nightmares... They\rquote d been a warning to others: }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Do not try to escape.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  \'93I don\rquote t need a broom,\'94 Harry said suddenly, setting his jaw stubbornly. \'93I can fly without one.\'94 
\par Ginny lifted Katie\rquote s tear-streaked face to him and cried, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 No, Harry!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93I have to!\'94 he shouted above the chaos around them, his stomach clenching as he realized that this might be the last time he held her, and it wasn\rquote t even her face he was able to see, her body he was holding. \'93I need to try to do }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 something}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 !\'94 Hoping he wouldn\rquote t start crying, he pulled her to him and kissed her deeply but quickly. \'93I love you Ginny. Always remember that.\'94 He looked at Snape. 
\'93Take care of her.\'94 
\par Snape surprised him by suddenly pulling him into a brusque hug, patting him earnestly on the back. Harry nodded at him, then stepped back and closed his eyes, feeling the change roll through him. He felt his paws touch 
down and opened his eyes, seeing that the crowd had spread out around him, several people screaming at the sight of a green-eyed lion in their midst. He took advantage of the extra space he was now afforded to spread his wings and leap into the sky, heari
ng Ginny cry out behind him, \'93Good luck, Harry!\'94 
\par He moved his wings as quickly as he could, climbing higher and higher above the circle of stones. Most of the dragons were still fairly close to the perimeter of the plain, urging the crowds toward the inter
ior. He decided to start with the bastard who had murdered those people in cold blood, the Death Eater who had made his dragon breathe fire at poor innocent nobodies who had never crossed Voldemort, apart from being born Muggles. He was high in the sky no
w and the people below him looked like so many confused ants; he could see Ron and Maggie pushing people toward the enormous white tent, and he hoped that Ron had been able to fireproof it, but he didn\rquote t want to take the chance that he hadn\rquote 
t. The dragons }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 had}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to be kept away from the tent. 
\par When he was at a good height, he dove toward the dragon that had murdered the people, feeling the wind whistling past his ears, squinting so that the rushing air wasn\rquote 
t quite so painful on his eyes. Things always looked different to him when he was in his griffin form, but the dragons looked }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 very}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 peculiar, their silver-blue hides shimmering with magic, except-- }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 There,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought, spying it even as he was zooming down to
ward the beast. He was a magical beast himself, at the moment, and he could see the magic imbuing the dragons\rquote 
 hides in iridescent waves. But along the spine of each enormous animal, where the plates of armor met, there was a narrow line, a division that a
llowed them to move freely. Between the shoulder blades and the haunches there were larger gaps, to give the wings and limbs adequate movement. The Death Eater was between the shoulder blades; Harry would land on the rump, closest to the other large gap i
n the armor. He was very grateful that Swedish Shortsnouts did not have the kind of tails Hungarian Horntails had. 
\par He managed to set down while the dragon was being steered back to the perimeter, his hind legs landing on the thick silver-blue scales, but h
is forepaws landing on the fleshy unprotected area revealed by the armor gap. He sank in his claws. The dragon roared in fury and released a burst of blue fire that towered in the air over the frightened crowd. The Death Eater was flung back and lost his 
seat; he was lying on his side behind the saddle. His helmet fell off and Harry saw long light hair and a pale, pointed face staring at him in horror, and then contempt.... 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Potter}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 !\'94 Lucius Malfoy spat, as though uttering an obscenity. Harry dug in his claws, feeling the dragon\rquote 
s impressive muscles tense as it rose higher in the sky and jerked back and forth, trying to dislodge Harry. This made Lucius Malfoy slide off the beast\rquote s back, but he still hung onto the reins. Dangling by the dragon\rquote s left wing, he
 was getting beat about the head every time the beast drew its wing back and forth. Harry wondered whether he would be concussed as a result. 
\par Malfoy released his right hand from the reins and plunged it into his robe pocket, pulling out his wand even as he dangled at the dragon\rquote 
s side, still holding onto the reins with his left hand. He pointed the wand at Harry and said something Harry couldn\rquote t hear, but when Malfoy was finishing the incantation, the dragon suddenly swooped upward, ruining Malfoy\rquote s aim, c
ausing the curse to bounce harmlessly off the dragon\rquote s magical hide. 
\par Harry squinted into the wind, which was whipping his mane around his head; he clenched his claws, holding on as tightly as he could, so that they went very deep. He could feel the dragon\rquote 
s blood seeping out between his paws and its flesh. Malfoy pointed his wand again, but once more, the dragon\rquote 
s unpredictable movements caused the curse to go awry. However, this time, Harry could see the amber beam of light ricochet back at Malfoy himself
, rather than shooting harmlessly into the air, and he saw Malfoy recoil as his own curse struck him. He released the reins with his left hand and fell down, down.... 
\par Harry swallowed, seeing how very high in the sky they were; the people on the ground were quite tiny. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 He couldn\rquote t possibly survive a fall like that.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 Harry thought fleetingly of Draco, of his reaction to seeing his father die in the Pensieve. Shaking himself irritably, he put his mind to the task at hand and began inching his way toward the sa
ddle, having to push his paws down between the plates of the dragon\rquote 
s thick hide at every step, to find a new fleshy spot where he could dig in his claws, to keep from flying off into space like Malfoy. The dragon continued to swoop and plunge, trying to shake him off. 
\par When he had finally reached the dragon\rquote s shoulder blades, he quickly changed back into a human and made a grab for the reins, so that he might control the beast himself, although he wasn\rquote t sure how to get a dragon to do as he wanted. He gain
ed the seat Malfoy had abandoned and gripped the reins hard, pulling up, hoping that would mean the dragon would go higher into the air, where it wouldn\rquote 
t put more humans at risk. Harry worried that, having killed some people already, this one might be hungry to repeat the experience. 
\par As he soared up and up, his stomach flopping uncomfortably inside him (it was nothing like a broom, a hippogriff or flying on his own), he said quickly, \'93Are you okay Sandy? Sorry about suddenly transfiguring like that. And you know, any time you
\rquote d like to tell me that you\rquote ve Seen something, you\rquote re welcome to. You wouldn\rquote t be able to explain the last thing you said, would you? I\rquote 
m still trying to work out that one. Have you Seen anything else? Anything that might help me?\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Tooo whooom are yooo ssspeeeeking, Two-Foot? From where deeeed yooo come? There wassss a winged beeeeasssst heeeeere, a hurtful beeeeasssst...Whooo eeess theeess \lquote Sssandeee?\rquote }{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 said a booming voice. After a moment\rquote s hesitation, Harry realized that it was the dragon. 
\par Nervously, he spoke to Sandy again. \'93Erm, Sandy, did you hear the dragon say anything?\'94 He felt like his arms were being pulled from their sockets as he struggled to hold onto the reins. 
\par \'93Yes, Harry Potter. Of course I did.\'94 
\par \'93So--I could have just spoken to the dragon during the First Task?\'94 
\par \'93I do not know what you are talking about,\'94 Sandy informed him archly, and he remembered that he didn\rquote t have her during his fourth year. 
\par \'93What I mean is--dragons speak human language?\'94 
\par \'93Oh, no, Harry Potter. They speak Wyrmtongue.\'94 
\par Harry dropped his jaw. \'93So--so I\rquote m not just a Parselmouth? I\rquote m also a--what did you call it? I\rquote m a Wyrmmouth?\'94 He thought for a moment. \'93That sounds dreadful.\'94 
\par \'93No,\'94 Sandy said, unperturbed by his last comment. \'93I have never heard of a human who can speak Wyrmtongue.\'94 
\par \'93Then--they how could it understand me?\'94 
\par \'93Wyrmtongue and Parseltongue are related because dragons and snakes are related,\'94 she informed him. \'93I learned many things in the year I was not with you. Some dragons ar
e merely snakes with wings. The basilisk is like a dragon with no wings, really...it understands the speech of snakes and the speech of dragons...\'94 
\par \'93So--it could understand me because I was speaking Parseltongue to you, Sandy?\'94 he said, finally starting to understand. \'93And I can understand what it\rquote s saying because its language is similar to Parseltongue?\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Yesss, Two-Foot. But I steeel do not underssstand tooo whooom yooo are sssspeeeking...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 the dragon boomed again. 
\par \'93Please, erm Mr. Dragon, sir. I have a snake companion. Her name is Sandy and she\rquote s wrapped around my arm....\'94 But he stopped suddenly in confusion. \'93Sandy,\'94 he said, \'93what I just said to the dragon sounded like English to me.\'94 

\par \'93It was,\'94 she informed him. 
\par \'93But--\'94 
\par \'93You cannot speak Wyrmtongue. I have been with humans--before I met you--and understand human speech, although I can only be understood by a Parselmouth. You must speak to the dragon through me. It does not acknowledge human speech.\'94 
\par \'93Oh,\'94 he said, unsure about this. \'93Okay then...I was just saying that you\rquote re my snake companion and that your name is Sandy and you\rquote re wrapped around my arm....\'94 He hoped the dragon was paying attention. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 That exxxplainssss eeet....}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 the dragon acceded. Harry held onto the reins more tightly, pulling 
back when it seemed that the dragon had started to descend toward some people still outside the standing stones. He\rquote d been understood. He was making progress. 
\par \'93I\rquote d like to tell the dragon that I\rquote m sorry, Sandy, about hurting him with my claws, when I was a griffin--a winged beast,\'94 Harry apologized awkwardly. It felt strange to not be able to address the dragon directly, but he couldn
\rquote t help that. He needed to make friends with the dragon, and the first thing he\rquote d done was to hurt it a great deal. Harry glanced back quickly; the dragon\rquote 
s hide had a gush of silvery-white blood staining it, as it poured from the wounds along its spine. \'93I needed to make sure I didn\rquote t fall off, Sandy. I was trying to get to the man who was controlling the dragon, the rider....\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Oh?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 the dragon said, barely interested. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Eeesss the other Two-Foot gone? Goooood. Heee alsssso had clawssss....Thank yoooo for ssstopping using your clawssss....}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 They swooped toward another dragon, and Harry thought quickly. }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Malfoy must have been wearing spurs, digging into the flesh just behind the shoulder blades.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par \'93I won\rquote t use my claws on the dragon again, Sandy. I promise. But I need his help. Do you think he could ask the other dragons to stop attacking the people on the ground?\'94 
\par As the great beast continued to fly, it moved its head around so that Harry was eye to eye with it; he wondered whether it could injure itself by blasting Harry with fire at this moment. Harry gripped the reins with white knuckles, his heart in his throat
 and his life passing before him as he gazed into the hypnotic vertical pupils of the dragon. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Yesss....}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par The dragon\rquote s long forked tongue slithered back between its saber-like teeth. Harry let out a long sigh of relief. The dragon turned his head and plun
ged down, approaching one of the other dragons, bellowing at it; Harry had to strain to understand what it was saying, as it was speaking more quickly to its mate than it had to him. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Ceasetheattack, Obrothersofthemountains!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 it cried. As he listened, the words began to separate themselves in his mind so that it wasn\rquote

when Hagrid was showing him the dragons in his fourth year, before the First Task. But they might just have been bellowing in pain and fury, because of their imprisonment. They might not have been }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 speaking}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  at all.... 
\par \'93I wish, Sandy,\'94 Harry said loudly, \'93t
hat the dragons could know that the people on the ground do not wish to harm them and that the men, er, Two-Foots on their backs do. I wish the dragons knew that I have a friend who knows dragons, Sandy, a friend who will help them get back to their home 
in Sweden, where they will not be at the beck and call of Two-Foots...\'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 O brothers and sisters!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 the dragon he was riding called out, making Harry grin. The dragon told the others what he had said, although Harry didn\rquote 
t manage to catch everything he said,
 and they started to rise into the sky, leaving off herding the people into the ring of stones (although that task was largely finished; Harry could see the mass of people moving toward the tent instead, where they would be safe--hopefully). 
\par As for the qu
estion of whether the dragons could be injured by fire from one of their fellows, that was answered for him soon enough when a Death Eater dug his spurs into the dragon he was riding and struck it with a long, curling whip, trying to get it to dive down a
g
ain; it was no longer obeying him. Harry felt his dragon lurch beneath him and dive toward the other one, about a thirty-foot drop, and he felt a blast of hot air strike his face painfully when his mount sent a blue spurt of fire at the figure riding the 
other dragon. Harry wanted to scream in horror, but his throat felt utterly parched, as was the air all around him, it seemed. In seconds, the Death Eater was a blackened corpse, holding onto the reins in a kind of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
rigor mortis}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . Harry thought his gloves might have fused, from the heat, so that they couldn\rquote t be released from the reins now. The dragon flew on with its inert rider; it was no longer under the control of a 
\'93Two-Foot.\'94 
\par Harry\rquote s skin felt very tender simply from being exposed to the air around the 
dragon when it had been so super-heated; he understood now why the Death Eaters were wearing helmets. His skin was starting to smart very badly, and he wished he dared take out his wand to ease the pain. He tried saying to Sandy, \'93
I--I wish the dragon hadn\rquote t done that, Sandy, so we could bring these men--these Two-Foots--to justice--\'94 He wasn\rquote t sure he meant it, but he }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 certain that he couldn\rquote t take seeing someone else killed in this way without spewing onto the dragon\rquote s neck. His stomach churned inside him, and not from the dragon\rquote s flight. He actually found himself hoping that Malfoy }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 had}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  survived his fall.... 
\par Suddenly, one of the other Death Eaters seemed to leap into the air and away from his dragon; Harry\rquote s heart leapt into his throat as he braced hi
mself for yet another death, but this quickly proved to be unnecessary. The man had had a broom with him, wedged under the saddle; this Death Eater was an impressive flyer, swooping around the dragons, who were going after him now quite aggressively, desp
ite their riders trying to restrain them. (Harry\rquote 
s mount had not communicated his wish to the other dragons that the riders be spared.) More than once, he just barely missed being fried to a crisp, and he actually caused two of the dragons to collide with e
ach other with a clever feint, making Harry wince instinctively, and causing the enormous beasts to roar with inarticulate fury. 
\par As the dragons went after him, he continued to elude them, swooping and tumbling through the air, going straight up and then into a daring dive, pulling out suddenly and whirling in the opposite direction. Harry was convinced that he\rquote 
d never seen anyone fly so well, with the possible exception of Viktor Krum, who was now dead. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Who the hell is he?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Harry wondered. 
\par Suddenly, the D
eath Eater turned and aimed his broom upward, outstripping his dragon pursuers. He flew straight toward the enormous cloud which still hovered high above the circle of stones; Harry noticed for the first time that there were still dark, bulky shapes disco
loring the cloud, and even as he watched, two more dragons descended through the mist. These dragons also had riders, but that wasn\rquote 
t all; these dragons were larger than any of the previous eight. They bore under their bellies enormous carriages, as though 
the dragons were passenger-carrying dirigibles, and with horror, Harry remembered Percy saying that this was how the dementors had been removed from Azkaban. 
\par And now he knew }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 why}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  they\rquote d been removed. The carriages were full of dementors, making Harry\rquote s blo
od run cold, even from a distance. Such a huge concentration of them was already affecting his mind; he started to lose his grip on the reins... 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 The Ministry is infested with Death Eaters}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94 he heard his mother\rquote s shrill voice in his head. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 It\rquote s rotten to 
the core; there\rquote s no way to be safe if the Ministry arranges our going into hiding. We\rquote ll all be dead within a week. No; there\rquote s only one way--}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Avada Ke--}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Expelliarmus!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 he heard his own voice explode. 
\par Suddenly, he was falling; he jerked his eyes open. He\rquote 
d slipped from the dragon, the dementors having taken over his mind, even at a distance. The ground was rising at an alarming rate and thinking quickly, Harry became a griffin, spreading his wings, swooping down in a low glide, brushing the grass be
fore he started moving his wings, ascending again. He tried not to think what would have happened if he\rquote d taken longer to transform... 
\par His head felt clearer again now that he was in his griffin form; it was harder for the dementors to affect him. But he could see that the people on the ground weren\rquote 
t so lucky; as the dragons with the dementor-filled carriages descended toward them, he could see that they were starting to move more slowly, lackadaisically, with no rhyme or reason. That was why the dragons h
ad been herding people into the center of the plain. 
\par The dragons\rquote  riders had them set down the carriages outside the circle of stones, one to the north and one to the south; the dementors, he could see, immediately started spilling out of their transports
, gliding eerily toward the cowering, gibbering people who couldn\rquote t even see them, unless there were still any witches or wizards who hadn\rquote t fled. Harry wondered where Snape and Ginny were, whether they were well away from the dementors. 

\par If he was going to conjure a Patronus, he\rquote d have to risk returning to his human form. He swallowed, watching the dementors\rquote 
 other-worldly movements, the jerky flight by Muggles who had no idea why they felt such hopelessness, despair, and an inner coldness. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 The Hopeless ones shall walk the earth....and happiness this earth shall flee...}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par He thought, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Oh, god. Maggie\rquote s Fraserburgh Prophecy.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 Harry flew toward the ring of stones and carefully landed on the central lintel on the east side, facing the altar stone. What he saw there shocked him; he\rquote d been unable to see what was going on in the circle\rquote 
s center, partly because of the sheer numbers of people, partly because of the five stone archways arranged in a horseshoe pattern behind the altar stone. From his new vantage point, 
he saw that Jeffries was standing on the altar stone, higher than the rest of the people, and he was shouting. After a confused, moment, Harry realized what he was crying into the wind: \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Believe! Believe! Believe! Be--}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par Harry could also see he was growing
 weaker by the moment as the dementors drew nearer; he was pale and sweaty, trembling head to toe. There were still too many people in the ring, huddling between the inner horseshoe of uprights and the outer circle. It seemed that Jeffries\rquote 
 die-hard supporters were loath to leave him, and he wasn\rquote 
t being parted from the altar stone. Harry folded his wings against his flanks, hesitating to change back to his human form, knowing he would be hit with a wave of cold and despair the moment that it happened, that
 he would have to struggle very hard to come up with a happy thought to conjure a Patronus strong enough to drive so many dementors away. But just as he had this thought, something that helped him feel much happier did in fact occur. Suddenly, he had comp
any on the top of the lintels; members of the Elven Army were appearing all along the top of the ring, and a few at the bases of the standing stones, with loud }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 cracks!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 Dobby himself appeared not two lintels away from Harry, who immediately changed back to h
is human form then, so Dobby would know it was him, and the other elves would know as well. After all, he was their general. The moment he was in human form again, Dobby cried out and ran along the lintels, jumping on him in a most unmilitary-like manner.
 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Harry Potter, Harry Potter}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 !\'94 Dobby screeched excitedly. \'93The Elven Army is here, the Elven Army is here!\'94 Abruptedly, Dobby seemed to realize that he wasn\rquote 
t exactly obeying protocol; he leapt down before Harry and saluted smartly. \'93Lieutenant Dobby reporting, sir!\'94 
\par Harry tried to smile at him through his discomfort; feeling utterly cold inside and hearing his own voice and his mother\rquote s voice seconds before he killed her weren\rquote t exactly conducive to his being a good general. 
\par \'93Get those people into the large tent, Dobby!\'94 he cried with effort. \'93I\rquote ll try to draw the dementors away from them!\'94 
\par Dobby saluted again and whistled loudly to the army. The elves were also starting to be affected by the dementors, however, so Harry amplified his voice again and gav
e all of the elves his orders. This seemed to wake them up a bit and they leapt into action. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Where are Sirius and Hermione with those brooms?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 he wondered, glad that they at least had sent the elves. He didn\rquote t dare Apparate back to Hogsmeade, not with Sandy on his arm. He couldn\rquote t afford to lose her; she\rquote d proven invaluable in managing the dragons. 
\par With horror, he saw that his aunt was next to the altar stone, but it seemed that she was there because she was trying to convince Jeffries to get down and follo
w her to the tent, as she was pulling at the sleeve of his robe. Around them, the elves were pushing a sea of people toward the tent. Some of the more reluctant ones were being }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 levitated}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  by the elves, making Harry wonder whether that was really a good idea. (The sheer volume of the memory charms that would need to be cast was starting to make his head ache.) 
\par There were still people in the ring, including his aunt and Jeffries. The dementors were entering through the uprights, left and right. Dripping with sweat, Harry lifted his wand, crying loudly, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Expecto Patronem!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 A wisp of grey smoke emerged from his wand and he flapped it with agitation, repeating, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Expecto Patronem, Expecto Patronem!}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par A slightly stronger-looking silver cloud flew from his wand, but he knew that his thoughts weren\rquote t happy enough at the moment for him to produce a Patronus that would dri
ve the dementors away. He kept trying, feeling more and more frustrated, and glad that he wasn\rquote t seeing Snape or Ginny anywhere about (they must be in the tent, he realized), although he could have used Snape\rquote s Patronus. 
\par Suddenly, a series of }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 pops!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  explod
ed all around him, on top of the lintels, where he still stood, and on the ground far below. Hermione and Sirius appeared on top of some stone lintels, carrying armfuls of brooms. They wore their own faces again; the Polyjuice sweets must have worn off, H
a
rry reckoned. The two of them stood just above where the dementors had passed through into the circle. Some of the Hogwarts teachers appeared as well as some of the seventh-years who were in the Dueling Club and who had learned to Apparate. There were als
o some people Harry took to be Aurors and operatives, many of them appearing rather far out on the plain, beyond where the dementors had landed. 
\par But best of all, near the center of the circle, facing Harry stood the imposing figure of Albus Dumbledore, his wand raised. Dementors flanked him, yet he waved his wand authoritatively, crying, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
Expecto Patronem!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 with a ringing voice. From his wand burst an enormous white cloud, and Harry was confused, having expected Dumbledore to be able to produce a corporeal 
Patronus. After a moment he realized that it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  a solid Patronus, but like Snape\rquote s, it appeared to be made of multiple creatures. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Bumblebees.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par The bees swooped and dove at the dementors, and they turned, gliding back toward the carriages which still rest
ed on the ground outside the ring of stones, beneath the weary dragons. The dragon Harry had ridden was keeping his compatriots flying high in the sky, well away from where they could provide any help in herding people. They seemed very small now. The rem
aining Death Eater riders did not seem to be able to control them. 
\par Hermione and Sirius made their way along the lintels to Harry, each hugging him awkwardly, because of the brooms; Sirius handed Harry his own broom and Harry nodded at him and grinned. He was glad to see his godfather\rquote 
s face again, much as he liked Aberforth Dumbledore. It hardly seemed to matter now whether they were disguised. 
\par \'93Shall we?\'94 Sirius said with a lopsided smile. 
\par \'93Harry!\'94 Hermione cried out suddenly. 
\par He saw where she was pointing; behind Dumbledore, two dementors who had not been driven away by his Patronus were bent over, respectively, his aunt and Rodney Jeffries. 
\par The dementors had taken their hoods down, to give the Kiss. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Noooo!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 Harry cried, leaping onto his broom and raising his wand in the air. \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Expecto Patronem!}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 
\par This time it worked; as he dove toward the altar stone on his broom, a tremendous stag leapt from his wand tip and galloped past Dumbledore, who nodded at it with approval; Harry\rquote s Patronus drove the dementor
s away from both his aunt and Jeffries, who appeared rather glazed-over. Harry turned in the air and went back in the direction from which he had come, dropping down and landing beside his headmaster. 
\par \'93Professor Dumbledore!\'94 he cried. \'93Can you help me get the two of them to the tent?\'94 
\par Dumbledore\rquote s face was terrible to behold as he realized what the dementors had nearly done right behind his back. \'93Get some of the students to do that. And find Professor Snape; we need more people out here who know how to c
onjure a Patronus if we\rquote re to get the dementors under control,\'94 he said sternly, his eyes hard as steel. 
\par Harry nodded and aimed his broom up again, directing Parvati Patil, Susan Bones and Millicent Bulstrode forward to help his Aunt Petunia, whom they re
cognized from Hogwarts. He got Justin Finch-Fletchley and Ernie MacMillan to help Jeffries; he seemed to be gibbering. While they were doing this, Harry flew to the tent ahead of them, but just as he was going to land and enter, to look for Snape, his Pot
ions professor emerged from one of the openings about fifteen feet away from him. Like Sirius and Hermione, his Polyjuice sweet had also worn off and he appeared as his usual self. 
\par \'93Dad!\'94 Harry said without thinking, flying toward him quickly. \'93I mean--\'94 
\par \'93I know what you mean, Harry,\'94 Snape said quickly. \'93What should I do?\'94 
\par \'93Conjure a Patronus. We need to get the dementors under control.\'94 
\par Snape nodded grimly, gripping his wand with white knuckles; he didn\rquote t comment on the advent of the dementors. When he\rquote d gone into the tent, the chief problem had been dragons. \'93I see the others finally got here,\'94 he growled. 
\par \'93I\rquote ll try to get you a broom,\'94 Harry said, kicking off again. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Expecto Patronem!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 he heard Snape cry behind him, and, looking over his shoulder, H
arry saw a flock of white bats burst from his wand and shoot at the nearest dementors, some of which had been trying to enter the tent, sensing the crowd of people in there. 
\par Harry found Sirius, flying toward some dementors with his wand raised. Harry turned himself around and flew by his side, asking him, \'93Is there a broom Snape can use?\'94 
\par \'93Sorry, Harry! Gave them all out!\'94 Sirius accelerated and pointed his broom up, over the standing stones, and Harry did the same, following him. 
\par \'93That\rquote s okay!\'94 Harry said, having decided what he was going to do. He flew back to Snape and landed next to him, then dismounted and mutely handed him his broomstick. Snape looked at him in horror. Harry yelled at him, \'93Take it! I don
\rquote t need it!\'94 And to emphasize this, he droppe
d the broom and changed into his griffin form, spreading his wings and taking to the air again. He heard a rushing sound nearby and turned his head momentarily to see Severus Snape flying by his side, his wand lifted like a saber and his robes flapping ar
ound him, looking for all the world like a cavalryman riding into battle. 
\par Harry banked and flew straight down toward the circle\rquote s center again, where Dumbledore stood, wand raised, as though conducting the movements of his Patronus--and maybe he was, Harry
 thought. This was a level of control over a Patronus that he had not yet learned. As he watched Dumbledore, an image leapt into Harry\rquote 
s mind that almost made him crash. He managed to touch down without incident, though, and folded his wings before transforming. He started speaking the moment he was in human form again. \'93Sir--I\rquote 
ve just thought--a way to deal with the dementors--\'94 
\par Dumbledore\rquote s face was grim and terrible as he moved his wand, and the ghostly swarm of bees swooped at a dementor, driving it from Professor Flitwick. \'93I\rquote m listening,\'94 he said, still watching his Patronus. \'93You }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 could}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  conjure a Patronus yourself...\'94 he added. 
\par \'93That\rquote s just it! Just doing that forever--that\rquote s not an answer! A Patronus just pushes them around. They need--they need a }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 destination}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, and not just the carriages!\'94 
\par Dumbledore looked at him over his half-moon spectacles. \'93What did you have in mind?\'94 
\par Harry told him; for a moment Dumbledore stared at him in surprise and shock, but he very quickly closed his mouth and nodded. \'93You\rquote re right. It\rquote s the only way. But we need to make certain that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
no one else}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  is affected, understood?\'94 
\par Harry nodded. \'93I\rquote ll try to get everyone out of the center; this would be a good place for it. We can drive the dementors }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 back through}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  the stones into the circle...\'94
 
\par Dumbledore nodded at him again. \'93You go far out on the plain; take others with you to help. Try to get anyone who does not have a broomstick into the tent. I will await your signal. I believe that I have a way to stay rather close without a problem.
\'94 
\par \'93What about the elves, sir?\'94 
\par Dumbledore thought for a moment. \'93Tell Dobby what is going to happen; the elves should leave again, I believe; they would very likely be at risk, as they are so small...\'94 
\par Harry nodded. \'93I\rquote ll tell him.\'94 He changed i
nto his griffin form again and took to the sky; it felt like it took him forever to stop beside each person, transform himself, tell them what was going to happen, then change and move on. The first two people he managed to talk to, luckily, were Hermione
 and Snape, so they told some of the others, and soon the word had been passed to everyone. Dobby was in the process of getting the elves to leave. 
\par Harry flew up high above the plane, bringing his wings together once, twice, three times. Dumbledore saw this signal and engorged his wand into an old-fashioned wizard\rquote 
s staff, striking the ground at his feet with it, shouting an incantation which echoed unintelligibly from the enormous stones surrounding him. A fissure ripped the ground in two at his feet along
 the east-west axis of the circle. The stone arches that formed the circle were not affected, however, as the rip in the earth defied the laws of physics and stretched open, to the south and north, like a great maw. But the five arches that were around th
e
 altar in a horseshoe shape were affected; the central arch split down the middle, each half of the enormous lintel cantilevering over the chasm. The altar stone also cracked down the middle, half on each side of the split now, far away from each other on
 
opposite sides of the circle. The rumbling of the earth tearing itself apart was deafening, but Harry saw that Dumbledore was standing his ground on the north side of the fissure, although even in the air, Harry could feel the vortex of Limbo pulling at h
im, and he could see Dumbledore\rquote s robes being whipped around his legs as though he was standing in the eye of a storm. 
\par But Dumbledore did not waver; he thrust his staff into the air, crying out another incantation. Harry saw his Patronus appear again, the bees rushing to do their master\rquote 
s bidding, and Harry landed and transformed, pulling out his own wand to conjure his Patronus anew and send the dementors toward the chasm. 
\par It was working; his Patronus and at least ten others\rquote  were goading the dementors to
ward the ring of stones, and Harry wanted to cheer when the first one slipped over the edge and plunged into Limbo. They were being drawn even more quickly toward the opening now, and Harry couldn\rquote 
t help the feeling of elation springing up inside him; his happiness made his Patronus even stronger, and the silvery stag leapt about Salisbury Plain, rushing at stray dementors, herding them into the circle, pushing them toward their new home. 
\par But then suddenly, Harry looked down and was surprised to see that he was standing only about twenty feet from the circle of stones; he\rquote 
d been utterly unaware of being drawn toward the vortex of Limbo himself, and even as he realized this, he looked down in fascination, watching his own feet moving inexorably forward, as t
hough they belonged to someone else, as though he no longer had control over them. He tried to think about becoming a golden griffin, but his mind seemed to be confused about how to accomplish this, as though he had a kind of amnesia, and he continued to 
march toward the circle... 
\par As he passed the perimeter of the circle, someone cried out his name; he looked up to see Snape flying his own broom overhead, looking like he was straining not to end up in the chasm himself. In fact, he had taken one of the rop
es that had been hanging down from the lintels--the ropes they had provided for the choir--and had tied it around his waist. \'93Grab one of the ropes, Harry!\'94
 Snape cried. Even as Harry watched, Snape seemed to feel compelled to dive into the abyss on the br
oom, joining the dementors, and he disappeared completely from sight, the rope going taut, before he zoomed up again, shaking and sweating, as he battled his attraction to the vortex. 
\par Seeing that, Harry came to his senses for a moment and reached out for the rope dangling down from the lintel under which he was inexorably passing, wrapping it around his waist and securing it with one of the many sailor\rquote s knots he\rquote 
d learned at Severus Snape\rquote s knee. He still felt himself drawn to the abyss, but a part of his mind was able to fight it, to say, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 No. I\rquote m not doing that....I won\rquote t...}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Suddenly, a loud }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 crack}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ! made Harry turn his head; Dobby appeared beside him. \'93Harry Potter! You are all right! I had to see...\'94
 But within seconds, Dobby was being drawn toward the chasm. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Accio Dobby!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 Harry cried quickly, making the elf suddenly fly into his hands. Harry\rquote 
s heart was beating so loudly it seemed to be in his ears, and he could hear that Dobby was breathing very hard. 
\par \'93Dobby thanks Harry Potter,\'94 he said, wheezing. \'93Dobby worried that Harry Potter--\'94 
\par But suddenly, a beam of red light struck the huge standing stone to Harry\rquote s left, causing him to duck under the lintel, Dobby under his arm. Harry looked up in alarm, seeing the Death Eater who was the phenomenal flyer. 
He swooped down again, clearly aiming at Harry, and Harry could see his face this time, angry and contorted though it was. He had evidently abandoned his helmet after leaving the dragon he\rquote d been riding. In his shock, Harry\rquote 
s grip on Dobby wasn\rquote t what it should have been, which allowed Dobby to leap up in the air and take the curse meant for Harry. Harry realized too late what it was he\rquote 
d heard the Death Eater saying, as he watched the crackling green light hit Dobby and took in the sound of speeding death. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Noooooo}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 !\'94 he cried with every ounce of his being, watching the inert Dobby fall to the ground. To Harry\rquote 
s surprise, though, Dobby was no longer being pulled toward the fissure; only living creatures seemed to feel the attraction toward the abyss. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Not Dobby, no, how could this happen....}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par He swooped over the lintel where Harry was grasping the rope, and Harry pointed his wand at the man\rquote s broom, crying, \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Accio broom!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94
 His means of transport abruptly whipped out from under him and he fell to the earth--or he would have, if there had been earth below him. But there was not, and Harry had only a split second in which to see Ludo Bagman\rquote 
s surprised face before he disappeared below the earth and into Limbo. 
\par Seeing a human fall into the abyss, Dumbledore struck the earth again with his staff, crying out the incantation to close the earth, and Harry noticed for the first time the rope that was tied around Dumbledore\rquote 
s waist like a belt, leading back to another standing stone; he\rquote d decided not to take chances. A g
reat wind swept down from the sky, knitting the earth back together, including the sundered lintel and altar stone, and soon the grass in the ancient circle was as pristine and undisturbed as it had been before Dumbledore had invoked Limbo. Stonehenge was
 intact once more, as it had been for four thousand years. 
\par Harry stood in shock, holding Ludo Bagman\rquote s broom in his hand, staring at Dumbledore. The old man did not seem to be judging Harry, though. Instead he took the rope from around his waist, saying calmly, \'93
You can untie yourself, Harry. And now we need to do something about the other Death Eaters who have played a role in this,\'94 he said, nodding at the dragons flying about in the sky, their riders still trying unsuccessfully to control the animals now
 that they\rquote d decided they didn\rquote t want to be ordered about by \'93Two-Foots.\'94 The Death Eaters who had been riding the dragons with the dementors\rquote 
 carriages strapped to them had long ago leapt down onto the ground and presumably Apparated to safety. 
\par Harry gazed down at Dobby\rquote s inert form. \'93But sir--\'94 he choked out. 
\par \'93I\rquote ll take care of him, Harry. Right now it\rquote s the living who need you more,\'94 he said gently. Harry bit his lip to keep it from shaking, nodding to Dumbledore and trying to focus. He used Bagman\rquote s b
room to fly with Sirius up to one of the dragons; Harry conjured a rope to hold the man in place while Sirius stunned him. Speaking through Sandy, Harry managed to thank the dragon for his help and promised that they would all soon be returned to their pr
oper home in Sweden. The dragon flew to the ground and settled down to wait; Harry marveled at how }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 docile}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 dragons could be when spoken to in their own language (or Parseltongue, which they understood nearly as well). 
\par As he was flying back to the stone circle, the Death Eater suspended between his and Sirius\rquote  brooms, he saw two people trying to apprehend another Death Eater and not faring nearly as well; this one fought back. Harry heard a cry of, \'93}{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Crucio!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 and saw the spell head right for Ginny just as he noticed that it }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  her; she\rquote 
d been swooping toward the dragon on her broom. 
\par She screamed when the curse hit her, falling from her broom, which luckily caused the curse to break, but Harry suddenly abandoned what he was doing, diving quickly so that he was
 under her falling body. When she landed across the twigs of his broom, he reached behind to keep her in place, realizing too late that abandoning Sirius meant that his godfather was now plunging to earth under the weight of the Death Eater. To his relief
, Sirius got his bearings and managed to point his broom up again, although the Death Eater\rquote s stunned body now trailed along well below it in a rather sloppy manner, the man\rquote s mouth hanging open slackly. 
\par Harry flew to the ground with her, stumbling off his broom and holding her in his arms, crying freely, patting her cheeks. \'93Come on! Wake up! Are you all right? You }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 have}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 to be all right....\'94 Her eyes fluttered open and she seemed surprised to see Harry. But before she could speak, he had pulled her into his
 arms again and was kissing her. A moment later, however, he was very confused, as she was pushing him away quite hard. 
\par \'93Harry?\'94 she cried, her breathing labored. She was turning bright pink. \'93Is that you behind all that hair? What do you think you\rquote re doing? I\rquote m married now, remember?\'94 
\par He stared down at Katie\rquote s face, realizing that she really }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 was}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Katie Bell--or Katie Weasley. Since Sirius, Hermione and Snape\rquote 
s Polyjuice sweets had already worn off, Ginny\rquote s probably had as well, and if she\rquote d been flying around with the dragons she\rquote d have looked like herself. Katie must have been one of the Aurors who had come to help, he realized. She didn
\rquote t know he\rquote d grown his hair as part of a disguise; she wasn\rquote t Ginny. 
\par Harry thought that what skin showed on his face was probably redder than a Weasley\rquote s hair. \'93Erm, sorry. See, Ginny took this Polyjuice sweet to look like you, and I thought--\'94 
\par \'93I know,\'94 she said, nodding. \'93Percy selected the sweets for your trip himself. But I\rquote m really Katie, and you\rquote re not my boyfriend anymore, Harry...\'94
 she said, starting to smirk, but instead wincing and groaning. Harry hovered over her, uncertain of what to do. \'93I think I cracked some ribs when I landed on your broom,\'94 she said in a soft, pained voice. \'93Small price to pay,\'94 she said i
n a falsely bright voice; Harry could still hear the pain behind it. \'93I would have been much worse off if I\rquote d hit the ground from that height. Don\rquote t worry, Harry,\'94 she said hurriedly. \'93I don\rquote 
t know how many bones I broke over the years, playing Quidditch at school, let alone during my Auror training. I probably haven\rquote t got a single bone in my body that hasn\rquote t been healed at least once.\'94 
\par He nodded. \'93Do you--do you mind me carrying you? Or do you think you can walk?\'94 
\par She looked like she was going through an internal struggle, but finally said, \'93Actually, if you wouldn\rquote t mind--\'94
 She seemed a bit embarrassed about it, but he tried to smile reassuringly at her, picking her up and carrying her to the tent while she held th
e broom. Once inside the tent, Harry saw that a sort of hospital had been conjured in an area cleared of the cubicles. Rows of camp beds held the wounded, or in some cases, judging from the vacant stares, the Kissed. The dementors had reached some unfortu
n
ate people before being sucked into Limbo. Harry spotted a familiar figure bending over his Aunt Petunia, in a camp bed next to Jeffries, trying to get her to eat some chocolate. There was a pervasive odor of cocoa in the tent and a number of people were 
sitting on their camp beds devouring large pieces of chocolate. He carried Katie to her. 
\par \'93Nita! What are you doing here?\'94 
\par Her hair was clustered around her forehead in damp, humid curls, her usual blonde bun tumbling down at the back of her head, becoming
 more of a ponytail. When she looked up in surprise, her lips pursed, and he could see that her blue eyes were very guarded behind the spectacles. To his surprise, she was dressed as a Muggle, in plain jeans and a grey fleece jacket. \'93
I was looking into Jeffries, after you told me that he\rquote d healed you. I--I wanted to see how--how he did it--\'94 She frowned, then waved her wand, which she removed from her jacket pocket, and conjured another camp bed. \'93Put her down here. You
\rquote re a lot hairier than the last time I saw you,\'94 she commented. But before he could explain, she was back on Katie. \'93What\rquote s wrong with her, she wasn\rquote t Kissed, was she?\'94 
\par Katie frowned after Harry gently lowered her. \'93No, I was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  Kissed,\'94 she said acidly. \'93I still have my wits about me. I\rquote ve
 just cracked some ribs. Who are you again?\'94 
\par Nita raised one eyebrow as she poked and prodded Katie\rquote s mid-section. \'93I\rquote m Dr. Anderssen, of St. Mungo\rquote s. And you are--?\'94 
\par \'93Katie Weasley.\'94 
\par Nita stopped what she was doing. \'93Weasley? How--how is that possible?\'94 
\par Katie frowned. \'93How is what possible? I\rquote m married to Percy Weasley. You\rquote ve heard of marriage, I suppose? It\rquote s not like we invented it,\'94 she added caustically; Harry reckoned the pain was making her a bit cross. 
\par \'93Katie!\'94 
\par Harry turned at the familiar voice; Percy was striding through the rows of camp beds. His hair was as neat as ever, but his glasses were askew and he looked slightly }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 singed}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, soot on his face and hands. When he reached his wife, he sat on the edge of her bed, brushing the hair from her brow and smiling lovingly at her. She took his hand in hers and kissed it. 
\par \'93I\rquote m all right, love. I would have had a bad time of it, but Harry caught me. I have some cracked ribs, that\rquote s all.\'94 She gave him a gentle smile. 
\par Percy turned to Harry, his blue eyes wide behind his glasses, reminding him a great deal of Ron. \'93Thanks, Harry. I--I don\rquote t know what--\'94 
\par \'93It\rquote s okay, Percy,\'94 Harry said quickly, deciding not to tell him that he thought he\rquote d been saving his sister. 
\par Almost as though the thought of her had s
ummoned Ginny, he looked up to see her making her way through the rows of beds, looking quite anxious, and he half-ran to meet her, holding her tightly against him, feeling like he would never let her go. She buried her face in his neck, sobbing. \'93}{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Oh, you\rquote re all right, you\rquote re all right}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94
 she repeated like a litany. He tilted her face up and she immediately opened her mouth under his, her fingers sliding up into his lengthened hair, not caring who saw them. 
\par \'93Harry!\'94 
\par He reluctantly separated his mouth from Ginny\rquote s, seeing Ron and Hermione walking towards them. There were more hugs all round and backslapping. 
\par \'93The Aurors and operatives are rounding up the Death Eaters. Some of them have actually surrendered,\'94 Hermione said breathlessly. \'93It\rquote s even possible some of them will give evidence, to get off more lightly. And the dragons are behaving }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 very}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  strangely. They\rquote re all sitting out there on Salisbury Plain looking like oversized nesting hens. I remember how much trouble the handlers had with the dragons during
 the First Task of the Tournament. Ron said Charlie wouldn\rquote t believe his eyes if he saw them like this. Do you think they\rquote re drugged by the Death Eaters, perhaps? Maybe they gave them some kind of potion?\'94 
\par With a little foot shuffling, Harry explained that he\rquote d spoken to them through Sandy, that the dragons understood Parseltongue, and that, when he really concentrated hard and they talked slowly, he could make out Wyrmtongue, but couldn\rquote 
t speak it. They were shocked. 
\par Dumbledore appeared behind Ron, reaching out and putting his hand on Harry\rquote s shoulder. He didn\rquote t seem to have heard what Harry had been saying about the dragons. \'93Good idea you had, there, Harry,\'94 he said with a small smile. \'93
I never did like dementors,\'94 he added simply. Harry started to smile at him, but then he remembered Dobby. 
\par \'93Where\rquote s--where\rquote s Dobby, sir? He--he saved my life--\'94 
\par Dumbledore sighed. \'93He is on the other side of the tent with the other--casualties. I will see to it that he is returned to Hogwarts quite carefully and respectfully.\'94 His hand tightened on Harry\rquote s shoulder. \'93
He did what a good lieutenant is trained to do; protect his general,\'94 he said quietly. 
\par Harry had a lump in his throat which wouldn\rquote t go away. Hermione\rquote s hand had gone to her breast. \'93Oh, no...not }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Dobby}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ...\'94 She buried her face on Ron\rquote 
s chest and he patted her back gently, although his face said that he\rquote d never understood Hermione\rquote s obsession with the elves. He seemed to understand Harry\rquote s grief, though, in that Dobby had died for him. 
\par \'93He was a good little bloke,\'94 Ron said to Harry in a matter-of-fact voice. \'93Saved your arse in the Second Task, didn\rquote t he? I\rquote d still be in the lake...\'94
 Ron had a feeble smile and Harry tried to smile back, but those muscles no longer seemed to function for him. 
\par He saw Snape, S
irius and Maggie making their way through the beds now, looking exhausted. Sirius was also a bit singed, like Percy, and Snape afforded Harry a rare smile when he saw him holding Ginny. Maggie, however, looked straight ahead as she walked, a very single-m
inded expression on her face, but she also seemed to be in another world, seeing something the rest of them couldn\rquote t. She didn\rquote 
t look at her younger sister and brother at all, nor Harry and Hermione, but moved purposefully toward where Nita Anderssen sat on the edge of Katie\rquote s bed, moving her wand over Katie\rquote s ribs and murmuring something. 
\par Maggie was clearly hesitating to say anything, and Harry thought this was odd, as she had thus far seemed to get on well with her new sister-in-law. But then Harry saw that Maggie wasn\rquote t looking at Katie. \'93You\rquote re here,\'94
 she said softly, starting to cry. \'93You\rquote re really here. I--I }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 felt}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 you. I thought I felt you at the village hall, when Ron was getting his OM, but I thought I must have been mad for thinking that, and I was t
alking to our mum and dad and Bill and Charlie and thought maybe the family feelings I was getting were because of them....But last night--I had a dream, I\rquote ve been having dreams about seeing you again...I thought it was wishful thinking--\'94
 she babbled, her voice full of tears. 
\par Nita Anderssen stood and slowly walked around Katie\rquote s camp bed, staring at Maggie as though she was a ghost. 
\par \'93}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Peggy}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ....\'94 
\par Suddenly the two women were holding each other and crying, although strangely, Nita didn\rquote t seem at all shocked
. Harry frowned at Ginny, Hermione and Ron, but Ron was grinning ear to ear, stepping forward to put his arms around Maggie and Nita, who each hugged him in turn, still crying. Hermione and Ginny looked as mystified as Harry felt; they both shrugged. Magg
ie held Nita at arm\rquote s length. 
\par \'93Oh, Annie, I can hardly believe it\rquote s you....\'94 
\par Harry had to pick his jaw up from the ground. He started to move forward, but Hermione put her hand on his arm to stop him as Ginny surged forward. 
\par \'93You--you\rquote re not Draco\rquote s cousin after all? You\rquote re--you\rquote re my sister?\'94 Ginny said in disbelief. Nita hesitated before nodding. 
\par \'93Yes, I\rquote m afraid so. I\rquote m--I\rquote m dreadfully sorry. Do you hate me?\'94 she whispered, looking fearfully at her youngest sister. 
\par Ginny\rquote s only answer was to throw her arms around Nita\rquote s neck and cling to her. \'93Of course I don\rquote t. You must have had such an awful life...\'94 
\par Nita separated from her, a flush under her freckles. \'93Well, actually, no. Not such an awful life. Except for thinking that my own family didn\rquote t want me,\'94 she whispered. \'93
And after Ron told me why I was kidnapped, I was afraid that I might still be a target. After all, you were keeping it a secret that Peggy was a Weasley for her protection...\'94 
\par Percy stood and faced her. \'93Then--then you\rquote re my older sister, too,\'94 he said evenly, neither hostile nor excited. She nodded. 
\par \'93And you\rquote re--you\rquote re the bloke who was born on a very inconvenient day for a little girl who wanted a sixth birthday party more than a new little brother,\'94 she admitted sheepishly. \'93I know now that it wasn\rquote t your fault.\'94
 She smiled at him. 
\par He put his hand on her arm. \'93You were only six,\'94 he said logically. She laughed and pulled him into a hug now, and he laughed too, kissing her on the cheek. \'93Mum is going to be a basket case when she sees you,\'94 he predicted. 
\par Nita\rquote s face fell. \'93Mum...Dad...Are you sure they }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 want}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  to see me?\'94 she whispered. Ron put his hand on her shoulder. 
\par \'93I told you--they didn\rquote t get rid of you, they were destroyed when you two disappeared.\'94 
\par Ginny touched Nita\rquote s hair for a moment. \'93Are you a natural blonde? How odd. In the pictures of you, when you were young, you had red hair like the rest of us...\'94 
\par Nita touched her hair absentmindedly, as though she\rquote d forgotten about it. \'93Oh, it\rquote s a potion. I\rquote ve been taking it for years. Everyone else in the family was blond, so...\'94 
\par \'93I can\rquote t believe you grew up with the Malfoys!\'94 Ginny eyes were wide. 
\par \'93Well, technically I didn\rquote t grow up with the Malfoys. I grew up in Sweden, only visiting Britain every few years at the holidays, if that, and when I was at Durmstrang, I was off up on the Russian border...\'94 Nita explained. 
\par \'93That's right! You went to Durmstrang!\'94 Ginny exclaimed, her eyes wide. \'93If you'd gone to Hogwarts, Charlie would have recognized you right off--\'94 
\par \'93Yes. And--and if I\rquote d been adopted by anyone else, such as a family that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 didn\rquote t}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  hate the Weasleys, I might have come home long before now.\'94
 Her lips went very thin. \'93I didn\rquote t exactly have high hopes of being welcomed back with open arms, having been consorting with Malfoys...\'94 
\par \'93But how is it you remember everything?\'94 Maggie said incredulously. \'93I had a memory charm put on me. Didn\rquote t you?\'94 
\par Nita shook her head. \'93I narrowly avoided it. I was planning to run away. I\rquote d put a bundle of pillows and blankets in my hospital b
ed, to make it look like I was still there, and I was in the corner getting dressed behind a screen when the bloke who\rquote d kidnapped us came in to put the spell on me. I don\rquote t think he ever knew he memory-charmed a pile of laundry.\'94
 She gave her sister a lopsided half-smile that reminded Harry of Ron. \'93I\rquote ve always remembered everything,\'94 she finished quietly. \'93When I met Ron at St. Mungo\rquote 
s, I was worried that the family would reject him for being a werewolf. We spent a lot of time talking. I told him every nasty thing I\rquote d ever heard from my aunt and uncle--especially my uncle--about the Weasleys, and Ron defended the family,\'94
 she said, her hand on his arm. 
\par \'93I knew something was up, though,\'94 Ron added, \'93and the truth finally came out, including the fact that she thought it was }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Mum and Dad}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 who'd arranged for Pettigrew to kidnap them. I finally convinced her that wasn't how it happened, but she made me promise to keep her identity our secret for a while. She wasn't sure how her }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 other}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  mum and dad would take her finding out about all this. And--well, I went and told her that there was a chance she might be in the Prophecy, and she knew just what Prophecy I meant. So then we were }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 both}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  worried about Death Eaters finding out about her still being alive....\'94 
\par \'93Like a certain uncle of mine,\'94 she said quietly, grimacing. 
\par Maggie hit Ron on the chest, but not hard. \'93How could you not tell }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , though? I can\rquote t believe you--\'94 
\par But her Ron-scolding was interrupted by another family reunion. \'93Katie!\'94 cried a familiar voice. They all turned, seeing Sam Bell making his way through the rows of beds to his daughter. She sat up on her elbows, grinning at him. 
\par \'93Dad! What are you doing here?\'94 
\par There was a moment of awkwardness. \'93Well, I was hoping...\'94 He shuffled his feet for a moment and spoke to the ground. \'93I was hoping that Jeffries would help me...\'94 He looked up and sought out Harry\rquote s eyes. \'93
He did it for your aunt, after all...\'94 
\par Nita frowned, shaking her head. \'93What? Jeffries did--}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 what}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ?\'94 
\par Harry stepped forward to explain how Jeffries had made his aunt magical, and his idea that it was largely her belief that that was what was necessary for her to be healed of the cancer that had done it. Nita looked quizzically at Sam. 
\par \'93So--is your daughter Muggle-born? You\rquote re a Muggle trying to become a wizard?\'94 
\par Sam shook his head. \'93No. I\rquote m a wizard. Or was. I was an Auror, in fact. But I spent ten years in Azkaban...the dementors, they...\'94 He swallowed, unable to speak about it. 
\par \'93You only went to Azkaban because Lucius Malfoy put your wife under Imperius,\'94 Harry said staunchly, then gave Nita an alarmed look. \'93Sorry. I know you think he\rquote s so great--\'94 
\par \'93No, I don\rquote t,\'94 Nita corrected him. \'93I\rquote ve learned a lot more about him recently. And while there\rquote s almost nothing he wouldn\rquote t do for family, well--let\rquote s just say that even his family members shouldn\rquote 
t dare to disagree with him if they know what\rquote s good for them. Aunt Cissy learned that lesson the hard way, and so did Draco...\'94 
\par Harry\rquote s eyes opened wide. \'93Did you know where he was hiding?\'94 
\par She shook her head. \'93Not exactly. I had my suspicions. Aunt Cissy was being very funny. And then one day he showed up in my flat, asking me a lot of weird questions about selkies and making me swear I wouldn\rquote t tell the authorities I\rquote 
d seen him. I was terrified...\'94 
\par Harry hit his forehead. \'93Mariah\rquote s mum! I forgot! What\rquote s going to happen to her now?\'94 
\par \'93Now? What do you mean \lquote now?\rquote  And who\rquote s Mariah?\'94 Nita wanted to know. 
\par Harry explained what Lucius Malfoy had done, and Nita covered her mouth in horror. \'93That }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 bastard}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ,\'94
 she breathed through her fingers. When the explanations about the Bell family and the Kirkner family and what he\rquote d done to them were finished, she was just shaking her head in disbelief. 
\par \'93And to think that all these years, he was telling me what horrors the Weasleys were...\'94 
\par \'93Do you think he ever realized that you }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 were}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  a Weasley?\'94 Ginny asked in a small voice. Nita considered this. 
\par \'93I don\rquote t know. Maybe Aunt Cissy would know. I just can\rquote t take it all in...\'94 
\par Sam was looking at her strangely. \'93I think I missed something. You're another Weasley? Are you a cousin or something?\'94 He smiled at Katie. \'93It's going to take me forever to learn my way around your new family. I hope you're less confused t
han I am, Kate.\'94 
\par He was gazing at Nita again, and she seemed to go pinker the longer he did this. \'93Sorry. I'm--I'm Annie Weasley,\'94 she said in a shaking voice. \'93I'm Annie Weasley,\'94 she said, her voice stronger and clearer this time, as she extended her ha
nd to Sam. \'93Your son-in-law's oldest sister.\'94 
\par He suddenly grinned and pulled her to him in a crushing hug, ignoring her extended hand. \'93You are? You really are? But that means--\'94 He looked back and forth from Nita to Maggie and back. \'93That means you've both been found. Oh, god,\'94
 he said, covering his face with his hands and then taking them down to look at her again in disbelief. \'93The day we went to Ottery St. Catchpole to look for the two of you...Two little girls, just vanished...Your mum was terribly br
oken up about it for weeks,\'94 he told Harry. He looked at Nita again. \'93And now here you are...\'94 he said in wonder. 
\par She turned to Sam and took his hands in hers. \'93You were an Auror who went to Azkaban? And--and you\rquote re without magic now? Completely? But there are others who were in Azkaban for years who can do magic...\'94 
\par Sam shook his head. \'93Not me. Depends on how much you let the dementors into your head. I reckon I wasn\rquote t strong enough...\'94 
\par Nita looked with narrowed eyes back and forth between Harry and Sam, clearly thinking very hard. \'93But--but Harry said something,\'94 she said slowly. \'93About--about }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 belief}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
. Is it--is it possible that you just didn\rquote t }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 believe}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  that you could do magic after you were released from prison--and so you weren\rquote t able to? Is it possible
 that--you just need to believe you can still be a wizard?\'94 she asked him breathlessly. 
\par Katie sat up straighter, looking at her father and the woman who\rquote d just been revealed as her sister-in-law. \'93What are you saying?\'94 
\par Nita turned to her. \'93I--I could heal when I was young. Animals, humans, it didn\rquote t matter. Real }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 healing}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
. As I received more training....that went away. But I was watching Jeffries before the--well, before everything fell apart. I was watching what he did. He clearly believed in his }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 own}{
\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  abilities, and he made other people believe in }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 theirs}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .\'94 She looked at Sam. \'93Maybe I can bring back both of us,\'94
 she whispered to him. 
\par He stared at her in awe; Sam was still wearing the rough robe that had been placed on him when he was in the queue. \'93Maybe,\'94 he said softly, never taking his eyes from her. 
\par Visibly trembling, she reached out and placed her hand on his head, her fingers sinking into his auburn hair. She and Sam both closed their eyes and seemed to be thinking very hard. Everyone around them was v
ery still, watching and waiting. She never said the word }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 believe}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
, unlike Jeffries, but Harry could feel the hair standing up on the back of his neck at one point, and there seemed to be a crackling sort of rainbow light limning Nita and Sam, especially where they were joined, her hand on his head. 
\par Sam\rquote s eyes flew open; he looked jolted, shocked. He removed her hand from his head but held it in his as he stood, then kissed it lightly, making Nita turn deep red. He looked around as though seeing the world fo
r the first time, an expression of amazement on his face. And Harry saw that he looked }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 strong}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , stronger than he\rquote d ever known him (and he wasn\rquote 
t in the habit of thinking of Sam as weak). Sam looked at Nita again and asked, \'93May I borrow your wand?\'94 
\par She nodded and handed it to him; he waved it, producing gold sparks that coalesced into sparkling golden roses, which he presented to his daughter, kissing her on the head with a smile. Harry couldn\rquote 
t prevent the cheer that escaped his throat when he saw that, and the others quickly joined him. Percy was grinning and patting his father-in-law on the back and Maggie was hugging an amazed Nita again, saying, \'93You did it! You did it!\'94 
\par Katie hung on her father\rquote s neck as he bent over her bed, clutching her roses in her right hand. \'93Oh, }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Daddy!}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94
 she choked out, half laughing, half crying, as though she were very small again, and he held her and laughed his great booming laugh. Harry couldn\rquote t resist the urge to hug Ginny again, grinning like mad. After kissing his daughte
r on the head one more time, Sam stood and embraced Nita. 
\par \'93Thank you,\'94 he said earnestly, holding her at arms\rquote  length. She was still a bright crimson from when he\rquote d kissed her hand. 
\par \'93Oh. You\rquote re--you\rquote re welcome,\'94 she said softly, still looking shocked that it had worked. 
\par Ginny separated herself from Harry and hugged her oldest sister, laughing. \'93You did it! You really are a healer!\'94 Nita laughed with her, and Ginny told her, \'93You know, I always hoped I\rquote d get to meet you. Your first name is my middle name,
 you know.\'94 
\par \'93Is it?\'94 Hermione said suddenly. \'93Ginny Annie Weasley?\'94 
\par Ginny made a face. \'93No, of course not. Virginia Annabel Weasley.\'94 
\par Hermione\rquote s mouth was saying, \'93Ooooh.\'94 But Harry could see that behind her face, the wheels of her mind were in motion once more. However, even as Harry thought this, Maggie pulled Snape forward and introduced him to Nita as her fianc\'e9. 

\par That caused another uproar amongst the people who hadn\rquote t known--unlike Ginny and Harry--that he\rquote d proposed to her and that she\rquote 
d accepted. Harry nodded and smiled at Snape, who looked quite embarrassed about the friendly approval of the Weasleys, almost as though he\rquote 
d expected shocked and horrified rejection. It was a most unlikely scenario, the former Death Eater standing amidst a crowd of Gryffindors, being drawn out until he was laughing and talking animatedly, and yet Harry thought he\rquote 
d never seen anything in his life--at least, this life--that felt more right.

l over the wizarding news that dragons, dementors and Death Eaters had attacked the gathering at Stonehenge and had been repelled by him, Dumbledore, Snape and the others. Ministry Wizards spent four days putting memory charms on Muggles. Charlie Weasley 
and other dragon-handlers managed to get the Swedish Shortsnouts back to their old reservation, with Harry\rquote 
s help. (Charlie was dumbfounded that Harry could speak to and be understood by the dragons, although Harry explained that he was really speaking Parseltongue.) 
\par Six days after Dobby had been killed by Ludo Bagman, the house elves of Hogwarts held their version of a funeral for him, as was the custom. Harry had never seen anything stranger than the somber procession of small, bowed figures crossing the 
Hogwarts grounds, two by two, making their way to the patch of earth near the forest that had served for almost a thousand years as a graveyard for elves. He\rquote 
d never noticed it before as it had always been overgrown and unkempt, the graves unmarked. 
\par After returning to Hogwarts from Stonehenge, he had learned from Dumbledore that elves did not speak of the dead except in hushed tones, as they thought that to speak of Death would bring \lquote Him\rquote 
 round for more. (It was similar, Harry thought, to the wizarding world attitude toward saying \'93Voldemort.\'94
) Burials were supposed to be silent and swift, and Harry, Hermione, Ron and Ginny quietly followed Dumbledore and the line of elves toward the small ivy-covered patch of ground where Hagrid had already dug a hole for
 the unadorned wooden box that Harry had insisted upon building himself with Muggle tools, his tears seeping into the wood as he worked. 
\par Dumbledore stood by the grave, unusually subdued in a fawn-colored robe and hat, while the elves lowered the box into the ground. Dobby\rquote 
s wife, Biddy, threw dirt onto the box first, her enormous eyes swimming with tears; she wore a simple little ecru dress that Hermione had acquired for her. Harry saw, as the elves stepped forward one by one, that although many of them wo
re small clothes now (especially those who were in the Elven Army, some of whom had been wounded at Stonehenge), the vast majority of them, male or female, still wore, like little pinafore dresses, tea towels with the Hogwarts crest. 
\par After it was Harry\rquote s turn to throw dirt into the grave, which was very nearly full up now, he turned to Ginny, holding her tightly, unashamed of his tears, wishing elves weren\rquote 
t so set against speaking about death. He needed to speak about Dobby, but this was all he was going to get, this silent procession of elves throwing dirt onto Dobby\rquote s coffin. 
\par That night he was having trouble sleeping; looking for a book to read, to tire himself out, he lit his wand and started searching through his trunk, finding instead the mismatched 
socks that Dobby had given him for Christmas when he was in fourth year, the socks he\rquote 
d worn to the Yule Ball, even though no one except the fake Moody had been able to see them beneath his robes. Fresh sobs started punching their way out of him, so he hur
riedly closed his trunk and fled down to the common room, flinging himself into a chair by the cold hearth, bringing the misshapen socks to his eyes to stem the flow of his tears. When he felt cried-out, he lit the fire with his wand and stared at it numb
ly, and finally, without really intending to, he opened his mouth and began to sing softly the }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Kaddish}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 Ruth had taught him in his other life. He trailed off at the end, starting to cry again. 
\par \'93I\rquote m sorry, Dobby,\'94 he sobbed. \'93I\rquote m sorry I ever said I\rquote d strang
le you for keeping me from going through the barrier to the train. I'm sorry I was cross with you for keeping my letters and performing that Hover Charm and making that Bludger come after me...\'94 
\par \'93Why is Harry Potter crying?\'94 
\par Harry jumped at the familiar voice. Standing before the fire, looking for all the world like he was moving the logs with a poker, was Dobby. Except that it wasn\rquote t Dobby, for Dobby wasn\rquote t white and misty and see-through. Or he didn\rquote 
t used to be like that. 
\par Harry grinned through his tears. \'93Dobby! What are you doing here? House elves can become ghosts?\'94 
\par Dobby turned and nodded at him. \'93Oh, yes. House elves are tending to feel that the housework is never really being done, you see, Harry Potter.\'94 
\par Harry nodded with understanding. \'93I can see that. But you were free. So why are }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  here? Not that I\rquote m not glad to see you.\'94 
\par He lifted his large silvery eyes to Harry. \'93There is indeed work of Dobby\rquote s which is not done. But it is not housework, Harry Potter.\'94 
\par He looked down at his own ghostly clothes, baggy short trousers and a too-large shirt that reminded Harry of when he used to have to wear Dudley\rquote s old things. \'93
Dobby had hoped that more of the elves would want to be free, you see, Harry Potter. But the elves have not asked for clothes,\'94 he said sadly. Harry sat up, gripping the arms of the chair. 
\par \'93Do you--do you want me to free them, Dobby?\'94 he asked breathlessly. Dobby gave him a huge, sappy, ghostly smile. 
\par \'93Dobby would be liking that very much, Harry Potter,\'94 he said quietly. Harry swallowed the lump in his throat. 
\par \'93Leave it to me, Dobby,\'94 he said. \'93I just need to pick the right time. And I\rquote ll need to have a lot of elf-clothes ready. Hermione, Ron and Ginny could help with that...\'94 
\par Dobby\rquote s silvery lip trembled. \'93Oh, Harry Potter, is too good to Dobby. Dobby doesn\rquote t know what to say--\'94 he burbled, wiping ghostly tears with the back of his ghostly hands. 
\par \'93Just leave it to me,\'94 Harry said again. \'93I won\rquote t let you down.\'94 
\par \'93I know, Harry Potter. I know....\'94 
\par He disappeared as suddenly as he had appeared, and Harry stared at the fire, feeling a sense of resolve. 
\par He had made a promise to Dobby, and he intended to keep it.

s End to welcome Nita back into the fold. Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny had received permission to accompany Snape and Maggie to Hogsmeade for the celebration; by the end of the weekend, Nita was actually answering to the name, \'93Annie.\'94
 Harry heard more than one person call Maggie \'93Peggy\'94 and get an answer. They were also able to celebrate Ginny\rquote 
s upcoming seventeenth birthday, and although Harry would have liked to be alone with her, he enjoyed seeing her with her family members and so happy. Mrs. Weasley told Harry, when he asked, that she\rquote 
d be glad to knit a large quantity of small jumpers if he procured the wool for her, although he wasn\rquote t very clear about what they were for. 
\par It was only the twenty-eighth of March; Ginny's birthday wasn\rquote 
t until the following Wednesday. Dumbledore had told Harry and Hermione that in light of the many Death Eaters who'd been apprehended, he had decided to very cautiously allow some of the students to go to Hogsmeade the following Saturday. Permissi
on would be granted to of-age students only, and he would have the right to veto the privileges of any student he thought should not go, for whatever reason. Ginny would be squeaking in just under the wire, age-wise, but the trip would allow her and Harry
 to have another birthday celebration for her at the Three Broomsticks, with Hermione and Ron. 
\par Unfortunately, the Head Girl and Boy were not permitted to tell anyone about the Hogsmeade weekend ahead of time, and were virtually bursting all week because of
 this. Ginny and Ron thought they were a bit mental at times, and said so. Even among the staff, only the heads of the houses were aware of Dumbledore's plan. But it was to be a secret until Saturday morning so that no one outside of the school would get 
wind of it. Dumbledore didn\rquote t want to take chances, and he also didn\rquote t want any students going to Hogsmeade who weren\rquote t permitted to do magic away from school.. 
\par The surrender of the Death Eaters involved in the Stonehenge attack had led to others giving themselves up who had had nothing to do with it. Voldemort\rquote 
s forces, it seemed, were being depleted daily. Plus, he no longer had dragons and dementors, not to men
tion Lucius Malfoy and Ludo Bagman, whose role in the Stonehenge incident was still somewhat mysterious to everyone. Rodney Jeffries and Petunia Dursley were still in St. Mungo\rquote 
s, (their souls, it turned out, were intact, but they were still not speaking). While Harry felt reasonably good about the way things had turned out, there were still some rather large question marks hovering over everything. 
\par As a safety precaution, on the day of the Hogsmeade trip, Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny went to the village
 using the tunnel under the statue of the hump-backed witch, emerging under the Honeydukes sweet shop. It was Hermione's idea not to walk to the village in the open air; Harry and Ron had argued, but Hermione had said she'd give them both detention and pr
event them going if they didn't agree. When they reached the Three Broomsticks, they discovered that Maggie and Snape had been busy in the short time they\rquote 
d been there, while they had been plodding through the dusty tunnel. The pub was decorated for a birthday party for Ginny, who was utterly floored. 
\par \'93I already had a party!\'94 she exclaimed, laughing and hugging her sister. 
\par \'93I know, Ginny, but you weren\rquote t really seventeen yet, and now you are. And this time your school friends are here. Or at least the ones who are older than you.\'94 
\par Even Draco Malfoy was there, mutely handing Ginny a small silver-wrapped gift. She thanked him but did not open it, placing it with a pile of other unopened presents. At one point, looking around the busy room with interest and d
rinking a butterbeer, Ginny asked him, \'93So, where\rquote s Mariah? She had her birthday in February. I don\rquote t think I\rquote ve seen her.\'94 
\par Draco\rquote s mouth was drawn very thin. \'93Professor Dumbledore didn\rquote t think it would be a good idea for her to come.\'94 
\par Ginny puzzled over this for a moment, before say, \'93Oh, I see. Because--\'94 
\par \'93--because her selkie skin hasn\rquote t turned up, yes. Nor her mum,\'94 he confirmed grimly, knocking back something in a hip flask that Harry didn\rquote t think was butterbeer. Soon after they had returned from St
onehenge, Draco Malfoy had been permitted to attend his father\rquote s funeral, and he\rquote d been very subdued ever since. His father had indeed died from his fall. Harry hadn\rquote t revealed to Draco his own role in Lucius Malfoy\rquote 
s death, though he knew that he wasn\rquote t technically to blame. If Malfoy hadn\rquote t been trying to curse }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 .... 
\par Harry turned from Draco, unable to meet his gaze. He walked to the bar to get a packet of crisps to share with Ginny, but when he returned to their table, she wasn\rquote t there. 
\par \'93Where\rquote s--?\'94 he began to say, but suddenly, Maggie\rquote s thoughts were in his mind. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 She\rquote s left the pub.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Harry glanced at her across the table, where she sat very cozily with Severus Snape, drinking some elderflower wine. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Why? It\rquote s her party.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Follow her down the High Street. Look casual about it. Try not to draw attention to yourself. The rest of the family are at the Burrow today.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 What?}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought at her, confused. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Stop doing that.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Stop doing what}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 ? 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Making that face. People will work out what we\rquote re doing. Just do as I told you.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  
\par Harry swallowed, putting down the crisps. \'93I\rquote m just--erm, be right back,\'94 he said feebly, walking quickly toward the door of the pub before anyone could ask him a question. 
\par When he was standing on the threshold of the pub, he looked up and down the High Street, finally seeing her standing and looking in a shop window, although she didn\rquote 
t really look remotely interested in anything she was seeing. He saw her gaze flicker at him out of the corner of her eye before she turned and continued to stro
ll down the cobblestone pavement. He began to move at an equally leisurely pace, wondering what was going on, but willing to follow her anywhere; he would have followed her to the moon and back. 
\par When she took a step, he took a step; when she paused to loo
k in another shop window, he paused to look in the nearest window; at one point he discovered that he was actually looking into the parlor of an old witch who had lifted her robes to adjust her tights, and she glared at him, closing the curtains with a fl
ick of her hand. He backed up guiltily, turning and seeing that Ginny had begun to walk down the drive of Hog\rquote 
s End. Now she turned her head and met his gaze, saying nothing, not even gesturing, but beckoning him with her eyes. He continued to walk forward again, continuing to look into those large, dark eyes, which were drawing nearer and nearer.... 
\par When he was only ten feet away, she turned casually and walked toward the door. She whispered a password and then opened the heavy oak front door, pausing, wai
ting for him. When he was on the threshold, she finally moved forward into the entrance hall. He closed and locked the door securely behind them. She had already started walking upstairs, and he followed, watching her swaying hips before him, feeling more
 and more excited by her purposeful movements, her unerring determination. When they reached the room that had been his in his other life, he followed her in and closed the door. 
\par Harry approached her and ran his hand up her arm tentatively, then along her shoulder to her neck; he could feel her pulse very strongly. Her heart seemed to be going a mile a minute. He wasn\rquote 
t exactly cool, calm and collected; he kept feeling as though he had to remind himself to breathe. He slowly pulled her mouth to his, and she
 was ready immediately, no hesitation at all, no questioning any more, although he could feel her shaking with nerves. Her fingers fluttered to the hem of his shirt, and the first contact they made with the skin on his stomach startled him and made him fl
i
nch. They continued to kiss deeply while she moved her quivering hands up his chest, and he moaned into her mouth as she made contact with more and more of his bare skin, and then flicked across his nipples. The two of them broke apart briefly for her to 
pull the shirt over his head, then her lips attached themselves to his neck, as though she would drink his life\rquote 
s blood. Her nerves were starting to ease a bit and he gasped from the combination of her mouth and hands. When his fingers went to unfasten her blouse, she helped him, every other button released by him, the rest by her. 
\par Somehow, this teamwork to take her clothes off completely undid him. He gathered her to him again, twining his hand in her hair, taking her bottom lip between his teeth, gently, 
running his tongue along her jaw line and up to her earlobe. She trembled in his arms when he did that, then trembled more when he moved his mouth down her neck, and further.... 
\par She stepped back from him for only a moment, removing her skirt as though it 
was an annoyance, and helping him remove his trousers. But then she was back, and when he brought his lips down on her neck again and held her to him by putting his hands around her waist, she ran her hands over his shoulders and arms, his chest and back,
 
over and over, the caresses frantic yet focused, seeming quite calculated to drive him mad. He moved his hands further down, cupping her bottom tenderly, pulling her against him, and she sighed happily and tried to move closer still, which made him gasp; 
did she }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 know}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  what she\rquote 
d just done? he wondered. But then he looked down into her face, her beautiful, mischievous face, and from the sly expression there, he knew that she }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 had}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 known, that it was quite deliberate, and as she pulled him to her again, receiving him in the welcoming hollow of her belly, he wanted to kiss her breathless to both punish and reward her.... 
\par Instead, she pulled away from him again and walked toward the bed, holding out her hand to him, and he took it, following her. He remembered seeing her in the Potions Dungeon in his fifth year, after he\rquote 
d thought Malfoy had attacked her (and now he knew that he really had, to a certain extent); he remembered carrying her to Madam Pomfrey afterward, his heart aching for her. She looked so different
 now, so self-possessed and confident as she stood next to the bed. Not taking her eyes from him, she removed her bra. He reached down and removed her last garment, pulling the elastic down over her legs slowly and deliberately, and then she did the same 
for him. (He had to remind himself to breathe again as she hesitated for a moment before standing.) They stood facing each other, very close, not touching, without any more barriers between them, no more obstacles. Harry couldn\rquote 
t take it any more, and at the same moment she lunged for him, he pulled her to his body, and now they were kissing each other more passionately than they\rquote d yet dared, no holding back or being coy, no nervousness or second thoughts. 
\par Their hands and mouths no longer felt that any territory was off-limits; Harry grinned when she tipped her head back and let a low moan escape her, and he almost yelped in surprise when she tentatively reached out a shaking hand to touch him; it hadn
\rquote t occurred to him she would do that, somehow, but moments later, as she gained confidence and moved her hand and his mind spun, he was very, very glad she had.... 
\par They tumbled onto the bed, which quickly became a shambles from their rolling over and twisting around; every square inch of skin needing to be expl
ored, it seemed, with kisses and caresses, lips and tongues and fingers. At length, Harry made her lie back while he started at her toes and began to move up her legs, tracing her long calves with his tongue, scraping his teeth across her knee. She was pr
o
pped up on her elbows, watching him at first, but as he moved higher, she collapsed and arched her back, repeating his name in a litany that he never wanted to end. Finally, reduced to moans and whimpers, Harry felt her shivering, and he feared that she w
as cold; but then she tensed up all over her body, and gave a throaty cry which almost undid all of his attempts at self-control. 
\par He moved up toward her face, trailing kisses along her body as he went, until he reached her mouth at last and took possession of that once more--only to find that }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 he}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 was the one being possessed. He whispered his feelings for her in her ear, and she whispered hers back, and they were the same, they could have come from the same mind and same heart. He felt an ache in his chest as he thought of how long they\rquote 
d waited for this, and he kissed her again and again, making up for lost time; he felt like he could never do enough to show how much he loved her. She accepted his kisses and, separating their mouths briefly, whispered in his ear, \'93}{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Now,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 \'94 sending a thrill through him. 
\par And then it was as though they\rquote 
d always been one contiguous body, as though this was the norm and the past separateness had been the aberration, for how could he ever want to be apart from her when being one with her was such bliss? It was as though they breathed with shared lungs, as 
though his heart was pumping blood for her body, as though her larynx was crying out what they both felt, as his mouth was clamped on her neck.... 
\par They moved in concord, in unison, as though following a choreography that had been programmed into their marr
ow from the day they were born. And when they started to tumble from the heights of passion, they were still one, and Harry knew it would be a wrench to be a separate, discrete person again, to use his own lungs instead of hers, to see with his own eyes a
n
d hear with his own ears. They lay together on their sides, dreamily running their fingers along arms and legs, along shoulders and the luscious curve of a breast....a satisfyingly complete feeling filled Harry, and he knew that separating from her was me
r
ely a physical formality that belied the truth of their connectedness. He lay on his back and she stretched out beside him, languid as a cat, ginger hair flowing down her back. She put her head on his chest, sending him flying again briefly when her finge
rs drifted down his body... 
\par He smiled down at her; no, he thought. }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Grinned.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  He felt as though he would never merely }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 smile}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 again. This was Ginny, at last. Ginny in his arms and covering his body with hers, then the two of them combining again with undiluted ardor, with all of the enthusiasm of their first time. Just when he thought she }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 must}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  have sapped every last ounce of strength from }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 him,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 she would kiss him again and he would feel a surge of energy start to well up from some unknown, previously-untapped inner source... 
\par At length they did dress and went to sit together on the window seat. Clothes seemed incidental now. They touched each other freely through the layers of fabric, or simply sat resting their hands places they wouldn\rquote t have dreamed of touching
 before, just }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 being}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  together, and happier than they ever remembered being. 
\par He leaned his cheek on her hair and looked down the High Street. Their oneness would surely show when they went back, he thought. He had no idea how he could bear to be apart from 
her for more than a few minutes ever again. He looked down at her and felt he could never grow tired of looking at her; he imagined her growing older, and greying, and getting smile lines around her mouth and eyes, and he knew that she would be more beaut
iful than ever, and it didn\rquote t matter that they wouldn\rquote t be seventeen forever, because the best was yet to come.... 
\par \'93How long were you planning this?\'94 he asked her, stroking her arm absentmindedly. 
\par She looked thoughtful. \'93For about--two minutes before I left the pub. While you were at the bar, Maggie had asked me what I really wanted for my birthday, and Professor Snape was sitting right there, so I couldn't really say }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 this}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 , you know?\'94 she said, blushing. \'93So Maggie asked me without words instead, and I adm
itted that I had hoped to spend some time alone with you. So she told me that Hog's End was empty and recommended that I just go there. Come here, that is. She said she'd send you on after me.\'94 
\par \'93And the rest is history--\'94 he grinned, hugging her to him tightly. 
\par She hugged him back and kissed his neck, then settled against him, looking out the window with a contented smile; however, a moment later she stiffened and looked as though she'd seen a ghost. 
\par \'93What's wrong?\'94 he whispered. She pointed out the window toward the village, her eyes very wide and her face drained of color. 
\par Draco Malfoy stood in the road, glaring up at the two of them, looking more furious and murderous than anyone Harry had ever seen. Harry\rquote s mind felt like it was waking from hibernation. 
\par \'93Get up, Ginny,\'94
 he said urgently, and she did as he asked without question. Harry stayed where he was while Ginny went to stand near the bed, and Malfoy walked closer and closer to the house. Harry watched him move up the drive toward the door. Harry
 finally stood and turned to Ginny. 
\par \'93I\rquote m going down to talk to him. Wait here.\'94 
\par She seemed to have recovered from her initial shock. \'93No, Harry. I\rquote m coming with you. He needs to face this, to face }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 us}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . It may seem cruel, but--he needs to hear from 
}{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  that this is how things are. He had to know this would happen eventually. And even though he\rquote s got Mariah, well--he\rquote ll be angry. I mean--I never--with him--\'94
 
\par Harry looked down at the pale, pointed face, swallowing, knowing that this was going to be very bad, worse than when they\rquote d been discovered in Hagrid\rquote s hut. \'93No, Ginny. He\rquote s not angry; he\rquote s }{
\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 livid}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . He still thinks he owns you, even after everything he\rquote s done, everything that\rquote s happened. It\rquote s not that he has a right to be, but he\rquote 
s going to feel absolutely }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 violated}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  by our being together, as much as if we\rquote 
d done this when you two were still a couple. Do you get that? Do you remember how you felt about him and Mariah? Or, more to the point, about }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 me}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 
 and Mariah? Are you ready to face a Draco Malfoy who feels that way? You stay up here,\'94 he said with finality, standing and walking toward the door. 
\par She ran to intercept him, her jaw set stubbornly. \'93I am }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 not}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  staying here. He has no right to judge me. We\rquote re not together any more and he knows that even when we were 
I was only doing it to protect you, that I\rquote ve always loved }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 you}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 . I can make my own decisions about this, Harry, and not just because I\rquote m seventeen now,\'94
 she informed him, her fists on her waist. \'93I should think you\rquote d want me with you to confront him. I\rquote ve seen him in some very vulnerable situations, Harry, and I\rquote m not frightened of Draco Malfoy.\'94 
\par He swallowed, seeing in his mind\rquote s eye the look Malfoy had worn on his face as he walked down the drive. 
\par }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 Well,}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286  he thought; }{\i\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286 at least that makes one of us.}{\f54\insrsid7540286\charrsid7540286
