One<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THE
HOLIDAY BEGINS<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Blow!
I’ve got a puncture!’ said Dick. ‘My tyre’s going flat. Worst time it could
possibly happen!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
glanced down at Dick’s back tyre. Then he looked at his watch. ‘You’ve just got
time to pump it up and hope for the best,’ he said. ‘We’ve got seven minutes
before the train goes.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
jumped off and took his pump. The others got off their bicycles, too, and stood
round, watching to see if the tyre blew up well or not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were on their way to Kirrin Station to catch the train, bicycles and all. Their
luggage had gone on in advance, and they thought they had left plenty of time
to ride to the station, get their bicycles labelled and put in the luggage van,
and catch the train comfortably.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
can’t miss the train!’ said George, putting on her best scowl. She always hated
it when things went wrong.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
can. Easiest thing in the world!’ said Julian, grinning at George’s fierce
face. ‘What do you say, Timmy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
barked sharply, as if to say he certainly agreed. He licked George’s hand and
she patted him. The scowl left her face as she saw Dick’s tyre coming up well.
They’d just do it! Dick felt his tyre, gave a sigh of relief, and put his pump
back in its place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Phew!
That was hot work,’ he said, mounting his bicycle. ‘Hope it will last till we
get to the station. I was afraid you’d have to go without me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
no,’ said Anne. ‘We’d have caught the next train. Come on, Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four cousins and Timmy the dog raced on towards the station. They cycled into
the station yard just as the signal went up to show the train was due. The
porter came towards them, his big round face red and smiling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
sent your luggage off for you,’ he said. ‘Not much between you, I must say -
just one small trunk!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we don’t wear much on holidays,’ said Julian. ‘Can you label our bikes quickly
for us? I see the train is due.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
porter began to label the four bicycles. He didn’t hurry. He wouldn’t let the
train go off again till he had done his job, that was certain. There it was
now, coming round the bend.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
going off to Cornwall, I see?’ said the porter. ‘And to Tremannon, too. You
want to be careful of bathing there. That’s a fierce coast and a hungry sea.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
do you know it?’ said Anne, surprised. ‘Is it a nice place?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nice?
Well, I dunno about that,’ said the porter, raising his voice as the train came
rumbling in. ‘I used to go out in my uncle’s fishing-boat all round there, and it’s
wild and lonely. I shouldn’t have thought it was much of a place for a holiday
- no pier, no ice-cream sellers, no concert parties, no cinema, no...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good,’
said Julian. ‘We can do without all those, thank you. We mean to bathe, and
hire a boat, and fish, and bike all round about. That’s our kind of holiday!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof!’
said Timmy, wagging his tail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
and yours too,’ said George, rubbing his big head. ‘Come on, we’d better get
into a carriage.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
see to your bikes,’ said the porter. ‘Have a good holiday, and if you see my
uncle, tell him you know me. His name’s same as mine, John Polpenny.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘
“By Tre, Pol and Pen, you may know the Cornishmen”,’ quoted Julian, getting
into a carriage with the others. ‘Thanks, John. We’ll look up your uncle if we
can!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
each took a corner seat, and Timmy went to the opposite door, put his feet up
on the ledge and his nose out of the window. He meant to stand like that all
the way! He loved the rush of air past his nose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy,
come down,’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
took no notice. He was happy. It was holidays again, and he was with everybody
he loved. They were going away together. There might be rabbits to chase. Timmy
had never yet caught a rabbit, but he went on hoping!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now,
we’re off again!’ said Julian, settling into his corner. ‘Gosh, how I do like
the beginnings of a holiday, getting ready, looking at maps, planning how to
get there, and then at last setting off!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘On
a lovely fine day like this!’ said Anne. ‘George, how did your mother hear of
Tremannon Farm?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
it was Father who heard about it, really,’ said George. ‘You know Father’s got
a lot of scientist friends who like to go off to lonely places and work out all
kinds of ideas in peace and quiet. Well, one of them went to Tremannon Farm because
he heard it was one of the quietest places in the kingdom. Father said his
friend went there all skin and bone and came back as fat as a Christmas goose,
and Mother said that sounded just the place for us to go to these hols!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She’s
right!’ said Dick. ‘I feel a bit skin-and-bonish myself after slaving at school
for three months. I could do with fattening up!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all laughed. ‘You may feel skin-and-bonish, but you don’t look it,’ said
Julian. ‘You want a bit of exercise to take your fat off. We’ll get it, too.
We’ll walk and bike and bathe and climb...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
eat,’ said George. ‘Timmy, you must be polite to the farm dogs, or you’ll have
a bad time.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
you must remember that when you go out to play, you’ll have to ask the other
dogs’ permission before you can chase their rabbits,’ said Dick solemnly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
thumped his tail against Dick’s knees and opened his mouth to let his tongue
hang out. He looked exactly as if he were laughing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
right. Grin at my jokes,’ said Dick. ‘I’m glad you’re coming, Tim, it would be
awful without you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
always has come with us, on every holiday,’ said George. ‘And he’s shared in
every single adventure we’ve ever had.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
old Timmy,’ said Julian. ‘Well, he may share in one this time, too. You never
know.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
not going to have any adventures this time,’ said Anne in a firm voice. ‘I just
want a holiday, nothing more. Let’s have a jolly good time, and not go on
looking for anything strange or mysterious or adventurous.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Julian. ‘Adventures are off this time. Definitely off. And if anything
does turn up, we pooh-pooh it and walk off. Is that agreed?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right,’ said George, doubtfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Fine,’
said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
looked surprised. ‘Gosh, you’re a poor lot, I must say. Well, I’ll fall in with
you, if you’re all agreed. Even if we find ourselves right in the very middle
of Goodness Knows What, we say “No, thank you” and walk away. That’s agreed.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,’
began George, ‘I’m not sure if...’ But what she wasn’t sure about nobody knew
because Timmy chose that moment to fall off the seat. He yelped as he hit the
floor with a bang, and immediately went back to his post at the window, putting
his head right out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
have to get him in and shut the windows,’ said George. ‘He might get something
in his eye.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
I’m not going to cook slowly to a cinder in this hot carriage with all the
windows shut, not even for the sake of Timmy’s eyes,’ said Julian, firmly. ‘If
you can’t make him obey you and come inside, he can jolly well get something in
his eye.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>However,
the problem was solved very quickly because at that moment the train gave a
most unearthly shriek and disappeared headlong into utter blackness. Timmy,
astounded, fell back into the carriage and tried to get on to George’s knee,
terrified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
be a baby, Timmy,’ said George. ‘It’s only a tunnel! Ju, haul him off me. It’s
too hot to try and nurse a heavy dog like Timmy. Stop it, Timmy, I tell you
it’s only a tunnel!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
journey seemed very long. The carriage was so hot, and the train stopped at so
many little out-of-the-way places, sometimes for ten minutes at a time. They
had to change twice, and sit on sun-baked stations waiting for their next train
to come along. Timmy panted loudly and hung his tongue out; George begged the
porters for water at each changing-place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had their lunch with them, but somehow they weren’t hungry. They got dirtier
and dirtier, and thirstier and thirstier, for they very quickly drank the
orangeade they had brought with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Phew!’
said Julian, fanning himself with a magazine. ‘What wouldn’t I give for a
bathe? Timmy, don’t pant all over me. You make me feel hotter still.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
time do we get there?’ asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we have to get out at Polwilly Halt,’ said Julian. ‘That’s the nearest place to
Tremannon Farm. We bike from there. With luck, we should be there by tea-time.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
ought to have brought masses more to drink,’ said Dick. ‘I feel like a man
who’s been lost in a sun-scorched desert for weeks.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were all extremely glad when they at last arrived at Polwilly Halt. At first
they didn’t think it was a halt, but it was. It was nothing but a tiny wooden
stage built beside the railway. The children sat and waited. They hadn’t even
seen the little wooden stage or the small sign that said ‘Polwilly Halt’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sound of impatient feet came along the little platform. The guard’s perspiring
face appeared at the window.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well?
Didn’t you want to get out here? You going to sit there all day?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh!
Is this Polwilly?’ said Julian, leaping up. ‘Sorry. We didn’t know it was a
Halt. We’ll be out in half a tick.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
train started off almost before they had banged the door. They stood there on
the funny little staging, all alone save for their four bicycles at the other
end. The little Halt seemed lonely and lost, set in the midst of rolling fields
and rounded hills. Not a building was in sight!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
not far off to the west George’s sharp eyes saw something lovely. She pulled
Julian’s arm. ‘Look, the sea! Over there, between the hills, in the dip. Can’t
you see it? I’m sure it’s the sea. What a heavenly blue.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
always that gorgeous blue on the Cornish coast,’ said Dick. ‘Ah, I feel better
when I see that. Come on, let’s get our bikes and find our way to Tremannon
Farm. If I don’t get something to drink soon I shall certainly hang my tongue
out, like Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went to get their bikes. Dick felt his back tyre. It was a bit soft, but not
too bad. He could easily pump it up again. ‘How far is it to Tremannon Farm?’
he asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
looked at his notes. ‘ “Get out at Polwilly Halt. Then bike four miles to
Tremannon Farm, along narrow lanes. Tremannon Village is about one mile before
you get to the farm.” Not too bad. We might get some lemonade, or even an
ice-cream, in the village.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,
woof,’ said Timmy, who knew the word ice-cream very well indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Poor
Tim!’ said Anne. ‘He’ll be so hot running beside our bikes. We’d better go
slowly.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
if anyone thinks I’m going to tear along, he can think again,’ said Dick. ‘I’ll
go as slowly as you like, Anne!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
set off with Timmy down a queer little lane, deep-set between high hedges. They
went slowly for Timmy’s sake. He panted along valiantly. Good old Timmy! He
would never give up as long as he was with the four children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was about five o’clock and a very lovely evening. They met nobody at all, not
even a slow old farm cart. It was even too hot for the birds to sing. No wind
blew. There seemed a curious silence and loneliness everywhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
looked back at the other three with a grin. ‘Adventure is in the air! I feel
it. We’re all set for adventure! But no, we’ll turn our backs on it and say:
“Away with you!” That’s agreed!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

FARM<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
certainly was a lovely ride to Tremannon Farm. Poppies blew by the wayside in
hundreds, and honeysuckle threw its scent out from the hedges as they passed.
The corn stood high in the fields, touched with gold already, and splashed with
the scarlet of the poppies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came to Tremannon Village at last. It was really nothing but a winding street,
set with a few shops and houses, and beyond that, straggling out, were other
houses. Farther off, set in the hills, were a few farm-houses, their grey stone
walls gleaming in the sun.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four children found the general store and went in. ‘Any ice-cream?’ said Julian
hopefully. But there was none. What a blow! There was orangeade and lemonade,
however, quite cool through being kept down in the cellar of the store.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
be the folks that old Mrs Penruthlan be having in?’ said the village shopkeeper.
‘She do be expecting of you. Furriners, bain’t you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
not exactly,’ said Julian, remembering that to many Cornish folk anyone was a
foreigner who did not belong to Cornwall. ‘My mother had a great-aunt who lived
in Cornwall all her life. So we’re not exactly “furriners”, are we?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
furriners all right,’ said the bent little shopkeeper, looking at Julian with
bird-like eyes. ‘Your talk is furrin-like, too. Like that man Mrs Penruthlan
had before. We reckoned he was mad, though he was harmless enough.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Really?’
said Julian, pouring himself out a third lemonade. ‘Well, he was a scientist,
and if you’re going to be a really good one you have to be a bit mad, you know.
At least, so I’ve heard. Golly, this lemonade is good. Can I have another bottle,
please?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
old woman suddenly laughed, sounding just like an amused hen. ‘Well, well,
Marty Penruthlan’s got a fine meal ready for you, but seems like you won’t be
able to eat a thing, not with all that lemonade splashing about in your
innards!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
say you can hear the splashing,’ said Julian earnestly. ‘Very bad manners,
that! Furriners’ manners, I’m sure. Well, how much do we owe you? That was
jolly good lemonade.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
paid the bill and they all mounted their bicycles once more, having been given
minute directions as to how to get to the farm. Timmy set off with them,
feeling much refreshed, having drunk steadily for four minutes without
stopping.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
should think you’ve had about as much water as would fill a horse-trough,
Timmy,’ Julian told him. ‘My word, if this weather holds we’re going to look
like Red Indians!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was an uphill ride to Tremannon Farm, but they got there at last. As they
cycled through the open gates, a fusillade of barks greeted them, and four
large dogs came flying to meet them. Timmy put up his hackles at once and
growled warningly. He went completely stiff, and stood there glaring.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
woman came out behind the dogs, her face one large smile. ‘Now, Ben; now,
Bouncer! Here, Nellie, here! Bad dog, Willy! It’s all right, children, that’s
their way of saying “Welcome to Tremannon Farm!” ’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
dogs now stood in a ring round the four children, their tongues out, their
tails wagging vigorously. They were lovely dogs, three collies and one small
black Scottie. Timmy eyed them one by one. George had her hand on his collar,
just in case he should feel foolhardy all of a sudden and imagine he could take
on all four dogs single-handed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
he didn’t. He behaved like a perfect gentleman! His tail wagged politely, and
his hackles went down. The little Scottie ran up to him and sniffed his nose.
Timmy sniffed back, his tail wagging more vigorously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
the three sheepdogs ran up, beautiful collies with plumy tails, and the
children heaved sighs of relief to see that the farm dogs evidently were not
going to regard Timmy as a ‘furriner’!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’re
all right now,’ said Mrs Penruthlan. ‘They’ve introduced themselves to one
another. Now come along with me. You must be tired and dirty - and hungry and
thirsty. I’ve high tea waiting for you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
didn’t talk in the Cornish way. She was pleased to see them and gave them a
grand welcome. She took them upstairs to a bathroom, big but primitive. There
was one tap only and that was for cold water. It ran very slowly indeed!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it was really cold, and was lovely and soft to wash in. The tired children
cleaned themselves and combed their hair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had two bedrooms between them, one for the girls and one for the boys. They
were rather small, with little windows that gave a meagre amount of light, so
that the rooms looked dark even in the bright evening sunshine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were bare little rooms, with two beds in each, one chair, one chest of drawers,
one cupboard and two small rugs. Nothing else! But, oh! the views out of the
windows!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Miles
and miles of countryside, set with cornfields, pasture land, tall hedges and
glimpses of winding lanes; heather was out on some of the hills, blazing purple
in the sun; and, gleaming in the distance was the dark blue brilliance of the
Cornish sea. Lovely!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
bike to the sea as soon as we can,’ said Dick, trying to flatten the few hairs
that would stick up straight on the top of his head. There are caves on this
coast. We’ll explore them. I wonder if Mrs Penruthlan would give us picnic
lunches so that we can go off for the day when we want to.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sure
to,’ said Julian. ‘She’s a pet. I’ve never felt so welcome in my life. Are we
ready? Come on down, then. I’m beginning to feel very empty indeed.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
high tea that awaited them was truly magnificent. A huge ham gleaming as pink
as Timmy’s tongue; a salad fit for a king. In fact, as Dick said, fit for
several kings, it was so enormous. It had in it everything that anyone could
possibly want.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Lettuce,
tomatoes, onions, radishes, mustard and cress, carrot grated up - that is carrot,
isn’t it, Mrs Penruthlan?’ said Dick. ‘And lashings of hard-boiled eggs.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was an enormous tureen of new potatoes, all gleaming with melted butter,
scattered with parsley. There was a big bottle of home-made salad cream.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
at that cream cheese, too,’ marvelled Dick, quite overcome. ‘And that fruit
cake. And are those drop-scones, or what? Are we supposed to have something of
everything, Mrs Penruthlan?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
yes,’ said the plump little woman, smiling at Dick’s pleasure. ‘And there’s a
cherry tart made with our own cherries, and our own cream with it. I know what
hungry children are. I’ve had seven of my own, all married and gone away. So I
have to make do with other people’s when I can get them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
jolly glad you happened to get hold of us,’ said Dick, beginning on ham and
salad. ‘Well, we’ll keep you busy, Mrs Penruthlan. We’ve all got big
appetites!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah,
I’ve not met any children yet that could eat like mine,’ said Mrs Penruthlan,
sounding really sorry. ‘Same as I’ve not met any man that can eat like Mr
Penruthlan. He’s a fine eater, he is. He’ll be in soon.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hope we shall leave enough for him,’ said Anne, looking at the ham and the
half-empty salad dish. ‘No wonder my uncle’s friend, the man who came to stay
here, went away as fat as butter, Mrs Penruthlan.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
the poor man!’ said their hostess, who was now filling up their glasses with
rich, creamy milk. ‘Thin as my husband’s old rake, he was, and all his bones
showing and creaking. He said “No” to this and “No” to that, but I took no notice
of him at all. If he didn’t eat his dinner, I’d take his tray away and tidy it
up, and then in ten minutes I’d take it back again and say: “Dinner-time, sir,
and I hope you’re hungry!” And he’d start all over again, and maybe that time
he’d really tuck in!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
didn’t he know you’d already taken him his dinner-tray once?’ said Julian,
astonished. ‘Goodness, he must have been a dreamer.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
took his tray in three times once,’ said Mrs Penruthlan. ‘So you be careful in
case I do the same kind of thing to you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
should love it!’ grinned Julian. ‘Yes, please, I’d like some more ham. And more
salad.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Footsteps
came outside the room, on the stone floor of the hall. The door opened and the
farmer himself came in. The children stared at him in awe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was a strange and magnificent figure of a man - tall, well over six feet,
broadly built, and as dark as a sunburnt Spaniard. His mane of hair was black
and curly, and his eyes were as black as his hair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
is Mr Penruthlan,’ said his wife, and the children stood up to shake hands,
feeling half afraid of this dark giant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
nodded his head and shook hands. His hand was enormous, and was covered with
hairs so thick and black that it was like fur. Anne felt that it would be quite
nice and soft to stroke, like a cat’s back!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
didn’t say a word, but sat down and let his wife serve him. ‘Well, Mr
Penruthlan,’ she said, ‘and how’s the cow getting along?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah,’
said the farmer, taking a plate of ham. The children gazed at the slices in
awe, seven or eight of them. Goodness!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
I’m glad she’s all right,’ said Mrs Penruthlan, stacking up some dirty plates.
‘And is the calf a dear little thing - and what’s the colour?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah,’
said Mr Penruthlan, nodding his head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Red
and white, like its mother! That’s good, isn’t it?’ said his wife, who seemed
to have a miraculous way of interpreting his ‘Ahs’. ‘What shall we call it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
badly wanted to say ‘Ah’, but nobody dared. However, Mr Penruthlan didn’t say
‘Ah’ that time, but something that sounded like ‘Ock’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
we’ll call it Buttercup, then,’ said his wife, nodding her head. ‘You always
have such good ideas, Mr Penruthlan.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
sounded odd to hear her call her husband by his surname like that, and yet,
somehow, the children couldn’t imagine this giant of a fellow even owning a
name like Jack or Jim. They went on with their own meal, enjoying every minute
of it, watching Mr Penruthlan shovel in great mouthfuls, and working his way
quickly through every dish. Mrs Penruthlan saw them watching him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
a grand eater, isn’t he?’ she said, proudly. ‘So were all my children. When
they were at home, I was kept really busy, but now, with only Mr Penruthlan to
feed, I feel quite lost. That’s why I like people here. You’ll tell me if you
don’t have enough to eat, won’t you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all laughed, and Timmy barked. He had had a wonderful meal, too, it was the
remains of Mrs Penruthlan’s big stock-pot, and was very tasty indeed. He had
also got the largest bone he had ever had in his life. The only thing that
really worried the well-fed Timmy now was, where could he put the bone out of
the way of the farm dogs?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr
Penruthlan suddenly made a peculiar noise and began undoing a trouser pocket at
the back. ‘Oo-ah!’ he said, and brought out a dirty, folded piece of paper. He
handed it to his wife, who unfolded it and read it. She looked up at the
children, smiling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now,
here’s a bit of excitement!’ she said. ‘The Barnies will be along this week!
You’ll love them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
are the Barnies?’ asked George, puzzled at Mrs Penruthlan’s evident pleasure
and excitement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
they’re travelling players that wander round the countryside and play and act
in our big barns,’ said Mrs Penruthlan. ‘We’ve no cinemas for miles, you know,
so the Barnies are always very welcome.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
you call them Barnies because they use your barns for their shows,’ said Anne,
seeing light. ‘Yes, we shall love to see them, Mrs Penruthlan. Will they play
in your barn?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
We’ll have all the village here when the Barnies come,’ said Mrs Penruthlan,
her cheeks going red with delight. ‘And maybe people from Trelin Village, too.
Now, there’s a treat for you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah,’
said Mr Penruthlan, and nodded his great head. Evidently he liked the Barnies,
too. He gave a sudden laugh and said something short and quite
incomprehensible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
says you’ll like Clopper the horse,’ said his wife, laughing. ‘The things he
does! The way he sits down and crosses his legs. Well, you wait and see. That
horse!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
sounded rather astonishing. A horse that sat down and crossed its legs? Julian
winked at Dick. They would most certainly see the Barnies!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
their wonderful high tea the four children didn’t really feel like doing very
much. Dick thought he ought to mend his puncture, but wasn’t sure that he could
bend over properly!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs
Penruthlan began to stack the dishes and clear away. George and Anne offered to
help her. ‘Well, that’s kind of you, Anne and Georgina,’ said the farmer’s
wife. ‘But you’re tired tonight. You can give me a hand some other time. By the
way, which of you is which?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
Anne,’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
I’m George, not Georgina,’ said George. ‘So please don’t call me that. I hate
it. I always wanted to be a boy, so I only like to be called George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
she really means is that she won’t answer unless you do call her George,’ said
Anne. ‘Well, if you really are sure you don’t need our help, we’ll go out with
the boys.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
out they went, George really looking far more like a boy than a girl, with her
grey shorts and shirt and her short, curly hair and freckled face. She put her
hands in her pockets and tried to walk like Dick!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
soon found his puncture and mended it. Mr Penruthlan came by with some straw
for his cow and new calf. The boys watched him in awe, for he was carrying
almost a wagon load of straw tied up in bales! What strength he had! He nodded
to them and passed without a word.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
doesn’t he talk?’ wondered Dick. ‘I suppose all his seven children take after
their talkative mother, and he never had a chance to get a word in. And it’s
too late now, he’s forgotten how to!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
laughed. ‘What a giant of a man,’ said Julian. ‘I hope I grow as big as that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t. I’d hate to have my bare feet poking out of the bottom of the bed every
night,’ said Dick. ‘There. I’ve finished that puncture. See the nail that made
it? I must have run over it on the way to the station this morning.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
look at Timmy,’ said Julian. ‘He’s having the time of his life with those farm
dogs, acting just like a puppy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
he was, bounding here and there, rushing round the dogs and then rushing away,
jumping on first one and then another, till they all went down in an excited,
yapping scrum, the little Scottie doing his best to keep up with everything!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy’s
going to have a good time here,’ said Dick. ‘And he’ll soon lose his beautiful
waist-line if he eats as well as we do!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
take him on long bike rides,’ said Julian. ‘He can’t grow much tummy if he runs
for miles!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls came up just then. A few feet behind trotted a queer little boy,
bare-footed, shock-headed and very dirty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who’s
this?’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know,’ said George. ‘He suddenly appeared behind us and has been
following us ever since. Ht just won’t go away!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy wore a ragged pair of pants and a shirt with no sleeves or buttons. He was
black-eyed and burnt dark-brown by the sun. He stood a few feet away and
stared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who
are you?’ said Dick. The boy went back a few steps in fright. He shook his
head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
said, who are you?’ said Dick again. ‘Or, if you prefer it another way, what’s
your name?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yan,’
said the boy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yan?’
said Dick. ‘That’s a queer name.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
probably means Jan,’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy nodded. ‘Iss. Yan,’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
suppose “Iss” means “Yes”,’ said Anne. ‘All right, Jan. You can go now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
stay,’ said the boy solemnly. ‘Iss.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
stay he did, following them about everywhere, gazing at all they did with the
utmost curiosity, as if he had never in his life seen children before!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
like a mosquito,’ said Dick. ‘Always buzzing around. I’m getting tired of it.
Hey, Yan!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Iss?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Clear
out now! Understand? Get away, go, run off, vamoose, bunk, scoot!’ explained
Dick sternly. Yan stared.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>           </span><span
style='mso-tab-count:2'>                        </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs
Penruthlan came out and heard all this. ‘Jan bothering you?’ she said. ‘He’s as
full of curiosity as a cat. Go home, Jan. Take this to your old Grandad. And
here’s some for you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jan
came up eagerly and took the packet of food Mrs Penruthlan held out to him, and
the slice of cake. He ran off without a word, his bare feet making no sound.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who
is he?’ asked George. ‘What a little scarecrow!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
a poor little thing,’ said the farmer’s wife. ‘He’s got no kith or kin except
for his old great-gran-dad, and there’s more than eighty years between them!
The old man is our shepherd. Do you see that hill over there, well, he’s got a
hut on the other side, and there he lives, winter and summer alike, and that
child with him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Surely
he ought to go to school?’ said Julian. ‘Perhaps he does?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said Mrs Penruthlan. ‘He plays truant nearly all the time. You ought to go and
talk to his old great-grandad. His father was one of the Wreckers on this
coast, and he can tell you some strange stories about those dreadful days.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
certainly go and talk to him,’ said Dick. ‘I’d forgotten that this Cornish
coast was the haunt of Wreckers. They shone false lights to bring ships in
close to shore, so that they would be smashed to pieces on the rocks, didn’t
they?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
and then they robbed the poor, groaning ship when she was helpless,’ said Mrs
Penruthlan. ‘And it’s said they paid no heed to the drowning folk, either.
Those were wicked days.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
far is it to cycle to the sea?’ said George. ‘I can see it from my bedroom
window.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
it won’t take you more than ten minutes,’ said the farmer’s wife. ‘Go tomorrow,
if you like. You all look very tired now. Why don’t you take a short walk and
go to bed? I’ll have a snack ready for you when you come in.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
we couldn’t possibly eat any more tonight, thank you,’ said Dick, hurriedly.
‘But the walk is quite a good idea. We’d like to see round the farm.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs
Penruthlan left them, and Dick looked round at the others. ‘A snack!’ he said.
‘I never thought I’d groan at the thought. But I bet Mr Penruthlan will want a
jolly good snack when he comes in. Come on, let’s go up by those sheds.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went off together, Timmy following behind with his four friends, their tails
wagging amiably. It was still a lovely evening, and a cool breeze came down
from the hills, making it lovelier still. The children wandered round, enjoying
the familiar farm sights, the ducks on the pond, a few hens still clucking
round, the grey sheep dotting the hills. Cows were peacefully grazing and an
old farm horse came to a gate to stare at them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
rubbed his velvety nose, and he bent down to sniff at Timmy, whom he didn’t
know. Timmy sniffed solemnly back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went into the barns and looked around, big, dark, sweet-smelling places, stored
with many things. Dick was sure that the biggest one would be the one used by
the Barnies. What fun!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
bet they’ll be pretty awful, but good fun, all the same,’ he said. ‘It must be
grand to wander round the countryside with all your belongings done up in a
parcel or two, and then amaze the country people with your songs and dances and
acting. I wouldn’t mind trying it myself! I’m pretty good at a spot of
conjuring, for instance!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
you are,’ said Anne. ‘Wouldn’t it be fun if we could give a little show too, if
the Barnies would let us join them just for one evening?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
wouldn’t be allowed to because we’re “furriners”,’ said Dick, grinning. ‘I say,
what’s that, over there, behind that sack?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
at once went to see, and stood there barking. The others went over to look.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
that kid Yan again,’ said Julian, in disgust. He pulled the boy out from his
hiding-place. ‘What are you following us around for, you little idiot?’ he
demanded. ‘We don’t like it. See? Go and find your old Grandad before you eat
all the food Mrs Penruthlan gave you. Go on, now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
pushed the boy out of the barn, and watched him go into the next field. ‘That’s
got rid of him,’ he said. ‘I think he’s a bit simple. We’ll go and see that
Grandad of his one day and see if he really has got anything interesting to say
about the old Wreckers.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
go back now,’ said Dick, yawning. ‘I’ve seen enough of this place to know I’m
going to like it a lot. I’m going to like my bed tonight too. Coming, Ju?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all felt the same as Dick. His yawn had set them yawning, too, and they thought
longingly of bed. They made their way back to the farm, followed closely by
Timmy at their heels, and the other four dogs a respectful distance away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
said good night to the two Penruthlans, who were sitting peacefully listening
to their radio. Mrs Penruthlan wanted to come up with them but they wouldn’t
let her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
said good night to the farmer, who grunted ‘Ah!’ without even looking at them,
and went on listening to the radio programme. Then up the stairs they went, and
into their rooms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
Julian was in bed and almost asleep he heard a scrabbling noise outside his
window. He half-opened his eyes, and listened. He hoped it wasn’t rats! If it
was, Anne would probably hear them too, and be scared, and Timmy would hear
them and bark the place down!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
scrabbling noise came again. Julian spoke softly to Dick. ‘Dick! Are you awake?
Did you hear that noise at the window?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>No
answer. Dick was sound asleep, dreaming that he had a puncture in his foot and
couldn’t walk till it was mended! Julian lay and listened. Yes, there it was
again, and now surely there was someone trying to peep in at the tiny window?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
slid out of bed and went to the side of the window. Thick ivy grew outside.
Somebody was still there for Julian could see the leaves shaking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
put his head suddenly out of the window, and a scared face, quite close to his,
stared in fright.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yan!
What do you think you’re doing?’ said Julian, fiercely. ‘I’ll spank you if you
go on like this, staring and peeping! What’s so queer about us?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yan
was terrified. He suddenly slithered down the ivy like a cat, landed with a
slight thud on the ground and then ran off into the twilight at top speed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hope he’s not going to follow us around all the time,’ thought Julian, getting
into bed again. ‘I’ll teach him a lesson if he does. Blow him! Now he’s made me
wide awake!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Rut
it wasn’t long before Julian was sleeping as soundly as Dick. Neither of them
stirred until a cock outside their window decided that it was time the whole
world woke up, and crowed at the top of his voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Cock-a-doodle-DOO!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys woke with a jump. The early sun streamed into the room, and Julian glanced
at his watch. How early it was! And yet he could hear movements downstairs that
told him Mrs Penruthlan was up and about, and so was her giant of a husband.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
fell asleep again, and was awakened by a loud knock at his door, and Mrs
Penruthlan’s voice. ‘It’s half past seven, and breakfast will be on the table
for you at eight. Wake up!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>How
lovely to wake in a strange place at the beginning of a holiday, to think of
bathing and biking and picnicking and eating and drinking, forgetting all about
exams and rules and punishments! The four children and Timmy stretched
themselves and stared at the sunshine outside. What a day!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Downstairs
breakfast awaited them. ‘Super!’ said Dick, eyeing the bacon and fried eggs,
the cold ham, and the home-made jam and marmalade. ‘Mrs Penruthlan, your seven
children must have been very sorry to marry and leave home. I feel, if I’d been
one of them, I’d have stayed with you for the rest of my life!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
first three days at Tremannon Farm were lazy, uneventful days, full of
sunshine, good food, dogs - and of little Yan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
really was a perfect nuisance. The four children seemed to have a real
fascination for him, and he trailed them everywhere, following them
bare-footed. He turned up behind hedges, along lanes, at their picnicking
places, his dark eyes watching them intently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
the good of telling him to go?’ groaned Julian. ‘He disappears behind one hedge
and appears out of another. You’d think he’d get bored, doing this shadowing
business all the time. What’s the point of it, anyway?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
point,’ said George. ‘Just curiosity. What I can’t understand is why Timmy puts
up with him. You’d think he’d bark or growl or something, but he’s quite silly
with Yan, lets him play with him, and roll him over as if he was a mad puppy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I’m going to find this Great-Grandad of his tomorrow, and tell him to keep Yan
with him,’ said Julian. ‘He’s maddening. I feel I want to swot him like a gnat,
always buzzing round us. Gosh, there he is again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
he was. A pair of dark eyes were gazing round a tree-trunk, half hidden by a
sheaf of leaves. Timmy bounded up to him in glee, and made such a fuss of Yan
that George was quite disgusted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy!
Come here!’ she called, imperiously. ‘Don’t you understand that you ought to
chase Yan away when he comes and not encourage him? I’m ashamed of you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
put his tail down and went to her. He sat down beside her with a bump. Dick
laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
sulking! He won’t look at you, George! He’s turning his head away on purpose!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
chased Yan away, threatening him with all sorts of things if he caught him, but
the boy was as fast as a hare, and seemed suddenly to disappear into thin air.
He had a wonderful way of vanishing, and an equally remarkable way of appearing
again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t like that kid,’ said Julian. ‘He makes me shiver down my back whenever I
see him suddenly peeping somewhere.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
can’t be a bad kid, though, because Timmy likes him so much,’ said Anne, who
had great faith in Timmy’s judgment. ‘Timmy never likes anyone horrid.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
he’s made a mistake this time, then,’ said George, who was cross with Timmy.
‘He’s being very stupid. I’m not pleased with you, Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
go down to the sea and bathe,’ said Dick. ‘We’ll go on our bikes and Yan won’t
be able to pop up and watch us there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
took their bicycles and rode off to the coast. Mrs Penruthlan made them
sandwiches and gave them fruit cake and drinks to take with them. They saw Yan
watching them from behind a hedge as they went.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
took the road to the sea. It was no more than a narrow lane, and wound about
like a stream, twisting and turning so that they couldn’t get up any speed at
all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
- the sea!’ cried Dick, as they rounded one last bend. The lane had run down
between two high, rocky cliffs, and in front of them was a cove into which
raced enormous breakers, throwing spray high into the air.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
left their bicycles at the top of the cove, and went behind some big rocks to
change into bathing things. When they came out, Julian looked at the sea. It
was calm beyond the rocks, but over these the waters raged fiercely and it was
impossible to venture in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
walked a little way round the cliffs, and came to a great pool lying in a rocky
hollow. ‘Just the thing!’ cried George and plunged in. ‘Gosh, it’s cold!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
should have been hot from the sun, but every now and again an extra large wave
broke right into the pool itself, bringing in cooler water. It was fun when
that happened. The four of them swam to their hearts’ content, and Timmy had a
fine time too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
picnicked on the rocks, with spray flying round them, and then went to explore
round the foot of the cliffs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
is exciting,’ said George. ‘Caves, and more caves, and yet more caves! And cove
after cove, all as lovely as the one before. I suppose when the tide’s in, all
these coves are shoulder-high in water.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘My
word, yes,’ said Julian, who was keeping a very sharp eye indeed on the tide.
‘And a good many of these caves would be flooded too. No wonder Mrs Penruthlan
warned us so solemnly about the tides here! I wouldn’t want to try and climb up
these cliffs if we were caught!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
looked up and shivered. They were so very steep and high. They frowned down at
her as if to say ‘We stand no nonsense from anyone! So look after yourself!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I’m blessed! Look there, isn’t that that tiresome little wretch of a Yan?’ said
Dick, suddenly. He pointed to a rock covered with seaweed. Peeping from behind
it was Yan!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
must have run all the way here, and found us,’ said Julian, in disgust. ‘Well,
we’ll leave him here. It’s time we went. The tide’s coming in. It’ll serve him
right to find us gone as soon as he arrives. He must be mad!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
you think he knows about the tide?’ said Anne, looking worried. ‘I mean, knows
that it’s coming in and might catch him?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course he knows!’ said Julian. ‘Don’t be silly. But we’ll wait and have our tea
at the top part of the cove, if you like. That’s the only way back, if he wants
to escape the tide, short of climbing the cliff, which no one would be mad
enough to try!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had put aside some cake and biscuits for their tea, and they found a good
picnicking place at the top of the cove where they had left their bicycles.
They settled down to munch the solid fruit cake that Mrs Penruthlan had given
them. There was no doubt about it, she was a wonderful cook!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
tide swept in at a great rate, and soon the noise of enormous waves pounding on
the rocks grew louder. ‘Yan hasn’t appeared yet,’ said Anne. ‘Do you think he’s
all right?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
must be having a good old wetting if he’s still there,’ said Dick. ‘I think
we’d better go and see. Much as I dislike him I don’t want him to be drowned.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two boys went down the cove as far as they could, peering round the cliff to
where they had seen Yan hiding. But how different it all looked now!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh,
the beach is gone already!’ said Julian, startled. ‘I can see how easily anyone
could get caught by the tide now, see that last wave, it swept right into that
cave we explored!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
happened to Yan?’ said Dick. ‘He’s nowhere to be seen. He didn’t come out of
the cove; we’ve been sitting there all the time. Where is he?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
spoke urgently, and Julian began to feel scared too. He hesitated. Should they
wade over the rocks a little way? The next wave decided him. It would be folly
to do any such thing! Another wave like that and both he and Dick would be
flung off the rock they were standing on!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
out, here comes an even bigger one!’ yelled Julian, and the two boys leapt off
their rock and raced back up the cove. Even so, the wave lapped right up to
their feet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went back to the girls. ‘Can’t see him anywhere,’ said Julian, speaking more
cheerfully than he felt. ‘The whole beach is covered with the tide now, more
than covered. The lower caves are full too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
- he won’t be drowned, will he?’ said Anne, fearfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
I expect he can look after himself,’ said Julian. ‘He’s used to this coast.
Come on, it’s time we went.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all rode off, Timmy running beside their bicycles. Nobody said anything. They
couldn’t help feeling worried about Yan. Whatever could have happened to him?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
arrived at the farm and put their bicycles away. They went in to find Mrs
Penruthlan. They told her about Yan, and how he had disappeared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
don’t think he might have been swept off his feet and drowned, do you?’ asked
Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs
Penruthlan laughed. ‘Good gracious, no! That boy knows his way about the
countryside and the seashore blindfold. He’s cleverer than you think. He never
misses anything! He’s a poor little thing, but he looks after himself all
right!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
was rather comforting. Perhaps Yan would turn up again, with his dark eyes
fixed unblinkingly on them!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
a high-tea as good as any they had had, they went for a walk down the
honeysuckle-scented lanes, accompanied as usual by the five dogs. They sat on a
stile, and Dick handed round some barley-sugar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look!’
said George suddenly. ‘Do you see what I see? Look!’ She nodded her head
towards an oak tree in the hedge, not far off. The others stared up into it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Two
dark eyes stared back. Yan! He had followed them as usual, and had hidden
himself to watch them. Anne was so tremendously relieved to see him that she
called to him in delight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
Yan! Have a barley-sugar?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yan
slithered down the tree at top speed and came up. He held out his hand for the
barley-sugar. For the first time he smiled, and his dirty, sullen face lighted
up enchantingly. Anne stared at him. Why, he was a dear little fellow! His eyes
shone and twinkled, and a dimple came in each cheek.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here
you are, here’s a couple more sweets for you,’ Dick said, very glad to see that
the small boy hadn’t been drowned. Yan almost snatched them from him! lt was
plain that he very, very seldom had any sweets! Timmy was making a fuss of him
as usual. He lay down on his back and rolled over Yan’s feet. He licked his
bare knees and arms, and jumped up at him, almost knocking the boy down. Yan
laughed, and fell on Timmy, rolling over and over with him. Julian, Dick and
Anne watched and laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
George was not pleased. Timmy was her dog, and she didn’t like him to make a
fuss of anyone she disapproved of. She was glad that Yan was safe but she still
didn’t like him! So she scowled, and Julian nudged Dick to make him see the
scowl, George saw him and scowled worse than ever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’ll
be sorry you gave him sweets,’ she said. ‘He’ll be round us worse than ever
now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yan
came up after a minute or two, sucking all three sweets at once, so that his
right cheek was very swollen indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come,
see my Granddad,’ he said, earnestly, talking even worse than usual because of
the sweets. ‘I tell him ’bout you all. He tell you many things.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
stared at them all seriously. ‘Grandad likes sweets too,’ he added, solemnly.
‘Iss. Iss, he do.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
laughed. ‘All right. We’ll come and see him tomorrow afternoon. Now you clear
off or you won’t get any more sweets. Understand?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Iss,’
said Yan, nodding his head. He took the three sweets out of his mouth, looked
at them to see how much he had sucked them, and then put them back again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Clear
off now,’ said Julian again. ‘But wait a bit, I’ve just thought; how did you
get away from that beach this afternoon? Did you climb that cliff?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said Yan, shifting his sweets to the other cheek. ‘I came the Wreckers’ Way. My
Grandad learnt it me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was off and away before anyone could ask him another question. The four looked
at one another. ‘Did you hear that?’ said Julian. ‘He went the Wreckers’ Way.
What’s that, do you suppose? We must have been on one of the beaches the
wreckers used long, long ago.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
But how did he get off that beach, and away into safety?’ said Dick. ‘I’d like
to know more about the Wreckers’ Way! I certainly think we’d better pay a visit
to old Great-Grandad tomorrow. He might have some very interesting things to
tell us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we’ll go and see him,’ said George, getting up. ‘But just you remember what I
said. Yan will pester us more than ever now we’ve encouraged him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
well, he doesn’t seem such a bad kid after all,’ said Dick, remembering that
sudden smile and the eager acceptance of a few sweets. ‘And if he persuades
Grandad to let us into the secret of Wreckers’ Way, we might have some fun
doing a bit of exploring. Don’t you think so, Ju?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
might even lead to an adventure,’ said Julian, laughing at Anne’s serious face.
‘Cheer up, Anne. I can’t even smell an adventure in Tremannon. I’m just pulling
your leg!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think you’re wrong,’ said Anne. ‘If you can’t smell one somewhere, I can. I
don’t want to, but I can!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
next day was Sunday. It made no difference to the time that the two Penruthlans
got up, however. As Mrs Penruthlan said, the cows and horses, hens and ducks
didn’t approve of late Sunday breakfasts! They wanted attending to at exactly
the same time each day!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Will
you be going to church?’ asked Mrs Penruthlan. ‘It’s a beautiful walk across
the fields to Tremannon Church, and you’d like Parson. He’s a good man, he is.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
we’re all going,’ said Julian. ‘We can tie Timmy up outside. He’s used to that.
And we thought we’d go up and see your old shepherd this afternoon, Mrs
Penruthlan, and see what tales he has to tell.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yan
will show you the way,’ said the farmer’s wife, bustling off to her cooking.
‘I’ll get you a fine Sunday dinner. Do you like fresh fruit salad with cream?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Rather!’
said everyone at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Can’t
we help you to do something?’ said Anne. ‘I’ve just seen all the peas you’re
going to shell. Piles of them! And don’t you want help with those red currant?
I love getting the currants off their stalks with a fork!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you’ll have a few odd minutes before you go to church, I expect,’ said Mrs
Penruthlan, looking pleased. ‘It would be a bit of help today. But the boys
needn’t help.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
like that!’ said George, indignantly. ‘How unfair! Why shouldn’t they, just
because they’re boys?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
fly off the handle, George,’ grinned Dick. ‘We’re going to help, don’t worry.
We like podding peas too! You’re not going to have all the treats!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
had a very neat way of turning the tables on George when he saw her flying into
a tantrum. She smiled unwillingly. She was always jealous of the boys because
she so badly wanted to be one herself, and wasn’t! She hitched up her shorts,
and went to get a pan of peas to shell.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
the noise of the popping of pads was to be heard, a very pleasant noise, Anne
thought. The four of them sat on the big kitchen step, out in the sun, with
Timmy sitting beside them, watching with interest. He didn’t stay with them
long though.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Up
came his four friends, the little Scottie trotting valiantly behind, trying to
keep up with the longer legs of the others. ‘Woof!’ said the biggest collie.
Timmy wagged his tail politely, but didn’t stir.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof!’
said the collie again, and pranced around invitingly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy!
He says “Will you come and play?” ’ said George. ‘Aren’t you going? You aren’t
the least help with shelling peas, and you keep breathing down my neck.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
gave George a flying lick and leapt off the step joyfully. He pounced on the
Scottie, rolled him over, and then took on all three collies at once. They were
big, strong dogs, but no match for Timmy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
at him,’ said George, proudly. ‘He can manage the whole lot single-handed.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Single-footed!’
said Dick. ‘He’s faster than even that biggest collie and stronger than the whole
lot. Good old Tim. He’s come in jolly useful in some of our adventures!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
no doubt he will again,’ said Julian. ‘I’d rather have one Timmy than two
police-dogs.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
should think his ears are burning, the way we’re talking about him!’ said Anne.
‘Oh, sorry, Dick, that pod popped unexpectedly!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
the second lot of peas you’ve shot all over me,’ said Dick, scrabbling inside
his shirt. ‘I must just find one that went down my neck, or I shall be
fidgeting all through church.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
always do,’ said Anne. ‘Look - isn’t that Yan?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was! He came sidling up, looking as dirty as ever, and gave them a quick smile
that once more entirely changed his sullen little face. He held out his hand,
palm upwards, and said something.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
he saying?’ said Dick. ‘Oh, he’s asking for a sweet.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
give him one,’ said Julian, quickly. ‘Don’t turn him into a little beggar. Make
him work for a sweet this time. Yan, if you want a sweet, you can help pod
these peas.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs
Penruthlan appeared at once. ‘But see he washes those filthy hands first,’ she
commanded, and disappeared again. Yan looked at his hands, then put them under
his arm-pits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Go
and wash them,’ said Julian. But Yan shook his head, and sat down a little way
away from them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right. Don’t wash your hands. Don’t shell the peas. Don’t have a sweet,’ said
George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yan
scowled at George. He didn’t seem to like her any more than she liked him. He
waited till someone split a pod, and a few peas shot out on to the ground
instead of into the dish. Then he darted at them, picked them up and ate them.
He was as quick as a cat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘My
Grandad says come see him,’ announced Yan. ‘I take you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Julian. ‘We’ll come this afternoon. We’ll get Mrs Penruthlan to pack us up
a basket, and we’ll have tea in the hills. You can share it if you wash your
hands and face.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
shouldn’t think he’s ever washed himself in his life,’ said George. ‘Oh, here’s
Timmy come back. I will not have him fawn round that dirty little boy. Here,
Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timmy darted to Yan with the greatest delight and pawed at him to come and have
a game. They began to roll over and over like two puppies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
you’re going to church, you’d better get ready,’ said Mrs Penruthlan, appearing
again, this time with arms floured up to the elbow. ‘My, what a lot of peas
you’ve done for me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wish I had time to do the red currants,’ said Anne. ‘We’ve practically finished
the peas, anyway, Mrs Penruthlan. We’ve done thousands, I should think!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah,
Mr Penruthlan is real fond of peas,’ said the farmer’s wife. ‘He can eat a
whole tureen at one sitting.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
disappeared again. The children went to get ready for church, and then off they
went. It certainly was a lovely walk over the fields, with honeysuckle trailing
everywhere!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
church was small and old and lovely. Yan went with them, trailing behind, right
to the church door. When he saw George tying Timmy up to a railing, he sat down
beside him and looked pleased. George didn’t look pleased, however. Now Timmy
and Yan would play about together all the time she was in church! How annoying!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
church was cool and dark, except for three lovely stained-glass windows through
which the sun poured, its brilliance dimmed by the colours of the glass.
‘Parson’ was as nice as Mrs Penruthlan had said, a simple, friendly person
whose words were listened to by everyone, from an old, old woman bent almost
double in a corner to a solemn-eyed five year old clutching her mother’s hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was dazzling to come out into the sun again from the cool dimness of the church.
Timmy barked a welcome. Yan was still there, sitting with his arm round Timmy’s
neck. He gave them his sudden smile, and untied Timmy, who promptly went mad
and tore out of the churchyard at sixty miles an hour. He always did that when
he had been tied up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
come see Grandad,’ said Yan to Dick, and pulled at his arm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
afternoon,’ said Dick. ‘You can show us the way. Come after dinner.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So,
after the children had had a dinner of cold boiled beef and carrots, with a
dumpling each, and ‘lashings’ of peas and new potatoes, followed by a truly
magnificent fruit salad and cream, Yan appeared at the door to take them to his
Grandad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Did
you see the amount of peas that Mr Penruthlan got through?’ said Anne, in awe.
‘I should think he really did manage a tureen all to himself. I wish he’d say
something beside “Ah” and “Ock” and the other peculiar sounds he makes.
Conversation is awfully difficult with him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
Yan taking you up to Grandad?’ called Mrs Penruthlan. ‘I’ll put a few cakes in
the basket for him, too, then, and for Grandad.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
put us up a big tea,’ begged Dick. ‘We only want a snack, just to keep us going
till high-tea.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
all the same the basket was quite heavy when Mrs Penruthlan had finished
packing it!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was a long walk over the fields to the shepherd’s hut. Yan led the way proudly.
They crossed the fields, and climbed stiles, walked up narrow cart-paths, and
at last came to a cone-shaped hill on which sheep grazed peacefully. Half-grown
lambs, wearing their woolly coats, unlike the shorn sheep, gambolled here and
there - then remembered that they were nearly grown up, and walked sedately.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
old shepherd was sitting outside his hut, smoking a clay pipe. He wasn’t very
big, and he seemed shrivelled up, like an apple stored too long. But there was
still sweetness in him, and the children liked him at once. He had Yan’s sudden
smile, that lighted up eyes that were still as blue as the summer sky above
them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
face had a thousand wrinkles that creased and ran into one another when he smiled.
His shaggy eye-brows, curly beard and hair were all grey, as grey as the woolly
coats of the sheep he had lived with all his life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
be welcome,’ he said, in his slow Cornish voice. ‘Yan here have told me about
you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ve
brought our tea to share with you,’ said Dick. ‘We’ll have it later on. Is it
true that your father was one of the Wreckers in the old days?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
old fellow nodded his head. Julian got out a bag of boiled sweets, and offered
them to the old man. He took one eagerly. Yan edged up at once and was given
one too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Judging
by the crunching that went on old Gran-dad still had plenty of teeth! When the
sweet had gone, he began to talk. He talked slowly and simply, almost as Yan
might have done, and sometimes paused to find a word he wanted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Living
with sheep all his life doesn’t make for easy talking, thought Julian,
interested in this old man with the wise, keen eyes. He must be much more at
home with sheep than with human beings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Grandad
certainly had some interesting things to tell them, dreadful things, Anne
thought.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’ve
seen them rocks down on Tremannon coast,’ began Grandad. ‘Wicked rocks they be,
hungry for ships and men. There’s many a ship been wrecked on purpose! Ay, you
can look disbelieving-like, but it’s true.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
did they get wrecked on purpose?’ asked Dick. ‘Were they lured here by a false
light, or something?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
old man lowered his voice as if he was afraid of being overheard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Way
back up the coast, more than a hundred years ago, there was a light set to guide
the ships that sail round here,’ said Grandad. ‘They were to sail towards that
light, and then hug the coast and avoid the rocks that stood out to sea. They
were safe then. But, on wild nights, a light was set two miles farther down the
coast, to bemuse lost ships, and drag them to the rocks round Tremannon coves.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
wicked!’ said Anne and George together. ‘How could men do that?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
fair amazing what men will do,’ said Grandad, nodding his head. ‘Take my old
Dad now - a kind man he was and went to church, so he did, and took me with
him. But he was the one that set the false light burning every time, and sent
men to watch the ship coming in on the rocks - crashing over them to break into
pieces.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Did
you - did you ever see a ship crashing to its death?’ asked Dick, imagining the
groaning of the sailing ships, and the groaning of the men flung into the
raging sea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ay.
I did so,’ said Grandad, his eyes taking on a very far-away look. ‘I were sent
to the cove with the men, and had to hold a lantern to bemuse the ship again
when she came to the rocks. Poor thing, she groaned like a live thing, she did,
when she ran into them wicked rocks, and split into pieces. And next day I went
to the cove to help get the goods that were scattered all around the cove.
There were lots drownded that night, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
tell us about that,’ said Dick, feeling sick. ‘Where did they flash the false
light from? From these hills, or from the cliff somewhere?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
show you where my Dad flashed it from,’ said Grandad, and he got up slowly.
‘There’s only one place on these hills where you could see the light
a-flashing. The wreckers had to find somewhere well hidden, so that their
wicked light couldn’t be seen from inland, or the police would stop it, but it
could be seen plainly by any ship on the sea near this coast!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
took them round his hill, and then pointed towards the coast. Set between two
hills there the roof of a house could just be seen, and from it rose a tower.
It could only be seen from that one spot! Dick took a few steps to each side of
it, and at once the house disappeared behind one or other of the hills on each
side of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
were the only one that ever knew the false light could be seen from inland,’
said Grandad, pointing with his pipe-stem towards the far-off square tower. ‘I
were watching lambs one night up here, and I saw the light a-flashing. And I
heard there was a ship wrecked down in Tremannon cove that night so I reckoned
it were the wreckers at work.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Did
you often see the light flashing over there, when you watched the sheep ?’
asked George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
ay, many a time,’ said the shepherd. ‘And always on wild, stormy nights, when
ships were labouring along, and in trouble, looking for some light to guide
them into shore. Then a light would flare out over there, and I’d say to meself
“Now may the Good God help those sailors tonight, for it’s sure that nobody
else will!” ’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
horrible!’ said George, quite appalled at such wickedness. ‘You must be glad
that you never see that false light shining there on stormy nights now!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Grandad
looked at George, and his eyes were scared and strange. He lowered his voice
and spoke to George as if she were a boy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Little
master,’ he said, ‘that light still flares on dark and stormy nights. The place
is a ruin, and jackdaws build in the tower. But three times this year I’ve seen
that light again! Come a stormy night it’ll flare again! I know it in my bones,
little master, I know it in my bones!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four children shivered suddenly in the hot sun, as they listened to the
shepherd’s strange words. Were they true? Did the wreckers’ light still flash
in the old tower on wild and stormy nights? But why should it? Surely no
wreckers any longer did their dreadful work on this lonely rocky coast?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
voiced the thoughts of the others. ‘But surely there are no wrecks on this
coast now? Isn’t there a good lighthouse farther up, to warn ships to keep
right out to sea?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Grandad
nodded his grey head. ‘Yes. There’s a lighthouse, and there’s not been a wreck
along this coast for more years than I can remember. But I tell you that light
flares up just as it used to do. I seen it with my own eyes, and there’s nought
wrong with them yet!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
seen it too,’ put in Yan, suddenly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Grandad
looked at Yan, annoyed. ‘You hold your noise, you,’ he commanded. ‘You’ve never
seen no light. You sleeps like a babe at nights.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
seen it,’ said Yan, obstinately, and moved out of Grandad’s way quickly as the
old man raised his hand to cuff the small boy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
changed the subject. ‘Grandad, do you know anything about the Wreckers’ Way?’
he asked. ‘Is it a secret way to get down to the coves from inland? Was it used
by the wreckers?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Grandad
frowned. ‘That be a secret,’ he said, shortly. ‘My Dad, he showed it to me, and
I swore as I never would tell. Us all had to swear and promise that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
Yan here said that you taught the way to him,’ said Dick, puzzled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yan
promptly removed himself from the company and disappeared round a clump of
bushes. His old Great-Grandad glared round at the disappearing boy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yan!
That boy! He doesn’t know anything about the Wreckers’ Way. It’s lost and
forgotten by every man living. I’m the last one left as knows of it. Yan! He’s
dreaming! Maybe he’s heard tell of an old Wreckers’ Way, but that’s all.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh!’
said Dick, disappointed. He had hoped that Grandad would tell them the old way,
and then they could go and explore it. Perhaps they could go and search for it,
anyhow! It would be fun to do that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
came back to the question of the light flashing from the old tower by the
coast. He was puzzled. ‘Who could possibly flash that light?’ he said to
Gran-dad. ‘You say the place is a ruin. Are you sure it wasn’t lightning you
saw? You said it came on a wild and stormy night.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
weren’t lightning,’ said the old man shortly. ‘I first saw that light near
ninety years ago, and I tell you I saw it again three times this year, same
place, same light, same weather! And if you telled me it weren’t flashed by
mortal hands, I’d believe you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a silence after this extraordinary statement. Anne looked over towards the
far-off tower that showed just between the two distant hills. How queer that
this spot where they were standing was the only place from which the tower
could be seen from inland. The wreckers had been clever to choose a spot like
that to flash a light from. No one but old Grandad up on the hills could
possibly have seen the light and guessed what was going on, no one but the
callous wreckers themselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Grandad
delved deep into more memories stored in his mind. He poured them out, tales of
the old days, queer, unbelievable stories. One was about an old woman who was
said to be a witch. The things she did!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four stared at the old shepherd, marvelling to think they were, in a way,
linked with the witches and brownies, the wreckers and the killers of long-ago
days, through this old, old man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yan
appeared again as soon as Julian opened the tea-basket. They had now gone back
to the hut, and sat outside in the sunshine, surrounded by nibbling sheep. One
or two of the half-grown lambs came up, looking hot in their unshorn woolly
coats. They nosed round the old shepherd, and he rubbed their woolly noses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘These
be lambs I fed from a bottle,’ he explained. ‘They always remember. Go away
now, Woolly. Cake’s wasted on you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yan
wolfed quite half the tea. He gave Anne a quick grin of pure pleasure, showing
both his dimples at once. She smiled back. She liked this funny little boy now,
and felt sorry for him. She was sure that his old Grandad didn’t give him
enough to eat!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
church bells began to ring, and the sun was now sliding down the sky. ‘We must
go,’ said Julian, reluctantly. ‘It’s quite a long walk back. Thanks for a most
interesting afternoon, Grandad. I expect you’ll be glad to be rid of us now,
and smoke your pipe in peace with your sheep around you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ay,
I will,’ said Grandad, truthfully. ‘I do be one for my own company, and I likes
to think my own thoughts. Long thoughts they be, too, going back nigh on a
hundred years. If I wants to talk, I talks to my sheep. It’s rare and wunnerful
how they listen.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children laughed, but Grandad was quite solemn, and meant every word he said.
They packed up the basket, and said good-bye to the old man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
what do you think he meant when he talked about the light still flashing in the
old tower?’ said Dick, as they went over the hills back to the farm. ‘What an
extraordinary thing to say. Was it true, do you suppose?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
only one way to find out!’ said George, her eyes dancing. ‘Wait for a wild and
stormy night and go and see!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
what about our agreement?’ said Julian, solemnly. ‘If anything exciting seems
about to happen we turn our backs on it. That’s what we decided. Don’t you
remember?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Pooh!’
said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
ought to keep the agreement,’ said Anne, doubtfully. She knew quite well that
the others didn’t think so!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look!
Who are all these people?’ said Dick, suddenly. They were just climbing over a
stile to cross a lane to another field.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
sat on the stile and stared. Some carts were going by, open wagons, their
canvas tops folded down. They were the most old-fashioned carts the children
had ever seen, not in the least like gipsy caravans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ten
or eleven people were with the wagons, dressed in the clothes of other days!
Some rode in the wagons and some walked. Some were middle-aged, some were
young, but they all looked cheerful and gay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children stared. After Grandad’s tales of long ago these old-time folk seemed
just right! For a few moments Anne felt herself back in Grandad’s time, when he
was a boy. He must have seen people dressed like these!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who
are they?’ she said, wonderingly. And then the children saw red lettering
painted on the biggest cart:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This’ll
be fun!’ said George, pleased. She called out to the passing wagons: ‘Will you
be playing at Tremannon Farm?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
yes!’ called a man with bright, merry eyes. ‘We always play there. You staying
there?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said George. ‘We’ll look out for you all. Where are you going now?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘To
Poltelly Farm for the night,’ called the man. ‘We’ll be at Tremannon soon.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
wagons passed, and the gay, queerly-dressed players went out of sight. ‘Good,’
said Dick. ‘Their show may not be first-rate, but it’s sure to be funny. They
looked a merry lot.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
but the man driving the front cart. Did you see him?’ said Anne. ‘He looked
pretty grim, I thought.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
else had noticed him. ‘He was probably the owner of the Barnies,’ said Dick.
‘And has got all the organization on his shoulders. Well, come on. Where’s
Timmy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
looked round for him, and George frowned. Yan had followed them as usual, and
Timmy was playing with him. Bother Yan! Was he going to trail them all day and
every day?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went back to the peaceful farm-house. Hens were still clucking around and ducks
were quacking. A horse stamped somewhere near by, and the grunting of pigs came
on the air. It all looked quite perfect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Footsteps
came through the farm-yard, and Mr Penruthlan came by. He grunted at them and
went into a barn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
spoke in almost a whisper. ‘I can imagine him living in the older days and
being a wrecker. I can really!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes!
I know what you mean,’ said Dick. ‘He’s so fierce-looking and determined.
What’s the word I want? Ruthless! I’m sure he would have made a good wrecker!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
you suppose there are any wreckers now, and that light really is flashed to
make ships go on the rocks?’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I shouldn’t have thought there were any wreckers in this country, anyway,’ said
Dick. ‘I can’t imagine that such a thing would be tolerated for an instant. But
if that light is flashed, what is it flashed for?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Old
Grandad said there hadn’t been any wrecks on this coast for ages,’ said Julian.
‘I think really that the old man is wandering a bit in his mind about that
light!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
Yan said he had seen it, too,’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
not sure that Yan’s as truthful as he might be!’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
did Grandad say that the light isn’t fiashed by mortal hands now?’ asked
George. ‘It must be! I can’t imagine any other hands working it! He surely
doesn’t think that his father is still doing it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a pause. ‘We could easily find out if we popped over to that tower and had
a look at it,’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was another pause. ‘I thought we said we wouldn’t go poking about in anything
mysterious,’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
isn’t really mysterious,’ argued Dick. ‘It’s just a story an old man remembers,
and I really can’t believe that that light still flashes on a wild stormy
night. Grandad must have seen lightning or something. Why don’t we settle the
matter for good and all and go and explore the old house with the tower?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
should like to,’ said George firmly. ‘I never was keen on this “Keep away from
anything unusual” idea we suddenly had. We’ve got Timmy with us - we can’t
possibly come to any harm!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right,’ said Anne, with a sigh. ‘I give up. We’ll go if you want to.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
old Anne,’ said Dick, giving her a friendly slap on the back. ‘But you needn’t
come, you know. Why don’t you stay behind and hear our story when we come
back?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Certainly
not,’ said Anne, quite cross. ‘I may not want to go as much as you do, but I’m
not going to be left out of anything, so don’t think it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right. It’s settled then,’ said Julian. ‘We take our opportunity and go as soon
as we can, Tomorrow, perhaps.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs
Penruthlan came to the door and called them. ‘Your high tea is ready. You must
be hungry. Come along indoors.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sun suddenly went in. Julian looked up at the sky in surprise. ‘My word, look
at those black clouds!’ he said. ‘There’s a storm coming! Well, I thought there
might be, it’s been so terribly hot all day!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
storm!’ said George. ‘That light flashes on wild and stormy nights! Oh, Julian,
do you think it will flash tonight? Can’t we - can’t we go and see?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before
the children had finished their high tea, the big kitchen-sitting-room was
quite dark. Thunder clouds had moved up from the west, gathering together
silently, frowning and sinister. Then, from far off, came the first rumble of
thunder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
little Scottie came and cowered against Mrs Penruthlan’s skirts. He hated
storms. The farmer’s wife comforted him, and her big husband gave a little
unexpected snort of laughter. He said something that sounded like ‘oose’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
not as timid as a mouse,’ said his wife, who was really marvellous at
interpreting her husband’s peculiar noises. ‘He just doesn’t like the thunder.
He never did. He can sleep with us in our room tonight.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
were a few more sounds from Mr Penruthlan to which his wife listened anxiously.
‘Very well, if you have to get up and see to Jenny the horse in the night, I’ll
see Benny doesn’t bark the house down,’ she said. She turned to the children.
‘Don’t worry if you hear him barking,’ she said. ‘It will only be Mr Penruthlan
stirring.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
thunder crashed and rumbled again, this time a little nearer, and then
lightning flashed. Then down came the rain. How it poured! It rattled and
clattered on the roof in enormous drops, and then settled down into a steady
downpour.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four children got out their cards and played games by the light of the oil
lamp. There was no electricity at Tremannon. Timmy sat with his head on
George’s knee. He didn’t mind the thunder but he didn’t particularly like it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I think we’d better go to bed,’ said Julian at last. He knew that the
Penruthlans liked to go to bed early because they got up so early, and as they
did not go upstairs until after the children did, Julian saw to it that they,
too, went early.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
said good night and went up to their bare little rooms. The windows were still
open and the small curtains drawn back, so that the hills, lit now and again by
lightning, showed up clearly. The children went and stood there, watching. They
all loved a storm, especially Dick. There was something powerful and most
majestic about this kind of storm, sweeping over hills and sea, rumbling all
round, and tearing the sky in half with flashes of lightning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian,
is it possible to go up to that place the shepherd showed us and see if the
light flashes tonight?’ said George. ‘You only laughed when I asked you
before.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I laugh again!’ said Julian. ‘Of course not! We’d be drenched, and I don’t
fancy being out in this lightning on those exposed hills, either.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right,’ said George. ‘Anyway, I don’t feel quite such an urge to go now that
it’s so pitch dark.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Just
as well,’ said Julian. ‘Come on, Dick, let’s go to bed.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
storm went on for some time, rumbling all round the hills again, as if it were
going round in a circle. The girls fell asleep, but the boys tossed about,
feeling hot and sticky.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dick,’
said Julian, suddenly, ‘let’s get up and go out. It’s stopped raining. Let’s go
and see if that light is flashing tonight. It should be just the night for it,
according to old Grandad.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Dick, and sat up, feeling for his clothes. ‘I simply can’t go to sleep,
even though I felt really sleepy when I undressed.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
pulled on as few clothes as possible, for the night was still thundery and hot.
Julian took his torch and Dick hunted for his.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Got
it,’ he said at last. ‘Are you ready? Come on, then. Let’s tiptoe past the
Penruthlans’ door, or we may wake that dog Scottie! He’s sleeping there
tonight, don’t forget.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
tiptoed along the passage, past the Penruthlans’ door and down the stairs. One
stair creaked rather alarmingly, and they stopped in dismay, wondering if Ben
the Scottie would break out into a storm of barking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
he didn’t. Good! Down they went again, switching on their torches to see the
way. They came to the bottom of the stairs. ‘Shall we go out by the front door
or back door, Ju?’ whispered Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Back,’
said Julian. ‘The front door’s so heavy to open. Come on.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
they went down the passage to the back door that led out from the kitchen. It
was locked and bolted, but the two boys opened it without too much noise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
stepped out into the night. The rain had now stopped, but the sky was still
dark and overclouded. Tne thunder rumbled away in the distance. A wind had got
up and blew coolly against the boys’ faces.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nice
cocl breeze,’ whispered Dick. ‘Now - do we go through the farm-yard? Is that
the shortest way to the stile we have to climb over into that first field?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
i think so,’ said Julian. They made their way across the silent farm-yard,
where, in the daytime, such a lot of noise went on, clucking, quacking,
grunting, clip-clopping, and shouting!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
it was dark and deserted. They passed the barns and the stables. A little
‘hrrrrrrumphing’ came from one of the stables. ‘That’s Jenny, the horse that’s
not well,’ said Julian, stopping. ‘Let’s just have a look at her and see if
she’s all right. She was lying down feeling very sorry for herself when I saw
her last.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
flashed their torch over the top half of the stable door, which was pulled back
to let in air. They looked in with interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jenny
was no longer lying down. She was standing up, munching something. Goodness,
she must be quite all right again! She whinnied to the two boys.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
left her and went on. They came to the stile and climbed over. The rain began
drizzling again, and if the boys had not had their torches with them they would
not have been able to see a step in front of them, it was so dark.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say, Ju - did you hear that?’ said Dick, stopping suddenly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
What?’ said Julian, listening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
it sounded like a cough,’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘One
of the sheep,’ suggested Julian. ‘I heard one old sheep coughing just like
Uncle Quentin does sometimes, sort of hollow and mournful.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
It wasn’t a sheep,’ said Dick. ‘Anyway, there aren’t any in this field.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
imagined it,’ said Julian. ‘I bet there’s nobody idiotic enough to be out on a
night like this, except ourselves!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went on cautiously over the field. The thunder began again, a little nearer.
Then came a flash, and again the thunder. Dick stopped dead once more and
clutched Julian’s arm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
somebody a good way in front of us, the lightning just lighted him up for half
a second. He was climbing over that stile, the one we’re making for. Who do you
suppose it is on a night like this?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
apparently going the same way that we are,’ said Julian. ‘Well, I suppose if we
saw him he’s quite likely to have seen us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
unless he was looking backwards,’ said Dick. ‘Come on, let’s see where he’s
going.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went on cautiously towards the stile. They came to it and climbed over. And
then a hand suddenly clutched hold of Dick’s shoulder!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
jumped almost out of his skin! The hand gripped him so hard and so fiercely
that Dick shouted in pain and tried to wriggle away from the powerful grip.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
felt a hand lunge at him, too, but dodged and pressed himself into the hedge.
He switched off his torch at once and stood quite still, his heart thumping
quickly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let
me go!’ shouted Dick, wriggling like an eel. His shirt was almost tom off his
back in his struggles. He kicked out at the man’s ankles and for one moment his
captor loosened his grasp. That was enough for Dick. He ripped himself away and
left his shirt in the man’s hand!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
ran up the lane into which the stile had led and flung himself under a bush in
the darkness, panting. He heard his captor coming along, muttering, and Dick
pressed himself farther into the bush. A torchlight swept the ground near him,
but missed him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
waited till the footsteps had gone and then crawled out. He went quietly down
tht lane. ‘Julian!’ he whispered, and jumped as a voice answered almost in his
ear, just above his head!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
here. Are you all right?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
looked up into the darkness of a tree, but could see nothing. ‘I’ve dropped my
torch somewhere,’ he said. ‘Where are you, Ju? Up in the tree?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
hand groped out and felt his head. ‘Here I am, on the first branch,’ said
Julian. ‘I hid in the hedge first and then climbed up here. I daren’t put on my
torch in case that fellow’s anywhere around and sees it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
gone up the lane,’ said Dick. ‘My word, he nearly wrenched my shoulder off.
Half my shirt’s gone! Who was he? Did you see?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
I didn’t,’ said Julian, clambering down. ‘Let’s find your torch before we go
home. It’s too good to lose. It must be by that stile.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went to look. Julian still didn’t like to put on his torch, so that it was more
a question of feeling for Dick’s torch, not looking! Dick suddenly trod on it
and picked it up thankfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Listen,
there’s that fellow coming back again, I’m sure!’ said Dick. ‘I heard the same
dry little cough! What shall we do?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I don’t now feel like going up to the shepherd’s hill to see if that light is
flashing from the tower,’ said Julian. ‘I vote we hide and follow this chap to
see where he goes. I don’t think anyone who is wandering out tonight can be up
to any good.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
Good idea,’ said Dick. ‘Squash into the hedge again. Blow, there are nettles
here! Just my luck.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
footsteps came nearer, and the cough came again. ‘I seem to know that cough,’
whispered Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sh!’
said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
man came up to the stile, and they heard him climbing over it. After a short
time both boys followed cautiously. They couldn’t hear the man’s footsteps
across the grass, but the sky had cleared a little and they could just make out
a moving shadow ahead of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
followed him at a distance, holding their breath whenever they kicked against a
stone or cracked a twig beneath their feet. Now and again they heard the cough.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
making for the farm,’ whispered Julian. He could just see the outline of the
big barns against the sky. ‘Do you think he’s one of the labourers? They live
in cottages round about.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
man came to the farm-yard and walked through it, trying to make as little sound
as possible. The boys followed. He went round the barns and into the little
garden that Mrs Penruthlan tended herself. Still the boys followed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Round
to the front door went the man, and the boys held their breath. Was he going to
burgle the farmhouse? They tiptoed nearer. There came the sound of a soft
click, and then of bolts being shot home! After that there was silence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
gone in,’ said Julian in amazement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
you know who it was? Can’t you guess now?’ said Dick. ‘We both ought to have
known when we heard that cough! It was Mr Penruthlan! No wonder he almost
dislocated my shoulder with his strong hand!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mr
Penruthlan - gosh, yes, you’re right,’ said Julian, astonished, almost
forgetting to speak in a whisper. ‘We didn’t notice that the front door was
undone because we went out the back way. So it was he we followed. How silly!
But what was he doing out on the hills? He didn’t go to see the horse, she
wasn’t ill.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Perhaps
he likes a walk at night,’ suggested Dick. ‘Come on, let’s go in ourselves. I
feel a bit chilly with practically no shirt on!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
crept round to the back door. It was still open, thank goodness! They went
inside, bolted and locked it, and tiptoed upstairs. They heaved sighs of relief
when they were safely in their room again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Switch
on your torch, Julian, and see if my shoulder is bruised,’ said Dick. ‘It feels
jolly painful.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
flashed his torch on Dick’s shoulder. He gave a low whistle. ‘My word, you’ve
got a wonderful bruise all down your right shoulder. He must have given you an
awful wrench.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
did,’ said poor Dick. ‘Well, I can’t say we had a very successful time,
followed our host through the night, got caught by him, and followed him all
the way back here. Not very clever!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
never mind, I bet no light flashed in that tower,’ said Julian, getting into
bed. ‘We haven’t lost much by not going all the way to see!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two boys looked curiously at Mr Penruthlan the next morning. It seemed strange
to think of their little adventure the night before with him, and he didn’t even
know it was they he had tried to catch! He gave the curious little dry cough
again, and Julian nudged Dick and grinned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs
Penruthlan was beaming at the head of the breakfast table as usual. ‘Did you
sleep well, all of you?’ she asked. ‘The storm soon died down, didn’t it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr
Penruthlan got up said ‘Ah, ock, oooh!’ or something that sounded like that,
and went out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
did he say?’ asked Anne curiously. She could not think how anyone could
possibly understand Mr Penruthlan’s extraordinary speech. Julian had said that
he thought he must talk in shorthand!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
said he might not be back for dinner,’ said Mrs Penruthlan. ‘I hope he’ll get
some somewhere. He had his breakfast at half past six, and that’s very early.
I’m glad he came in and had a cup of your breakfast tea now. The poor man had a
very bad night, I’m sorry to say.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys pricked up their ears. ‘What happened?’ asked Julian at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
he had to get up and go and spend two hours with poor Jenny,’ said Mrs
Penruthlan. ‘I woke when he left, but luckily Benny didn’t bark, and it wasn’t
till two hours later he came back, he’d been sitting with the horse all that
time, poor man.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and Dick did not feel at all sympathetic. They knew quite well where Mr
Penruthlan had been, not with the horse, that was certain! Anyway, Jenny hadn’t
been ill when they had looked at her in the night. What a lot of untruths!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were puzzled. Why should Mr Penruthlan deceive his wife and tell her what
wasn’t true? What had he been doing that he didn’t even want her to know?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
told the girls everything immediately after breakfast, when they went to pick
currants, raspberries and plums for a fruit salad. Anne and George listened in
surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
never told us you were going,’ said George, reproachfully. ‘I’d like to have
come with you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
always thought Mr Penruthlan looked sort of strange and - and sinister,’ said
Anne. ‘I’m sure he’s up to no good. What a pity. His wife is so very nice.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went on picking the endless red-currants. Anne suddenly got the feeling that
somebody was hiding somewhere near. She looked round uncomfortably. Yes, there
was someone in the tall raspberry canes, she was sure! She watched.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was Yan, of course. She might have guessed! He flashed his smile at her and
came towards her. He liked Anne best of all! He held out his hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
I’ve no sweets,’ said Anne. ‘How did you get on last night in the storm, Yan?
Were you frightened?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yan
shook his head. Then he came nearer and spoke softly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
seen the light last night!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
stared at him, astonished. What light?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
don’t mean - the light that flashes in that old hidden tower?’ she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
nodded. Anne went quickly to Julian and Dick, who were picking white currants
and eating just about as many as they put into the basket!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian!
Dick! Yan says he saw that light flashing last night, the one in the tower!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh!’
said the boys together. They turned to Yan, who had followed Anne. ‘You saw
that light?’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yan
nodded. ‘Big light. Very big,’ he said. ‘Like - like a fire.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shining
from the tower?’ said Dick, and Yan nodded again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Did
your Grandad see it?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yan
nodded. ‘He seen it, too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Are
you telling the truth?’ demanded Julian, wondering how far he could believe
Yan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yan
nodded again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
time was this?’ asked Dick. But that Yan couldn’t tell him. He had no watch,
and if he had had, he wouldn’t have been able to use it. He couldn’t tell the
time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Blow!’
said Julian to Dick. ‘We missed it. If Yan’s telling the truth we would have
seen that light last night.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
Well, we’ll go tonight and watch for it,’ said Dick, determined. ‘It’s a wild
enough day, all wind and scurrying clouds. If that light is used at night in
weather like this, we’ll be able to see it again. But I’m blessed if I can
understand why the wreckers’ tower should be used nowadays. No ship would take
any notice of an odd light like that when they’ve got the lighthouse signalling
hard all the time!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
go, too,’ nodded Yan, who had overheard this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
you won’t,’ said Julian. ‘You can stay with Grandad. He’ll wonder where you are
if you’re not there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
began to rain. ‘Blow!’ said George. ‘I do hope the weather hasn’t broken up.
It’s been so gorgeous. It’s quite cold today with this tearing wind. Come on,
let’s go in, Anne. We’ve got enough now to feed an army, I should think!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went in, just as the rain came down properly. Mrs Penruthlan greeted them
in excitement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
Barnies want our barn for tomorrow night!’ she said. ‘They’re giving their
first show in our barn, and after that they go to another place. Would you like
to help clear out the barn and get ready?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Rather!’
said Julian. ‘We’ll go now. There’s a lot of stuff to clear out. Where shall we
put it? In the other barn?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Barnies arrived in about twenty minutes and went straight to the barn, which
they had been lent several times before for their shows. They were pleased to
see the children and were glad of their help.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were no longer dressed in fancy clothes, as they had been when the children had
seen them on the Sunday evening. They were practically all dressed in slacks,
the women, too, ready for the hard work of clearing the barn and setting up a
simple stage and background.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
caught sight of a horse’s head being carried in by a little nimble fellow who
pranced along with it comically.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
that for?’ he said. ‘Oh, is that Clopper’s head? The horse that can sit down
and cross its legs?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
right,’ said the little fellow. ‘I’m in charge of it. Never let it out of my
sight! Guv’nor’s orders!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who’s
the Guv’nor?’ asked Julian. ‘The fellow over there?’ He nodded to a grim-faced
man who was supervising the moving of some bales of straw.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
him,’ said the little man with a grin. ‘His lordship himself! What do you think
of my horse, chum!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
looked at the horse’s head. It was beautifully made and had a most comical look
in its eye. Its mouth could open and shut, and so could its big eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
only the hind legs,’ said the little man regretfully. ‘But l work his tail,
too. Mr Binks over there is his front legs, and works his head, the horse’s
head, I mean. You should see old Clopper when he performs! My, there isn’t a
horse like him in the world. He can do everything short of fly!’<span
style='mso-tab-count:3'>                            </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
are his back and front legs - and - er - his body part'?’ asked Dick, coming up
and looking with great interest at the horse’s head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Over
there,’ said the little man. ‘By the way, my name’s Sid. What’s yours, and how
is it you’re here?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
introduced himself and Dick, and explained that they were helping because they
were staying at the farm. He caught hold of a bale of straw, thinking it was
about time he did some work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Like
to give me a hand?’ he asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sid
shook his head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sorry.
Orders are I’m not to put this horse’s head down anywhere. Where I go, it goes!
I can tell you, me and Clopper are quite attached to one another!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why?
Is it so valuable?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
not so much that,’ said Sid. ‘It’s just that Clopper’s so popular, you know.
And he’s important. You see, whenever we think the show’s flopping a bit, we
bring Clopper on, and then we get the laughs and the claps, and the audience is
in a good temper. Oh, Clopper’s saved the show times without number. He’s a
jolly good horse is Clopper.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr
Binks came up. He was bigger than Sid and much stronger. He grinned at the two
boys. ‘Admiring old Clopper?’ he said. ‘Did Sid tell you about the time
Clopper’s head dropped off the wagon and we didn’t miss him till we were miles
away? My word, what a state the Guv’nor was in! Said we couldn’t give a show
without Clopper, and nearly gave us all the sack!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’re
important, we are,’ said Sid, throwing out his chest and doing a funny little
strut with the horse’s head in front of him. ‘Me and Binks and Clopper - no
show without us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
you put that horse down even for a moment,’ warned Mr Binks. ‘The Guv’nor’s got
his eye on you, Sid. Look, he’s calling you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sid
went over to the Guv’nor, looking rather alarmed. He carried the horse’s head
safely under his arm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
grim-faced man said a few sharp words and Sid nodded. Julian went up to him
when he came back. ‘Let me feel how heavy the horse’s head is,’ he said. ‘I’ve
often wondered, when I’ve seen something like this on the stage.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sid
immediately put the horse under his other arm, and glared at Julian, looking
round quickly to see if the Guv’nor had heard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
a fool thing to ask me,’ he said. ‘After I’ve told you I’m not allowed to put
the horse down! And didn’t the Guv’nor just this minute say to me “Keep away
from those kids, you know what tricks they’re up to. They’ll have that horse
away from you if you’re not careful.” See? Do you want me to lose my job?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
laughed. ‘Don’t be silly. You wouldn’t lose your job for that! When are you and
Mr Binks going to do a bit of practice? We want to see you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
well, we could manage that all right,’ said Sid, calming down. ‘Here, Binks.
Bit of practice wanted. Get the legs.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Binks
and Sid went to a cleared space in the big barn and proceeded to clothe
themselves in the horse’s canvas skin and legs. Sid showed the boys how he
worked the tail with one of his hands when he wanted to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Binks
put on the head and the front legs. His head only went into the neck of the
horse, no farther. He was able to use his hands for pulling strings to open the
horse’s mouth and work its rolling eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sid
got his legs in the horse’s back legs, bent over and put his head and arms over
towards Binks, so making the horse’s back. Somebody came up and zipped up the
two halves of the horse’s ‘skin’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh!
What a jolly good horse!’ said Dick, delighted. It looked a lively, comical,
extremely supple beast, and the two men inside at once proceeded to make it do
ridiculous things. It marched - left-right, left-right, left-right. It did a
little tap-dance with its front feet, which then remained perfectly still, and
then the back feet did the same little tap-dance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
back feet got themselves entangled and fell over, and the horse’s head looked
round at itself in astonishment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
four children were now watching, and Yan was peeping in at the door. They
roared with laughter at the ridiculous horse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
took its tail in its mouth and marched round and round itself. It stood up on
its hind legs only. It jumped like a kangaroo, and made peculiar noises. The
whole company stood and watched and even the grim-faced Guv’nor had to smile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
it sat down on its hind-legs and crossed its front ones in the air, looking
round comically. It then gave an enormous yawn that showed dozens of large
teeth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
don’t do any more!’ cried Anne, who was weak with laughing. ‘Don’t! Oh, I can
quite well see how important you are, Clopper! You’ll be the best part of<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the show!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was a mad, gay morning, for the Barnies were full of chatter and jokes and
laughter. Sid and Binks took off their horse garments, and Sid thereupon went
about as before, the horse’s head, grinning comically, tucked safely under his
arm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs
Penruthlan called the children in to dinner. Yan ran after Julian, and caught
hold of his arm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
seen that light,’ he said, urgently. ‘You come, see it tonight. Don’t forget. I
seen that light!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
had forgotten it in the excitement of the morning. He grinned down at the small
boy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right, all right. I won’t forget. We’re coming along tonight, but you’re not
coming, Yan, so get that out of your head! Look, here’s a sweet for you. Now,
scoot!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>By
the end of the day the big barn was quite transformed! It had been cleared of
all straw, sacks of corn, bags of fertilizer and odd machines that had been
stored in it. It looked enormous now, and the Barnies were very pleased with
it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ve
been here plenty of times,’ they told the children. ‘It’s the best barn in the
district. We don’t get the best audience, though, because it’s rather a lonely
spot here, and there are only two villages near enough to send people to see
us. Still, we have a good time, and Mrs Penruthlan gives us a marvellous supper
afterwards!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
bet she does!’ said Dick, grinning. ‘I bet that’s why you come to this lonely
spot, too, to taste Mrs Penruthlan’s cooking. I don’t blame you. I’d come a
good few miles myself!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
stage had been set up, made of long boards, supported on barrels. A back-cloth
had been unrolled and hung over the wooden wall of the barn at the back of the
stage. It showed a country scene, and had been painted by the company
themselves, bit by bit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
my bit,’ said Sid, showing Dick a horse standing in one of the fields painted
on the back-cloth. ‘I had to put old Clopper in! See him?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Barnies had plenty of home-made scenery, which they were used to changing
several times during their performance. This was all home-made too, and they
were very proud of it, especially some that represented a castle with a tower.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
tower reminded the boys of the one Yan had said he had seen flashing a light
the night before. They looked at one another secretly, and Julian nodded
slightly. They would certainly watch to see that light themselves. Then they
would know for certain whether Grandad and Yan were telling the truth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
wondered if they would have to look out for Mr Penruthlan again that night.
Jenny the horse was quite better now, if she had ever been ill!, and was out in
the fields again. So Mr Penruthlan had no excuse for creeping about the
countryside at night again!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Neither
of the boys could imagine what had taken him out the night before, on such a
wild night too! Was he meeting somebody? He hadn’t had time to go up to see the
shepherd about anything, and there wouldn’t have been much point in that
anyway. He had seen Grandad in the morning already.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs
Penruthlan came to see the barn now that it was almost ready for the show the
next night. She looked red and excited. This was a grand time for her, the
Barnies in her barn, the villagers all coming up the next night, a grand supper
to be held afterwards. What an excitement!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
was very busy in her kitchen, cooking, cooking, cooking! Her enormous larder
was already full of the most appetizing looking pies, tarts, hams, brawns and
cheeses. The children took turns at looking into it and sniffing in delight.
Mrs Penruthlan laughed at them and shooed them out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’ll
have to help me tomorrow,’ she said. ‘Shelling peas, scraping potatoes,
stringing beans, picking currants and raspberries, and you’ll find hundreds of
wild strawberries in the copse, too, which can go to add a flavour to the fruit
salad.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
shall love to help,’ said Anne. ‘All this is grand fun! But surely you aren’t
going to do all the supper single-handed, Mrs Penruthlan?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
one or two of the villagers will stay behind to help me serve it,’ said the
plump little farmer’s wife, who looked as happy as could be in the midst of so
much hard work. ‘Anyway, I’ll be up at five o’clock tomorrow morning. I’ll have
plenty of time!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’d
better go to bed early tonight then!’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
all will,’ said Mrs Penruthlan. ‘We’ll be up early and abed late tomorrow, and
we’ll need some sleep tonight. It’s no trouble to get Mr Penruthlan to bed early.
He’s always ready to go!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children felt sure he would be ready to go early that night because he had
spent so much time out in the storm the night before! Julian and Dick were
tired too, but they were quite determined to go up to the shepherd’s hill and
find the place where they could watch and see if that light really did flash
out!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had a high tea as usual, at which Mr Penruthlan was present. He ate solidly and
solemnly, not saying a word except something that sounded like ‘Ooahah, ooh.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I’m glad you like the pie, Mr Penruthlan,’ said his wife. ‘Though I says it as
shouldn’t, it’s a good one.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
really was wonderful the way she understood her husband’s speech. It was also
very queer to hear her speak to her husband as if he was someone to whom she
had to be polite, and call Mister! Anne wondered if she called him Mr
Penruthlan when they were alone together. She looked at him earnestly. What a
dark giant he was - and how he ate!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
looked up and saw Anne watching him. He nodded at her and said ‘Ah! Oooh, ock,
ukker.’ It might have been a foreign language for all Anne could understand!
She looked startled and didn’t know what to say.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now,
Mr Penruthlan, don’t you tease the child!’ said his wife. ‘She doesn’t know
what to answer. Do you, Anne?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- I - er - I didn’t really catch what he said,’ said Anne, going scarlet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
now, Mr Penruthlan - see how badly you talk without your teeth in!’ said the
farmer’s wife scoldingly. ‘Haven’t I told you you should wear your teeth when
you want to make conversation? I understand you all right, but others don’t. It
must sound just a mumble to them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr
Penruthlan frowned and muttered something. The children all stared at him,
dumbfounded to hear that he had no teeth. Goodness gracious - HOW did he manage
to eat all he did, then? He seemed to chew and munch and crunch, and yet he had
no teeth!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
that’s why he speaks so queerly,’ thought Dick, amused. ‘But fancy eating as
much as he does, with no teeth in his head! Goodness, what would he eat if he
had got all his teeth.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs
Penruthlan changed the conversation because it was clear that her husband was
annoyed with her. She talked brightly about the Barnies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
horse Clapper! You wait till you see him prance on to the stage, and fall off
it. You’ll see Mr Penruthlan almost fall out of his seat he laughs so much.
He’s fair set on that horse. He’s seen it a dozen times, and it tickles him to
death.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think it’s jolly funny myself,’ said Julian. ‘I’ve always thought I’d like to
put on an act like that at our end-of-term concert at school. Dick and I could
do it all right. I wish Sid and Mr Binks would let us try.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
meal was finished at last. Most of the dishes were empty, and Mrs Penruthlan looked
pleased. ‘There now - you’ve done really well,’ she said. ‘That’s what I do
like to see, people finishing up everything put before them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
easy when it’s food you put before us,’ said George. ‘Isn’t it, Timmy? I bet
Timmy wishes he lived here always, Mrs Penruthlan! I’m sure he keeps telling
your dogs how lucky they are!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
the washing-up, in which everyone but Mr Penruthlan helped, they went to sit
down for a while, and read. But the farmer kept giving such enormous yawns that
he set everyone else yawning too, and Mrs Penruthlan began to laugh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on, to bed, all of you!’ she said. ‘I’ve never heard so many yawns in my life!
Poor Mr Penruthlan. He’s tired out with sitting up with Jenny the horse half
the night.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children exchanged glances. They knew better!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
went up to bed, and the children laughed to hear Mr Penruthlan still yawning
loudly in his room. Julian looked out of his window. It was a dark, blustery
night, with sudden spurts of sharp rain. The wind howled and Julian almost
thought he could hear the great waves crashing on the rocks in the nearest
caves! How enormous they would be in this wind!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
good night for wreckers, if there were any nowadays!’ he said to Dick. ‘Not
much chance for any ship that went too near those coves tonight! They’d be on
the rocks, and dashed to pieces in half an hour! The beach would be strewn with
thousands of pieces of wreckage the next day.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’d
better wait a bit before we go,’ said Dick. ‘It’s really very early. On a
bright sunny evening the hills would still be full of daylight, but this stormy
evening is very dark. Let’s light our candles and read.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
wind became even stronger, and grew almost to a gale. It made a howling noise
round the old farm-house, and sounded angry and in pain. Not a very nice night
to go out on the hills!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
go now, I think,’ said Julian, at last. ‘It’s quite dark, and getting late.
Come on.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
hadn’t undressed, so they went down the stairs at once, and out of the back
door as before, closing it silently behind them. They made their way through
the farm-yard, not daring to shine their torches till they were well away from
the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had had a quick look at the front door, when they had stood in the hall. It was
locked and bolted! Mr Penruthlan was not out tonight, that was certain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
walked steadily through the gale, gasping when it caught them full in the face.
They each had their warm jerseys on, for it was quite cold, and the wind blew
all the time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Across
the fields. Over one stile after another. Across more fields. The boys stopped
once or twice to make sure they were right. They were relieved when they came
to the great flock of sheep, and knew they must be near the shepherd’s hut.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
the hut,’ whispered Julian, at last. ‘You can just see its dark outline. We
must go quietly now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
stole by the hut. Not a sound came from inside, and no candle-light showed
through the cracks. Old Grandad must be fast asleep! Julian pictured Yan curled
up with him on their bed of old sheepskins.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys went quietly along. Now, they must make for the spot from which the old
tower could be seen, and it must be the exact spot, for the tower could be seen
from nowhere else.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
couldn’t find it, or, if they had found it, and were standing on it, they were
unable to see the tower far off in the darkness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
it didn’t happen to be flashing a light, we wouldn’t know if we were looking in
the right direction or not!’ said Julian. ‘We’d never see it in the dark. Why
didn’t we think of that? Somehow I thought we’d see the tower whether it was
lighted up or not. We’re asses.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
wandered about a little, continually looking in the direction where they
thought the tower should be. But they saw nothing at all. What a waste of a
long walk!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
Julian suddenly gave an exclamation. ‘Who’s that? I saw you there! Who is it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
jumped. What was this now? Then someone sidled up against them both, and a
voice spoke timidly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
me, Yan!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
gracious! You turn up everywhere!’ said Julian. ‘I suppose you were watching
out for us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Iss.
Come with me,’ said Yan, and tugged at Julian’s arm. The two boys went with
him, a few yards to the right, then higher up the hill. Then Yan stopped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys saw the distant light at once. There was no doubt about it at all! It
flashed continually, rather like a small lighthouse light. Each time it flashed
they could see the faint outline of the tower.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
seems to be some kind of signal,’ said Julian. ‘Flash - flash-flash-flash -
flash-flash - flash. My word, how weird. Who’s doing it, and why? Surely there
are no wreckers nowadays!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Grandad
says it’s his old Dad,’ said Yan, in an awed voice. Julian laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
be silly! All the same, it’s a bit of a mystery, isn’t it, Dick? Could any ship
out at sea be deceived and come near to the shore, and be wrecked? It’s a
wicked night, just the night for great waves to pound a ship to pieces if it
came near this coast.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
Well, we shall hear tomorrow if there has been a wreck,’ said Dick soberly. ‘I
hope there won’t be. I can’t bear thinking of it, anyway. Surely, surely there
aren’t wreckers here now!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
there are, they will be creeping down the hidden Wreckers’ Way, wherever it
is,’ said Julian. ‘And watching for the ship to crash to pieces. Then they will
collect sacks upon sacks of booty and creep away back.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
felt a chill of horror. ‘Shut up, Ju!’ he said, sharply. ‘Don’t talk like that.
Now, what are we going to do about that light.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
tell you,’ said Julian, firmly, ‘We’re going to find that tower and see what’s
going on. That’s what we’re going to do! And as soon as ever we can too, maybe
tomorrow!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and Dick watched the light for a little longer, and then turned to go back to

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m

like to show us the way to it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

shivered all the more, from fright as much as cold. ‘No. I’m frit,’ he said.
‘I’m frit of that tower now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
does he mean, frit?’ said Dick. ‘Short for frightened, I suppose! All right,
Yan. You needn’t come. It is pretty peculiar, I must admit. Now, go back to
your hut.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yan
shot off in the dark like a scared rabbit. The boys made their way home, not
very cautiously, for they felt sure they were the only people out that night.
But when they came to the farm-yard they saw something that made them stop
suddenly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
a light in the big barn!’ whispered Dick. ‘It’s gone, no, there it is again.
It’s somebody with a torch, flashing it on and off. Who is it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘One
of the Barnies, perhaps,’ whispered back Julian. ‘Let’s go and see. We know the
Barnies are sleeping in the near-by sheds tonight.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
tiptoed to the barn and looked through a crack. They saw nothing at first. Then
a torch flashed, shedding its light on some of the properties of the Barnies,
stacked in a corner, scenery, dresses, coats, and other things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Somebody’s
going through the pockets!’ said Julian, indignantly. ‘Look at that! A thief!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who
is it?’ said Dick. ‘One of the Barnies pick-pocketing?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
a moment or two the torch lighted up the back of the intruder’s hand in the
barn, and the boys stifled an exclamation. They knew that hand! It was covered
with black hairs almost as thick as fur!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mr
Penruthlan!’ whispered Dick. ‘Yes, I see it’s him now. Look at his enormous
shadow. What’s he doing? He must be mad, walking about at night on the hills,
stealing into the barn, going through pockets. Look what he’s doing now!
Looking in the drawers of that chest the Barnies are going to use in one of
their scenes. Yes, he’s mad!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
felt most uncomfortable. He didn’t like spying on his host like this. What a
strange man he was! He told untruths, he crept about at night, he went through
people’s pockets. Yes, he must be mad! Did Mrs Penruthlan know? She couldn’t
know, or she would be unhappy, and she really seemed the most cheerful, gay
little person in the world!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on,’ said Julian, in Dick’s ear. ‘He’s going through everything! Though what he
expects to find in the Barnies’ stage clothes and properties, I don’t know.
He’s got a kink! Come on, I really don’t want to spot him taking something,
stealing it. It would be so awkward if we had to say we saw him stealing.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
left the barn and went back to the farmhouse, creeping in once more at the back
door. They looked at the front door. It was shut, but no longer locked or
bolted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys went upstairs, puzzled. What a strange night! The howling wind, the
flashing light, the furtive man in the barn, they didn’t know what to make of
it at all!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
wake the girls and tell them,’ said Julian. ‘I feel as if I can’t wait till the
morning.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was awake and so was Timmy. Timmy had heard them going out, and had lain awake
waiting for them to come back. He had stirred and had awakened George. She was
quite prepared to hear a whisper at the door!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Anne!
George! We’ve got some news!’ whispered Julian. Timmy gave a little welcoming
whine and leapt off the bed. Soon Anne was awake, too, and the girls were
listening in amazement at the boys’ news.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were almost as surprised to hear about Mr Penruthlan in the barn as to hear
about the light actually flashing in the tower.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
it was true what old Grandad said, then?’ whispered Anne. ‘He had seen the
light again. I do think it’s weird, all this. Julian, you don’t think we’ll
hear of a wreck tomorrow, do you? I couldn’t bear it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nor
could I,’ said George, listening to the wind howling outside. ‘Fancy being
wrecked on a night like this, and being dashed on the rocks by those pounding
waves. I feel as if we ought to rush off to the caves here and now and see if
we can do any rescuing!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
wouldn’t be much use,’ said Dick. ‘I doubt if we could even get near the cove
on a night like this. The waves would run right up to the road that leads down
to it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
talked and talked about everything. Then George yawned. ‘We’d better stop,’ she
said. ‘We’ll never wake up tomorrow morning. We can’t go and explore that tower
tomorrow, Julian. The Barnies will be here, and we’ve promised Mrs Penruthlan
to help her.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’ll
have to be next day, then,’ said Julian. ‘But I’m determined to go. Yan said he
wouldn’t show us the way. He said he was too “frit”!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
feel pretty frit myself,’ said George, settling down. ‘I should have jumped out
of my skin if I’d seen that light tonight.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys stole back to their room. Soon they were in bed and asleep. The wind still
howled round the house, but they didn’t hear it. They were tired out with their
long walk over the hills.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Next
day was so busy that it was quite dificult to find time to remember the night’s
happenings! They were reminded of it by one thing, though!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs
Penruthlan was seeing to their breakfast, and making bright conversation as
usual. She was never at a loss for words, and chattered all day long either to
the children or to the dogs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Did
you sleep well with that howling gale blowing all night long?’ she asked. ‘I
slept like a top. So did Mr Penruthlan! He told me he never moved all night, he
was that tired!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children kicked each other under the table, but said nothing. They knew quite a
lot more about her husband’s nights than she did!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
that they had very little time to think of anything but picking fruit, podding
peas, rushing here and there, carrying things for the Barnies, helping them to
put up benches, barrels, boxes and chairs for the audience to sit on, and even
mending tears in some of the stage clothes! Anne had offered to sew on a
button, and at once found herself overwhelmed with requests to mend this, that
and the other!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was an extremely busy day. Yan appeared as usual and was greeted uproariously
by Timmy, of course. All the dogs loved him, but Timmy was quite silly with
him. Mrs Penruthlan sent Yan on endless errands, which he ran quickly and
willingly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
may be a bit simple, but he’s quick enough when he thinks there’s some good
food he’s going to share!’ she said. So it was ‘Fetch this, Yan!’ ‘Do that,
Yan!’ all day long.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Barnies worked hard, too. They had a quick rehearsal in which every single
thing went wrong; the Guv’nor raved and raged and stamped, making Anne wonder
why they didn’t all run away and stay away!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>First
there was to be a kind of concert party such as pierrots give on the beaches.
Then there was to be a play, most heart-rending and melodramatic, with villains
and heroes and a heroine who was very hardly used. But everything came right
for her in the end, Anne was relieved to find!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Clopper
the horse was to have no definite performance of his own. He just wandered on
and off the stage to get laughs and to please everyone, or to fill awkward
gaps. There was no doubt he would do this to perfection!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and Dick watched Mr Binks and Sid doing a small rehearsal on their own in a
corner of the farmyard. How well those back legs and front legs worked
together! How that horse danced, trotted, galloped, marched, fell over, tied
itself into knots, sat down, got up, went to sleep, and, in fact, did every
comical thing that Sid and Mr Binks could think of. They really were very, very
funny.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let
me try the head on, Mr Binks,’ begged Julian. ‘Do let me. Just to feel what
it’s like.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it was no good. Sid wouldn’t let him. Mr Binks had no say in the matter at all.
‘Orders are orders,’ said Sid, picking up the head as soon as Mr Binks took it
off. ‘I don’t want to lose my job. The Guv’nor says if this horse’s head is
mislaid again, I’ll be mislaid, too! So hands off Clopper!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
you sleep with Clopper?’ asked Dick, curiously. ‘Having to take charge of a
horse’s head all the time must be a bore!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
get used to it,’ said Sid. ‘Yes, I sleep with old Clopper. Him and me have our
heads on the pillow together. He sleeps sound, does old Clopper!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
the best part of the show,’ grinned Julian. ‘You’ll bring the barn down with
Clopper tonight!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
always do,’ said Mr Binks. ‘He’s the most important member of the Barnies, and
he gets paid the worst. Shame.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
back-legs and front-legs are badly paid,’ said Sid. ‘They only count as one
player, see, so we get half pay. Still, we like the life, so there you are!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went off together, Sid carrying the horse’s head as usual under his arm. He
really was a funny little man, cheery and silly and gay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
suddenly remembered something at dinnertime. ‘Mrs Penruthlan,’ he said, ‘I
suppose that awful wind didn’t cause any wrecks last night, did it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
farmer’s wife looked surprised. ‘No, Julian. Why should it? Ships keep right
out to sea round these coasts now. The lighthouse warns them, you know. The
only way any ship could come in now would be to nose into one of the caves at
full tide, and then she’d have to be very careful of rocks. The fishermen know
the rocks as well as they know the backs of their hands, and they come into the
coves at times. But no other craft come now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
heaved a sigh of relief. The flashing light hadn’t caused a wreck last night,
then. That was a mercy! They went on with their meal. Mr Penruthlan was there,
eating away as usual, and saying nothing at all. His jaws worked vigorously up
and down, and it was impossible to think he had no teeth to chew with. Julian
glanced at his hands, covered with black hairs. Yes, he had seen those hands
last night, no doubt about that! Not wielding a knife and fork, but sliding
into pockets.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
evening came at last. Everything was ready. A big table was placed in the kitchen,
made of strong trestles and boards. Mrs Penruthlan gave the two girls a most
enormous white cloth to lay over it. It was bigger than any cloth they had ever
seen!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
the one I use at harvest-time,’ said the farmer’s wife, proudly. ‘We have a
wonderful harvest supper then, on that same table, but we put it out in the big
barn because there’s not enough room here in the kitchen for all the farm
workers. And we clear the table away afterwards and have a dance.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
fun!’ said Anne. ‘I do think people are lucky to live on a farm. There’s always
something going on!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Town
folk wouldn’t say that!’ said Mrs Penruthlan. ‘They think the country is a
dead-and-alive place, but, my word, there’s more life about a farm than
anywhere else in the world. Farm life’s the real thing I always say!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
is,’ agreed Anne, and George nodded, too. They had now spread out the
snowy-white cloth and it looked lovely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
cloth’s the real thing, too,’ said Mrs Penruthlan. ‘It belonged to my
great-great-great-grand-mother, and it’s nearly two hundred years old! As white
as ever and not a darn in it! It’s seen more harvest suppers than any cloth
made, and that’s the truth!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
table was laid with plates and knives and forks, cruets and glasses. All the
Barnies had been invited, and there were the children, too, of course. One or
two of the villagers were staying as well, to help. What a feast they would all
have!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
larder was so crammed with food that it was difficult to get into it. Meat
pies, fruit pies, hams, a great round tongue, pickles, sauces, jam tarts,
stewed and fresh fruit, jellies, a great trifle, jugs of cream - there was no
end to the things Mrs Penruthlan had got ready. She laughed when she saw the
children peeping there and marvelling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
won’t get any high tea today,’ she told them. ‘You’ll get nothing from dinner
till supper, so that you can get up a good appetite and really eat well!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
minded missing high tea with that wonderful supper to come. The excitement grew
as the time came near for the show. ‘Here come the first villagers!’ cried
Julian, who was at the barn door to help to sell the tickets. ‘Hurrah! It will
soon begin! Walk up, everyone! Finest show in the world. Come along in your
hundreds! Come along!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
the big barn was full of villagers, and a few more boxes had been fetched for
some of the extra children, the noise was tremendous. Everyone was laughing and
talking, some of the children were clapping for the show to begin, and the
excited farm dogs were yapping and barking at the top of their voices!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was excited, too. He welcomed everyone with a bark and a vigorous wag. Yan was
with him, and George was sure that he was pretending that Timmy was his dog!
Yan looked cleaner than usual. Mrs Penruthlan had actually given him a bath!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
don’t come to the show and you don’t come to the supper unless you bath
yourself,’ she threatened. But he wouldn’t. He said he was ‘frit’ of the bath!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
be drowned in there,’ he said, backing away from it hurriedly. It was already
half full of water for him!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Frit,
are you!’ said Mrs Penruthlan grimly, lifting him up and plunging him into the
water, clothes and all. ‘Well, you’ll be fritter still now! Take your clothes
off in the water and I’ll wash them in the bath when you’re clean. Oh, the
dirty little varmint that you are!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yan
screamed the place down as Mrs Penruthlan scrubbed him and soaped him and
flannelled him. He hit out at her, but she gave him one sound spank on his
small behind, and he stopped very suddenly. He felt very much at her mercy, and
decided not to annoy her in any way while he was in that dreadful bath!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
washed his ragged pants and shirt, too, and set them to dry. She wrapped him in
an old shawl, and told him to wait till his things dried and then put them on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘One
of these days I’ll make you some decent clothes,’ she said. ‘Little rapscallion
that you are! What a mite of a body you’ve got. I’ll need to feed you up a
bit!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yan
brightened up considerably. Feeding up was the kind of treatment he really
liked!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
he was down in the barn, welcoming everyone with Timmy, and feeling quite
important. He yelled with delight when he saw his old great-grandfather coming
along!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Grandad!
You said you was coming, but I didn’t believe you. Come you in. I’ll find you a
chair.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
what’s come over you, the way you look tonight?’ said the old man, puzzled.
‘What you done to yourself?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
took a bath. See?’ said Yan, sounding proud. ‘Iss. I took a bath, Grandad. Same
as you ought.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Grandad
aimed a cuff at him, and then nodded to various people he knew. He had his big
old shepherd’s crook with him, and he held on to it even when he sat down on a
chair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
Grandad, it’s nigh on twenty year since we saw you down hereabouts,’ said a
big, red-faced villager. ‘What you been doing with yourself all these years?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Minding
my business and minding my sheep,’ said Grandad, in his slow, Cornish voice.
‘Ay, and it’ll mebbe twenty years afore you sees me again, Joe Tremayne. And if
you want to know summat, I’ll tell you this. It bain’t the show I’m come for,
it’s the supper.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
roared with laughter, and Grandad looked as pleased as Punch. Yan looked at him
proudly. His old Grandad was as good as anyone, any day!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sh!
Sh! Show’s going to begin!’ said somebody, when they saw the curtain twitching.
At once the talking and shuffling stopped, and all eyes turned to the stage. A
faded, rather torn blue curtain was drawn across.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
came a chord from a fiddle behind the scenes, and then a gay tune sounded out.
The curtain was drawn back slowly, halting on its rings here and there, and the
audience gave a long sigh of delight. They had seen the Barnies many times but
they never tired of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
the Barnies were on the stage, and the fiddler fiddled away as they struck up a
rousing song with a chorus that all the villagers joined in most heartily. Old
Grandad beat time, banging his crook on the floor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everything
was applauded heartily. Then someone called out loudly. ‘Where’s old Clopper?
Where be he?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
old Clopper the horse came shyly on, looking out of the sides of his eyes at
the audience, and being so very bashful that old Grandad almost fell off his
chair with laughing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
fiddle struck up again and Clopper marched in time to it. It grew quicker, and
he ran. It grew quicker still and he galloped, and fell right off the stage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!’
roared someone. ‘HOO-HOO-HOO-HOO!’ It was such an enormous guffaw that everyone
turned round. It came from Mr Penruthlan, who was writhing and wriggling in his
seat as if he was in great pain. But he was only laughing at Clopper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Clopper
heard the giant of a laugh and put a hoof behind one ear to listen to it.
Grandad promptly fell off his seat with joy. Clopper caught his back legs in
his front legs and fell over too. There was such a pandemonium of screams and
guffaws and yells from the delighted audience that it was surprising the roof
didn’t fall in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Off
now,’ said a firm voice at the side of the stage. Julian looked to see who it
was, as Clopper obediently turned to shuffle off, waving one back leg to the
admiring villagers. The voice came from the Guv’nor who was standing where he
could watch the whole show in detail. His face was still unsmiling, even after
Clopper’s antics!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
show was a great success, although it could not have been simpler. The jokes
were old, the play acted was even older, the singing was a bit flat, and the
dancing not as good as the third form of a girls’ school, but it was so merry
and smiling and idiotic and good-natured that it went with a terrific swing
from start to finish.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
for Clopper, it was his evening! Every time his head so much as looked in on
the stage, the audience rocked with joy. They would, in fact, have been
delighted to have had one actor only, all the evening, and that actor, Clopper,
of course. Julian and Dick watched him, fascinated. How they both longed to try
on those back and front legs, and put on the head, and do a little ‘cloppering’
themselves!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sid
and Binks are awfully good, aren’t they?’ said Dick. ‘Gosh, I wish we could get
hold of legs and a head and do that act at the Christmas school concert, Ju!
We’d bring the house down. Let’s ask Sid if we can have a shot some time.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
won’t lend us the head,’ said Julian. ‘Still, we could do without that, and
just try the legs. I bet we could think of some funny things to do, Dick!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everybody
was sad when the curtain went across the stage, and the show was over. The
fiddle struck up ‘God Save the Queen’, and everyone rose loyally to stand and sing
every word lustily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Three
cheers for the Barnies!’ yelled a child, and the hip-hurrahing rose to the
rafters. Grandad waved his crook too vigorously and hit a very large farmer on
the back of his neck.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now,
old Grandad!’ said the farmer, rubbing his neck, ‘you trying to pick a fight
with me? No, no, I’d be afeared to take you on, I would. You’d get me by my
hind leg with that crook like you do your sheep, and down I’d go!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Grandad
was delighted. He hadn’t had such an evening for forty years! Maybe fifty. And
now for that supper. That was what he had really come for. He’d show some of
these sixty-year-old youngsters how to eat!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
villagers went home, talking and laughing. Two or three of the women stayed on
to help. The Barnies didn’t bother to change out of their acting clothes, but
came into the kitchen as they were, grease-paint running down their cheeks in
the heat. The barn had got very hot with so many people packed in close
together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children were simply delighted with everything. They had laughed so much at
Clopper that they felt quite weak. The play had amused them too, with its
sighings and groanings and threats and tears and stridings around. Now they
were more than ready for their supper!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Barnies crowded round the loaded table, cracking jokes, complimenting Mrs
Penruthlan, smacking everyone on the back, and generally behaving like a lot of
school children out for a treat. Julian looked round at them all. What a jolly
lot! He looked for the Guv’nor, surely for once in a way he too would be
smiling and cheerful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
he wasn’t there. Julian looked and looked again. No, he certainly wasn’t there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
the Guv’nor?’ he asked Sid, who was sitting next to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
Guv’nor? Oh, he’s sitting in solitary state in the barn,’ said Sid, attacking
an enormous slice of meat-pie laced with hard-boiled eggs. ‘He never feeds with
us, not even after a show. Keeps himself to himself, he does! He’ll be having a
whacking great tray of food all on his own. Suits me all right! I never did get
on with the Guv’nor.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
Clopper - the horse’s head, I mean?’ asked Julian. He couldn’t see it beside
Sid anywhere. ‘Is it under the table?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
The Guv’nor’s got it tonight. Said he wasn’t going to have it rolled about
under the table, or have jelly or gravy dropped all over it,’ said Sid, taking
six large pickled onions. ‘My, Mrs Penruthlan is a wonder! Why don’t I marry
someone like her, instead of getting thinner and thinner inside Clopper’s
back-legs?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
laughed. He wondered who was going to take the Guv’nor’s tray into the barn. He
noticed that Mrs Penruthlan was getting one ready, and he went over to her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
that for the Guv’nor?’ he asked. ‘Shall I take it for you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
thank you, Julian,’ said the busy farmer’s wife, gratefully. ‘Here it is, and
ask Dick to carry in a bottle and a glass for him, will you? There’s no more
room on the tray.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
Julian and Dick together went out to the barn with the food and drink. The wind
still blew strongly and rain was beginning to fall again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
no one here,’ said Julian, looking round. He set down the tray, puzzled. Then
he saw a note pinned on the curtain. He went to read it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Back
in an hour,’ he read. ‘Gone for a walk. The Guv’nor.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
well, we’ll leave the tray then,’ said Julian. He and Dick were just turning to
go when they caught sight of something, the back and front legs of Clopper the
horse! They stopped, each with the same thought in his mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Everyone
at supper! The Guv’nor gone for an hour. Nobody would know if we tried on the
legs!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
looked at one another, and read each other’s mind. ‘Let’s have a go at being
Clopper!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on, quick,’ said Julian. ‘You be the back legs and I’ll be the front ones.
Quick!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
got into them hurriedly, and Julian managed to do up most of the zip. But it
wasn’t right without the head. Had the Guv’nor taken it with him? Surely not.”
It would be quite safe in the barn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
it is, on that chair under the shawl!’ said Dick, and they galloped over to get
it. Julian picked it up. It was rather heavier than he had imagined. He looked
inside it to see how far his head went in it, wondering how to work the eyes
and mouth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
put his hand inside, and scrabbled about. A lid fell open in the side of the
neck, and out came some cigarettes, scattering over the floor. ‘Blow!’ said
Julian, ‘I didn’t know Mr Binks kept his cigarettes in Clopper. Pick them up,
Dick, and I’ll put them back. Thanks.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
put the cigarettes back in the little space, and shut the lid on them. Then he
put the head carefully over his own, It felt extremely strange.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
are eye-holes in the neck,’ he said to Dick. ‘That’s how Mr Binks knew where he
was going. I kept wondering why he didn’t bump into things more than he did!
Now - I’m ready. The head seems to be on firmly. I’ll count - one-two, one-two
- and we’ll walk in time. Don’t let’s start any funny tricks till we’re used to
Clopper. Does my voice sound funny inside the neck?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Most
peculiar,’ said Dick, who was now bending over so that his back made the horse’s
back, and his arms were round Julian’s waist. ‘I say, what’s that?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Someone’s
coming, it’s the Guv’nor coming back!’ said Julian in alarm. ‘Quick, gallop out
of the door before we’re caught.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
so, to the Guv’nor’s enormous surprise Clopper galloped very clumsily out of
the barn door just as he was coming in, almost knocking him over. At first he
didn’t realize it was Clopper, then he let out a loud roar and gave chase.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can’t see,’ panted poor Julian. ‘Where am I going? Oh thank goodness, it’s an empty
stable! Quick, let’s un-zip ourselves, and you’ll have to take this head off
for me, I can’t manage it myself.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
alas and alack! The zip got stuck and wouldn’t come undone. The boys tugged and
pulled but it wasn’t a bit of good. It looked as if they had got to be Clopper
for the rest of the evening!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Blow
this zip!’ said Julian, desperately. ‘It’s got absolutely stuck! It’s so
dificult for us to undo it from the inside of the beastly horse. Oh, this head.
I must get it off.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
pushed at the head but somehow or other it had got wedged on him, and Julian
felt that short of pulling his own head off he would certainly never get
Clopper’s off!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
horse sat down, exhausted, looking a very peculiar shape. Julian leaned the
head against the wall of the stable and panted. ‘I’m so hot,’ he complained.
‘Dick, for goodness sake think of something. We’ll have to get help. But I
daren’t go back to the barn because of the Guv’nor, and we really can’t appear
in the kitchen like this. Everyone would have a fit, and Sid and Mr Binks would
be furious with us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think we were asses to try this,’ said Dick, pulling viciously at the zip
again. ‘Ugh! What use are zips, I’d like to know. I feel most uncomfortable.
Can’t you get in some other position, Ju ? I seem to be standing'‘ on my head
or something.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
go and scout round the kitchen,’ said Julian trying to get up. Dick tried to
get up too, but they both fell down on top of one another. They tried again and
this time stood up rather shakily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
not as easy as it looks, is it, to be a two-man horse,’ said Julian. ‘I wish I
could get these eye holes in the right place. I’m absolutely blind!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>However,
he managed to adjust them at last, and the two boys made their way cautiously
and clumsily out of the stable. They went carefully over the farm-yard, Julian
counting one-two, one-two, under his breath so that they walked in time with
one another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came to the kitchen door and debated whether to try and catch someone’s
attention without going in. There was a fairly large window near by, open
because of the warmth of the kitchen. Julian decided to take a look through to
see if George or Anne were anywhere near. If so, he could call them outside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
he reckoned without the clumsiness of the big head! It knocked against the
window-frame, and everyone looked up. There were shrieks at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
horse! Farmer Penruthlan, one of your horses is loose!’ cried a villager who
was helping with the supper. ‘He looked in at the window!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
farmer went out at once. Julian and Dick backed hurriedly away and trotted in
very good style over the farm-yard. Where now? The farmer saw their moving
figure in the darkness and went after them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Trot-trot-trot
went the horse desperately then gallop-gallop-gallop! But that finished them,
because the back and front legs didn’t gallop together, got entangled and down
went the horse! The farmer ran up in alarm, thinking that his horse had fallen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Take
your knee out of my mouth,’ mumbled an angry voice, and the farmer stopped
suddenly, astounded to hear a human voice coming from the horse. Then he
realized what was happening - it was the stage horse with two people in it!
Who? It sounded like Julian and Dick. He gave the horse a gentle kick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t,’
said Dick’s voice. ‘For goodness’ sake whoever it is, un-zip us! We’re
suffocating!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
farmer let out a terrific guffaw, bent down and felt for the zip. One good pull
and the horse’s canvas skin came in half as the zip was undone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys clambered out thankfully. ‘Oh - er - thanks awfully, Mr Penruthlan,’ said
Julian, rather embarrassed. ‘We - er - we were just having a canter round.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr
Penruthlan gave another hearty roar and went off towards the kitchen to finish
his meal. Dick and Julian felt very thankful. They carried the legs and head of
the horse cautiously towards the barn. They peeped in at a window. The Guv’nor
was there, striding up and down, looking extremely angry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
waited till he was at the far end of the barn, and then hurriedly pushed the
legs and head in at the door, as quietly as he could. When the Guv’nor turned
round to stride angrily back the first thing he saw was the bundle that was
Clopper! He raced over to it at once, and looked out of the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Julian and Dick had gone. They could own up the next day when things were not
quite so exciting! They slid quietly into the kitchen, feeling hot and untidy,
hoping that nobody would notice them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
and Anne saw them at once. George came over. ‘What have you been doing? You’ve
been ages and ages. Do you want any more to eat before everything is finished
up?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Tell
you everything afterwards,’ said Julian. ‘Yes, we do want something to eat.
I’ve hardly had a thing yet. I’m starving!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr
Penruthlan was back in his place eating again. He pointed with his knife at the
boys sliding into their seats. ‘Ock-ock-oo,’ he said, beginning to laugh, and
added a few more equally puzzling words.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
they’ve been to help you catch the horse that peeped in at the window, have
they?’ said Mrs Penruthlan, nodding. ‘Which horse was it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Clopper!’
said the farmer, quite clearly, and gave a loud guffaw again. Nobody understood
what he meant, so nothing more was said. George and Anne guessed, though, and
grinned at the two boys.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was a wonderful evening altogether, and everyone was sorry that it had to come
to an end. The village women and the two girls stacked the dirty dishes and
plates and the boys carried them to the sink to be washed. The Barnies gave a
hand where they could, and the big kitchen was full of chatter and laughter. It
was very pleasant indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
at last the kitchen was empty again, and the big lamp turned out. The village
women went home, the Barnies departed. Old Grandad took Yan’s hand and went
back to his sheep, saying dolefully that he’d ‘et a mort too much and wouldn’t
be able to sleep a wink, so he wouldn’t.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Never
mind. It was worth it, Grandad,’ said Mrs Penruthlan, and shut and locked the
kitchen door. She looked round, tired but happy. There was nothing she liked
better than to spend hours upon hours preparing delicious dishes for people and
then see them eaten in no time at all! The children thought she was truly
wonderful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were soon all in bed and asleep. The Penruthlans were asleep, too. Only the
kitchen cat was awake, watching for mice in the kitchen. She didn’t like a
crowd. She liked the kitchen to herself!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Next
day was fair and warm, though a stiff breeze still blew. Mrs Penruthlan spoke
to the four children at breakfast-time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
be busy today cleaning up the mess. How would you like to take a picnic lunch
of some of the remains of the supper and stay out all day? It’s a nice day, and
you’ll enjoy it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nothing
could be better! Julian had already planned to make his way to the old tower
once used by the Wreckers, and explore it. Now they would have all day to do it
in!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
yes, Mrs Penruthlan, we’d love to do that,’ he said. ‘Let the girls get the
picnic stuff ready for us. You’ve plenty to do!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
no, Mrs Penruthlan wouldn’t let anyone deal with food but herself. She
proceeded to pack up enough food for twelve people, or so Julian thought when
he saw her preparations!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
set off together happily, with Timmy at their heels. The four farm dogs
accompanied them for some way, tearing on in front and then tearing back trying
to make Timmy as mad as they were. But Timmy was sedate, walking along as if to
say, ‘I’m taking these children for a walk, I’ve no time to play with you.
You’re only farm dogs!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
we want Yan with us if he turns up?’ asked George. ‘Do we particularly want him
to know what we are doing today?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
considered. ‘No, I don’t think we do want him with us. We may find out
something we don’t want him to know, or to spread around.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said George. ‘Well, just you send him off, then, if he comes. I’m fed up with
him. Thank goodness he’s a bit cleaner than he was!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yan
did appear, of course. He came up silently on his bare feet. Nobody would have
known he was trotting behind if it hadn’t been for Timmy. Timmy quite happily
left George’s heels and went to say how-do-you-do to Yan, jumping up at him in
delight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
turned round to see where Timmy was, and saw Yan. ‘Julian, there’s Yan!’ she
said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo,
Yan,’ said Julian. ‘Buzz off today. We’re going somewhere alone.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
come too,’ said Yan, strutting along behind. He still looked fairly clean.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
you don’t come too,’ said Julian. ‘You buzz off. See? Off you go. We don’t want
you today.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yan’s
face took on a sullen look. He turned to Anne. ‘I come too?’ he said,
pleadingly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
shook her head. ‘No, not today,’ she said. ‘Another time. Take this sweet, Yan,
and go away.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yan
took the sweet and turned away, his face sulky. He disappeared over the field
and was soon lost to sight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four children and Timmy went on together, glad of their warm jerseys when the
wind blew strongly. Julian gave a sudden groan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
shall be jolly glad when we’ve had our lunch,’ he said. ‘This bag of food is so
heavy it’s cutting into my shoulders.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
let’s wait till we get to the tower and we can put the bags down,’ said Dick.
‘We’ll do a little exploring before we have our lunch. I should think Mrs
Penruthlan meant us to stay out to dinner, tea and supper, the amount she’s
packed for us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
hoped they were going in the right direction. They had looked at a map, and
found various lanes which they thought would eventually lead to the tower, and
had worked out which was the best direction to take.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
had his compass and was going by that, leading them down lanes, across fields,
along little paths, and sometimes along no paths at all! He felt sure, however,
that they were going right. They were making for the coast, anyway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look,
there are two hills side by side, or cliffs, are they?’ said Anne, pointing. ‘I
believe they are the hills between which we saw that tower.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
you’re right,’ said Dick. ‘We’re nearly there. I wonder how people got there
when the tower and the house were lived in. There appears to be no proper road
at all.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
walked on, over a rough field. They soon found themselves in a very narrow,
overgrown lane, deep-set between hedges that almost met overhead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
green tunnel,’ said Anne, pleased. ‘Look out for those enormous nettles, Ju.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
the end of the lane an overgrown path swung sharply right, and there, not far
from them, was the tower! They stood and stared at it. This was where the light
had flashed a hundred years ago to bring ships to their doom, and where the
light had flashed only the other night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
tower’s falling into ruin,’ said Dick. ‘Large pieces have dropped out of it.
And I should think the house is in ruin, too, though we can’t see enough of it
at the moment, just a bit of the roof. Come on. This is going to be fun!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
tower didn’t look the frightening thing it had seemed on the stormy night when
the boys saw the flashing light. It just looked a poor old ruin. They made
their way to it through high thistles, nettles and willow-herb.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Doesn’t
look as if anyone has been here for years,’ said Julian, rather puzzled. ‘I rather
wish we’d brought a scythe to cut down these enormous weeds! We can hardly get
through them. I’m stung all over with nettles, too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came to the house at last, and a poor, tumbledown ruin it was! The doors had
fallen in, the windows were out of shape, and had no glass, the roof was full
of holes. An enormous climbing rose rambled everywhere, throwing masses of
old-fashioned white roses over walls and roof to hide the ugliness of the ruin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Only
the tower seemed still strong, except at the top, where parts of the wall had
crumbled away and fallen. Julian forced his way through the broken doorway into
the house. Weeds grew in the floor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
a stone stairway going up the tower!’ he called. ‘And I say, look here! What’s
this on each stair?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oil,’
said George. ‘Someone’s been carrying oil up in a can, or a lamp, and has spilt
it. Julian, we’d better be careful. That somebody may be here still!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>IN
THE WRECKERS’ TOWER<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
and Anne came hurriedly up to the old stone stairway when they heard what
Julian and Georgie had said. Oil! That could only mean one thing, a lamp in the
tower.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all stood and looked at the big splashes of oil on each step.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on up,’ said Julian at last. ‘I’ll go first. Be careful how you go because the
tower’s in a very crumbly state.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
tower was built at one end of the old house, and its walls were thicker than
the house walls. The only entry to it was by a doorway inside the house. In the
tower was a stone stairway that went very steeply up in a spiral.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
must once have been the door of the tower,’ said Dick, kicking at a great thick
slab of wood that lay mouldering away beside the stone doorway. ‘The tower
doesn’t seem to hold anything but this stone stairway, just a look-out, I
suppose.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Or
a place for signalling to ships to entice them on the rocks,’ said George. ‘Oh,
Timmy, don’t push past like that; you nearly made me fall, these stone steps
are so steep.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
Dick said, the tower seemed to hold nothing but a stairway spiralling up
steeply. Julian came to the top first and gave a gasp. The view over the sea
was astonishing. He could see for miles over the dark cornflower-blue waters.
Near the coast the churning of the waves into white breakers and spray showed
the hidden rocks that waited for unwary ships.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
came up beside him and stared in wonder, too. What a marvellous sight, blue
sky, blue sea, waves pounding over the rocks, and white gulls soaring on the
stiff breeze.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
Dick came up, and Julian gave him a warning. ‘Be careful. Don’t lean on the
walls at all, they’re crumbling badly.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
put out his hand and touched the top of the tower wall near him. It crumbled
and bits fell away below.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Big
pieces had fallen away here and there, leaving great gaps in the wall round the
top of the tower. When Anne came up also, Julian took her arm, afraid that with
such a crowd up there someone might stumble against a crumbling wall and fall
from the tower.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
had hold of Timmy’s collar and made him stand quite still. ‘Don’t you go
putting your great paws up on the wall,’ she warned him. ‘You’ll find yourself
down in the nettles below in no time if you do!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
can quite well see what a wonderful place this is for flashing a light at night
over the sea,’ said Dick. ‘It could be seen for miles. In the old days, when
sailing ships got caught in the storms that rage round this coast at times,
they would be thankful to see a guiding light.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
what a light!’ said Julian. ‘A light that guided them straight on to those
great rocks! Let me see now. Are those the rocks near those coves we went to
the other day?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
I think so,’ said Dick. ‘But there are rocks and rocks, and caves and coves
round here. It’s difficult to tell if they are the same ones we saw.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
ships that sailed towards the light must have been wrecked on the rocks down
there,’ said Julian, pointing. ‘How did the wreckers get there? There must have
been a path from here somewhere.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
Wreckers’ Way, do you think?’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
considered. ‘Well, I don’t know. I imagine that the Wreckers’ Way must have
been a way leading to the sea from inland somewhere, certainly a way that was
convenient for the villagers to use. No, I’ll tell you what I think happened!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What?’
said everyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think, on a stormy night long ago, the people who lived here in this house went
up into the tower and flashed their false light to any ship that was sailing
out on the waters. Then, in great excitement, they watched it sailing nearer
and nearer, perhaps shown up by lightning, perhaps by the moon.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
imagined such a ship, and George shivered. Poor wretched ship!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘When
the ship reached the rocks and crashed on them, the signallers in the tower
gave a different signal, a signal to a watcher up there on the hills,’ said
Julian, pointing behind him. ‘A watcher who was standing on the only spot from
which the flash could be seen! Maybe the light gleamed steadily to entice a
ship in, but was flashed in code to the watcher on the hills, and the flashing
said, “Ship on rocks. Tell the others, and come to the feast!” ’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
simply horrible!’ said Anne. ‘I can’t believe it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
is difficult to think anyone could be so heartless,’ said Julian. ‘But I think
that’s what happened. And then, I think, the people who lived in this house went
down from here to the near-by coves and waited for their friends to come along
the other way, the Wreckers’ Way, wherever that is.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
must be a secret way,’ said Dick. ‘It must have been a way known only to those
villagers who were wreckers. After all, wrecking was against the law, and so
this whole business of showing lights and wrecking ships must have been kept a
dead secret. We heard what old Grandad said, that every wrecker who knew the
way had to vow he would tell no one else.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Old
Grandad’s father probably lived in this very house, and climbed the stone
stairway on a wild night, and lighted the lamp that shone out over the stormy
sea,’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
why Yan said he was “frit” of this tower,’ said George. ‘He thinks his
Grandad’s dad still lights it! Well, we know better. Somebody else lights it,
somebody who can’t be up to any good either!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And,
don’t let’s forget, somebody who may still be about somewhere!’ said Julian,
lowering his voice suddenly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh!
yes,’ said Dick, looking round the little tower as if he expected to see a
stranger there, listening. ‘I wonder where he keeps his lamp. It’s not here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
oil splashes are on almost every one of the stone steps,’ said Anne. ‘I noticed
as I came up. I bet it’s a big lamp. It has to give a light far out to sea!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look,
it must have been stood on this bit of the wall,’ said Dick. ‘There are some
oily patches here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all looked at the dark patches. Dick bent down and smelt them. ‘Yes, paraffin
oil,’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was looking at the wall on the other side of the tower. She called to the other
three.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
here’s a patch on this side!’ she said. ‘I know what happened! Once a ship had
been caught by the light and was on its way in, the men with the lamp put it on
the other side of the tower to signal to the watcher on the hills, to tell him
the ship was caught!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
That’s it,’ said Anne. ‘But who could it be? I’m sure nobody lives here, the
place is an absolute ruin, open to the wind and the rain. It must be somebody
who knows the way here, sees to the light, and does the signalling.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a pause. Dick looked at Julian. The same thought came into their minds.
They had seen somebody wandering out in the stormy night, twice!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Could
it be Mr Penruthlan, do you suppose?’ said Dick. ‘We couldn’t imagine why he
was out here in the storm the first night we came out to watch for the light.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
he’s not the man with the light, he’s the watcher on the hills!’ said Julian.
‘That’s it! That’s why he goes out on wild nights, to see if there’s a signal
from the tower, flashing to say that a ship is coming in!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was an even longer pause. Nobody liked that idea at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
know he tells lies, we know he goes through people’s pockets, because we saw
him,’ went on Julian after a few moments. ‘He fits in well, He’s the man who
goes and stands in that special spot on the hills and watches for a light!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
does he do after that?’ said Anne. ‘Didn’t we hear that there were no wrecks
here now, because of the lighthouse higher up the coast? What’s the point of it
all, if there isn’t a wreck?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Smuggling,’
said Julian shortly. ‘That’s the point. Probably by motor-boat. They choose a
wild night of storm and wind, when they will be neither seen nor heard, wait
out at sea for the signalling light to show them all’s clear, and then come in
to one of these coves.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
and I bet the Wreckers’ secret way is used by someone who steals down to the
cove and takes the smuggled goods!’ said Dick, excited. ‘Three or four people,
perhaps, if the goods are heavy. Gosh! I’m sure we’re right.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
it’s the watcher on the hill who tells his friends, and down they go to the
coves together. It’s most ingenious,’ Julian said. ‘Nobody sees the light on
the tower except the boat waiting, and nobody sees the signal inland except the
one watcher on the hills. Absolutely fool-proof.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
are lucky to stumble on it,’ said Dick. ‘But what puzzles me is this. I’m
pretty certain that the man who lights the lamp didn’t come the way we came -
we’d have seen trodden-down weeds or something. We should certainly have found
some sort of a path his feet had made.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
And there wasn’t anything, not even a broken thistle,’ said Anne. ‘There must
be some other way into this old house.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course there is! We’ve already said there must be a way for the man who lights
the lamp to get down to the coves from here!’ said George. ‘Well, that’s the
way he gets here, of course. He comes up the passage from the cove. How stupid
we are!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
idea excited them all. Where was the passage? Nobody could imagine! It
certainly wasn’t in the tower, there was no room for anything in that small
tower except for the spiral staircase leading to the top.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
go down,’ said Anne, and began to descend the steps. A slight noise below made
her stop. ‘Go on,’ said George, who was just behind her. Anne turned a scared
face to her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
heard a noise down there,’ she whispered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
turned to Julian immediately. ‘Anne thinks there’s somebody down there,’ she
said, in a low voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
back, Anne,’ ordered Julian at once. Anne climbed back, still looking scared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Would
it be the man who does the lamp?’ she whispered. ‘Do be careful, Julian. He
can’t be a nice man!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nice!
He must be a beast!’ said George, scornfully. ‘Are you going down, Ju? Look
out, then.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
peered down the stone steps. There was really nothing for it but to go down and
see who was there. They couldn’t possibly stay up in the tower all day long,
hoping that whoever it was would go away!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
sort of noise did you hear?’ Julian asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
a sort of scuffling noise,’ said Anne. ‘It might have been a rat, of course, or
a rabbit. It was just a noise, that’s all. Something’s down there, or
somebody!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
sit down for a moment or two and wait,’ said Dick. ‘We’ll listen hard and see
if we can hear anyone.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
they sat down cautiously, George with her hand on Timmy’s collar. They waited
and they listened. They heard the wind blowing round the old tower. They heard
the distant gulls calling, ‘ee-oo, ee-oo, ee-oo’. They heard the thistles
rustling their prickles together down below.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But.they
heard nothing from the kitchen at the foot of the tower. Julian looked at Anne.
‘No sound to be heard now,’ he said. ‘It must have been a rabbit!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Perhaps
it was,’ said Anne, feeling rather foolish. ‘What shall we do then? Go down?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I’ll go first though, with Timmy,’ said Julian. ‘If anyone is lying in wait
he’ll be annoyed to see our Timmy. And Timmy will be even more annoyed to see
him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Just
as Julian was getting up, a noise was quite distinctly heard from below. It
was, as Anne had described, a kind of scuffle, then silence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
here goes!’ said Julian, and began to descend the steps. The others watched
breathlessly. Timmy went with Julian, trying to press past him. He hadn’t
seemed worried about the noise at all! So perhaps it was only a rat or rabbit!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
went down slowly. Who was he going to find - an enemy, or a friend? Careful
now, Julian, there may be somebody lying in wait!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
paused on the last step of the spiral staircase and listened. Not a sound came
from the near-by room. ‘Who’s there?’ said Julian, sharply. ‘I know you’re
there! I heard you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Still
not a sound! The kitchen, overgrown with weeds and dark with ivy and the white
rambling rose, seemed to be listening to him, but there was no answer!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
stepped right into the room and looked round. Nothing was there - nobody was
there! The place was absolutely empty and quiet. Julian went through a doorway
into another room. That was empty, too. The old house only had four rooms
altogether, two of them very tiny, and every one of them was empty. Timmy
didn’t seem disturbed at all, either, nor did he bark as he certainly would
have done if there had been any intruder there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
Timmy, it’s a false alarm,’ said Julian, relieved. ‘Must have been a rabbit, or
even a bit of wall crumbling and falling. What are you sniffing at there?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was sniffing with interest at a corner near the doorway. He stood and looked at
Julian as if he would like to tell him something. Julian went over to see what
it was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was nothing there except for some rather flattened weeds, growing through the
floor. Julian couldn’t think why Timmy should be interested. However, Timmy
soon wandered away and went all round the place, wondering why they had come to
such a peculiar house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dick!
Bring the girls down!’ shouted Julian up the stone stairway. ‘There doesn’t
seem to be anyone here, after all. It must have been some small animal that
Anne heard.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others clattered down in relief. ‘I’m sorry I gave you all a shock,’ said Anne.
‘But it did sound like somebody down there! However, I’m sure Timmy would have
barked if so! He didn’t seem at all disturbed.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
I think we can safely say that it was a false alarm,’ said Dick. ‘What do we do
next? Have our lunch? Or hunt about to see if we can find the entrance to the
passage that leads from here down to the coves?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
looked at his watch. ‘It’s not really time for lunch yet, unless you’re all
frightfully hungry,’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I’m beginning to feel jolly hungry,’ said Dick. ‘But, on the other hand, I feel
I can’t wait to find that passage! Where on earth is the entrance?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
been in all four rooms,’ said Julian. ‘None of them seems to have anything but
weeds in, no old door leading out of the walls, no trapdoor. It’s a puzzle.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we’ll all have a jolly good hunt,’ said George. ‘This is the sort of thing I
like. Timmy, you hunt, too!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
began to explore the four rooms of the old house. As weeds grew more or less
all over the floor they felt that there could be no trapdoor. If there had
been, and the man with the lamp used it, the weeds would surely have shown
signs of it. But they grew quite undisturbed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Listen,’
said Julian at last. ‘I’ve got an idea. We’ll make Timmy find the entrance.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How?’
said George at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we’ll make him smell the oil drips on the steps, and follow with his nose any
others that have dripped in the weeds,’ said Julian. ‘I don’t suppose the lamp
dripped only on the steps. It must have dripped all the way from the passage
entrance, wherever it is, to the top of the tower. Couldn’t Timmy sniff them
out? They would lead us to the entrance we’re trying to find!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right. But I’m beginning to believe there is no entrance,’ said George, getting
hold of Timmy’s collar. ‘We’ve looked over every single inch of this house.
Come on, Tim, you’ve got to perform a miracle!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy’s
nose was firmly placed over the oil-drip on the bottom stair. ‘Sniff it, Timmy,
and follow,’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
knew perfectly well what she meant. George had trained him well! He sniffed
hard at the oil and then started up the stone steps for the next oil patch. But
George pulled him back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
Tim. Not that way. This way. There must be other oil drips on the floor of the
house.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
amiably turned the other way. He found an oil drip at once, on a patch of weeds
growing on the floor. He sniffed it and went on to another and another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
old Timmy,’ said George, delighted. ‘Isn’t he clever, Ju? He’s following where
the man walked when he carried that lamp! Go on, Timmy, where’s the next drip?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was an easy, strong-smelling trail for Timmy to follow! He followed it, sniffing,
out of one room into another, smaller one. Then into a third, bigger one, which
must have been the main room, for it had a very big fire-place. Timmy went
straight to the fireplace, his nose to the ground. In fact, he went right into
the hearth, and there came to a stop. He looked round at George and barked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
says the trail ends here,’ said George, in excitement. ‘So the entrance to the
secret passage must be in this big fire-place!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others crowded to the hearth. Julian produced his torch and shone it up the
chimney. It was an enormous one, though part of the top of it had now fallen
away. ‘Nothing there,’ said Julian. ‘But - hallo - what’s this?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
now shone his torch to the side of the big fireplace and saw a small, dark
cavity there, barely big enough for a man to get into. ‘Look!’ he said,
excited, ‘I believe we’ve found it. See that small hole? Well, I bet if we
crawl through that we’ll find it’s the way to the secret passage! Good old
Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
shall get absolutely filthy,’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
would say that!’ said George, scornfully. ‘Who cares? This may be very
important, mayn’t it, Ju?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Rather!’
said Julian. ‘If we’re on to what we think we are, and that’s Smuggling with a
big S, it is important. Well, what about it? Lunch first, or exploring that
hole?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Exploring,
of course,’ said Dick. ‘What about letting old Tim go first? I’ll give him a
leg-up.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was hoisted up to the black hole, and disappeared into it with delight.
Rabbits? Rats? What were the children after? This was a fine game!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
I’ll go,’ said Julian, and clambered up. ‘It’s a bit difficult to squeeze into.
Dick, you help Anne and George up next, and then you come.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
disappeared, and one by one the others also hoisted themselves to the hole and
crawled in, too. Anne wished she had shorts on, like George. Even a short skirt
was a nuisance in performances of this kind!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
hole was merely an entrance to a narrow standing-place at the side of the
chimney. Julian got down from the hole, and stood still for a moment, wondering
if this was just an old hiding-place, and not an entrance to anywhere, after
all. But then, just to the right of his feet, he saw another hole that dropped
sharply downwards.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
flashed his torch down, and saw iron hand-grips at one side. He called back and
told the others. Then he descended into the hole, at first using the grips for
his feet and then for his hands as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
hole went down as straight as a well. It came to a sudden end, and Julian found
himself standing on solid ground. He turned round, flashing his torch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was the passage, in front of him! It must be the one that led down to the
coves, the one that the man with the lamp must have used long ago, when he went
to gloat over the groaning ships on the rocks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
could hear the others coming down the shaft. He suddenly thought of Timmy.
Where was he? He must have fallen headlong down the hole and found himself
suddenly at the bottom. Poor Tim! Julian hoped he hadn’t hurt himself, but as
he hadn’t yelped, perhaps he had fallen like a cat, on his feet!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
called up to the others. ‘I’ve found the passage. It starts at the bottom of
the shaft. I’ll go along it a little way and wait for you all to come. Then we
can keep together in a line.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
everyone was safely down the shaft. George began to worry about Timmy. ‘He must
have hurt himself, Ju! Falling all that way; Oh, dear, where is he?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
soon come across him, I expect,’ said Julian. ‘Now, keep close together,
everybody. The path goes downwards pretty steeply, as you might expect.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
certainly did. In places the four children almost slithered along. Then Julian
discovered iron staples fixed here and there in the steepest places, and after
that they held on to them in the most slippery spots.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘These
iron staples would be jolly useful to anyone coming up,’ said Julian. ‘It would
be almost impossible to climb up this passage without something to help the
climber to pull himself up. Ah, here’s a more level stretch.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
level part soon became much wider. And then, quite suddenly, it became a cave!
The four came out into it in surprise. It was rather low-roofed, and the walls
were made of black rock, that glistened in the light of the torch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wish I could find Timmy,’ said George, uneasily. ‘I can’t even hear him
anywhere!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
go on till we come to the cove,’ said Julian. ‘This must lead us right down to
the shore, probably to the very cove where the ships were wrecked. Look, there’s
a kind of rocky arch leading out of this cave.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went through the archway and into yet another passage that wound between
jutting rocks, which made it rather dificult to get through at times. Then
suddenly the passage divided into two. One fork went meandering off towards the
seaward side, the other into the cliff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Better
take the seaward side,’ said Julian. They were just going to take the
right-hand passage when George stopped and clutched at Julian. ‘Listen!’ she
said.‘I can hear Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all stopped and listened. George had the sharpest ears of the lot, and she
could hear him barking. So could the others after a few moments.
Bark-bark-bark! Bark-bark-bark! Yes, it was Timmy all right!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy!’
yelled George, making the others jump almost out of their skins. ‘TIMMY!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
can’t hear you all this way away,’ said Dick. ‘Gosh, you made me jump. Come on,
we’ll have to take the cliff passage. Timmy’s barking comes from that
direction, not this.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
I agree,’ said Julian. ‘We’ll go and collect him, and then come back and take
the other passage. I’m sure it leads down to the sea.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
made their way along the left-hand passage. It was not difficult, because it
was much wider than the one they had already come down. Timmy’s barking became
louder and louder as they went down. George whistled piercingly, hoping that
Timmy would come rushing up. But he didn’t.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
funny that he doesn’t come,’ said George, worried. ‘I think he must be hurt.
TIMMY!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
passage wound round a corner, and then once more divided into two. To the
children’s surprise they saw a rough door set into the rocky wall of the
passage on the left-hand side. A door! How very extraordinary!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look,
a door!’ said Dick, amazed. ‘And a jolly stout one, too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy’s
behind it!’ said George. ‘He must have gone through it and it shut behind him.
Timmy! We’re here! We’re coming!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
pushed at the door, but it didn’t open. She saw that it was lightly latched,
and lifted the old iron latch. The door opened easily and all the four went
through into a curious cave beyond. It was more like a low-roofed room!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
flung himself at them as soon as they came through the door. He wasn’t hurt. He
was so pleased to see them that he barked the place down! ‘Woof! WOOOOOF!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
Timmy, how did you get here?’ said George, hugging him. ‘Did the door click

the boxes and crates and things!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
looked round the strange cave, and at that moment there was a soft click. Then
something slid smoothly into place. Julian leapt to the door and tried to open
it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick,
George and Anne looked at one another in dismay. Someone must have been lying
in wait for them, someone must have captured Timmy and shut him up. And now
they were captured, too!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
began to bark when Julian shouted. He ran to the door. Julian was hammering on
it and even kicking it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
voice came from the other side of the door, a drawling voice, sounding rather
amused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
came at an awkward time, that’s all, and you must remain where you are till tomorrow.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who
are you?’ said Julian fiercely. ‘How dare you lock us in like this!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
believe you have food and drink with you,’ said the voice. ‘I noticed the packs
on your backs, which I presume contain food. That is lucky for you! Now be
sensible. You must pay the penalty of being inquisitive!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
let us out!’ shouted Julian, enraged at the cool voice with its impertinent
tone. He kicked the door again out of temper, though he knew that it wasn’t the
slightest use!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no reply. Whoever it was outside the cave door had gone. Julian gave the
door one last furious kick and looked round at the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
fellow must have been watching us from somewhere. Probably followed us all the
way to the old house, and saw the packs on our backs then. It must have been he
that you heard down in the house when we were in the tower, Anne.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
barked again. He was still at the door. George called him. ‘Tim! It’s no use!
The door’s locked. Oh dear, why did we let you go into that hole first? If you
hadn’t run on ahead and somehow got yourself caught, you’d have been able to
protect us when those men lay in wait!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
what do we do now?’ said Anne, trying to sound brave.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
can we do?’ said George. ‘Nothing at all! Here we are, locked and bolted in a
cave inside the cliff, with nobody near except the fellow who locked us in. If
anybody’s got any good ideas I’d like to hear them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
do sound cross!’ said Anne. ‘I suppose there isn’t anything to do but wait till
we’re let out. I only hope that man remembers we’re here. Nobody else knows
where we are.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Horrid
thought!’ said Dick. ‘Still, I’ve no doubt that Mrs Penruthlan would raise the
alarm, and a search-party would set out to find us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
a hope they’d have!’ said George. ‘Even if they did trace us to the old tower,
they wouldn’t know the secret entrance to the passage!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
let’s look on the cheerful side,’ said Julian, undoing the pack from his back.
‘Let’s have some food.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everybody
cheered up at once. ‘I feel quite hungry,’ said Anne in surprise. ‘It must be
past our dinnertime now. Well, anyway, eating will be something to do!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had a very good meal and felt thankful that Mrs Penruthlan had packed up so
much food. If they were not going to be let out till the next day they would
need plenty to eat!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
examined the boxes and crates. Some were very old. All were empty. There was a
big seaman’s chest there, too, with ‘Abram Trelawny’ painted on it. They lifted
the lid. That was empty, too, save for one old brass button.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Abram
Trelawny,’ said Dick, looking at the name. ‘He must have been a sailor on one
of the ships that the Wreckers enticed to the rocks. This chest must have been
rolled up on the beach by the waves and brought up here. I dare say this cave
was the place where the man who owned that old house took his share of the
booty and hid it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
I think you’re right,’ said Julian. ‘That is why it has a door that can be
locked. The Wrecker probably stored quite a lot of valuable things here from
different wrecks, and didn’t want any other Wrecker to creep up from the cave
and take them. What a hateful lot they must have been! Well, there doesn’t seem
anything of real interest here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was very, very boring in the cave. The children used only one torch because
they were afraid that if they used the two they had brought they might exhaust
both batteries, and then have to be in the dark.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
examined the cave from top to bottom to see if there was any possible way of
escape. But there wasn’t. That was quite clear. The cave walls were made of
solid rock, and there wasn’t a hole anywhere through which to escape, big or
small!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
fellow said we’d come at an awkward time,’ said Julian, throwing himself down
on the ground. ‘Why? Are they expecting some smuggled goods tonight? They’ve
signalled out to sea twice already this week, as we know. Hasn’t the boat they
expected come along yet? If so, they must be expecting it tonight, and so we’ve
come at an awkward time!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
only we weren’t locked in this beastly cave!’ said George. ‘We might have spied
on them and seen what they were up to, and might even have been able to stop
them somehow, or get word to the police.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we can’t now,’ said Dick gloomily. ‘Timmy, you were an ass to get caught; you
really were.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
put his tail down and looked as gloomy as Dick. He didn’t like being in this
low-roofed cave. Why didn’t they open the door and go out? He went to the door
and whined, scraping at it with his feet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
good, Tim. It won’t open,’ said Anne. ‘I think he’s thirsty, George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was nothing for Timmy to drink except home-made lemonade, and he didn’t seem to
like that very much.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
waste it on him if he doesn’t like it,’ said Julian hastily. ‘We may be jolly
glad of it ourselves tomorrow.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
glanced at his watch. ‘Only half past two!’ he groaned. ‘Hours and hours to
wait. Let’s have a game of some sort, noughts and crosses would be better than
nothing.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
played noughts and crosses till they were sick of them. They played word-games
and guessing games. They had a light tea at five o’clock and began to wonder
what Mrs Penruthlan would think when they didn’t turn up that evening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
Mr Penruthlan is mixed up in this affair, and it’s pretty certain that he is,’
said Julian, ‘he’ll not be best pleased to be told to fetch the police to look
for us! It’s just the one night he won’t want the police about!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think you’re wrong,’ said George. ‘I think he’d be delighted to have the police
looking for lost children, and not poking their noses into his affairs
tonight!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hadn’t thought of that,’ said Julian. How slowly the time went by. They yawned,
talked, fell silent, argued and played with Timmy. Julian’s torch flickered out
and they took Dick’s instead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
thing we brought two torches!’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Half
past nine came and they all began to feel sleepy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
vote we try to go to sleep,’ said Dick, yawning hugely. ‘There’s a sandy spot
over there, softer to lie on than this rock. What about trying to sleep?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all thought it was a good idea and went to the sandy spot. It certainly was
better than the hard rock. They wriggled about in the sand and made dents for
their bodies to lie in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
still hard,’ complained George. ‘Oh, Timmy darling, don’t snuffle all round my
face. Lie down beside me and Anne and go to sleep, too!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
lay down on George’s legs. He put his nose on his paws and heaved a huge sigh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hope Timmy’s not going to do that all night,’ said Anne. ‘What a draught!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Although
they thought they couldn’t possibly go to sleep, they did. Timmy did, too,
though he kept one ear open and one eye ready to open. He was on guard! No one
could open that door or even come near it without Timmy hearing!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
about eleven o’clock Timmy opened one eye and cocked both ears. He listened, not
taking his head off George’s legs. He opened the other eye.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
he sat up and listened harder. George woke up when he moved and stretched out a
hand to Timmy. ‘Tim, lie down,’ she whispered. But Timmy didn’t. He gave a
small whine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
sat up, fully awake. Why was Timmy whining? Was there something going on
outside the door, men passing perhaps, on their way to the cove? Had the light
been flashing out to sea and had it brought in the boat the men were waiting
for?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
put her hand on Timmy’s collar. ‘What is it?’ she whispered, expecting Timmy to
growl when he next heard something. But he didn’t growl. He whined again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
he shook off George’s hand and went to the door. George switched on her torch,
puzzled. Timmy scraped at the door and whined again. But still he didn’t growl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ju!
I believe someone is at the door!’ called George, suddenly, in a low voice. ‘I
believe Timmy can hear a search-party or something. Wake up!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
awoke suddenly. George repeated her words again. ‘Timmy’s not growling. That
means it’s not our enemies he hears,’ she added. ‘He’d growl like anything at
the man who locked us in.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Be
quiet for a moment and listen,’ said Julian. ‘Let’s see if we can hear anything
ourselves. We haven’t got Timmy’s sharp ears, but we might be able to hear
something.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
sat absolutely still, listening. Then Julian nudged Dick. He had heard
something. ‘Quiet!’ he breathed. They listened again, hardly breathing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
heard a little scrabbling noise at the door. Then it stopped. George expected
Timmy to break out into a fusillade of barks at once, but he didn’t. He stood
there with his head on one side and his ears cocked. He gave an excited little
whine and suddenly scraped at the door again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Somebody
whispered outside the door, and Timmy whined and ran to George and then back to
the door again. Everyone was puzzled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
got up and went to the door himself, his feet making no sound. Yes, there was
most certainly somebody outside, two people, perhaps, whispering to one
another?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who’s
there?’ said Julian suddenly. ‘I can hear you outside. Who is it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was dead silence for a moment, and then a small familiar voice answered softly:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It’s
me. Yan.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yan!
Gosh! Is it really you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Iss.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was an amazed silence in the cave. Yan! Yan at this time of night outside the
door of the very cave they were locked in! Were they dreaming?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
went mad when he heard Yan speaking to Julian. He flung himself at the door, barking
and yelping. Julian put his hand on his collar. ‘Be quiet, idiot! You’ll spoil
everything! Be quiet!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
stopped. Julian spoke to Yan again. ‘Yan, have you got a light?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
No light. It is dark here,’ said Yan. ‘Can I come to you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
of course. Listen, Yan. Do you know how to unlock and unbolt a door?’ asked
Julian, wondering whether the half-wild boy knew even such simple things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Iss,’
said Yan. ‘Are you locked in?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Julian. ‘But the key may be in the lock. Feel and see. Feel for the bolts,
too. Slide them back and turn the key if there is one.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four in the cave held their breath as they heard Yan’s hands wandering over the
stout door in the dark, tapping here and there to find the bolts and the lock.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
they heard the bolts being slid smoothly back. How they hoped their captor had
left the key in the lock!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here
is a key,’ said Yan’s voice suddenly. ‘But it is so stiff. My hand isn’t strong
enough to turn it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Try
both hands at once,’ said Julian urgently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
heard Yan trying, panting with his efforts. But the key would not turn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Blow!’
said Dick. ‘So near and yet so far!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
pushed Dick out of the way, an idea suddenly flooding into her mind. ‘Yan!
Listen to me, Yan. Take the key out of the lock and push it under the bottom of
the door. Do you hear me?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Iss,
I hear,’ said Yan, and they heard him tugging at the key. There was a sharp
noise as it came suddenly out of the lock. Then, lo and behold! it appeared
under the bottom of the door, slid through carefully by Yan!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
snatched it up and put it into the lock his side. He turned the key, and
unlocked the door. What a wonderful bit of luck!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
flung open the door. Timmy leapt past him and yelped with delight to find Yan

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right.
Explanations later,’ said Julian. He hustled everyone out, took the key from
the inside lock and shut the door. He inserted the key into the outside lock

He grinned at Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
stood and considered. ‘It would be madness to go back up the passage and into
the old house,’ he said. ‘If there’s any signalling going on, and there’s
pretty certain to be, we shall be caught again. We’d be sure to make a noise
scrambling out of that hole in the fire-place.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
let’s take that other passage we saw, the righthand one,’ said George. ‘Look,
there it is.’ She shone her torch on it. ‘Where does it lead to, Yan?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘To
the beach,’ said Yan. ‘I went down it when I was looking for you all, but you
weren’t there, so I came back and found that door. There is nobody on the
beach.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
let’s go down there, then,’ said Dick. ‘Once we feel we’re out of danger’s way
we can plan what’s best to do.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went along the other passage, their torch showing them the way. It was a steep
tunnel, and they found it rather difficult going. Anne managed to give Yan a
squeeze.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
were clever to find us!’ she said, and Yan gave her a smile which she couldn’t
see because of the dark.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
heard the sound of waves at last and came out into the open air. It was a windy
night, but stars were shining in the sky, and gave quite a fair light after the
darkness of the passage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
are we exactly?’ said Dick, looking round. Then he saw they were on the same
beach as they had been a few days before, but a good way farther along.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Can
we get back to the farm from here?’ said Julian, stopping to consider exactly
where they were. ‘Gosh! I think we’d better hurry. The tide’s coming in! We’ll
be cut off if we don’t look out!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
wave ran up the sand almost to their feet. Julian took a quick look at the
cliff behind them. It was very steep. They certainly couldn’t climb it in the
darkness! Would there be time to look for a cave to sit in till the tide went
out again?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
wave ran up, and Julian’s feet felt suddenly wet. ‘Blow!’ he said. ‘This is
getting serious. The next big one will sweep us off our feet. I wish the moon
was out. These stars give such a faint light.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yan,
is there a cave we can go to, a cave open to the air, not inside the cliff?’
said George, anxiously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
take you back by the Wreckers’ Way,’ said Yan, surprisingly. ‘Iss. You come
with me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course, you said you knew the Wreckers’ Way,’ said Julian, remembering. ‘If it
comes out near here, we’re in luck’s way! Lead on, Yan. You’re a marvel! But do
hurry, our feet got wet again just then, and at any moment a giant of a wave
may come!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yan
took the lead. He led them into cove after cove, and then came to a larger one
than usual. He took them to the back of the cove, and led them a little way up
a cliff path.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
came to a great rock. He squeezed behind it and the others followed one by one.
Nobody could ever have guessed that there was a way into the cliff behind that
rock.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
we are in the Wreckers’ Way,’ said Yan proudly, and led them on again. But
suddenly he stopped and the others all bumped into one another. Timmy gave a
short, warning bark, and George put her hand on his collar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Somebody
comes!’ whispered Yan, and pushed them back. Sure enough, they could hear
voices in the distance. They turned and hurried back. They didn’t want to walk
into any more trouble!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yan
got to the front and led them back to the big rock. He was trembling. They all
squeezed out behind it, and Yan went along the cliff face to a tiny cave,
really only a big ledge with an overhanging roof. ‘Ssssssssss!’ he said
warningly, sounding like a snake!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
sat down and waited. Two men came out from behind the rock, one a big man, and
one a small one. Nobody could see them clearly, but Julian hissed into Dick’s
ear: ‘I’m sure that’s Mr Penruthlan! See how enormous he is!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
nodded. It was no surprise to him to think that the giant farmer should be
mixed up in this. The five children held their breath and watched.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yan
nudged Dick and pointed out to sea. ‘Boat comes!’ he whispered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
could see and hear nothing. But in a few moments he did hear something, the
whirr of a fast motor-boat! What sharp ears Yan must have! The others heard the
noise, too, through the crashing of the waves on the rocks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
light,’ whispered Yan, as the noise of the boat grew louder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’ll
be on the rocks!’ said Dick. But before the boat got to the rocks, the engine
stopped. The children could just make out the boat now, swaying up and down
beyond the barrier of rocks. Evidently it was not going to try and come any
farther in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
the watchers could hear voices again. The two men who had come down Wreckers’
Way were standing below the big rock that hid the entrance, talking. One leapt
down to a rock farther down, and disappeared. The other man was left standing
alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
was the big man who leapt down,’ whispered Julian. ‘Where’s he gone? Ah, there
he is! You can just see him moving behind that rock down there. What’s he got?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
boat!’ whispered Yan. ‘He has a boat down there, pulled up high out of reach of
the big waves. There is a pool there. He is going to row out to the other
boat.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children strained their eyes to watch. The sky was quite clear, but the only
light they had was from the stars, and it was dificult to see anything more
than moving shadows or outlines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
there came the sound of oars in rowlocks, and a moving black shadow of a
rowing-boat and man could be seen faintly, going over the waves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Does
he know the way through that mass of rocks?’ wondered Dick. ‘He must know this
coast well to risk rowing out through rocks at high tide in the dead of night!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
is he doing it?’ asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
getting smuggled goods from the motorboat,’ said Julian. ‘Goodness knows what!
There, I’ve lost him in the darkness.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
had everyone. They could no longer hear the oars either, for the crashing of
the waves on the rocks drowned every other sound.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Beyond
the rocks lay the motor-boat, but only Yan’s sharp eyes could see it even
faintly in the starlight. Once, in a sudden silence of the waves, there came
the exchange of voices over the water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
reached the motor-boat,’ said Dick. ‘He’ll be back in a minute.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look!
The second man is going down to the cove now, going to help the first one in, I
expect,’ said Julian. ‘What about us escaping through the Wreckers’ Way while
we’ve got the chance?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
idea,’ said George, scrambling up. ‘Come on, Timmy! Home!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went to the great rock arid squeezed behind it once more into the entrance of
the Wreckers’ Way. Then, Yan once more leading, they went up the secret
passage, flicking on the torch very thankfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
does the Wreckers’ Way come out?’ asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘In
a shed at Tremannon Farm,’ said Yan, to the astonishment of everyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Goodness,
so it’s very nice and handy for Mr Penruthlan!’ said George. ‘I wonder how many
times he has been up on the hills at night, and has been warned by the tower
light to go down Wreckers’ Way to the cove and collect smuggled goods from some
boat or other! A very good scheme, it seems to me, and impossible for anyone to
find out.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Except
us!’ said Dick in a pleased voice..‘We got on to it pretty well. There’s not
much we don’t know about Mr Penruthlan now!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went on and on. The passage was fairly straight and had probably been the bed
of an underground stream at some time. The way was quite smooth to the feet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ve
walked about a mile, I should think!’ groaned Dick, at last. ‘How far now, Yan?
Shall we soon be back?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Iss,’
said Yan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
suddenly remembered that nobody knew how it was that Yan had found them that night.
She turned to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yan,
how did you find us tonight? It seemed like a miracle when we woke up to find
you outside that locked door!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
was easy,’ said Yan. ‘You said to me: “Go away. Do not come with us today.” So
I went back a little way. But I followed you. I followed you to the old house,
though I was frit.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
guess you were frit!’ said Dick with a grin. ‘Well, go on.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hid,’ said Yan. ‘You went up into the tower a long time. I came out into the
room below, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
was you we heard scuffling there, then!’ said Anne. ‘We wondered who it was!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Iss,’
said Yan. ‘I sat down on some weeds in a corner, and waited till you came down,
and then I hid again; but I watched you through a hole from outside. I saw you
go through the fire-place. One minute you were there. The next you were gone. I
was frit.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
love that word!’ said Dick. ‘So it was you who flattened down that patch of
weeds that Timmy sniped at? Well, what did you do next?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
was going to come too,’ said Yan. ‘But the hole was so dark and black. I stood
in the fire-place for a long time, hoping you would come back.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Then
what happened?’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Then
I heard voices,’ said Yan. ‘I thought it was you all coming back. But it
wasn’t. It was men. So l ran away and hid in the nettles.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
a place to choose!’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Then
I was hungry,’ said Yan, ‘and I went back to Grandad’s hut for food. He cuffed
me for leaving him, and he made me work for him all day. He was angry with me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘My
word! So you’ve been on the hills all day, knowing we were down in that
passage!’ said Julian. ‘Didn’t you say anything to anyone?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
went down to Tremannon Farm to see if you were back when it grew dark,’ said
Yan. ‘But you weren’t there. Only the Barnies were there, giving another show.
I didn’t see Mr or Mrs Penruthlan. I knew then that you must still be down in
that dark hole. I was afraid the men had hurt you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
you came all the way again in the dark!’ said Julian, astonished. ‘Well, you’ve
got pluck, I must say!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
was very frit,’ said Yan. ‘My legs shook at the knees like my old Grandad’s. I
climbed in at the hole, and at last I found you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘With
no torch to light the way!’ said Dick, and clapped the small boy on the back.
‘You’re a real friend, Yan! Timmy knew you all right when you came to the
locked door. He didn’t even bark! He knew it was you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wanted to save Timmy too,’ said Yan. ‘Iss. Timmy is my friend.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
said nothing to that. She was thinking, rather unwillingly, that Yan was a
remarkably brave young man, and that she had been silly and unkind to resent
Timmy’s liking for him. What a good thing he had liked Timmy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yan
suddenly stopped. ‘We are there,’ he said. ‘We are at Tremannon Farm. Look
above your heads.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
flashed his torch upwards, and stared. An open trapdoor was just above them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
trapdoor is open!’ he said. ‘Someont came down here tonight!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
we know who!’ said Dick, grimly. ‘Mr Penruthlan and his friend! Where does that
trapdoor lead to, Yan?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Into
a corner of the machine shed,’ said Yan. ‘When the trapdoor is shut, it is
covered with sacks of corn or onions. They have been moved to open the way
down.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all climbed out. Julian flashed his torch round the shed. Yes, there were the
machines and the tools. Well, who would have thought that the sacks he had seen
in here the other day were hiding the trapdoor that led to the Wreckers’ Way!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
rat suddenly shot out from a corner of the shed, and tore across to the open
trapdoor. Timmy gave a bark and leapt after it. He just stopped himself from
taking a header through the trapdoor by sliding along on all four feet and
coming to a stop at the entrance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
stood up and looked down the hole, his head cocked to one side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look,
he’s listening,’ said Anne. ‘Is there someone coming, those men, perhaps, with
the smuggled goods?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
he’s only listening for the rat,’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
tell you what we’ll do! We’ll shut the trapdoor and pile sacks and boxes and
everything on top of it! Then when the men come up, they’ll find themselves
trapped. They won’t be able to get out. If we can get the police in time,
they’ll be able to catch them easily.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
idea!’ said Dick. ‘Super! How mad those two men will be when they come to the
trapdoor and find it shut! They can’t get out the other way because the tide’s
up.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’d
like to see Mr Penruthlan’s face when he sees the trapdoor shut, and feels a
whole lot of things piled on top of it!’ said Julian. ‘He’ll make a few more of
his peculiar noises!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ooh
- ah - ock,’ said Dick, solemnly. ‘Come on, help me with the trapdoor, Ju, it’s
heavy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
shut the big trapdoor and then began to drag sacks, boxes and even some kind of
heavy farm machine on top of the trapdoor. Now certainly nobody could open it
from underneath.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were hot and very dirty by the time they had finished. They were also beginning
to feel very tired. ‘Phew!’ said Dick. ‘I’m glad that’s done. Now we’d better
go to the farm-house and show ourselves to Mrs Penruthlan.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
dear, do we tell her about her husband, and how he’s mixed up in this horrid
business?’ said Anne. ‘I do so like her. I expect she’s very worried about us,
too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
It’s going to be a bit difficult,’ said Julian, soberly. ‘Better let me do most
of the talking. Come on, we’ll go. Don’t make too much row or we’ll set the
dogs barking. I’m surprised they haven’t yelled their heads off already!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was rather surprising. Usually the farm-dogs barked the place down if there was
any unusual noise in the night. The five children and Timmy left the
machine-shed and made their way towards the farmhouse. George pulled at
Julian’s arm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look,’
she said, in a low voice. ‘See those lights up in the hills? What are they?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
looked. He could see moving lights here and there up on the hills. He was
puzzled. Then he made a guess. ‘I bet Mrs Penruthlan has sent out searchers for
us,’ he said, ‘and they’ve got lanterns. They’re hunting for us on the hills.
Gosh, I hope all the Barnies aren’t out after us too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came to the farm-yard, moving very quietly. The big barn, used by the Barnies
for their show, was in darkness. Julian pictured it full of benches, left from
that night’s show. The memory of Mr Penruthlan turning out the pockets of the
clothes left and hunting through the drawers in the chest used by the Barnies,
came into his mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
sharp whisper made them stop very suddenly. George put her hand on Timmy’s
collar to stop him growling or barking. Who was this now?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>None
of the little company answered or moved. The whisper came again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here!
I’m here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Still
nobody moved. They were all puzzled. Who was waiting there in the shadows, and
whom was he waiting for? The whisper came again, a little louder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here!
Over here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then, as if too impatient to wait any longer, the whisper moved out into the
yard. Julian couldn’t see who it was in the dark, and he quickly flashed his
torch on the man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was the Guv’nor, grim-faced as ever! He flinched as the light fell on his face,
took a few steps back and disappeared round a corner. Timmy growled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well!
How many more people wander about at night here?’ said Dick. ‘That was the
Guv’nor. What was he doing?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
give it up,’ said Julian. ‘I’m getting too tired to think straight. I shouldn’t
be in the least surprised to see Clopper the horse peering round a corner at
us, and saying “Peep-bo, chaps!” ’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
chuckled. It was just the kind of thing Clopper would do if he were really
alive!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came to the farm-house. It was full of light, upstairs and downstairs. The
curtains were not drawn across the kitchen window and the children looked in as
they passed. Mrs Penruthlan was sitting there, her hands clasped, looking
extremely worried.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
opened the kitchen door and trooped in, Yan too. Mrs Penruthlan leapt up at
once and ran to them. She hugged Anne, she tried to hug George, she said all
kinds of things at top speed, and to the children’s dismay they saw that she
was crying.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
where have you been?’ she said, tears pouring down her face. ‘The men are out
looking for you, and all the dogs, and the Barnies too. They’ve been looking
for ages! And Mr Penruthlan’s not home, either. I don’t know where he is, he’s
gone too! Oh, what a terrible evening. But thank goodness you’re safe!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
saw that she was terribly upset. He took her arm gently and led her to a chair.
‘Don’t worry,’ he said. ‘We’re all safe. We’re sorry you’ve been upset.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
where have you been?’ wept Mrs Penruthlan. ‘I pictured you drowned, or lost on
the hills, or fallen into quarries. And where is Mr Penruthlan? He went out at
seven and there’s been not a sign of him since!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children felt uncomfortable. They thought they knew where Mr Penruthlan was,
getting smuggled goods from the motor-boat, and carrying them back with his
friend, up the Wreckers’ Way!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
just you tell me what you’ve been doing,’ said Mrs Penruthlan, drying her eyes,
and sounding unexpectedly determined. ‘Upsetting everybody like this!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,’
said Julian, ‘it’s a long story, but I’ll try to make it short. Strange things
have been happening, Mrs Penruthlan.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
plunged into the whole story, the old tower, Grandad’s tale of the flashing
light, their journey to explore the tower, the secret passage to the wreckers’
cove, their imprisonment and escape, and then Julian stopped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>How
was he to tell poor Mrs Penruthlan that one of the smugglers was her husband?
He glanced at the others desperately. Anne began to cry, and George felt very
much like it, too. It was Yan who suddenly spoke and broke the news.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
seen Mr Penruthlan in the cove,’ he said, glad of a chance to put in a word.
‘We seen him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs
Penruthlan stared at Yan, and then at the embarrassed, anxious faces of the
other children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
saw him in the cove?’ she said. ‘You didn’t! What was he doing there?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
think, we think he must be one of the smugglers,’ said Julian, awkwardly. ‘We
think we saw him get into a boat and row to the motor-boat beyond the rocks. If
so, he - well - he may get into trouble, Mrs Penru...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
didn’t finish, because, to his enormous surprise, Mrs Penruthlan jumped up from
her chair, and boxed his ears soundly. He hadn’t even time to dodge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
wicked boy!’ panted Mrs Penruthlan, sounding suddenly out of breath, ‘You bad,
wicked boy, saying things like that about Mr Penruthlan, who’s the straightest,
honestest, most God-fearing man who ever lived! Him a smuggler! Him in with
those wicked men! I’ll box your ears till you eat your words and serve you
right!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
dodged the second time, amazed at the change in the cheerful little farmer’s
wife. Her face was red, her eyes were blazing, and somehow she seemed to be
taller. He had never seen anyone so angry in his life! Yan went promptly under
the table.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
growled. He liked Mrs Penruthlan, but he felt he really couldn’t allow her to
set about his friends. She faced Julian, trembling with anger.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
you apologize!’ she said. ‘Or I’ll give you such a drubbing as you’ve never had
in your life before. And you just wait and see what Mr Penruthlan will say when
he comes back and hears the things you’ve said about him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was much too big and strong for the farmer’s wife to ‘give him a drubbing’ but
he felt certain she would try, if he didn’t apologize! What a tiger she was!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
put his hand on her arm. ‘Don’t get so upset,’ he said. ‘I’m very sorry to have
made you so angry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs
Penruthlan shook his hand off her arm. ‘Angry! I should just think I am angry!’
she said. ‘To think anyone should say those things about Mr Penruthlan. That
wasn’t him down in Wreckers’ Cove. I know it wasn’t. I only wish I knew where he
was! I’m that worried!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
be down Wreckers’ Way,’ announced Yan from his safe vantage-point under the
table. ‘We put trapdoor down over he. Iss.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Down
Wreckers’ Way!’ cried Mrs Penruthlan and to the children’s great relief she
sank down into a chair again. She turned to Julian, questioningly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
nodded. ‘Yes. We came up that way from the beach - Yan knew it. It comes up in
a corner of the machine-shed, through a trapdoor. We - er - we shut the
trapdoor and piled sacks and things on it. I’m afraid, well, I’m rather afraid
Mr Penruthlan can’t get out!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs
Penruthlan’s eyes almost dropped out of her head. She opened and shut her mouth
several times, rather like a goldfish gasping for breath. All the children felt
most uncomfortable and extremely sorry for her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t believe it,’ she said at last. ‘It’s a bad dream. It’s not real. Mr
Penruthlan will come walking in here at any moment, at any moment, I tell you!
He’s not down in the Wreckers’ Way. He’s NOT a bad man. He’ll come walking in,
you just see!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was silence after this, and in the silence a sound could be heard. The sound of
big boots walking over the farm-yard. Glomp-clomp-clomp-clomp!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
frit!’ squealed Yan, suddenly, and made everyone jump. The footsteps came round
the kitchen wall, and up to the kitchen door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
know who that is!’ said Mrs Penruthlan, jumping up. ‘I know who that is.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
door opened and somebody walked in. Mr Penruthlan!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
wife ran to him and flung her arms round him. ‘You’ve come walking in! I said
you would. Praise be that you’ve come!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr
Penruthlan looked tired, and the children, quite dumb with amazement at seeing
him, saw that he was wet through. He looked round at them in great surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
are these children up for?’ he said, and they all gaped in surprise. Why, he
was talking properly! His words were quite clear, except that he lisped over
his s’s.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
Mr Penruthlan, the tales these bad children have told about you!’ cried his
wife. ‘They said you were a smuggler. They said they’d seen you in Wreckers’
Cove going out to a motor-boat to get smuggled goods, they said you were
trapped in Wreckers’ Way, they’d put the trapdoor down, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr
Penruthlan pushed his wife away from him and swung round on the astounded
children. They were most alarmed. How had he escaped from Wreckers’ Way? Surely
even his great strength could not lift up all the things they had piled on top
of the trapdoor? How fierce this giant of a man looked, with his mane of black
hair, his shaggy eyebrows drawn over his deep-set eyes, and his dense black
beard!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
all this?’ he demanded, and they gaped again at his speech. They were so used
to his peculiar noises that it seemed amazing he could speak properly after
all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
sir,’ began Julian, awkwardly, ‘we - er - we’ve been exploring that tower - and
- er - finding out a bit about the smugglers, and we really thought we
recognized you in Wreckers’ Cove, and we thought we’d trapped you, and your
friend, by shutting the trapdoor and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
is important,’ said Mr Penruthlan, and his voice sounded urgent. ‘Forget all
this about thinking I’m a smuggler. You’ve got things wrong. I’m working with
the police. It was someone else down in the cove, not me. I’ve been on the
coast, it’s true, watching out, and getting drenched, as you can see, all to no
purpose. What do you know? What’s this about the trapdoor? Did you really close
it, and trap those men?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
this was so completely astonishing that for a moment nobody could say a word.
Then Julian leapt up,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
sir! We did put the trapdoor down, and if you want to catch those fellows, send
for the police, and we’ll do it! We’ve only got to wait beside the trapdoor
till the smugglers come!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Mr Penruthlan. ‘Come along. Hurry!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the greatest surprise and excitement the five children rushed to the kitchen
door to follow Mr Penruthlan. Yan had scrambled out from beneath the table,
determined not to miss anything. But at the door the farmer turned round.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
the girls,’ he said. ‘Nor you, Yan.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
keep the girls here with me,’ said Mrs Penruthlan, who had forgotten her dismay
and anger completely in this new excitement. ‘Yan, come here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Yan had slipped out with the others. Nothing in the world would keep him from
missing this new excitement! Timmy had gone too, of course, as excited as the
rest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
goings-on in the early hours of the morning!’ said Mrs Penruthlan, sitting down
suddenly again. ‘To think that Mr Penruthlan never told me he was working to
find those smugglers! We knew it was going on, around this coast, and to think
he was keeping a watch, and never told me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and Dick had quite forgotten that they felt tired. They hurried over the
farm-yard with Mr Penruthlan, Yan a little way behind, and Timmy leaping round
like a mad thing. They came to the machine-shed and went in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
piled ...’ began Julian, and then suddenly stopped. Mr Penruthlan’s powerful
torch was shining on the corner where the trapdoor was fixed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was open! Unbelievably open! The sacks and boxes that the children had dragged
over it were now scattered to one side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
at that!’ said Julian, amazed. ‘Who’s opened it? Sir, the smugglers have got
out, with their smuggled goods, and they’ve gone. We’re beaten!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr
Penruthlan made a very angry noise, and flung the trapdoor shut with a
resounding bang. He was about to say something more when there came the sound
of voices not far off. It was the Barnies returning from their search for the
children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
saw the light in the shed and peered in. When they saw Julian and Dick they
cried out in delight. ‘Where were you? We’ve searched everywhere for you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and Dick were so disappointed at finding their high hopes dashed that they
could hardly respond to the Barnies’ delighted greetings. They felt suddenly
very tired again, and Mr Penruthlan seemed all at once in a very bad temper. He
answered the Barnies gruffly, said that everything was all right now, and any
talking could be done tomorrow. As for him, he was going to bed!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Barnies dispersed at once, still talking. Mr Penruthlan silently led the way
back to the farm-house with Julian and Dick trailing behind. Yan had gone like
a shadow. As he was not at the farm-house when they walked wearily into the
kitchen, Julian guessed that he had scampered back up the hills to old Grandad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Five
past three in the morning,’ said Mr Penruthlan, looking at the clock. ‘I’ll
sleep down here for an hour or two, wife, then I’ll be up to milk the cows.
Send these children to bed. I’m too weary to talk. Good-night.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
with that he put his hand to his mouth and quite solemnly took out his false
teeth, putting them into a glass of water on the mantelpiece.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oooh
- ock,’ he said to his wife, and stripped off his wet coat. Mrs Penruthlan
hustled Julian and the rest upstairs. They were almost dropping with exhaustion
now. The girls managed to undress, but the two boys flopped on their beds and
were asleep in half a second. They didn’t stir when the cocks crew, or when the
cows lowed, or even when the wagons of the Barnies came trundling out into the
yard to be packed with their things. They were going off to play in another
village barn that night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
awoke at last. It took him a few moments to realize why he was still fully
dressed. He lay and thought for a while, and a feeling of dejection came over
him when he remembered how all the excitement of the day before had ended in
complete failure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
only they knew who had opened that trapdoor! WHO could it be?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then something clicked in his mind, and he knew. Of course! Why hadn’t he
thought of it before? Why hadn’t he remembered to tell Mr Penruthlan about the
Guv’nor standing in the shadows, and his whispered message: ‘Here! I’m here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
must have been waiting for the smugglers to come to him, of course, he probably
used local fishermen to row through the rocks to the motor-boat that had slunk
over to the Cornish coast, and those fishermen used the Wreckers’ Way so that
no one knew what they were doing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Barnies often came to play at Tremannon Barn, nothing could be easier than for
the Guv’nor to arrange for the smuggling to take place then, for the Wreckers’
Way actually had an entrance in the shed near the big barn! If a stormy night
came, all the better! No one would be about. He could go up on the hills and
wait for the signal from the tower which would tell him that at last the boat
was coming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yes,
and he would arrange with the signaller too, to flash out the news that he, the
Guv’nor, was at Tremannon again, and waiting! Who was the signaller? Probably
another of the fishermen, descendants of the old Wreckers, and glad of a bit of
excitement, and extra money.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everything
fell into place, all the odd bits and pieces of happenings fitted together like
a jig-saw puzzle. Julian saw the clear picture.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Who
would ever have thought of the owner of the Barnies being involved in
smuggling? Smugglers were clever, but the Guv’nor was cleverer than most!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
heard the noise outside, and got up to see what it was. When he saw the Barnies
piling their furniture on the wagons, he rushed downstairs, yelling to wake
Dick as he went. He must tell Mr Penruthlan about the Guv’nor! He must get him
arrested! He had probably got the smuggled goods somewhere in one of the boxes
on the wagons. What an easy way of getting it away unseen! The Guv’nor was
cunning, there was no doubt about that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
Dick at his heels, puzzled and surprised, Julian went to find Mr Penruthlan.
There he was, watching the Barnies getting ready to go, looking very dour and
grim. Julian ran up to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sir!
I’ve remembered something, something important! Can I speak to you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went into a near-by field, and there Julian poured out all he had surmised
about the Guv’nor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
was waiting in the dark last night for the smugglers,’ said Julian. ‘I’m sure
he was. He must have heard us and thought we were the men. And it must have
been he who opened the trapdoor, sir. When they didn’t come, he must have gone
to the trapdoor and found it shut, with things piled on it. And he opened it,
and waited there till the men came and handed him the goods. And now he’s got
them hidden somewhere in those wagons!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
didn’t you tell me this last night?’ said Mr Penruthlan. ‘We may be too late
now! I’ll have to get the police here to search those wagons, but if I try to
stop the Barnies going now, the Guv’nor will suspect something and go off at
once!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was relieved to see that Mr Penruthlan had his teeth in again and could speak
properly! The farmer pulled at his black beard and frowned. ‘I’ve searched many
times through the Barnies’ properties to find the smuggled goods,’ he said.
‘Each time they’ve been here I’ve gone through everything in the dead of night.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
you know what it is they’re smuggling?’ asked Julian. The farmer nodded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
Dangerous drugs. Drugs that are sold at enormously high prices in the black
market. The parcel wouldn’t need to be very big. I’ve suspected one or other of
the Barnies of being the receivers before this, and I’ve searched and searched.
No good.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
it’s a small parcel it could be hidden easily,’ said Dick, thoughtfully. ‘But
it’s a dangerous thing to hide. The Guv’nor wouldn’t have it on him, would he?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no, he would be afraid of being searched,’ said Mr Penruthlan. ‘Well, I reckon
I must let them go this time, and I must warn the police. If they like to
search the wagons on the road, they’re welcome. I can’t get the police here in
time to stop the wagons going off. We’ve got no telephone at the farm.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr
Binks came up at that moment, carrying Clopper’s front and back legs. He
grinned at the boys. ‘You led us a fine dance last night!’ he said. ‘What
happened?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Sid, coming up with Clopper’s ridiculous head under his arm as usual.
‘Clopper was right worried about you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh,
you didn’t carry old Clopper’s head all over the hills last night, did you!’
said Dick, astonished,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
I left it with the Guv’nor,’ said Sid. ‘He took charge of his precious Clopper while
I went gallivanting over the hills and far away, looking for a pack of tiresome
kids!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
stared at the horse’s head, with its comical rolling eyes. He stared at it very
hard indeed. And then he did a most peculiar thing!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
snatched the head away from the surprised Sid, and tore across the farm-yard
with it! Julian looked after him in amazement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sid
gave an angry yell. ‘Now then! What do you think you’re doing? Bring that horse
back at once!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Dick didn’t. He tore round a corner and disappeared. Sid went after him, and so
did somebody else!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Guv’nor raced across the yard at top speed, looking furious! He shouted, he
yelled, he shook his fist. But when he and Sid got to the corner, Dick had
disappeared!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
got into him?’ said Mr Penruthlan, amazed, ‘What does he want to rush off with
Clopper’s head for? The boy must be mad.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
suddenly saw light. He knew why Dick had snatched Clopper’s head. He knew!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mr
Penruthlan, why does the Guv’nor always have someone in charge of Clopper’s
head?’ he said. ‘Maybe he hides something precious there, something he doesn’t
want anyone to find! Quick, let’s go and see!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
that moment Dick appeared again, round another corner, still holding Clopper’s
head, with Sid and the Guv’nor hard on his heels. He hadn’t been able to stop
for a moment, or even to hide anywhere. He panted up to Mr Penruthlan, and
thrust the head at him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Take
it. I bet it’s got the goods in it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
Sid and the Guv’nor raced up too, both in a furious rage. The Guv’nor tried to
snatch Clopper away from the big farmer. But he was a small man and Mr
Penruthlan was well over six feet. He calmly held the horse’s head out of reach
with his strong right hand, and fended off the Guv’nor with the other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
ran up at once. The Barnies surrounded the little group in excitement, and one
or two farm-men came up too. Mrs Penruthlan and the girls, who were now up,
heard the excitement and came running out as well. Hens scattered away,
clucking, and the four dogs and Timmy barked madly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Guv’nor was beside himself with fury. He began to hit the farmer, but was
immediately pulled away by Mr Binks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
one of the farm-men shouldered his way through the excited crowd, and put his
great hand on to the Guv’nor’s shoulder. He held him in a grip of iron.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
let him go,’ said the farmer. He lowered Clopper’s head and looked round at the
puzzled Barnies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Fetch
that barrel,’ he said to Julian, and the boy got it at once, placing it in
front of the farmer. The Guv’nor watched, his face going white.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
leave that horse alone,’ he said. ‘It’s my property. What do you think you’re
doing'?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
say this horse is your property?’ said the farmer. ‘Is it entirely your
property, inside as well as outside?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Guv’nor said nothing. He looked very worried indeed. Mr Penruthlan turned the
head upside down, and looked into the neck. He put his hand in and scrabbled
about. He found the little lid and opened it. Out fell about a dozen
cigarettes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’re
mine,’ said Mr Binks. ‘I keep them there. Anything wrong with that, sir? It’s a
little place the Guv’nor had made for me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nothing
wrong with that, Mr Binks,’ said the farmer, and put his hand in again. He
pulled at the lid, and ran his finger round the hole where Mr Binks kept his
cigarettes. The Guv’nor watched, breathing quickly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can feel something, Guv’nor,’ said Mr Penruthlan, watching the man’s face. ‘I
can feel a false bottom to this clever little space. How do I get it open,
Guv’nor? Will you tell me, or do I smash Clopper up to find it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
smash him!’ said Sid and Mr Binks together. They turned to the Guv’nor,
puzzled. ‘What’s up?’ said Sid. ‘We never knew there was a secret about
Clopper.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
isn’t,’ said the Guv’nor, stubbornly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah,
I’ve found the trick!’ said Mr Penruthlan, suddenly. ‘Now I’ve got it!’ He
worked his fingers about in the space that he had suddenly hit on, behind the
place where Mr Binks had his cigarettes. He pulled out a package done up in
white paper, a small package, but worth many hundreds of pounds!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
this, Guv’nor?’ he asked the white-faced man. ‘Is it one of the many packets of
drugs you’ve handled round this coast? Was it because of this secret of yours
that you told Sid never to let Clopper out of his sight? Shall I open this
packet, Guv’nor, and see what’s inside?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
murmur arose from the Barnies, a murmur of horror. Sid turned fiercely on the
Guv’nor. ‘You made me guard your horrible drugs, not Clopper! To think I’ve
been helping you all this time, helping a man who’s only fit for prison! I’ll
never work with Clopper again! Never!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Almost
in tears poor Sid pushed his way through the amazed Barnies and went off by
himself. After a few moments Mr Binks followed him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr
Penruthlan put the white package into his pocket. ‘Lock the Guv’nor up in the
small barn,’ he ordered. ‘And you, Dan, get on your bike and get the police. As
for you, Barnies, I don’t know rightly what to say. You’ve lost your Guv’nor,
but it’s good riddance, I’ll tell you that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Barnies stared after the Guv’nor as he was dragged away by two farm-men, over
to the small barn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
never liked him,’ said one. ‘But he had money to tide us over bad times. Money
from smuggling in those wicked drugs! He used us Barnies as a screen for his
goings-on. It’s good riddance, you’re right.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
manage,’ said another Barnie. ‘We’ll get along. Hey, Sid, come back. Cheer up!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sid
and Mr Binks came back, looking rather solemn. ‘We’re not going to use Clopper
any more,’ said Sid. ‘He’ll bring us bad luck. We’ll get a donkey instead, and
work up another act. Mr Binks says he couldn’t wear Clopper again, and I feel
the same.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said the farmer, picking up Clopper’s head. ‘Get the back and front legs. I’ll
take charge of old Clopper. I’ve always been fond of him, and he won’t bring
any bad luck to me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was nothing more to be done. The Barnies said rather a forlorn good-bye. Sid
and Mr Binks shook hands solemnly with each of the children. Sid gave Clopper
one last pat and turned away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
go off now,’ said Mr Binks. ‘Thanks for everything, Mr Penruthlan, sir. So
long!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘See
you again when next you’re by here,’ said Mr Penruthlan. ‘You can have my barn
any time, Sid.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Guv’nor was safely locked up, waiting for the police. Mr Penruthlan picked
Clopper up, legs and all, and looked down at the five children, for Yan was now
with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
smiled at them all, looking suddenly quite a different man. ‘Well, that’s all
finished up!’ he said. ‘Dick, I thought you’d gone mad when you went off with
old Clopper’s head!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
was certainly a bit of a brain-wave,’ said Dick, modestly. ‘It came over me all
of a sudden. Only just in time, too, the Barnies were nearly on their way
again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went over to the farm-house. Mrs Penruthlan had already run across. The girls guessed
why, and they were right!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
getting a meal for you!’ she cried, as they came in. ‘Poor children, not a mite
to eat have you had today. No breakfast, nothing. Come away in and help me. You
can turn out the whole larder if you like!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
very nearly did! Ham and tongue and pies went on the table. Anne picked crisp
lettuces from the garden and washed them. Julian piled tomatoes in a dish.
George cooked a dozen hard-boiled eggs at the stove. A fruit-tart and a
jam-tart appeared as if by magic and two great jugs of creamy milk were set at
each end of the table.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yan
hovered around, getting into everybody’s way, his eyes nearly falling out of
his head at the sight of the food. Mrs Penruthlan laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Get
away from under my feet, you dirty little ruffian! Do you want to eat with us?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Iss,’
said Yan, his eyes sparkling. ‘ISS!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Then
go upstairs and wash those dirty hands!’ said the farmer’s wife. And, marvel of
marvels, Yan went off upstairs as good as gold, and came down with hands that
really were almost clean!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all sat down. Julian solemnly put a chair beside him, and arranged Clopper in
such a way that it looked as if he were sitting down too! Anne gave a giggle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
Clopper! You look quite real. Mr Penruthlan, what are you going to do with
him?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
going to give him away,’ said the farmer munching as hard with his teeth as he
did without them. ‘To friends of mine.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Lucky
friends!’ said Dick, helping himself to a hard-boiled egg and salad. ‘Do they
know how to work the back and front legs, sir?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes,’ said the farmer. ‘They know fine. They’ll do well with Clopper. There’s
only one thing they don’t know. Haw-haw-haw!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children looked at him in surprise. Why the sudden guffaw?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr
Penruthlan choked, and his wife banged him on the back. ‘Careful now, Mr
Penruthlan,’ she said. ‘Mr Clopper’s looking at you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
farmer guffawed again. Then he looked round at the listening children. ‘I was
telling you,’ he said, ‘there’s only one thing these friends of mine don’t
know.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
that?’ asked George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
they don’t know how to undo the zip!’ said the farmer, and roared again till
the tears came into his eyes. ‘They don’t know how to - how to -
haw-haw-haw-haw - undo the ZIP!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mr
Penruthlan now, behave yourself!’ said his amused wife. ‘Why don’t you say
straight out that you’re giving Clopper to Julian and Dick, instead of
spluttering away like that?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh,
are you really?’ said Dick, thrilled. ‘Thanks most awfully!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you got me what I wanted, so it’s only right and fair I should give you what
you wanted,’ said the farmer, taking another plate of ham. ‘You’ll do well with
Clopper, you and your brother. You can give us a show one day before you leave
for home. Haw-haw - Clopper’s a queer one, see him looking at us now!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
winked!’ said George, in an astonished voice, and Timmy came out from under the
table to stare at Clopper with the others. ‘I saw him wink!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Well,
it wouldn’t be surprising if he did wink. He’s really had a most exciting time!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
