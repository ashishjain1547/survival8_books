<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
One<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>BACK
TO KIRRIN COTTAGE<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ONE
fine day right at the beginning of the Easter holidays, four childien and a dog
travelled by train together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Soon
be there now,' said Julian, a tall strong boy, with a determined face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Woof,'
said Timothy the dog, getting excited, and trying to look out of the window
too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Get
down, Tim,' said Julian, 'Let Anne have a look.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
was his young sister. She put her head out of the window. 'We're coming into
Kirrin Station!' she said. T do hope Aunt Fanny will be there to meet us.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Of
course she will!' said <st1:place w:st="on">Georgina</st1:place>, her cousin.
She looked more like a boy than a girl, for she wore her hair very short, and
it curled close about her head. She too had a determined face, like Julian. She
pushed Anne away and looked out of the window.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
nice to be going home,' she said. 'I love school -but it will be fun to be at
Kirrin Cottage and perhaps sail out to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Kirrin</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Island</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
and visit the castle there. We haven't been since last summer.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Dick's
turn to look out now,' said Julian, turning to his younger brother, a boy with
a pleasant face, sitting reading in a corner. 'We're just coming into sight of
Kirrin, Dick. Can't you stop reading for a second?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
such an exciting book,' said Dick, and shut it with a clap. 'The most exciting
adventure story I've ever read!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Pooh!
I bet it's not as exciting as some of the adventures we've had!' said Anne, at
once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was quite true that the five of them, counting in<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
the dog, who always shared everything with them, had had the most amazing
adventures together. But now it looked as if they were going to have nice quiet
holidays, going for long walks over the cliffs, and perhaps sailing out in
George's boat to their <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">island</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Kirrin</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I've
worked jolly hard at school this term,' said Julian. 'I could do with a
holiday!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You've
gone thin,' said <st1:place w:st="on">Georgina</st1:place>. Nobody called her
that. They all called her George. She would never answer to any other name.
Julian grinned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
I'll soon get fat at Kirrin Cottage, don't you worry! Aunt Fanny will see to
that. She's a great one for trying to fatten people up. It will be nice to see
your mother again, George. She's an awfully good sort.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes.
I hope Father will be in a good temper these holls,' said George. 'He ought to
be because he has just finished some new experiments, Mother says, which have
been quite successful.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George's
father was a scientist, always working out new ideas. He liked to be quiet, and
sometimes he flew into a temper when he could not get the peace he needed or
things did not go exactly as he wanted them to. The children often thought that
hot-tempered <st1:place w:st="on">Georgina</st1:place> was very like her
father! She too could fly into fierce tempers when things did not go right for
her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Aunt
Fanny was there to meet them. The four children jumped out on the platform and
rushed to hug her. George got there first. She was very fond of her gentle
mother, who had so often tried to shield her when her father got angry with
her. Timmy pranced round, barking in delight. He adored George's mother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
patted him, and he tried to stand up and lick her face. 'Timmy's bigger than
ever!' she said, laughing. 'Down, old boy! You'll knock rne over.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was certainly a big dog. All the children loved him, for he was loyal, loving
and faithful. His brown eyes looked from one to the other, enjoying the
children's excitement. Timmy shared in it, as he shared in everything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the person he loved most, of course, was his mistress, George. She had had him
since he was a small puppy. She took him to school with her each term, for she
and Anne went to a boarding-school that allowed pets. Otherwise George would
most certainly have refused to go!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
set off to Kirrin in the pony-trap. It was very windy and cold, and the
children shivered and pulled their coats tightly round them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
awfully cold,' said Anne, her teeth beginning to chatter. 'Colder than in the
winter!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
the wind,' said her aunt, and tucked a rug round her. 'It's been getting very
strong the last day or two. The fishermen have pulled their boats high up the
beach for fear of a big storm.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children saw the boats pulled right up as they passed the beach where they had
bathed so often. They did not feel like bathing now. It made them shiver even
to think of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
wind howled over the sea. Great scudding clouds raced overhead. The waves
pounded on the beach and made a terrific noise. It excited Timmy, who began to
bark.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Be
quiet, Tim,' said George, patting him. 'You will have to learn to be a good
quiet dog now we are home again, or Father will be cross with you. Is Father
very busy, Mother?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Very,'
said her mother. 'But he's going to do very<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>little
work now you aie coming home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>would
like to go for walks with you, or go out in the boat,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>if
the weather calms down.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children looked at one another. Uncle Quentin was not the best of companions.
He had no sense oi humour, and when the children went off into fits of
laughter, as they did twenty times a day or moie, he could not see the joke at
all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It
looks as if these holls won't be quite so jolly if Uncle Quentin parks himself
on us most of the time,' said Dick in a low voice to Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Sh,'
said Julian, afraid that his aunt would hear, and be hurt. George frowned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
Mother! Father will be bored stiff if he comes with us - and we'll be bored
too.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was very outspoken, and could never learn to keep a guard on her tongue. Her
mother sighed. 'Don't talk like that, dear. I daresay your father will get
tired of going with you after a bit. But it does him good to have a bit of
young life about him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Here
we are!' said Julian, as the trap stopped outside an old house. 'Kirrin
Cottage! My word, how the wind is howling round it, Aunt Fanny!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes.
It made a terrible noise last night,' said his aunt. 'You take the trap round
to the back, Julian, when we've got the things out. Oh, heie's your uncle to
help!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin came out, a tall, clever-looking man, with rather frowning eyebrows. He
smiled at the children and kissed George and Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Welcome
to Kirrin Cottage!' he said. 'I'm quite glad your mother and father are away,
Anne, because now we shall have you all here once again!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
they were sitting round the table eating a big tea. Aunt Fanny always got ready
a fine meal for their first<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>one,
for she knew they were very hungry after their long journey in the train.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Even
George was satisfied at last, and leaned back in her chair, wishing she could
manage just one more of her mother's delicious new-made buns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
sat close to her. He was not supposed to be fed at meal-times but it was really
surprising how many titbits found their way to him under the table!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
wind howled round the house. The windows rattled, the doors shook, and the mats
lifted themselves up and down as the draught got under them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'They
look as if they've got snakes wriggling underneath them,' said Anne. Timmy
watched them, and growled. He was a clever dog, but he did not know why the
mats wriggled in such a queer way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
hope the wind will die down tonight,' said Aunt Fanny. 'It kept me awake last
night. Julian dear, you look rather thin. Have you been working hard? I must
fatten you up.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children laughed. 'Just what we thought you'd say, Mother!' said George.
'Goodness, what's that?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all sat still, startled. There was a loud bumping noise on the roof, and Timmy
put up his ears and growled fiercely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'A
tile off the roof,' said Uncle Quentin. 'How tiresome! We shall have to get the
loose tiles seen to, Fanny, when the storm is over, or the rain will come in.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children rather hoped that their uncle would retire to his study after tea, as
he usually did, but this time he didn't. They wanted to play a game, but it
wasn't much good with Uncle Quentin there. He really wasn't any good at all,
not even at such a simple game as snap.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Do
you know a boy called Pierre Lenoirj!' suddenly;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>asked
Uncle Quentin, taking a letter from his pocket. 'I believe he goes to your
school and Dick's, Julian.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Pierre</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> Lenoir - oh you mean
old Sooty,' said Julian. 'Yes - he's in Dick's form, sir. Mad as a hatter.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Sooty!
Now why do you call him that?' said Uncle Quentin. 'It seems a silly name for a
boy.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'If
you saw him you wouldn't think so,' said Dick, with a laugh. 'He's awfully
dark! Hair as black as soot, eyes like bits of coal, eyebrows that look as if
they've been put in with charcoal. And his name means &quot;The black
one,&quot; doesn't it? Le-noir - that's French for black.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes.
Quite true. But what a name to give anyone -Sooty \' said Uncle Quentin. 'Well,
I've been having quite a lot of correspondence with this boy's father. He and I
are interested in the same scientific matters. In fact, I've asked him whether
he wouldn't like to come and stay with me a few days - and bring his boy, Pierre.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
really!' said Dick, looking quite pleased. 'Well, it wouldn't be bad sport to
have old Sooty here, Uncle. But he's quite mad. He never does as he's told, he
climbs like a monkey, and he can be awfully cheeky. I don't know if you'd like
him much.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin looked sorry he had asked Sooty after he had heard what Dick had to
say. He didn't like cheeky boys. Nor did he like mad ones.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'H'm,'
he said, putting the letter away. 'I wish I'd asked you about the boy first,
before suggesting to his father that he might bring him with him. But perhaps I
can prevent him coming.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,
don't, Father,' said George, who rather likecl the sound of Sooty Lenoir.
'Let's have him. He could come out with us and liven things up!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We'll
see,' said her father, who had already made up his mind on no account to have
the boy at Kirrin Cottage,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>if
he was mad, climbed everywhere, and was cheeky. George was enough of a handful
without a madcap of a boy egging her on!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Much
to the children's relief Uncle Quentin retired to read by himself about eight
o'clock. Aunt Fanny looked at the clock.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Time
for Anne to go to bed,' she said. 'And you too, George.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Just
one good game of Slap-Down Patience, all of us playing it together, Mother!'
said George. 'Come on -you play it too. It's our first evening at home. Anyway,
I shan't sleep for ages, with this gale howling round! Come on, Mother- one
good game, then we'll go to bed. Julian's been yawning like anything already!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
SHOCK IN THE NIGHT<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>IT
was nice to climb up the steep stairs to their familiar bedrooms that night.
All the children were yawning widely. Their long train journey had tired them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'If
only this awful wind would stop!' said Anne, pulling the curtain aside and
looking out into the night. 'There's a little moon, George. It keeps bobbing
out between the scurrying clouds.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Let
it bob!' said George, scrambling into bed. I'm jolly cold. Hurry, Anne, or
you'll catch a chill at that window.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Don't
the waves make a noise?' said Anne, still at the window. 'And the gale in the
old ash-tree is making a whistling, howling sound, and bending it right over.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Timmy,
hurry up and get on my bed,' commanded George, screwing up her cold toes.
'That's one good thing about being at home, Anne. I can have Timmy on my bed!
He's far better than a hot water bottle.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You're
not supposed to have him on your bed at home, any more than you're supposed to
at school,' said Anne, curling up in bed. 'Aunt Fanny thinks he sleeps in his
basket over there.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
I can't stop him coming on my bed at night, can I, if he doesn't want to sleep
in his basket?' said George. 'That's right, Timmy darling. Make my feet warm.
Where's your nose? Let me pat it. Good-night, Tim. Good-night, Anne.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Good-night,'
said Anne, sleepily. 'I hope that Sooty boy comes, don't you? He does sound
fun.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yes.
And anyway father would stay in with Mr. Lenoir, the boy's father, and not come
out with us,' said George. 'Father doesn't mean to, but he does spoil things
somehow.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'He's
not very good at laughing,' said Anne. 'He's too serious.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
loud bang made both girls jump. 'That's the bathroom door!' said George, with a
groan. 'One of the boys must have left it open. That's the sort of noise that
drives Father mad! There it goes again!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
let Julian or Dick shut it,' said Anne, who was now beginning to feel nice and
warm. But Julian and Dick were thinking that George or Anne might shut it, so
nobody got out of bed to see to the banging door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Very
soon Uncle Quentin's voice roared up the stairs, louder than the gale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Shut
that door, one of you! How can I work with that noise going on!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
four children jumped out of bed like a shot. Timmy leapt off George's bed.
Everyone fell over him as they rushed to the bathroom door. There was a lot of
giggling and scuffling. Then Uncle Quentin's footsteps were heard on the stairs
and the five fled silently to their looms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
gale still roared. Uncle Quentin and Aunt Fanny came up to bed. The bedroom
door flew out of Uncle Quentin's hand and slammed itself shut so violently that
a vase leapt off a nearby shelf.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin leapt too, startled. 'This wretched gale!' he said, fiercely. 'Never
known one like it all the time we've been here. If it gets much worse the
fishermen's boats will be smashed up, even though' they've pulled them as high
up the beach as possible.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It
will blow itself out soon, dear,' said Aunt Fanny,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>soothingly.
'Probably by the time morning comes it will be quite calm.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
she was wrong. The gale did not blow itself out that night. Instead it raged
round the house even more fiercely, shrieking and howling like a live thing.
Nobody could sleep. Timmy kept up a continuous low growling, for he did not
like the shakes and rattles and howls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Towards
dawn the wind seemed in a fury. Anne thought it sounded as if it was in a
horrible temper, out to do all the harm it could. She lay and trembled,
half-frightened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly
there was a strange noise. It was a loud and woeful groaning and creaking, like
someone in great pain. The two girls sat up, terrified. What could it be?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys heard it too. Julian leapt out of bed and ran to the window. Outside stood
the old ash tree, tall and black in the fitful moonlight. It was gradually
bending over!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
the ash! It's falling!' yelled Julian, almost startling Dick out of his wits.
'It's falling, I tell you. It'll crash on the house! Quick, warn the girls!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Shouting
at the top of his voice, Julian raced out of his door on to the landing.
'Uncle! Aunt! George and Anne! Come downstairs quickly! The ash tree is
falling!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
jumped out of bed, snatched at her dressing-gown, and raced to the door,
yelling to Anne. The little girl was soon with her. Timmy ran in front. At the
door of Aunt Fanny's bedroom Uncle Quentin appeared, tall and amazed, wrapping
his dressing-gown round him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What's
all this noise? Julian, what's happening?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Aunt
Fanny! Come downstairs - the ash tree is falling! Listen to its terrible groans
and creaks!' yelled Julian, almost beside himself with impatience. 'It'll smash<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>in
the room and the bedrooms! Listen, here it comes!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
fled downstairs as, with an appalling wail, the great ash tree hauled up its
roots and fell heavily on to Kirrin Cottage. There was a terrible crash, and
the sound of tiles slipping to the ground everywhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
dear!' said poor Aunt Fanny, covering her eyes. 'I knew something would happen!
Quentin, we ought to have had that ash tree topped. I knew it would fall in a
great gale like this. What has it done to the roof?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
the great crash there had come other smaller noises, sounds of things falling,
thuds and little smashing noises. The children could not imagine what was
happening. Timmy was thoroughly angry, and barked loudly. Uncle Quentin slapped
his hand angrily on the table, and made everyone jump.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Stop
that dog barking! I'll turn him out!' But nothing would stop Timmy barking or
growling that night, and George at last pushed him into the warm kitchen, and
shut the door on him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
feel like barking or growling myself,' said Anne, who knew exactly what Timmy
felt like. 'Julian, has the tree broken in the roof?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin took a powerful torch and went carefully up the stairs to the landing
to see what damage had been done. He came down looking rather pale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'The
tree has crashed through the attic, smashed the roof in, and wrecked the girls'
bedroom,' he said. 'A big branch has penetrated the boys' room too, but not
badly, But the girls' room is ruined! They would have been killed if they had
been in their beds.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
was silent. It was an awful thought that George and Anne had had such a narrow
escape.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Good
thing I yelled my head off to warn them, then,' said Julian, cheerfully, seeing
how white Anne had gone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Cheer
up, Anne - think what a tale you'll have to tell at school next term.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
think some hot cocoa would do us all good,' said Aunt Fanny, pulling herself
together, though she felt very shaken. 'I'll go and make some. Quentin, see if
the fire is still alight in your study. We want a little warmth!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
fire was still alight. Everyone crowded round it. They welcomed Aunt Fanny when
she came in with some steaming milk-cocoa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
looked curiously round the room as she sat sipping her drink. This was where
her uncle did his work, his very clever work. He wrote his difficult books
here, books which Anne could not understand at all. He drew his queer diagrams
here, and made many strange experiments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
just at the moment Uncle Quentin did not look very clever. He looked rather
ashamed, somehow. Anne soon knew why.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Quentin,
it is a mercy none of us was hurt or killed,' said Aunt Fanny, looking at him
rather sternly. *I told you a dozen times you should get that ash tree topped.
I knew it was too big and heavy to withstand a great gale. I was always afraid
it would blow down on the house.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,
I know, my dear,' said Uncle Quentin, stirring his cup of cocoa very
vigorously. 'But I was so busy these last months.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
always make that an excuse for not doing urgent things,' said Aunt Fanny, with
a sigh. 'I shall have to manage things myself in the future. I can't risk our
lives like this!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
a thing like this would only happen once in a blue moon!' cried Uncle Quentin,
getting angry. Then he calmed down, seeing that Aunt Fanny was really<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>shocked
and upset, very near to tears. He put down his cocoa and slipped his arm round
her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You've
had a terrible shock,' he said. 'Don't you worry about things. Maybe they won't
be so bad when morning comes.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
Quentin - they'll be much worse!' said his wife. 'Where shall we sleep tonight,
all of us, and what shall we do till the roof and upstairs rooms are repaired?
The children have only just come home. The house will be full of workmen for
weeks! I don't know how I'm going to manage.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Leave
it all to me!' said Uncle Quentin. 'I'll settle everything. Don't you worry.
I'm sorry about this, very sorry, particularly as it's my fault. But I'll
straighten things out for everyone, you just see!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Aunt
Fanny didn't really believe him, but she was grateful for his comforting. The
children listened in silence, drinking their hot cocoa. Uncle Quentin was so
very clever, and knew so many things - but it was so like him to neglect
something urgent like cutting off the top of the old ash tree. Sometimes he
didn't seem to live in this world at all!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was no use going up to bed! The rooms upstairs were either completely ruined,
or so messed up with bits and pieces, and clouds of dust, that it was
impossible to sleep there. Aunt Fanny began to pile rugs on sofas. There was
one in the study, a big one in the sitting-room and a smaller one in the
dining-room. She found a camp bed in a cupboard and, with Julian's help, put
that up too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We'll
just have to do the best we can,' she said. 'There isn't much left of the
night, but we'll get a little sleep if we can! The gale is not nearly so wild
now.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No
- it's done all the damage it can, so it's satisfied,'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>said
Uncle Quentin, grimly. 'Well, we'll talk things over in the morning.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children found it very difficult to go to sleep after such an excitement, tired
though they were. Anne felt worried. How could they all stay at Kirrin Cottage
now? It wouldn't be fair on Aunt Fanny. But they couldn't go home because her
father and mother were both away and the house was shut up for a month.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
hope we shan't be sent back to school,' thought Anne, trying to get comfortable
on the sofa. 'It would be too awful, after having left there, and started off
so gaily for the holidays.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was afraid of that, too. She felt sure that they would all be packed back to
their schools the next morning. That would mean that she and Anne wouldn't see
Julian and Dick any more those holidays, for the boys, of course, went to a
different school.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was the only one who didn't worry about things. He lay on George's feet,
snoring a little, quite happy. So long as he was with George he didn't really
mind where he went!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

QUENTIN HAS AN IDEA<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>NEXT
morning the wind was still high, but the fury of the gale was gone. The
fishermen on the beach were relieved to find that their boats had suffered very
little damage. But word soon went round about the accident to Kirrm Cottage,
and a few sightseers came up to marvel at the sight of the great, uprooted
tree, lying heavily on the little house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children rather enjoyed the importance of relating how nearly they had escaped
with their lives. In the light<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of
day it was surprising what damage the big tree had done. It had cracked the
roof of the house like an eggshell, and the rooms upstairs were in a terrible
mess.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
woman who came up from the village to help Aunt Fanny during the day exclaimed
at the sight: 'Why, Mam, it'll take weeks to set that right!' she said. 'Have
you got on to the builders, Mam? I'd get them up here right away and let them
see what's to be done.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I'm
seeing to things, Mrs. Daly,' said Uncle Quentin. 'My wife has had a great
shock. She is not fit to see to things herself. The first thing to do is to
decide what is to happen to the children. They can't remain here while there
are no usable bedrooms.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'They
had better go back to school, poor things,' said Aunt Fanny.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No.
I've a better idea than that,' said Uncle Quentin, fishing a letter out of his
pocket. 'Much better. I've had a letter from that fellow Lenoir this morning -
you know, the one who's interested in the same kind of experiments as I am. He
says - er, wait a minute, I'll read you the bit. Yes, here it is.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin read it out: 'It is most kind of you to suggest my coming to stay with
you and bringing my boy Pierre. Allow me to extend hospitality to you and your
children also. I do not know how many you have, but all are welcome here in
this big house. My Pierre will be glad of company, and so will his sister,
Marybelle.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin looked up triumphantly at his wife. 'There you are! I call that a most
generous invitation! It couldn't have come at a better time. We'll pack the
whole of the children off to this fellow's house.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'But
Quentin - you can't possibly do that! Why, we don't know anything about him or
his family!' said Aunt Fanny.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'His
boy goes to the same school as Julian and Dick, and I know Lenoir is a
remarkable, clever fellow,' said Uncle Quentin, as if that was all that really
mattered. 'I'll telephone him now. What's his number?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Aunt
Fanny felt helpless in face of her husband's sudden determination to settle
everything himself. He was ashamed because it was his forgetfulness that had
brought on the accident to the house. Now he was going to show that he could
see to things if he liked. She heard him telephoning, and frowned. How could
they possibly send off the children to a strange place like that?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin put down the receiver, and went to find his wife, looking jubilant and
very pleased with himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
all settled,' he said. 'Lenoir is delighted, most delighted. Says he loves
children about the place, and so does his wife, and his two will be thrilled to
have them. If we can hire a car today, they can go at once.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'But,
Quentin - we can't let them go off like that to strange people! They'll hate
it! I shouldn't be surprised if George refuses to go,' said his wife.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
- that reminds me. She's not to take Timothy,* said Uncle Quentin. 'Apparently
Lenoir doesn't like dogs.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
then, you know George won't go!' said his wife. 'That's foolish, Quentin.
George won't go anywhere without Timmy.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'She'll
have to, this time,' said Uncle Quentin, quite determined that George should
not upset all his marvellous plans. 'Here are the children. I'll ask them what
they feel about going, and see what they say!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
called them into his study. They came in, feeling sure that they were to hear
bad news - probably they were all to return to school!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
remember that boy I spoke to you about last<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>night?'
began Uncle Quentin. Pierre Lenoir. You had some absurd name for him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Sooty,'
said Dick and Julian together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Ah
yes, Sooty. Well, his father has kindly invited you all to go and stay with him
at Smuggler's Top,' said Uncle Quentin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children were astonished.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Smuggler's
Top!' said Dick, his fancy caught by the queer name. 'What's Smuggler's Top?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'The
name of his house/ said Uncle Quentin. 'It's very old, built on the top of a
queer hill surrounded by marshes over which the sea once flowed. The hill was
once an island, but now it's just a tall hill rising up from the marsh.
Smuggling went on there in the old days. It's a very peculiar place, so I've
heard.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
this made the children feel excited. Also Julian and Dick had always liked
Sooty Lenoir. He was quite mad, but awfully good fun. They might have a
first-rate time with him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
- would you like to go? Or would you rather go back to school for the
holidays?' asked Uncle Quentin impatiently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
no - not back to school!' said everyone at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I'd
love to go to Smuggler's Top,' said Dick. 'It sounds a thrilling place. And I
always liked old Sooty, especially since he sawed half through one of the legs
of our form-master's chair. It gave way at once when Mr. Toms sat down!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'H'm.
I don't see that a trick like that is any reason for liking someone,' said
Uncle Quentin, beginning to feel a little doubtful about Master Lenoir.
'Perhaps, on the whole, school would be best for you.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
no, no!' cried everyone. 'Let's go to Smuggler's Top! Do, do let's!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Very
well,' said &quot;Uncle Quentin, pleased at their eagerness to follow his plan.
'As a matter of fact, I have already settled it. I telephoned a few minutes
ago. Mr. Lenoir was very kind about it all.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Can
I take Timmy?' asked George, suddenly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,'
said her father. I'm afraid not. Mr. Lenoir doesn't like dogs.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Then
I shouldn't like him' said George, sulkily. 'I won't go without Timmy.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You'll
have to go back to school, then,' said her father, sharply. 'And take off that
sulky expression, George. You know how I dislike it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
George wouldn't. She turned away. The others looked at her in dismay. Surely
old George wasn't going to get into one of her moods, and spoil everything! It
would be fun to go to Smuggler's Top. But, of course, it certainly wouldn't be
so much fun without Timmy. Still - they couldn't all go back to school just
because George wouldn't go anywhere without her dog.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went into the sitting-room. Anne put her arm through George's. George shook
it off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'George!
You simply must come with us,' said Anne, 'I can't bear to go without you - it
would be awful to see you going back to school all alone.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
shouldn't be all alone,' said George. 'I should have Timmy.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others pressed her to change her mind, but she shook them off. 'Leave me alone,'
she said. 'I want to think. How are we supposed to get to Smuggler's Top, and
where is it? Which road do we take?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We're
going by car, and it's right up the coast somewhere, so I expect we'll take the
coast-road,' said Julian. 'Why, George?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Don't
ask questions,' said George. She went out with<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy.
The others didn't follow her. George was not very nice when she was cross.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Aunt
Fanny began to pack for them, though it was impossible to get some of the
things from the girls' room. After a time George came back, but Jimmy was not
with her. She looked more cheerful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Where's
Tim?' asked Anne, at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Out
somewhere,' said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Are
you coming with us, George?' asked Julian, looking at her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes.
I've made up my mind to,' said George, but for some reason she wouldn't look
Julian in the eyes. He wondered why.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Aunt
Fanny gave them all an early lunch, and then a big car came for them. They
packed themselves inside. Uncle Quentin gave them all sorts of messages for Mr.
Lenoir, and Aunt Fanny kissed them good-bye. 'I do hope you have a nice time at
Smuggler's Top,' she said. 'Mind you write at once and tell me all about it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Aren't
we going to say good-bye to Timmy?' said Anne, her eyes opening wide in
amazement at George forgetting. 'George, surely you're not going without saying
good-bye to old Timmy!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Can't
stop now,' said Uncle Quentin, afraid that George might suddenly become awkward
again. 'Right, driver! You can go off now. Don't drive too fast, please.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Waving
and shouting the children drove away from Kirrin Cottage, sad when they looked
back and saw the smashed roof under the fallen tree. Never mind - they had not
been sent back to school. That was the main thing. Their spirits rose as they
thought of Sooty and his queerly-named home, Smuggler's Top.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Smuggler's
Top! It sounds too exciting for words!' said Anne. 'I can picture it, an old
house right on the top<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of
a hill. Fancy being an island once. I wonder why the sea went back and left
marshes instead.3<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
said nothing for a while, and the car speeded on. The others glanced at her
once or twice, but came to the conclusion that she was grieving about Timmy.
Still she didn't look very sad!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
car went over a hill and speeded down to the bottom. When they got there George
leaned forward and touched the driver's arm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Would
you stop a moment, please? We have to pick somebody up here.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian,
Dick and Anne stared at George in surprise. The driver, also rather surprised,
drew the car to a standstill. George opened the car door and gave a loud
whistle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Something
shot out of the hedge and hurled itself joyfully into the car. It was Timmy! He
licked everyone, trod on everyone's toes, and gave the little short barks that
showed he was excited and happy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,'
said the driver, doubtfully, 'I don't know if you're supposed to take that dog
in, Miss. Your father didn't say anything about him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
all right,' said George, her face red with joy. 'Quite all right. You needn't
worry. Start the car again, please.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
are a monkey!' said Julian, half-annoyed with George, and half-pleased because
Timmy was with them after all. 'Mr. Lenoir may send him back, you know.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
he'll have to send me back too,' said George, defiantly. 'Anyhow, the main
thing is, we've got Timmy after all, and I am coming with you.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes
- that's fine,' said Anne, and gave first George and then Timmy a hug. I didn't
like going without Tim either.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'On
to Smuggler's Top!' said Dick, as the car started off again. 'On to Smuggler's
Top. I wonder if we shall have any adventures there!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Four SMUGGLER'S TOP<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THE
car sped on, mostly along the coast, though it sometimes went inland for a few
miles. But, sooner or later it was in sight of the sea again. The children
enjoyed the long drive. They were to stop somewhere for lunch, and the driver
told them he knew of a good inn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
half past twelve he drew up outside an old inn, and they all trooped in. Julian
took charge, and ordered lunch. It was a very good one, and all the children
enjoyed it. So did Timmy. The innkeeper liked dogs, and put down such a
piled-up plate for Timmy that the dog hardly liked to begin on his meal in case
it was not for him!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
looked up at George and she nodded to him. 'It's your dinner, Timmy. Eat it
up.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
he ate it, hoping that if they were going to stay anywhere they might be
staying at the inn. Meals like this did not arrive every day for a hungry dog!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
after lunch the children got up. They went to find the driver, who was having
his lunch in the kitchen with the innkeeper and his wife. They were old friends
of his.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
I hear you're going to Castaway,' said the innkeeper, getting up. 'You be
careful there!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Castaway!'
said Julian. 'Is that what the hill is called, where Smuggler's Top is?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'That's
its name,' said the innkeeper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Why
is it called that?' said Anne. 'What a funny name! Were people cast away on it
once, when it was an island?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
no. The old story goes that the hill was once joined to the mainland,' said the
innkeeper. 'But it was the haunt of bad people, and one of the saints became
angry with the place, and cast it away into the sea, where it became an
island.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'And
so it was called Castaway,' said Dick. 'But perhaps it has got good again,
because the sea has gone away from it, and you can walk from the mainland to
the hill, can't you?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes.
There's one good road you can take,' said the innkeeper. 'But you be careful of
wandering away from it, if you go walking on it! The marsh will suck you down,
in no time if you set foot on it!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It
does sound a most exciting place,' said George. 'Smuggler's Top on Castaway
Hill! Only one road to it!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Time
to get on,' said the driver, looking at the clock. 'You've got to be there
before tea, your uncle said.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
got into the car again, Timmy clambering over legs and feet to a comfortable
place on George's lap. He was far too big and heavy to lie there but just
occasionally he seemed to want to, and George never had the heart to refuse
him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
drove off once more. Anne fell asleep, and the others felt drowsy too. The car
purred on and on. It began to rain, and the countryside looked rather dreary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
driver turned round after a while and spoke to Julian. 'We're coming near to
Castaway Hill, sir. We'll soon be leaving the mainland, and taking the road
across the marsh.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
woke Anne. They all sat up expectantly. But it was very disappointing after
all! The marshes were full of mist! The children could not pierce through it
with their eyes, and could only see the flat road they were on, raised a little
higher than the surrounding flat marsh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
the mist shifted a little now and again the children saw a dreary space of flat
marsh on either side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Stop
a minute, driver,' said Julian. I'd like to see what the marsh is like.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
don't step off the road,' warned the driver, stopping the car. 'And don't you
let that dog out, Miss. Once he runs off the road and gets into the marsh he'll
be gone for good.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
do you mean - gone for good?' said Anne, her eyes wide.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'He
means the marsh will suck down Timmy at once,' said Julian. 'Shut him in the
car, George.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
Timmy, much to his disgust, was shut safely in the car. He pawed at the door,
and tried to look out of the window. The driver turned and spoke to him. 'It's
all right. They'll be back soon old fellow!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timmy whined all the time the others were out of the car. He saw them go to the
edge of the road. He saw Julian jump down the couple of feet that raised the
road above the marsh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a line of raised stones running in the marsh alongside the road. Julian
stood on one of these peering at the flat marsh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
mud,' he said. 'Loose, squelchy mud! Look, when I touch it with my foot it
moves! It would soon suck me down if I trod heavily on it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
didn't like it. She called to Julian. 'Come up on the road again. I'm afraid
you'll fall in.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mists
were wreathing and swirling over the salty marshes. It was a weird place, cold
and damp. None of the children liked it. Timmy began to bark in the car.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Tim
will scratch the car to bits if we don't get back,' said George. So they all
went back, rather silent. Julian<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>wondered
how many travellers had been lost in that strange sea-marsh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
there's many that's never been heard of again,' said the driver, when they
asked him. 'They do say there's one or two winding paths that go to the hill
from the mainland, that were used before the road was built. But unless you
know every inch of them you're off them in a trice, and find your feet sinking
in the mud.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
horrid to think about,' said Anne. 'Don't let's talk about it any more. Can we
see Castaway Hill yet?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes.
There it is, looming up in the mist,' said the driver. 'The top of it is out of
the mist, see? Queer place, isn't it?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children looked in silence. Out of the slowly moving mists rose,a tall, steep
hill, whose rocky sides were as steep as cliffs. The hill seemed to swim in the
mists, and to have no roots in the earth. It was covered with buildings which
even at that distance looked old and quaint. Some of them had towers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'That
must be Smuggler's Top, right at the summit,' said Julian, pointing. 'It's like
an old building of centuries ago - probably is! Look at the tower it has. What
a wonderful view you'd get from it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children gazed at the place where they were to stay. It looked exciting and
picturesque, certainly - but it also looked rather forbidding.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
sort of - sort of secret, somehow,' said Anne, putting into words what the
others were thinking. 'I mean it looks as if it had kept all kinds of queer
secrets down the centuries. I guess it could tell plenty of tales!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
car drove on again, quite slowly, because the mists came down thickly. The road
had a line of sparkling round buttons set all along the middle, and when the

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>him
well. Then as they neared Castaway Hill the road began to slope upwards.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
go through a big archway soon,' said the driver. 'That used to be where the
city gate once was. The whole town is surrounded by wall still, just as it used
to be in olden times. It's wide enough to walk on, and if you start at a
certain place, and walk long enough, you'll come round to the place you started
at!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
the children made up their minds to do this without fail. What a view they
would have all round the hill, if they chose a fine day!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
road became steeper, and the driver put the engine into a lower gear. It
groaned up the hill. Then it came to an archway, from which old gates were
fastened back. It passed through, and the children were in Castaway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
almost as if we've gone back through the centuries, and come to somewhere that
existed ages ago!' said Julian, peering at the old houses and shops, with their
cobbled streets, their diamond-paned windows, and stout old doors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went up the winding high street, and came at last to a big gateway, set with
wrought-iron gates. The driver hooted and they opened. They swept into a steep
drive, and at last stopped before Smuggler's Top.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
got out, feeling suddenly shy. The big old house seemed to frown down at them.
It was built of brick and timber, and its front door was as massive as that of
a castle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Queer
gables jutted here and there over the diamond-paned windows. The house's one
tower stood sturdily at the east side of the house, with windows all round. It
was not a square tower, but a rounded one, and ended in a point.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Smuggler's
Top!' said Julian. 'It's a good name for it somehow. I suppose lots of
smuggling went on here in the old days.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
rang the bell. To do this he had to pull down an iron handle, and a jangling at
once made itself heard in the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was the sound of running feet, and the door was opened. It opened slowly, for
it was heavy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Beyond
it stood two children, one a girl of about Anne's age, and the other a boy of
Dick's age.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Here
you are at last!' cried the boy, his dark eyes dancing. 'I thought you were
never coming!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'This
is Sooty,' said Dick to the girls, who had not met him before. They stared at
him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was certainly very very dark. Black hair, black eyes, black eyebrows, and a
brown face. In contrast to him the girl beside him looked pale and delicate.
She had golden hair, blue eyes and her eyebrows were so faint they could hardly
be seen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'This
is Marybelle, my sister,' said Sooty. 'I always think we look like Beauty and
the Beast!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
was nice. Everyone liked him at once. George found herself twinkling at him in
a way quite strange to her, for usually she was shy of strangers, and would not
make friends for some time. But who could help liking Sooty with his dancing
black eyes and his really wicked grin?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Come
in,' said Sooty. 'Driver, you can take the car round to the next door, and
Block will take in the luggage for you and give you tea.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly
Sooty's face lost its smile and grew very solemn. He had seen Timmy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
say! I say - that's not your dog, is it?' he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'He's
mine,' said George, and she laid a protecting-hand<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>on
Timmy's head. 'I had to bring him. I can't go anywhere without him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,
but - no dog's allowed at Smuggler's Top,' said Sooty, still looking very
worried, and glancing behind him as if he was afraid someone might come along
and see Timmy. 'My stepfather won't allow any dogs here. Once I brought in a
stray one and he licked me till I couldn't sit down - my stepfather licked me,
I mean, not the dog.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
gave a frightened little smile at the poor joke. George looked stubborn and
sulky.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
thought -1 thought maybe we could hide him somewhere while we were here,' she
said. 'But if that's how you feel, I'll go back home with the car. Good-bye.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
turned and went after the car, which was backing away. Timmy went with her.
Sooty stared, and then he yelled after her. 'Come back, stupid! We'll think of
something!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Five SOOTY LENOIR<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>SOOTY
ran down the steps that led to the front door, and tore after George. The
others followed. Marybelle went too, shutting the big front door behind her
carefully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a small door in the wall just where George was. Sooty caught hold of her
and pushed her roughly through the door, holding it open for the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Don't
shove me like that,' began George, angrily. 'Timmy will bite you if you push me
about.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,
he won't,' said Sooty, with a cheerful grin. 'Dogs like me. Even if I boxed
your ears your dog would only wag his tail at me.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children found themselves in a dark passage. There was a door at the farther
end. 'Wait here a minute and I'll see if the coast is clear,' said Sooty. 'I
know my stepfather is in, and I tell you, if he sees that dog he'll pack you
all into the car again, and send you back! And I don't want him to do that
because I can't tell you how I've looked forward to having you all!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
grinned at them, and their hearts warmed towards him again, even George's,
though she still felt angry at being so roughly pushed. She kept Timmy close
beside her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
the same everyone felt a bit scared of Mr. Lenoir. He sounded rather a fierce
sort of person!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
tiptoed to the door at the end of the passage and opened it. He peeped into the
room there, and then came back to the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'All
clear,' he said. 'We'll take the secret passage to my<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>bedroom.
No one will see us then, and once we're there we can make plans to hide the
dog. Ready?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
secret passage sounded thrilling. Feeling rather as if they were in an
adventure story, the children went quietly to the door and into the room
beyond. It was a dark, oak-panelled room, evidently a study of some sort, for
there was a big desk there, and the walls were lined with books. There was no
one there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
went to one of the oak panels in the wall, felt along it deftly, and pressed in
a certain place. The panel slid softly aside. Sooty put in his hand and pulled
at something. A much larger panel below slid into the wall, and left an opening
big enough for the children to pass through.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Come
on,' said Sooty in a low voice. 'Don't make a row.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Feeling
excited, the children all passed through the opening. Sooty came last, and did
something that shut the opening and slid the first panel back into its place
again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
switched on a small torch, for it was pitch dark where the children were
standing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were in a narrow stone passage, so narrow that two people could not possibly
have passed one another unless both were as thin as rakes. Sooty passed his torch
along to Julian, who was in front.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Keep
straight on till you come to stone steps,' he said. 'Go up them, turn to the
right at the top, and keep straight on till you come to a blank wall, then I'll
tell you what to do.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
led the way, holding up the torch for the others. The narrow passage ran
straight, and came to some stone steps. It was not only very narrow but rather
low, so that Anne and Marybelle were the only ones who did not have to bend
their heads.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
didn't like it very much. She never liked being in a very narrow enclosed
space. It reminded her of dreams she sometimes had of being somewhere she
couldn't get away from. She was glad when Julian spoke. 'The steps are here. Up
we go, everyone.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Don't
make a row,' said Sooty, in a. low voice. 'We're passing the dining-room now.
There's a way into this passage from there too.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
fell silent, and tried to walk on tiptoe, though this was unexpectedly
difficult when heads had to be bent and shoulders stooped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
climbed up fourteen steps, which were quite steep, and curved round half-way.
Julian turned to the right at the top. The passage ran upwards then, and was as
narrow as before. Julian felt certain that a very fat person could not possibly
get along it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went on until, with a start, he almost bumped into a blank stone wall! He
flashed his torch up and down it. A low voice came from the back of the line of
children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You've
got to the blank wall, Julian. Shine your torch up to where the roof of the
passage meets the wall. You will see an iron handle there. Press down on it
hard.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
flashed his torch up and saw the handle. He put his torch into his left hand,
and grasped the thick iron handle with his right. He pressed down as hard as he
could.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And,
quite silently, the great stone in the middle of the wall slid forward and
sideways, leaving a gaping hole.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was astonished. He let go the iron handle and flashed his torch into the hole.
There was nothing but darkness there!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
all right it leads into a big cupboard in my bedroom!' called Sooty from the
back. 'Get through, Julian, and we'll follow. There won't be anyone in my
room.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
crawled through the hole and found himself in a spacious cupboard, hung with
Booty's clothes. He groped his way through them and bumped against a door. He
opened it and at once daylight flooded into the cupboard, lighting up the way
from the passage into the room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
by one the others clambered through the hole, lost themselves in clothes for a
moment and then went thankfully into the room through the cupboard door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy,
puzzled and silent, followed close beside George. He had not liked the dark,
narrow passage very much. He was glad to be in daylight again!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty,
coming last, carefully closed the opening into the passage by pressing the
stone back. It worked easily, though Julian could not imagine how. There must
be some sort of pivot, he thought.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
joined the others in his bedroom, grinning. George had her hand on Timmy's
collar. 'It's all right, George,' said Sooty. 'We're quite safe here. My room
and Marybelle's are separate from the rest of the house. We're in a wing on our
own, reached by a long passage!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
opened the door and showed the others what he meant. There was a room next to
his, which was Mary-belle's. Beyond stretched a stone-floored, stone-walled
passage, laid with mats. At the end of it a big window let in light. There was
a door there, a great oak one, which was shut.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'See?
We're quite safe here, all by ourselves,' said Sooty. 'Timmy could bark if he
liked, and no one would know.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'But
doesn't anyone ever come?' said Anne, surprised. 'Who keeps your rooms tidy,
and cleans them?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
Sarah comes and does that every morning,' said Sooty. 'But usually no one else
comes. And anyway, I've got a way of knowing when anyone opens that door!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
pointed to the door at the end of the passage. The others stared at him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'How
do you know?&quot; said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I've
rigged up something that makes a buzzing noise here, in my room, as soon as
that door is opened,' said Sooty, proudly. 'Look, I'll go along and open it,
while you stay here and listen.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
sped along the passage and opened the heavy door at the end. Immediately a low
buzzing noise sounded somewhere in his room, and made everyone jump. Timmy was
startled too, pricked up his ears, and growled fiercely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
shut the door and ran back. 'Did you hear the noise? It's a good idea, isn't
it? I'm always thinking of things like that.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others thought they had come to rather a queer place! They stared round Sooty's
bedroom, which was quite ordinary in its furnishings, and in its general
untidiness. There was a big diamond-paned window, and Anne went to look out of
it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
gave a gasp. She had not expected to look down such a precipice! Smuggler's Top
was built at the summit of the hill, and, on the side where Sooty's bedroom
was, the hill fell away steeply, down and down to the marsh below!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
look!' she said. 'Look how steep it is! It really gives me a very queer feeling
to look down there!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others crowded round and looked in silence, for it certainly was strange to
gaze down such a long way. The sun was shining up on the hill-summit, but all
around, as far as they could see, mists hid the marsh and the far-off sea. The
only bit of the marsh that could be seen was far down below, at the bottom of
the steep hill.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'When
the mists are away, you can see over the flat marshes to where the sea begins,'
said Sooty. 'That's quite a fine sight. You can hardly tell where the marsh
ends and sea begins except when the sea is very blue. Fancy, once upon a time,
the sea came right up and around this hill, and it was an island.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes.
The innkeeper told us that,' said George. 'Why did the sea go back and leave
it?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
don't know,' said Sooty. 'People say it's going back farther and farther.
There's a big scheme on foot to drain the marsh, and turn it into fields, but I
don't know if that will ever happen.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
don't like that marsh,' said Anne, with a shiver. 'It looks wicked, somehow.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
whined. George remembered that they must hide him, and make plans for him. She
turned to Sooty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Did
you mean what you said about hiding Tim?' she asked. 'Where shall we put him?
And can he be fed? And how can we exercise him? He's a big dog, you know.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We'll
plan it all,' said Sooty. 'Don't you worry. I love dogs, and I shall be
thrilled to have Timmy here. But I do warn you that if toy stepfather ever
finds out we &quot;shall probably all get a jolly good thrashing, and you'll be
sent home in disgrace.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'But
why doesn't your father like dogs?' said Anne puzzled. 'Is he afraid of them?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,
I don't think so. It's just that he won't have them here in the house,' said
Sooty. 'I think he must have a reason for it, but I don't know what it is. He's
a queer sort of man, my stepfather!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'How
is he queer?' asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
- he seems full of secrets,' said Sooty. 'Queer people come here, and they come
secretly without anyone knowing. I've seen lights shining in our tower on
certain nights, but I don't know who puts them there or why. I've tried to find
out, but I can't.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Do
you think - do you think your father is a smuggler?' said Anne, suddenly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
don't think so,' said Sooty. 'We've got one smuggler here, and everyone knows
him! See that house over there to the right, lower down the hill? Well, that's
where he lives. He's as rich as can be. His name is Barling. Even the police
know his goings-on, but they can't stop him! He is very rich and very powerful,
so he does what he likes - and he won't let anyone play the same game as he<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>plays!
No one else would dare to do any smuggling in Castaway, while he does it!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'This
seems rather an exciting place,' said Julian. 'I have a kind of feeling there
might be an adventure somewhere about!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
no,' said Sooty. 'Nothing ever happens, really. It's only just a feeling you
get here, because the place is so old, so full of secret ways and pits and
passages. Why, the whole hill is mined with passages in the rock, used by the
smugglers of olden times!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,'
began Julian, and stopped very suddenly. Everyone stared at Sooty. His secret
buzzer had suddenly barked from its hidden corner! Someone had opened the door
at the end of the passage!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Six<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>BOOTY'S
STEPFATHER AND MOTHER<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'SOMEONE'S
coming!' said George, in a panic. 'What shall we do with Tim? Quick!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
took Timmy by the collar and shoved him into the old cupboard, and shut the
door on him. 'Keep quiet!' he commanded, and Timmy stood still in the darkness,
the hairs at the back of his neck standing up, his ears cocked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,'
began Sooty, in a bright voice, 'perhaps I'd better show you where your
bedrooms are now!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
door opened and a man came in. He was dressed in black trousers and a white
linen coat. He had a queer face. 'It's a shut face,' thought Anne to herself.
'You can't tell a bit what he's like inside, because his face is all shut and
secret.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
hallo, Block,' said Sooty, airily. He turned to the others. 'This is Block, my
stepfather's man,' he said. 'He's deaf, so you can say what you like, but it's
better not to, because though he doesn't hear he seems to sense what we say.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Anyway,
I think it would be beastly to say things we wouldn't say in front of him if he
wasn't deaf,' said George, who had very strict ideas about things of that sort.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Block
spoke in a curiously monotonous voice. 'Your stepfather and your mother want to
know why you have not brought your friends to see them,' he said. 'Why did you
rush up here like this?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Block
looked all round as he spoke - almost as if he knew there was a dog, and wondered
where he had gone<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>to,
George thought, in alarm. She did hope the car-driver had not mentioned Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
-I was so pleased to see them I took them straight up here!' said Sooty. 'All
right, Block. We'll be down in a minute.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
man went, his face quite impassive. Not a smile, not a frown! 'I don't like
him,' said Anne. 'Has he been with you long?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No
- only about a year,' said Sooty. 'He suddenly appeared one day. Even Mother
didn't know he was coming! He just came, and, without a word, changed into that
white linen coat, and went to do some work in my stepfather's room. I suppose
my stepfather was expecting him - but he didn't say anything to my mother, I'm
sure of that. She seemed so surprised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Is
she your real mother, or a stepmother, too?' asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
don't have a stepmother and a stepfather!' said Sooty, scornfully. 'You only
have one or the other. My mother is my real mother, and she's Marybelle's
mother, too. But Marybelle and I are only half-brother and sister, because my
stepfather is her real father.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
rather muddled,' said Anne, trying to sort it out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Come
on - we'd better go down,' said Sooty, remembering. 'By the Way, my stepfather
is always being very affable, always smiling and joking - but it isn't real,
somehow. He's quite likely to fly into a furious temper at any moment.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
hope we shan't see very much of him,' said Anne5 uncomfortably. 'What's your
mother like, Sooty?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Like
a frightened mouse!' said Sooty. 'You'll like her, all right. She's a darling.
But she doesn't like living here; she doesn't like this house, and she's
terrified of my step-father. She wouldn't say so herself, of course, but I know
she is.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Marybelle,
who was too shy to have joined in any talking until then, nodded her head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
don't like living here, either/ she said. 'I shall be glad when I go to
boarding-school, like Sooty. Except that I shall leave Mother all alone then.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Come
on,' said Sooty, and led the way. 'We'd better ' leave Timmy in the cupboard
till we come back, just in case Block does a bit of snooping. I'll lock the
cupboard door and take the key.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Feeling
rather unhappy at leaving Timmy locked up in the cupboard, the children
followed Sooty and Mary-belle down the stone passage to the oak door. They went
through, and found themselves at the top of a great flight of stairs, wide and
shallow. They went down into a big hall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
the right was a door, and Sooty opened it. He went in and spoke to someone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Here
they all are,' he said. 'Sorry I rushed them off to my bedroom like that,
Father, but I was so excited to see them all!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Your
manners still need a little polishing, Pierre,' said Mr. Lenoir, in a deep
voice. The children looked at him. He sat in a big oak chair, a neat,
clever-looking man, with fair hair brushed upwards, and eyes as blue as
Marybelle's. He smiled all the time, but with his mouth, not his eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
cold eyes!' thought Anne, when she went forward to shake hands with him. His
hand was cold, too. He smiled at her, and patted her on the shoulder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
a nice little girl!' he said. 'You will be a good companion for Marybelle.
Three boys for Sooty, and one girl for Marybelle. Ha ha!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
evidently thought George was a boy, and she did look rather like one - she was
wearing shorts and jersey, as usual, and her curly hair was very short.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
said that George wasn't a boy. Certainly George was not going to! She, Dick and
Julian shook hands with Mr. Lenoir. They had not even noticed Sooty's mother!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
was there, though, sitting lost in an arm-chair, a tiny woman like a doll, with
mouse-coloured hair and grey eyes. Anne turned to her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
how small you are!' she said, before she could stop herself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Lenoir laughed. He laughed no matter what anyone said. Mrs. Lenoir got up and
smiled. She was only as tall as Anne, and had the smallest hands and feet that
Anne had ever seen on a grown-up. Anne liked her. She shook hands, and said,
'It's so nice of you to have us all here like this. You know, I expect, that a
tree fell on the roof of our house and smashed it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Lenoir's laugh came again. He made some kind of joke, and everyone smiled
politely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
I hope you'll have a good time here,' he said. Pierre and Marybelle will show
you the old town, and, if you promise to be careful, you can walk along the
road to the mainland to go to the cinema there.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Thank
you,' said everyone, and Mr. Lenoir laughed his curious laugh again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Your
father is a very clever man,' he said, suddenly turning to Julian, who guessed
that he had mistaken him for George. 'I am hoping he will come here to fetch
you home again when you go, and then I shall have the pleasure of talking with
him. He and I have been doing the same kind of experiments, but he has got
further than I have.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh!'
said Julian, politely. Then the doll-like Mrs. Lenoir spoke in her soft voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Block
will give you all your meals in Marybelle's schoolroom, then you will not
disturb my husband. He does not like talk at meal-times, and that would be
rather hard on six children.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Lenoir laughed again. His cold blue eyes looked intently at all the children.
'By the way, Pierre,' he said suddenly, 'I forbid you to wander about the
catacombs in this hill, as I have forbidden you before, and I also forbid you
to do any of your dare-devil climbing, nor will I have you acting about on the
city wall, now that you have<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>others
here. I will not have them taking risks. Will you promise me this?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
don't act about on the city wall,' protested Sooty. 'I don't take risks,
either.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
play the fool always/ said Mr. Lenoir, and the tip of his nose turned quite
white. Anne looked at it with interest. She did not know that it always did
this when Mr. Lenoir got angry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
sir - I was top of my form last term,' said Sooty, in a most injured tone. The
others felt certain that he was trying to lead Mr. Lenoir away from his request
- he was not going to promise him what he had asked!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Lenoir now joined in. 'He really did do well last term,' she said. 'You must
remember -'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Enough!'
snapped Mr. Lenoir, and the smiles and laughs he had so freely lavished on
everyone vanished, entirely. 'Get out, all of you!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Rather
scared, Julian, Dick, Anne and George hurried from the room, followed by
Marybelle and Sooty. Sooty was grinning as he shut the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
didn't promise!' he said. 'He wanted to take all our fun away. This place isn't
any fun if you don't explore it. I can show you heaps of queer places.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
are catacombs?' asked Anne, with a vague picture of cats and combs in her head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Winding,
secret tunnels in the hill,' said Sooty. 'Nobody knows them all. You can get
lost in them easily, and never get out again. Lots of people have.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Why
are there so many secret ways and things here?' wondered George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Easy!'
said Julian. 'It was a haunt of smugglers, and there must have been many a time
when they had to hide not only their goods, but themselves! And, according to
old Sooty, there still is a smuggler here!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
did you say his name was - Barling, wasn't it?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,'
said Sooty. 'Come on upstairs and I'll show you your rooms. You've got a good
view over the town.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
took them to two rooms set side by side, on the opposite side of the big
staircase from his bedroom and Marybelle's. They were small but well-furnished,
and had, as Sooty said, a marvellous view over the quaint roofs and towers of
Castaway Hill. They also had a remarkably good view of Mr. Barling's house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
and Anne were to sleep in one room, and Julian and Dick in the other. Evidently
Mrs. Lenoir had taken the trouble to remember that there were two girls and two
boys, not one girl and three boys, as Mr. Lenoir imagined!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Nice
cosy rooms,' said Anne. 'I like these dark oak panels. Are there any secret
passages in our rooms, Sooty?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
wait and see!' grinned Sooty. 'Look, there are your things, all unpacked from
your suitcases. I expect Sarah did that. You'll like Sarah. She's a good sort,
fat and round and jolly - not a bit like Block!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
seemed to have forgotten all about Tim. George reminded him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
about Timmy? He'll have to be near me, you know. And we must arrange to feed
him and exercise him. Oh, I do hope he'll be all right, Sooty, I'd rather leave
straight away than have Timmy unhappy.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'He'll
be all right!' said Sooty. Til give him the free run of that narrow passage we
came up to my bedroom by, and we'll feed him every chance we get. And we'll
smuggle him out by a secret tunnel that opens half-way down the town, and give
him plenty of exercise each morning. Oh, we'll have a grand time with Timmy!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
wasn't so sure. 'Can he sleep with me at night?' she asked. 'He'll howl the
place down if he can't.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
- we'll try and manage it,' said Sooty, rather doubtfully. 'You've got to be
jolly careful, you know. We don't want to land in serious trouble. You don't
know what my stepfather can be like!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
could guess, though. Julian looked curiously at Sooty. 'Was your own father's
name Lenoir, too?' he asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
nodded. 'Yes. He was my stepfather's cousin, and was as dark as all the Lenoirs
usually are. My stepfather is an exception - he's fair. People say the fair
Lenoirs are no good - but don't tell my stepfather that!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'As
if we should!' said George. 'Gracious, he'd cut off our heads or something!
Come on - let's go back to Tim.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Seven THE HIDDEN PIT<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THE
children were all very glad to think that they were going to have meals by
themselves in the old schoolroom. Nobody wanted to have much to do with Mr.
Lenoir! They felt sorry for Marybelle because she had such a queer father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
soon settled down at Smuggler's Top. Once George was satisfied that Timmy was
safe and happy, though rather puzzled about everything, she settled down too.
The only difficulty was getting Timmy to her room at night. This had to be done
in darkness. Block had a most tiresome way of appearing silently and suddenly,
and George was terrified of him catching a glimpse of the big dog.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
had a queer sort of life the next few days! Whilst the children were indoors,
he had to stay in the narrow secret passage, where he wandered about, puzzled
and lonely, pricking his ears for a sound of the whistle that meant he was to
come to the cupboard and be let out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was fed very well, for Sooty raided the larder every night. Sarah, the cook,
was amazed at the way things like soup-bones disappeared. She could not
understand it. But Timmy devoured everything that was given to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Each
morning he was given good exercise by the children. The first morning this had
been really very exciting!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
had reminded Sooty of his promise to take<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
for walks each day. 'He simply must have exercise, or he'll be terribly
miserable!' she said. 'But how can we manage it? We can't possibly take him
through the house and out of the front door! We'd be certain to walk into your
father!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
told you I knew a way that came out half-way down the hill, silly,' said Sooty.
'I'll show you. We shall be quite safe once we are down there, because even if
we met Block or anyone else that knew us, they wouldn't know it was our dog.
They would think it was just a stray we had picked up.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
- show us the way,' said George, impatiently. They were all in Booty's bedroom,
and Timmy was lying on the mat beside George. They felt really safe in Booty's
room because of the buzzer that warned them when anyone opened the door at the
end of the long passage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We'll
have to go into Marybelle's room,' said Sooty. 'You'll get a shock when you see
the way that leads down the hill, I can tell you!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
looked out of the door. The door at the end of the passage was shut.
'Marybelle, slip along and peep through the passage door,' said Sooty. 'Warn us
if anyone is coming up the stairs. If not, well all dip quickly into your
room.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Marybelle
ran to the door at the end of the passage. She opened it, and at once the
warning buzzer sounded in Sooty's room, making Timmy growl fiercely. Marybelle
looked through the doorway to the stairs. Then she signalled to the others that
no one was coming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all rushed out of Sooty's room into Marybelle's, and Marybelle came to join
them. She was a funny little mouse of a girl, shy and timid. Anne liked her,
and once or twice teased her for being so shy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Marybelle did not like being teased. Her eyes filled<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>with
tears at once, and she turned away. 'She'll be better when she goes to school,'
Sooty said. 'She can't help being shy, shut up all the year round in this queer
house. She hardly ever sees anyone of her own age.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
crowded into the little girl's bedroom and shut the door. Sooty turned the key
in the lock. 'Just in case friend Block comes snooping,' he said with a grin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
began to move the furniture in the room to the sides, near the walls. The
others watched in surprise and then helped. 'What's the idea of the furniture
removal?' asked Dick, struggling with a heavy chest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Got
to get this heavy carpet up,' panted Sooty. 'It's put there to hide the
trap-door below. At least, that's what I've always thought.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Once
the furniture stood by the walls, it was easy to drag up the heavy carpet.
There was a felt lining under it too, and that had to be pulled aside as well.
Then the children saw a trap-door, let flat into the floor, with a ring-handle
to pull it up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
felt excited. Another secret way! This house seemed full of them. Sooty pulled
at the ring and the heavy door came up quite easily. The children peered down,
but they could see nothing. It was pitch-dark.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Are
there steps down?' asked Julian, holding Anne back in case she fell.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,'
said Sooty, reaching out for a big torch he had brought in with him. 'Look!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
switched on his torch, and the children gave a gasp. The trap-door led down to
a pit, far, far below!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Why!
It's miles below the foundations of the house, surely!' said Julian, surprised.
'It's just a hole down to a big pit. What's it for?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
it was probably used to hide people - or to get rid of them!' said Sooty. 'Nice
little place, isn't it? If<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>you
fell down there you'd land with an awful bump'!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'But
- how in the world could we get Timmy down there - or get down ourselves?' said
George. 'I'm not going to fall down it, that's certain!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
laughed. 'You won't have to,' he said. 'Look here.' He opened a cupboard and
reached up to a wide shelf. He pulled something down, and the children saw that
it was a rope-ladder, fine but very strong.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'There
you are! We can all get down by that,' he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Timmy
can't,' said George at once. 'He couldn't possibly climb up or down a ladder.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
couldn't he?' said Sooty. 'He seems such a clever dog - I should have thought
he could easily have done a thing like that.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
he can't,' said George, decidedly. 'That's a silly idea.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
know,' said Marybelle, suddenly, going red at her boldness in breaking in on
the conversation. T think I know! We could get the laundry basket and shut
Timmy in it. And we could tie it with ropes, and let him down -and pull him up
the same way!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others stared at her. 'Now that really is a brainwave!' said Julian, warmly.
'Good for you, Marybelle. Timmy would be quite safe in a basket. But it would
have to be a big one.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'There's
a very big one in the kitchen,' said Marybelle. 'It's never used except when we
have lots of people to stay, like now. We could borrow it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
yes!' said Sooty. 'Of course we could. I'll go and get it now.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'But
what excuse will you give?' shouted Julian after him. Sooty had already
unlocked the door and shot out! He was a most impatient person, and could never
put off anything for a single minute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
didn't answer. He sped down the passage. Julian locked the door after him. He
didn't want anyone coming in and seeing the dragged-up carpet and the yawning
hole!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
was back in two minutes, carrying a very heavy wicker laundry basket on his
head. He banged on the door, and Julian unlocked it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Good!'
said Julian. 'How did you get it? Did anyone mind?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Didn't
ask them,' grinned Sooty. 'Nobody there to ask. Block's with Father, and Sarah
has gone out shopping. I can always put it back if any awkward questions are
asked.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
rope-ladder was shaken out down the hole. It slipped like an uncoiling snake,
down and down, and reached the pit at the bottom. Then Timmy was fetched from
Sooty's room. He came in wagging his tail overjoyed at being with everyone
again. George hugged him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Darling
Timmy! I hate you being hidden away like this. But never mind, we're all going
out together this morning!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Til
go down first,' said Sooty. 'Then you'd better let Timmy down. I'll tie his
basket round with this rope. It's nice and strong, and there's plenty to let
down. Better tie the other end to the end of the bed, then when we come up
again we can easily pull him up.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was made to get inside the big basket and lie down. He was surprised and barked
a little. But George put her hand over his mouth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Sh!
You mustn't say a word, Timmy,' she said. 'I know all this is very astonishing.
But never mind, you'll have a marvellous walk at the end of it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
heard the word 'walk' and was glad. That was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>what
he wanted - a really nice long walk in the open air and sunshine!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
didn't at all like having the lid shut down on him, but as George seemed to
think he must put up with all these queer happenings, Timmy did so, with a very
good grace.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'He's
really a marvellous dog,' said Marybelle. 'Sooty, get down the hole now, and be
ready for when we let him down.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
disappeared down the dark hole, holding his torch between his teeth. Down and
down he went, down and down. At last he stood safely at the bottom, and flashed
his torch upwards. His voice came to them, sounding rather queer and far away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Come
on! Lower Timmy down!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
laundry basket, feeling extraordinarily heavy now, was pushed to the edge of
the hole. Then down it went, knocking against the sides here and there. Timmy
growled. He didn't like this game!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
and Julian had hold of the rope between them. They lowered Timmy as smoothly as
they could. He reached the bottom with a slight bump, and Sooty undid the
basket. Out leapt Timmy, barking! But his bark sounded very small and distant
to the watchers at the top.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Now
come on down, one by one!' shouted up Sooty, waving his torch. 'Is the door
locked, Julian?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,'
said Julian. 'Look out for Anne. She's coming now.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
climbed down, a little frightened at first, but, as her feet grew use to
searching for and finding the rungs of the rope-ladder, she went down quite
quickly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
the others followed, and soon they were all standing together at the bottom of
the hole, in the enormous pit. They looked round curiously. It had a musty
smell.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and
its walls were damp and greenish. Sooty swung his torch round, and the children
saw various passages leading off here and there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Where
do they all lead to?' asked Julian, in amazement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
I told you this hill was full of tunnels,' said Sooty. 'This pit is down in the
hill and these tunnels lead into the catacombs. There are miles and miles of
them. No one explores them now, because so many people have been lost in them
and never heard of again. There used to be an old map of them, but it's lost.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
weird!' said Anne, and shivered. 'I wouldn't like to be down here alone.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
a place to hide smuggled goods in,' said Dick. 'No one would ever find them
here.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
guess the old-time smugglers knew every inch of these passages,' said Sooty.
'Come on! We'll take the one that leads out of the hillside. We'll have to do a
bit of climbing when we get there. I hope you don't mind.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Not
a bit,' said Julian. 'We're all good climbers. But I say, Sooty - you're sure
you know the way? We don't want to be lost for ever down here!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Course
I know the way! Come on!' said Sooty, and, flashing his torch in front of him,
he led the way into a dark and narrow tunnel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Eight<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>AN
EXCITING WALK<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THE
tunnel ran slightly downwards, and smelt nasty in places. Sometimes it opened
out into pits like the one they themselves had come from. Sooty flashed his
torch up them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'That
one goes into Barling's house somewhere,' he said. 'Most of the old houses
hereabouts have openings into pits, like ours. Jolly well hidden some of them
are, too!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'There's
daylight or something in front!' said Anne, suddenly. 'Oh good! I hate this
tunnel.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sure
enough, it was daylight, creeping in through a kind of cave-entrance in the
hillside. The children crowded there, and looked out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were outside the hill, and outside the town, somewhere on the steep cliff-side
that ran down to the marsh. Sooty climbed out on to a ledge. He put his torch
into his pocket.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We've
got to get to that path down there,' he said, pointing. 'That will lead us to a
place where the city wall is fairly low, and we can climb over it. Is Timmy
surefooted? We don't want him tumbling into the marsh down there!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
marsh lay a good way below, looking ugly and flat. George sincerely hoped Timmy
would never fall into it. Still, he was very sure-footed, and she didn't think
he would slip. The path was steep and rocky, but quite passable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went down it, clambering over rocks now and again. The path led them to the
city wail, which, as Sooty<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>had
said, was fairly low just there. He climbed up to the top. He was like a cat
for climbing!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No
wonder he's got such a name for climbing about everywhere at school!' said Dick
to Julian. 'He's had good practice here. Do you remember how he climbed up to
the roof of the school the term before last? Everyone was scared he'd slip and
fall, but he didn't. He tied the Union Jack to one of the chimney-pots!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Come
on!' called Sooty. 'The coast is clear. This is a lonely bit of the town, and
no one will see us climbing up.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
they were all over the wall, Timmy too. They set off for a good walk, swinging
down the hill, enjoying themselves. The mist began to clear after a while, and
the sun felt nice and warm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
town was very old. Some of the houses seemed almost tumble-down, but there were
people living in them, for smoke came from the chimneys. The shops were quaint,
with their long narrow windows, and over-hanging eaves. The children stopped to
look into them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Look
out - here's Block!' said Sooty suddenly in a low voice. 'Don't take any notice
of Timmy at all. If he comes around licking us or jumping up, pretend to try
and drive him off as if he was a stray.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The/all
pretended not to see Block, but gazed earnestly into the window of a shop.
Timmy feeling rather out of it, ran up to George and pawed at her, trying to
make her take notice of him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Go
away, dog!' said Sooty, and flapped at the surprised Timmy. 'Go away! Following
us about like this! Go home, can't you?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
thought this was some sort of a game. He barked happily, and ran round Sooty
and George, giving them an occasional lick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Home,
dog, home!' yelled Sooty, flapping hard again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
Block came up to them, no expression on his face at all. 'The dog bothers you?'
he said. 'I will throw a stone at him and make him go.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Don't
you dare!' said George, immediately. 'You go home yourself! I don't mind the
dog following us. He's quite a nice one.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Block's
deaf, silly,' said Sooty. 'It's no good talking to him.' To George's horror
Block picked up a big stone, meaning to throw it at Timmy. George flew at him,
punched him hard on the arm, and made him drop the stone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'How
dare you throw stones at a dog!' yelled the little girl in a fury. Til - I'll
tell the police.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Now,
now,' said a voice nearby. 'What's all this about? Pierre, what's the trouble?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children turned and saw a tall man standing near them, wearing his hair rather
long. He had long, narrow eyes, a long nose and a long chin. 'He's long
everywhere!' thought Anne, looking at his long thin legs and long narrow feet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
Mr. Barling! I didn't see you,' said Sooty, politely. 'Nothing's the matter,
thanks. It's only that this dog is following us, and Block said he'd make it go
away by chucking a stone at it. And George here is fond of dogs and got angry
about that.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
see. And who are all these children?' said Mr. Barling, looking at each one of
them out of his long, narrow eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'They've
come to stay with us because their uncle's house had an accident to it,'
explained Sooty. 'George's father's house, I mean. At Kirrin.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Ah
- at Kirrin?' said Mr. Barling, and seemed to prick up his long ears. 'Surely
that is where that very clever scientist friend of Mr. Lenoir's lives?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes.
He's my father,' said George. 'Why, do you know him?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
have heard of him - and of his very interesting experiments,' said Mr. Barling.
'Mr. Lenoir knows him well, I believe?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Not
awfully well,' said George, puzzled. 'They just write to one another, I think.
My father telephoned to Mr. Lenoir to ask him if he could have us to stay while
our own house is being mended.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'And
Mr. Lenoir, of course, was only too delighted to have the whole company of
you?' said Mr. Barling. 'Such a good, generous fellow, your father, Pierre!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children stared at Mr. Barling, thinking that it was queer of him to say nice
things in such a nasty voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
felt uncomfortable. It was plain that Mr. Barling did not like Mr. Lenoir at
all. Well, neither did they, but they didn't like Mr. Barling any better!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
saw another dog and darted happily after him. Block had now disappeared, going
up the steep high street with his basket. The children said good-bye to Mr.
Barling, not wanting to talk to him any more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went after Timmy, talking eagerly as soon as they had left Mr. Barling behind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Goodness
- that was a narrow escape from Block!' said Julian. 'Old beast - going to
throw that enormous stone at Timmy. No wonder you flew at him, George! You
nearly gave the game away, though.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
don't care,' said George. 'I wasn't going to have Timmy's leg broken. It was a
bit of bad luck meeting Block our very first morning out.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We'll
probably never meet him again when we take Timmy out,' said Sooty,
comfortingly. 'And if we do we'll simply say the dog always joins us when it
meets us. Which is perfectly true.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
enjoyed their walk. They went into a quaint old coffee shop and had steaming
cups of delicious creamy coffee and jammy buns. Timmy had two of the buns and
gobbled them greedily. George went off to buy some meat for him at the
butcher's, choosing a shop that Sooty said Mrs. Lenoir did not go to. She did
not want any butcher telling Mrs. Lenoir that the children had been buying
dog-meat!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went back the same way as they had come. They made their way up the steep
cliff-path, and in at the tunnel-entrance, back through the winding tunnel to
the pit, and there was the rope-ladder waiting for them. Julian and Dick went
up first, while George packed the surprised Timmy into the basket again and
tied the rope<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>firmly
round it. Then up went the whining Timmy, bumping against the sides of the hole,
until the two panting boys pulled the basket into Marybelle's room and undid
it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was ten minutes before the dinner-hour. 'Just time to shut the trap-door, pull
back the carpet and wash our hands,' said Sooty. 'And I'll put old Timmy back
into the secret passage behind the cupboard in my room, George. Where is that
meat you bought? I'll put that in the passage too. He can eat it when he
likes.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Did
you put him a nice warm rug there, and a dish of fresh water?' asked George,
anxiously, for the third or fourth time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
know I did. I keep telling you,' said Sooty. 'Look, we won't put back all the
furniture except the chairs. We can say we want it left back because we like to
play a game on the carpet. It'll be an awful bore if we have to move chests and
things every time we exercise Tim.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were just in time for their dinner. Block was there to serve it, and so was
Sarah. The children sat down hungrily, in spite of having had coffee and buns.
Block and Sarah ladled out hot soup on to their plates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
hope you got rid of the unpleasant dog,' said Block in his monotonous voice. He
gave George a rather nasty look. Evidently he had not forgotten how she had
flown at him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
nodded. It was no good speaking in answer, for Block would not hear. Sarah
bustled round, taking away the soup-plates and preparing to give them their
second course.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
food was very good at Smuggler's Top. There was plenty of it, and the hungry
visitors and Sooty ate everything put before them. Marybelle hadn't much
appetite,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>but
she was the only one. George tried to secrete tit-bits and bones whenever she
could, for Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Two
or three days went by, and the children fell into their new life quite happily.
Timmy was taken out each morning for a long walk. The children soon got used to
slipping down the rope-ladder, and making their way with Timmy to the
cliff-side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the afternoons they went to either Booty's room or Marybelle's, and played
games or read. They could have Timmy there, because the buzzer always warned
them if anyone was coming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
night it was always an excitement to get Timmy to George's room without being
seen. This was usually done when Mr. and Mrs. Lenoir were sitting at their
dinner, and Block and Sarah were serving them. The children had a light supper
first, and Mr. and Mrs. Lenoir had their dinner an hour later. It was quite the
best time to smuggle Timmy along to George's room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
seemed to enjoy the smuggling. He ran silently beside George and Sooty, stopped
at every corner, and scampered gladly into George's room as soon as he got
there. He lay quietly under the bed till George was in bed herself, and then he
came out to lie on her feet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
always locked their door at night. She didn't want Sarah or Mrs. Lenoir coming
in and finding Timmy there! But nobody came, and as night after night went by,
George grew more easy about Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Taking
him back to Sooty's room in the morning was a bit of nuisance, because it had
to be done early, before anyone was up. But George could always wake herself at
any time she chose, and each morning about half past six the little girl
slipped through the house with Timmy. She went in at Sooty's door, and he
jumped out of bed to deal with Timmy. He was always awakened by the buzzer that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>sounded
when George opened the door at the end of the passage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
hope you are all enjoying yourselves,' Mr. Lenoir said to the children,
whenever they met him in the hall or on the stairs. And they always replied
politely. 'Oh yes, Mr. Lenoir, thank you.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
quite a peaceful holiday after all,' said Julian. 'Nothing happens at all!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then things did begin to happen and once they had begun they never stopped!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Nine<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>WHO
IS IN THE TOWER?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ONE
night Julian was awakened by someone opening his door. He sat up at once. 'Who
is it?' he said. 'Me, Sooty,' said Sooty's voice, very low. 'I say, I want you
to come and see something.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
woke Dick, and the two of them put on their dressing-gowns. Sooty led them
quietly out of the room and took them to a queer little room, tucked away in an
odd wing of the house. All kinds of things were kept here, trunks and boxes,
old toys, chests of old clothes, broken vases that had never been mended, and
many other worthless things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Look,'
said Sooty, taking them to the window. They saw that the little room had a view
of the tower belonging to the house. It was the only room in the house that
did, for it was built at a queer angle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys looked - and Julian gave an exclamation. Someone was signalling from the
tower! A light there flashed every now and again. In and out - pause - flash,
flash, in and out - pause. The light went regularly on and off in a certain
rhythm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Now
- who's doing that?' whispered Sooty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Your
father?' wondered Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Don't
think so,' said Sooty. 'I think I heard him snoring away in his room. We could
go and find out though -see if he really is in his bedroom.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
- for goodness sake don't let's get caught,' said Julian, not at all liking the
idea of prying about in his host's house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>They made their way to where Mr. Lenoir
had his | room. It was quite plain he was there, for a regular low snoring came
from behind the closed door.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>'It may
be Block up in the tower,' said Dick. 'He looks full of secrets. I wouldn't
trust him an inch. I bet it's it Block.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
- shall we go to his room and see if it's empty?' whispered Sooty. 'Come on. If
it's Block signalling, he's doing it without Father knowing.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
your father might have told him to,' said Julian, who felt that he wouldn't
trust Mr. Lenoir much further than he would trust Block.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went up the back-stairs to the wing where the staff slept. Sarah slept in a
room there with Harriet the 'kitchen-maid. Block slept alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
pushed open Block's door very softly and slowly. When he had enough room to put
in his head, he did so. The room was full of moonlight. By the window was
'}\Block's bed. And Block was there! Sooty could see the humpy shape of his
body, and the black round patch that was his head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
listened, but he could not catch Block's breathing. He must sleep very quietly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
withdrew his head, and pushed the other two boys quietly down the back-stairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Was
he there?' whispered Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes.
So it can't be him, signalling up in our tower,' said Sooty. 'Well - who can it
be then? I don't like it. It couldn't possibly be Mother or Sarah or the little
kitchen-maid. Is there a stranger in our house, someone we don't know, living
here in secret?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Can't
be!' said Julian, a little shiver running down his back. 'Look here - what about
us going up to the tower and trying to peep through the door or something? We'd<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>soon
find out who it was then. Perhaps we ought to tell your father.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No.
Not yet. I want to find out a whole lot more befoie I say anything to anyone,'
said Sooty, sounding obstinate. 'Let's creep up to the tower. We shall have to
be jolly careful though. You get to it by a spiral staircase, rather narrow.
There's nowhere much to hide if anyone suddenly came down out of the tower.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What's
in the tower?' whispered Dick, as they made their way through the dark and
silent house, thin streaks of moonlight coming in here and there between the
cracks of the closed curtains.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Nothing
much. Just a table and a chair or two, and a bookcase of books,' said Sooty.
'We use it on hot summer days when the breeze gets in strongly through the
windows there, and we can see a long way all round us.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came to a little landing. From this a winding, narrow stairway of stone went up
to the rounded tower. The boys looked up. Moonlight fell on the stairway from a
slit-like window in the wall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We'd
better not all go up,' said Sooty. 'We should find it so difficult to hurry
down, three of us, if the person in the tower suddenly came out. I'll go. You
stay down here and wait. I'll see if I can spy anything through the crack in
the door or the key-hole.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
crept softly up the stairway, soon lost to view as he rounded the first spiral.
Julian and Dick waited in the shadows at the bottom. There was a thick curtain
over one of the windows there, and they got behind it, wrapping its folds round
them for warmth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
crept up to the top. The tower-room had a stout oak door, studded and barred.
It was shut! It was no use trying to look through the crack, because there
wasn't one. He bent down to peer through the key-hole.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
that was stuffed up with something, so he could not see through that either. He
pressed his ear to it and listened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
heard a series of little clicks. Click - click - click -click - click. Nothing
else at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'That's
the click of the light they're using,' thought Sooty. 'Still signalling like
mad! What for? Who to? And who is in our tower-room, using it as a
signalling-station? How I wish I knew!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly:
the clicking stopped. There was the sound of someone walking across the stone
floor of the tower. And almost at once the door opened!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
had no time to hurry down the stairs. All he could do was to squeeze into a
niche, and hope that the person would not see him or touch him as he went by.
The moon went behind a cloud at that moment, and Sooty was thankful to know he
was hidden in black shadow. Someone came down the stairs and actually brushed
against Sooty's arm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
jumped almost out of his skin, expecting to be hauled out of his niche. But the
person did not seem to notice, and went on down the spiral stairway, walking
softly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
did not dare to go down after him, for he was afraid the man would come out,
and cast his shadow down for the signaller to see.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
he stayed squeezed in his niche, hoping that Julian and Dick were well-hidden,
and would not think it was he, Sooty, who was walking down the stairs!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and Dick heard the soft footsteps coming, and-thought at first it was Sooty.
Then, not hearing his whisper, they stiffened behind the curtains, guessing
that it was the signaller himself who was walking by!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We'd
better follow him!' whispered Julian to Dick. 'Come on. Quiet, now!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Julian got muddled up with the great curtains, and could not seem to find his
way out. Dick, however, slipped out easily enough, and padded after the
disappearing person. The moon was now out again, and Dick could catch glimpses
of the signaller as he went past the moonlight streaks. Keeping well in the
shadows himself, he darted quietly after him. Where was he going?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
followed him across the landing to a passage. Then across another landing and
up the back-stairs! But those led to the staff bedrooms. Surely the man was not
going there?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick,
to his enormous surprise, saw the person disappear silently into Block's
bedroom. He crept to the door,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>which
had been left a little ajar. There was no light in the room except that of the
moon. There was no sound of talking. Nothing at all except a creak which might
have come from the bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
peeped in, full of the most intense curiosity. Would he see the man waking up
Block? Would he see him climbing out of the window?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
stared round the room. There was no one there at all, except Block lying in
bed. The moonlight lit up the corners, and Dick could quite plainly see that
the room was empty. Only Block lay there, and, as Dick watched, he heard him
give a sigh and roll over in bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well!
That's the queerest thing I ever saw,' thought Dick, puzzled. 'A man goes into
a room and completely disappears, without a single sound! Where can he have
gone?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went back to find the others. Sooty by this time had crept down the spiral
staircase and had found Julian, who had explained that Dick had gone to follow
the queer signaller.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went to find Dick, and suddenly bumped into him, creeping along quietly in the
darkness. They all jumped violently, and Julian almost cried out, but stifled
his voice just in time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Golly!
You gave me a scare, Dick!' he whispered. 'Well, did you see who it was and
where he went?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
told them of his queer experience. 'He simply went into Block's room and
vanished,' he said. 'Is there any secret passage leading out of Block's room,
Sooty?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,
none,' said Sooty. 'That wing is much newer than the rest of the house, and
hasn't any secrets in at all. I simply can't imagine what happened to the man.
How very queer! Who is he, and why does he come, and where on earth does he
go?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
really must find out,' said Julian. 'It's such a mystery! Sooty, how did you
know there was signalling going on from the tower?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
some time ago I found it out, quite by accident,' said Sooty. 'I couldn't
sleep, and I went along to that funny little box-room place, and ferreted about
for an old book I thought I'd seen there. And suddenly I looked up at the tower,
and saw a light flashing there.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Funny,'
said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
I went along there at night a good many times after that, to see if I could see
the signals again,' said Sooty, 'and at last I did. The first time I had seen
them there was a good moon, and the second time there was, too. So, I thought,
next time there's a moon, I'll creep along to that old box-room and see if the
signaller is at work again. And sure enough he was!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Where
does that window look out on, that we saw the light flashing from?' asked
Julian, thoughtfully. 'The seaward side - or the landward?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Seaward,'
said Sooty at once. 'There's something or someone out at sea that receives
those signals. Goodness knows who.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Some
kind of smugglers, I suppose,' said Dick. 'But it can't be anything to do with
your father, Sooty. I say -let's go up into the tower, shall we? We might find
something there-or see something.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went back to the spiral staircase and climbed up to the tower-room. It was
dark, for the moon was behind a cloud. But it came out after a while, and the
boys looked out of the seaward window.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no mist at all that night. They could see the flat marshes stretching away
to the sea. They gazed down in silence. Then the moon went in and darkness
covered the marsh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly
Julian clutched the others, making them jump. 'I can see something!' he
whispered. 'Look beyond there. What is it?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all looked. It seemed like a tiny line of very small dots of light. They were
so far away that it was difficult to see if they stayed still or moved. Then
the moon came out again, flooding everywhere with silvery light, and the boys
could not see anything except the moonshine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
when the moon went in again, there was the line of tiny, pricking lights again!
'A bit nearer, surely!' whispered Sooty. 'Smugglers - coming over a secret path
from the sea to Castaway Hill! Smugglers!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

MAKES A NOISE<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THE
three girls were very excited the next day when the boys told them their
adventure of the night before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Gracious!'
said Anne, her eyes wide with surprise. 'Who can it be signalling like that?
And wherever did he go to? Fancy him going into Block's room, with Block there
in bed!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
very peculiar,' said George. 'I wish you had come and told me and Anne.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'There
wasn't time - and anyway, we couldn't have Timmy about at night. He might have
flown at the signaller,' said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'The
man must have been signalling to the smugglers,' said Julian, thoughtfully.
'Let me see - probably they came over from France in a ship - came as near to
the marsh as they could - waited for a signal to tell them that the coast was
clear - probably the signal from the tower -and then waded across a path they
knew through the marsh. Each man must have carried a torch to prevent himself from
leaving the path and falling into the marsh. No doubt there was someone waiting
to receive the goods they brought - someone at the edge of the marsh below the
hill.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'But
who?' said Dick. 'It can't have been Mr. Barling, who, Sooty says, is known to
be a smuggler. Because the signal lights came from our house, not his. It's all
very puzzling.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
we'll do our best to solve the mystery,' said George. 'There's some queer game
going on in this very<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>house,
with or without your father's knowledge, Sooty. We'll keep a jolly good lookout
and see if we can find out what it is.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were at breakfast alone, when they discussed the night's adventure. Block came
in to see if they had finished at that moment. Anne did not notice him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
does Mr. Barling smuggle?' she asked Sooty. Immediately she got a hard kick on
her ankle, and stared in pain and surprise. 'Why did you ...?' she began, and
got another kick, harder still. Then she saw Block.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'But
he's deaf,' she said. 'He can't hear anything we say.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Block
began to clear away, his face as usual showing no expression. Sooty glared at
Anne. She was upset and cross, but said no more. She rubbed her bruised ankle
hard. As soon as Block went out of the room she turned on Sooty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
mean thing! You hurt my ankle like anything! Why shouldn't I say things in
front of Block? He's quite deaf!' said Anne, her face very red.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
know he's supposed to be,' said Sooty. 'And I think he is. But I saw a funny
look come over his face when you asked me what Mr. Barling smuggled - almost as
if he had heard what you said, and was surprised.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
imagined it!' said Anne, crossly, still rubbing her ankle. 'Anyway, don't kick
me so hard again. A gentle push with your toe would have been enough. I won't
talk in front of Block if you don't want me to, but it's quite plain he's as
deaf as a post!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,
he's deaf all right,' said Dick. 'I dropped a plate off the table yesterday, by
accident, just behind him, and it smashed to bits, if you remember. Well, he
didn't jump or turn a hair, as he would have done if he could have heard.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'All
the same - I never trust Block, deaf or not,' said Sooty. 'I always feel he
might read our lips or something. Deaf people can often do that, you know.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went off to take Timmy for his usual morning walk. Timmy was quite used to
being shut in the laundry basket by now, and lowered into the pit. In fact, he
always jumped straight into the basket as soon as the lid was opened, and lay
down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
morning they again met Block, who stared with great interest at the dog. He
plainly recognized it as the same dog as before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'There's
Block,' said Julian, in a low voice. 'Don't drive Timmy off this time. We'll
pretend he's a stray who always meets us each morning.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
they let Timmy run round them, and when Block came up, they nodded to him, and
made as if to go on their way. But the man stopped them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'That
dog seems to be a friend of yours,' he said, in his curious monotone of a
voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
yes. He goes with us each morning now,' said Julian, politely. 'He quite thinks
he's our dog! Nice fellow, isn't he?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Block
stared at Timmy, who growled. 'Mind you do not bring that dog into the house,'
said Block. 'If you do, Mr. Lenoir will have him killed.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
saw George's face beginning to turn red with fury. He spoke hurriedly. 'Why
should we bring him to the house, Block? Don't be silly!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Block,
however, did not appear to hear. He gave Timmy a nasty look, and went on his
way, occasionally turning round to look at the little company of children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Horrid
fellow!' said George, angrily. 'How dare he say things like that?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
they got back to Marybelle's bedroom that morning, they pulled Timmy up from
the pit, and let him out of the basket. 'We'll put him into the secret passage
as usual,' said George, 'and I'll put some biscuits in with him. I got some
nice ones for him this morning, the sort he likes, all big and crunchy.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
went to the door - but just as she was about to unlock it and take Timmy into
Sooty's room next door, Timmy gave a small growl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
took her hand away from the door at once. She turned to look at Timmy. He was
standing stiffly, the hackles on his neck rising up, and he was staring fixedly
at the door. George put her hand to her lips warningly, and whispered:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Someone's
outside. Timmy knows. He's smelt them. Will you all talk loudly, and pretend to
be playing a game? I'll pop Timmy into the cupboard where the rope-ladder is
kept.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
once the others began to talk to one another, whilst George swiftly dragged
Timmy to the cupboard, patted him to make him understand he was to be quiet,
and shut him in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'My
turn to deal,' said Julian loudly, and took a pack of snap cards from the top
of the chest. 'You won last time, Dick. Bet I'll win this time.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
dealt swiftly. The others, still talking loudly, saying<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>anything
that came into their heads, began to play snap.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
yelled 'snap' nearly all the time, pretending to be<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>very
jolly and hilarious. Anyone listening outside the door<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>would
never guess it was all pretence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George,
who was watching the door closely, saw that the handle was gradually turning,
very slowly indeed. Someone meant to open the door without being heard, and
come in unexpectedly. But the door was locked!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
the person outside, whoever it was, realized that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
door was locked, and the handle slowly turned the other way again. Then it was
still. There came no other sound. It was impossible to know if anyone was still
outside the door or not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timmy would know! Signing to the others to carry on with their shouting and
laughing, George let Timmy out of the cupboard. He ran to the door of the room,
and stood there, sniffing quietly. Then he turned and looked at George, his
tail wagging.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
all right,' said George to the others. 'There's no one there now. Timmy always
knows. We'd better quickly take him into your room, Sooty, while the coast is
clear. Who could it have been, do you think, snooping outside?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Block,
I should say,' said Sooty. He unlocked the door and peered out. There was no
one in the passage. Sooty tiptoed to the door at the end and looked out there
also. He waved to George to tell her it was all right to take Timmy into his
room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
Timmy was safely in the secret passage, crunching up his favourite biscuits. He
had got quite used to his queer life now, and did not mind at all. He knew his
way about the passage, and had explored other passages that led from it. He was
quite at home in the maze of secret ways!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Better
go and have our dinner now,* said Dick. 'And mind, Anne - don't go and say
anything silly in front of that horrid Block, in case he reads your lips.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Of
course I shan't,' said Anne, indignantly. 'I wouldn't have before, but I never
thought of him reading my lips. If he does, he's very clever.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
they were all sitting down to lunch. Block was there, waiting to serve them.
Sarah was out for the day and did not appear. Block served them with soup, and
then went out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly,
to the children's intense surprise and fright, they heard Timmy barking loudly!
They all jumped violently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Listen!
Hark at Timmy!' said Julian. 'He must be somewhere near here, in that secret
passage. How weird it sounds, his bark coming muffled and distant like that.
But anyone would know it was a dog barking.' ' 'Don't say anything at all about
it in front of Block,' said Sooty. 'Not a word. Pretend not to hear at all, if
Timmy barks again. What on earth is he barking for?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
the bark he uses when he's excited and pleased,' said George. 'I expect he's
chasing a rat. He always goes right off his head when he sees a rat or a
rabbit. There he goes again. Oh, dear, I hope he catches the rat quickly and
settles down!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Block
came back at that moment. Timmy had again just stopped barking. But, in a
moment or two, his doggy voice could be heard once more, very muffled. 'Woof!
Woof-woof!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was watching Block closely. The man went on serving the meat. He said nothing,
but looked round at the children intently, as if he wanted to see each child's
expression, or see if they said anything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Jolly
good soup that was today,' said Julian, cheerfully, looking round at the
others. 'I must say Sarah is a wonderful cook.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
think her ginger buns are gorgeous,' said Anne. 'Especially when they are all
hot from the oven.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Woof-woof,'
said Timmy's voice from far away behind the walls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'George,
your mother makes the most heavenly fruit cake I ever tasted,' said Dick to
George, wishing Timmy would be quiet. 'I do wonder how they're all getting on<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>at
Kirrin Cottage, and if they've started mending the roof yet.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Woof!'
said Timmy, joyfully chasing his rat down another bit of passage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Block
served everyone and then silently disappeared. Julian went to the door to make
sure he had gone and was not outside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
hope old Block is as deaf as a post!' he said. 'I could have sworn I saw a
surprised look come into those cold eyes of his, when Timmy barked.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
if he could hear him,-which I don't believe,' said George, 'he must have been
jolly surprised to see us talking away and not paying any attention to a dog's
barking at all!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others giggled. They kept a sharp ear for Block's return. They heard footsteps
after a time, and began to pile their plates together for him to take away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
schoolroom door opened. But it was not Block who came in. It was Mr. Lenoir! He
came in, smiling as usual, and looked round at the surprised children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Ah!
So you are enjoying your dinner, and eating it all up, like good children,' he
said. He always irritated the children because he spoke to them as if they were
very small. 'Does Block wait on you properly?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
yes, sir, thank you,' said Julian, standing up politely. 'We are having a very
nice time here. We think Sarah is a wonderful cook!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Ah,
that's good, that's good,' said Mr. Lenoir. The children waited impatiently for
him to go. They were so afraid that Timmy would bark again. But Mr. Lenoir
seemed in no hurry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then Timmy barked again! 'Woof, woof, woof!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Eleven GEORGE IS WORRIED<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>MR.
LENOIR cocked his head on one side almost like a startled dog, when he heard
the muffled barking. He looked at the children. But they made no sign of having
heard anything. Mr. Lenoir listened a little while, saying nothing. Then he
turned to a drawing-book, belonging to Julian, and began to look at the
sketches there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children felt somehow that he was doing it for the sake of staying in the
schoolroom a little longer. Into Julian's mind came the quick suspicion that
somehow Mr. Lenoir must have been told of Timmy's barking and come to
investigate it for himself. It was the first time he had ever come to the
schoolroom!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
barked again, a little more distantly. Mr. Lenoir's nose grew white at the tip.
Sooty and Marybelle knew the danger-sign, and glanced at one another. That
white-tipped nose usually meant a storm of temper!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Do
you hear that noise?' said Mr. Lenoir, snapping out the words.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
noise, sir?' asked Julian, politely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
barked again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Don't
be foolish! There's the noise again!' said Mr. Lenoir. At that moment a gull
called outside the window, circling in the sea-breeze.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
- that gull, sir? Yes, we often hear the gulls,' said Dick, brightly.
'Sometimes they seem to mew like a cat sir.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Pah!'
said Mr. Lenoir, almost spitting out the word. T suppose you will say they also
bark like a dog?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
they might, I suppose, sir,' agreed Dick, looking faintly surprised. 'After
all, if they can mew like cats, there's no reason why they shouldn't bark like
dogs.5<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
barked again very joyfully. Mr. Lenoir faced the children, in a very bad temper
indeed now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Can't
you hear that? Tell me what that noise is!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children all put their heads on one side, and pretended to listen very
carefully. 'I can't hear anything,' said Dick. 'Not a thing.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
can hear the wind,' said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
can hear the gulls again,' said Julian, putting his hand behind one ear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
can hear a door banging. Perhaps that's the noise you mean, sir!' said Sooty,
with a most innocent expression. His stepfather gave him a poisonous look. He
could really be very unpleasant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'And
there's a window rattling,' said Marybelle, eager to do her bit too, though she
felt very frightened of her father, for she knew his sudden rages very well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
tell you, it's a dog, and &gt;ou know it!' snapped Mr. Lenoir, the tip of his
nose so white now that it looked very queer indeed. 'Where's the dog? Whose is
he?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
dog, sir?' began Julian, frowning as if he were very puzzled indeed. 'There's
no dog here that I can see.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Lenoir glared at him, and clenched his fingers. It was quite clear that he
would have liked to box Julian's ears. 'Then listen!' he hissed. 'Listen and
say what you think could make that barking, if not a dog?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were all forced to listen, for by now they felt scared of the angry man. But
fortunately Timmy made no sound at all. Either he had let the rat escape, or
was now gobbling it up. Anyway, there was not a single sound from him!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Sorry,
sir but really I can't hear a dog barking,' said Julian, in rather an injured
tone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Nor
can I!' said Dick, and the others joined in, saying the same. Mr. Lenoir knew
that this time they were speaking the truth, for he too could not hear
anything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'When
I catch that dog I will have him poisoned,' he said, very slowly and clearly.
'I will not have dogs in my house.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
turned on his heel and went out quickly, which was a very good thing, for
George was quite ready to fly into one of her rages, and then there would have
been a real battle! Anne put her hand on George's arm to stop her shouting
after Mr. Lenoir.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Don't
give the game away!' she whispered. 'Don't say anything, George!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
bit her lip. She had gone first red with rage and then white. She stamped her
foot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'How
dare he, how dare he?' she burst out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Shut
up, silly,' said Julian. 'Block will be back in a minute. We must all pretend
to be awfully surprised that Mr. Lenoir thought there was a dog, because, if
Block can read our lips, he mustn't know the truth.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Block
came in with the pudding at that moment, his face as blank as ever. It was the
most curious face the children had ever seen, for there was never any change of
expression on it at all. As Anne said, it might have been a wax mask!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Funny
how Mr. Lenoir thought there was a dog barking!' began Julian, and the others
backed him up valiantly. If Block could indeed read their lips he would be
puzzled to know whether there had been a dog barking or not!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children escaped to Sooty's room afterwards, and held a council of war. 'What
are we to do about Timmy?' said George. 'Does your stepfather know the secret
way behind the walls of Smuggler's Top, Sooty? Could he possibly get in and
find Timmy? Timmy might fly at him, you know.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,
he might,' said Sooty, thoughtfully. I don't know if Father does know about the
secret passages. I mean, I expect he knows, but I don't know if he guessed
where the entrances are. I found them out quite by accident.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I'm
going home,' said George, suddenly. 'I'm not going to risk Timmy being
poisoned.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
can't go home alone,' said Julian. 'It would look funny. If you do, we'd all
have to, and then we won't have a chance to solve this mystery with Sooty.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,
for goodness sake don't go and leave me just now,' said Sooty, looking quite
alarmed. 'It would make my father furious, simply furious.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
hesitated. She didn't want to make trouble for Sooty, whom she liked very much.
But, on the other hand, she certainly was not going to risk danger to Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
- I'll telephone my father and say I'm homesick and want to go back,' said
George. 'I'll say I miss Mother. It's quite true, I do miss her. You others can
stay on here and solve the mystery. It wouldn't be fair of you to try and keep
me and Timmy here when you know I'd worry every moment in case someone got into
the secret passage and put down poisoned meat for him to eat.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others hadn't thought of this. That would be terrible. Julian sighed. He would
have to let George have her own way after all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'All
right. You telephone to your father,' he said. 'There's a phone downstairs. Do
it now if you like. There won't be anyone about now, I don't suppose.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
slipped down the passage, out of the door there, and down the stairs to where
the telephone was enclosed in a dark little cupboard. She asked for the number
she wanted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a long wait. Then she heard the buzzing noise - brr - brr - brr - brr -
that told her that the telephone bell at Kirrin Cottage was ringing. She began
to plan what she should say to her father. She must, she really must go home
with Timmy. She didn't know how she was going to explain about Timmy - perhaps
she needn't explain at all. But she meant to go home that day or the next!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Brr
- brr - brr - brr' said the bell at the other end. It went on and on, and
nobody answered it. She did not<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>hear
her father's familiar voice - only the bell that went on ringing. Why did
nobody answer?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
operator at the exchange spoke to her. I'm sorry. There's no reply.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
put down the receiver miserably. Perhaps her parents were out? She would have
to try again later on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Poor
George tried three times, but each time there was the same result. No reply. As
she was coming out of the telephone cupboard for the third time, Mrs. Lenoir
saw her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Have
you been trying to telephone to your home?' she said. &quot;Haven't you heard
any news?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
haven't had a letter yet,' said George. 'I've tried three times to telephone
Kirrin Cottage but each time there is no reply.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
we heard this morning that it is impossible to live in Kirrin Cottage while the
men are hammering and knocking everywhere,' said Mrs. Lenoir, in her gentle
voice. 'We heard from your mother. She said that the noise was driving your
father mad, and they were going away for a week or so, till things were better.
But Mr. Lenoir at once wrote and asked them here. We shall know tomorrow,
because we have asked them to telephone a reply. We could not get them on the
telephone today, of course, any more than you could, because they have gone
away already.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,'
said George, surprised at all this news and wondering why her mother had not
written to tell her too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Your
mother said she had written to you,' said Mrs. Lenoir. 'Maybe the letter will
come by the next post. The posts are often most peculiar here. It will be a
pleasure to have your parents if they can come. Mr. Lenoir particularly wants
to meet your clever father. He thinks he is quite a genius.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
said no more but went back to the others, her face serious. She opened Booty's
door, and the others saw at once that she had had news of some sort.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
can't go home with Timothy,' said George. 'Mother and Father can't stand the
noise the workmen make, and they have both gone away!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Bad
luck!' said Sooty. 'All the same, I'm glad you'll have to stay here, George. I
should hate to lose you or Timmy.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Your
mother has written to ask my mother and father to come and stay here too,' said
George. 'What I shall do about Timmy I don't know! And they are sure to ask
questions about him too. I can't tell a downright lie and say I left him with
Alf the fisher-boy, or anything like that. I can't think what to do!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We'll
think of something,' promised Sooty. 'Perhaps I can get one of the villagers to
look after him for us. That would be a very good idea.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
yes!' said George, cheering up. 'Why didn't I think of that before? Let's ask
someone quickly, Sooty.3<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it was impossible to do anything that day because Mrs. Lenoir asked them to go
down into the drawing-room after tea, and have a game with her. So none of them
could go out to find someone to look after Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Never
mind,' thought George. 'He'll be safe tonight on my bed! Tomorrow will be soon
enough.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was the first time that Mrs. Lenoir had asked them down to be with her. 'You
see, Mr. Lenoir is out tonight on important business,' she explained. 'He has
had to go to the mainland with the car. He doesn't like his evenings disturbed
when he is at home, so I haven't been able to see as much of you all as I
should have liked. But tonight I can.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
wondered if Mr. Lenoir had gone to the mainland on smuggling business! Somehow
the smuggled goods must be taken across to the mainland - and if all that
signalling business the other night had to do with Mr. Lenoir's smuggling then
maybe he had now gone to dispose of the goods!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
telephone bell rang shrilly. Mrs Lenoir got up. 'I expect that is your mother
or father on the phone,' she said to George. 'Maybe I shall have news for you!
Perhaps your parents will be arriving here tomorrow.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
went out into the hall. The children waited anxiously. Would George's parents
come or not?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Twelve<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>BLOCK
GETS A SURPRISE<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>MRS.
LENOIR came back after a time. She smiled at George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'That
was your father,' she said. 'He is coming tomorrow, but not your mother. They
went to your aunt's, and your mother says she thinks she must stay and help
her, because your aunt is not very well. But your father would like to come,
because he wants to discuss his latest experiments with Mr. Lenoir, who is very
interested in them. It will be very nice to have him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children would very much rather have had Aunt Fanny instead of Uncle Quentin,
who could be very difficult at times. But still, he would probably be talking
with Mr. Lenoir most of the time, so that would be all right!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
finished their game with Mrs. Lenoir and went up to bed. George was to get
Timmy to take him to her room. Sooty went to see that the coast was clear. He
could not see Block anywhere. His stepfather was still away from the house.
Sarah was singing in the kitchen and the little kitchen-maid, Harriet, was
knitting there in a corner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Block
must be out,' thought Sooty, and went to tell George that the coast was clear.
As he went across the landing to the long passage that led to his own room, the
boy noticed two black lumps sticking out at the bottom of the thick curtains
drawn across the landing window. He looked at them in surprise, and then
recognized them. He grinned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'So
old Block suspects we have a dog, and he thinks it sleeps in George's room or
Julian's, and he's posted himself there to watch!' he thought 'Aha! I'll give
friend Block a nasty shock!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
ran to tell the others. George listened, alarmed. But Sooty, as usual, had a
plan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We'll
give Block an awful shock!' he said. 'I'll get a rope, and we'll all go down to
the landing. I'll suddenly yell out that there's a robber hiding behind the
curtains and I'll pounce on Block, and give him a few good punches. Then, with
your help, Julian and Dick, I'll fold him up well in the curtains - a good jerk
will bring them down on top of him as well!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others began to laugh. It would be fun to play a trick on Block. He really was
such an unpleasant fellow. A good lesson would do him no harm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'While
all the excitement is beginning I'll slip by with Timmy,' said George. 'I only
hope he won't want to join in! He might give Block a good nip!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
hold on to Timmy firmly,' said Julian. 'Get him into your room quickly. Now -
are we ready?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were. Feeling excited they crept down the long passage that led to the door
which opened out on to the landing where Block was hiding. They saw the
curtains move very slightly as they came along. Block was watching.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
waited with Timmy at the passage door, not showing herself at all. Then, with a
yell from Sooty, a really blood-curdling yell that made both George and Timmy
jump, things began to happen!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
flung himself on the hidden Block with all his might. 'A robber! Help, a robber
hiding here!' he shouted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Block
jumped, and began to struggle. Sooty got in two or three well-aimed punches.
Block had often got him<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>into
trouble with his father, and now Sooty was getting a bit of his own back!
Julian and Dick rushed to help.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
violent tug at the curtains brought them down on Block's head! Not only that,
the curtain pole descended on him too, and knocked him sideways. Poor Block -
he was completely taken by surprise, and could do nothing against the three
determined boys. Even Anne gave a hand, though Marybelle stood apart, enjoying
the fun though not daring to take part in it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Just
as it all began George slipped by with Timmy. But Timmy could not bear to miss
the fun. He dragged behind George, and would not go with her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
tried to force him, her hand on his collar. But Timmy had seen a nice fat leg
waving about near him, protruding from the curtain. He pounced on it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was an agonized yell from Block. Certainly Timmy could nip hard with his sharp
white teeth. He worried at the kicking leg for a few seconds, and then had a
sharp slap from George. Shocked, Timmy let go the leg and humbly followed his
mistress. She never slapped him! She must indeed be angry with him. With tail
well down Timmy followed her into the bedroom and got under the bed at once. He
poked his head out and looked beseechingly at George with big brown eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
Timmy - I had to slap you!' said George, and she knelt down by the big dog and
patted his head. 'You see, you might have spoilt everything if you'd been seen.
As it is I'm sure you bit Block and I don't know how we're going to explain
that! Lie. quietly now, old fellow. I'm going out to join the others.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy's
tail thumped softly on the floor. George ran out of the room and joined the
others on the landing. They were having a fine game with Block, who was yelling
and wriggling and struggling for all he was worth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was wrapped up in the blanket like a caterpillar inside a cocoon. His head was
completely covered and he could see nothing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly
Mr. Lenoir appeared in the hall below, with a very scared Mrs. Lenoir beside
him. 'What's all this?' thundered Booty's stepfather. 'Have you gone mad? How
dare you behave like this at this time of night?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Sir,
we've caught a robber and tied him up,' panted Sooty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Lenoir ran up the stairs two steps at a time, amazed. He saw the kicking figure
on the ground well-tied up in the heavy curtains. 'A robber! Do you mean a
burglar? Where did you find him?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'He
was hiding behind the curtains, sir!' said Julian. 'We managed to get hold of
him and tie him up before he could escape. Could you call the police sir?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An
anguished voice came from inside of the curtains. 'Let me go! I've been bitten!
Let me go!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Good
heavens! You've got Block tied up there!' said Mr. Lenoir, in amazement and
anger. 'Untie him, quickly.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'But,
sir - it can't be Block. He was hiding behind those curtains at the window,'
protested Sooty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Do
as you're told,' commanded Mr. Lenoir, getting angry. Anne looked at the tip of
his nose. Yes, it was turning white, as usual!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys reluctantly undid the ropes. Block angrily parted the curtains that
enfolded him, and looked out, his usually blank face crimson with rage and
fright.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
won't stand this sort of thing!' he raged. 'Look here, at my leg, sir! I've
been bitten. Only a dog could have done that. See my leg?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sure
enough there were the marks of teeth on his leg,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>slowly
turning purple. Timmy had taken a good nip, and almost gone through the skin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'There's
no dog here,' said Mrs. Lenoir, coming timidly up the stairs at last. 'You
couldn't have been bitten by a dog, Block.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Who
bit him, then?' demanded Mr. Lenoir, turning fiercely on poor Mrs. Lenoir.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Do
you think 7 could have bitten him, sir, in my excitement?' suddenly said Sooty,
to the enormous surprise of the others, and to their immense amusement. He
spoke very seriously with a worried look on his face. 'When I lose my temper,
sir, I hardly know what I do. Do you think I bit him?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Pah!'
said Mr. Lenoir, in disgust. 'Don't talk nonsense, boy! I'll have you whipped
if I think you go about biting people. Get up, Block. You're not badly hurt.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'My
teeth do feel a bit funny, now I come to think of it,' said Sooty, opening and
shutting his mouth as if to see if they were all right. I think I'd better go
and clean them, sir. I feel as if I've got the taste of Block's ankle in my
mouth. And it isn't nice.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Lenoir, driven to fury by Sooty's impudence, reached out swiftly to box the
boy's ears. But Sooty dodged and ran back up the passage. 'Just going to clean
my teeth!' he called, and the others tried to keep from laughing. The idea of
Sooty biting anyone was absurd. It was quite obvious, however, that neither Mr.
nor Mrs. Lenoir guessed what had bitten Block.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Go
to bed, all of you,' ordered Mr. Lenoir. 'I hope I shall not have to complain
of you to your father tomorrow when he comes - or your uncle, as it may be. I
don't know which of you are his children, and which not. I'm surprised at you
making such a nuisance of yourselves<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>in
somebody else's house. Tying up my servant! If he leaves, it will be your
fault!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children hoped fervently that Block would leave. It would be marvellous to have
the deaf, blank-faced fellow out of the house. He was on the watch for Timmy,
they felt sure. He would snoop about till he got Timmy-or one of them into
trouble.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Block was still there next morning. He came into the schoolroom with the breakfast,
his face almost as blank as usual. He gave Sooty an evil look.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
look out for yourself,' he said, in a curiously soft voice. 'You look out.
Something's going to happen to you one of these days. Yes - and that dog too! I
know you've got a dog, see? You can't deceive me.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children said nothing, but looked at one another. Sooty grinned, and rapped out
a gay little tattoo on the table with his spoon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Dark,
dire, dreadful threats!' he said. 'You look out for yourself too, Block. Any
more snooping about, and you'll find yourself tied up again - yes, and I might
bite you again too. You never know. My teeth feel quite ready for it this
morning.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
bared his teeth at Block, who made no reply at all, but merely looked as if he
had not heard a word. The man went out, and closed the door softly behind him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Nasty
bit of work, isn't he?' said Sooty. But George felt rather alarmed. She feared
Block. There was something cold and clever and bad about those narrow eyes of
his. She longed with all her heart to get Timmy out of the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
got a terrible shock that morning! Sooty came to her, looking agitated. I say!
What do you think? Your father's going to have my room. I've got to sleep with
Julian and Dick. Block is taking all my things from my<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>room
to theirs this very minute, with Sarah. I hope we shall have a chance to get
him out all right, before your father comes!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
Sooty!' said George, in despair. 'I'll go and see if I can get him at once.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
went off, pretending to go to Marybelle's room for something. But Block was
still in Booty's room. And there he stayed, cleaning it all morning!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was very worried about Timmy. He would wonder why she hadn't fetched him. He
would miss his walk. She hovered about the passage all morning, getting into
Sarah's way as she carried clothes from Sooty's old room to Julian's.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Block
gave George some curious looks. He walked with a limp to show that his leg was
bad from the bite. He left the room at last and George darted in. But Block
returned<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>almost
at once and she dashed back into Marybelle's room. Again Block left and went
down the passage, and again the desperate little girl rushed into Sooty's room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Block was back before she could even open the cupboard door. 'What are you
doing in this room?' he said, roughly. 'I haven't cleaned it all morning to
have children in here messing it up again! Clear out of it!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
went - and then once more waited for Block to go. He would have to see to the
luncheon soon! He went at last. George rushed to the door of Sooty's room,
eager to get poor Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
she couldn't open the door. It was locked - and Block had taken the key!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Thirteen POOR GEORGE!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>BY
now George was in despair. She felt as if she was in a nighI'mare. She went to
find Sooty. He was in Julian's room, next to hers, washing his hands ready for
lunch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Sooty!
I shall have to get into the secret passage the way you first took us in,' she
said. 'Through that little study-room of your father's - you know, where the
sliding panels are.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
can't,' said Sooty, looking rather alarmed. 'He uses it now, and he'd half-kill
anyone who went in there. He's got the records of all his experiments there,
and he's put them ready to show your father.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
don't care,' said George, desperately. 'I've got to get in there somehow. Timmy
may starve!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Not
Timmy! He'll live on the rats in the passages!' said Sooty. 'Timmy could always
look after himself, I bet!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
he'd die of thirst then,' said George, obstinately. 'There's no water in those
secret passages. You know that!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
could hardly eat any lunch because she was so worried. She made up her mind
somehow to get into that little study-room, and see if she could open the
entrance into the wall behind the panels. Then she would slip in and get Timmy.
She didn't care what happened; she was going to get Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
shan't tell the others, though,' she thought. 'They would only try and stop me,
or offer to do it themselves, and I don't trust anyone but myself to do this.
Timmy's my dog, and I'm going to save him!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
lunch, everyone went to Julian's room to discuss things. George went with them.
But after a few minutes she left them. 'Back in a minute,' she said. They took
no notice and went on discussing how to rescue Timmy. It really did seem as if
the only way was to raid the study, and try and get into the secret passage
without being seen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'But
my stepfather works there now,' said Sooty. 'And I shouldn't be surprised if he
locks the door when he leaves the room.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
didn't come back. After about ten minutes Anne grew puzzled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
can George be doing? It must be about ten minutes since she went.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
she's probably gone to see if my old room is unlocked yet,' said Sooty, getting
up. You peep out and see if she's about.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
wasn't. She didn't seem to be anywhere! She wasn't in the passage that led to
Sooty's old room; she couldn't be in that room because it was still locked, and
she wasn't in Marybelle's room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
peeped in George's own room, the one she shared with Anne. But that was empty
too. He went downstairs and snooped around a bit. No George!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went back to the others, puzzled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
can't find her anywhere,' he said. 'Where can she be?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
looked alarmed. This was such a queer house, with queer happenings. She wished
George would come.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'She's
not gone into that little study-room, has she?' said Julian, suddenly. It would
be just like George to try and get into the lion's den!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
didn't think of that,' said Sooty. 'Silly of me. I'll go and see.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went down the stairs. He made his way cautiously to his father's study. He
stood quietly outside the shut door. There was no sound from inside. Was his
father there or not?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
debated whether to open the door and peep in or whether to knock. He decided to
knock. Then, if his father answered he could rush back upstairs before the door
could be opened, and his father would not know whom to scold for the
interruption.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
he knocked, very smartly, Rap-rap.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Who's
that?' came his stepfather's irritable voice. 'Come in! Am I to have no peace?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
fled upstairs at once. He went to the others. 'George can't be in the study,'
he said. 'My stepfather's there, and he didn't sound in too good a temper
either.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Then
where can she be?' said Julian, looking worried. 'I do wish she wouldn't go off
without telling us where she's going. She must be somewhere about. She wouldn't
go very far from Timmy.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all had a good hunt over the house, even going into the kitchen. Block was
there, reading a paper. 'What do you want?' he said. 'You won't get it,
whatever it is.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
don't want anything from you,' said Sooty. 'How's your poor bad bitten leg?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Block
looked so unpleasantly at them that they all retreated from the kitchen in a
hurry. Sooty put Julian and Dick on guard, and went up to the staff bedrooms to
see if by any chance George had gone there. A silly idea, he knew, but George
must be somewhere!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
wasn't there, of course. The children went back gloomily to Julian's room.
'This beastly house!' said Julian. 'I can't say I like it. Sorry to say so,
Sooty, but it's a queer place with a queer feeling about it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
was not hurt at all. 'Oh, I agree with you,' he<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>said.
'I've always thought the same myself. So has Mother, and so has Marybelle. It's
my stepfather that likes it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Where
is George?' said Anne. 'I keep on and on trying to think. There's only one
place I'm certain she's not in and that's your stepfather's study, Sooty. Even
George wouldn't dare to go there while your stepfather was there.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Anne was wrong. The study was the very place where George was at that very
moment!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
little girl had made up her mind that it was best to try and get in there, and
wait for a chance to open the sliding panel. So she had slipped downstairs,
gone across the hall, and tried the door of the study. It was locked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Blow!'
said George, desperately. 'Everything is against me and Timmy. How can I get
in? I must, I must!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
slipped out of the side-door near the study and went into the little yard on to
which the study-window looked. Could she get in there?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the window was barred! So that was no good either. She went back again, wishing
she could find the key to unlock the door. But it was nowhere to be seen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly
she heard Mr. Lenoir's voice in the room across the hall. In a panic George
lifted up the lid of a big wooden chest nearby, and climbed hurriedly into it.
She closed the lid over her, and knelt there, waiting, heart beating fast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Lenoir came across the hall. He was going to his study. 'I shall get everything
ready to show my visitor when he comes,' he called to his wife. 'Don't disturb
me at all. I shall be very busy indeed.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
heard the sound of a key being put into the study door. It turned. The door
opened and shut with a click.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it was not locked again from the inside. George knelt in the dark chest and
considered matters. She meant to get into that study. She meant to get through
the entrance into the secret passage, where Tim was. That passage led from the
study to Sooty's old bedroom, and somewhere in that passage was Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
she was going to do once she had Timmy she didn't quite know. Perhaps Sooty
would take him to someone who could look after him for her, someone on Castaway
Hill.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
heard the sound of Mr. Lenoir coughing. She heard the shuffling of papers. Then
she heard the click of a cupboard being opened and shut. Mr. Lenoir was
evidently busy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
he gave an exclamation of annoyance. He said something in an irritable voice
that sounded like 'Now where did I put that?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
the door opened very suddenly and Mr. Lenoir came out. George had just time to
close down the lid, which she had opened to let in fresh air. She knelt in the
chest, trembling, as Mr. Lenoir passed there and went on across the hall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
suddenly knew that this was her chance. Mr. Lenoir might be gone for a few
minutes and give her time to open that panel in the wall! She lifted the lid of
the chest, and jumped out quickly. She ran into the study, and went to the
place where Sooty had pressed the panelling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
before she could even run her fingers over the smooth brown oak, she heard
returning footsteps! Mr. Lenoir had hardly been half a minute. He was coming
back at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
a panic poor George looked round for somewhere to hide. There was a large sofa against
one wall. George<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>crawled
behind it, finding just room to crouch there without being seen. She was hardly
there before Mr. Lenoir entered the room, shut the door, and sat down at his
desk. He switched on a big lamp over it, and bent to look at some documents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
hardly dared to breathe. Her heart bumped against her ribs and seemed to make a
terrible noise. It was very uncomfortable behind the sofa, but she did not dare
to move.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
could not think what in the world to do. It would be terrible to be there for
hours! What would the others think? They would soon be looking for her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were. Even at that moment Sooty was outside the study door, pondering whether
to go in or to knock. He knocked smartly - rap-rap - and George almost jumped
out of her skin!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
heard Mr. Lenoir's impatient voice. 'Who's that? Come in! Am I to have no
peace?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no answer. No one came in. Mr. Lenoir called again. 'Come in, I say!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Still
no answer. He strode to the door and flung it open angrily. No one was there.
Sooty had fled upstairs at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Those
tiresome children, I suppose,' muttered Mr. Lenoir. 'Well, if any of them comes
and knocks again and goes away, I'll punish them properly. Bed and bread and
water for them!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
sounded fierce. George wished she was anywhere but in his study. What would he
say if he knew she was only three or four feet away from him?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Lenoir worked for about half an hour, and poor George got stiffer and stiffer,
and more and more uncomfortable. Then she heard Mr. Lenoir yawn, and her heart
felt lighter. Perhaps he would have a nap! That<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>would
be good luck. She might creep out then, and try to get into the secret passage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Lenoir yawned again. Then he pushed his papers aside and went to the sofa. He
lay down on it and pulled the rug there over his knees. He settled himself down
as if for a good sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sofa creaked under him. George tried to hold her breath again, afraid that now
he was so near to her he would certainly hear her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
a small snore came to her ears. Then another and another. Mr. Lenoir was
asleep! George waited for a few minutes. The snores went on, a little louder.
Surely it would be safe now to creep from her hiding-place?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
began to move, very cautiously and quietly. She crept to the end of the sofa.
She squeezed out from behind it. Still the snores went on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
stood upright and went on tiptoe to the panel that had slid aside. She began to
press here and there with her fingers, trying to find the spot that would move
the panel to one side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
couldn't seem to find it. She grew red with anxiety. She cast a glance at the
sleeping Mr. Lenoir, and worked feverishly at the panel. Where was the spot to
press, oh, where was it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
a stern voice came from behind her, making her jump almost out of her skin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'And
what exactly do you think you are doing, my boy? How dare you come into my
study and mess about like this?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
turned round and faced Mr. Lenoir. He always thought she was a boy! She didn't
know what to say. He looked very angry indeed, and the tip of his nose was
already white.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was frightened. She ran to the door, but Mr.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Lenoir
caught her before she opened it. He shook her<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>hard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
were you doing in my study? Was it you who<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>knocked
and ran away? Do you think it is funny to play<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>tricks
like that? I'll soon teach you that it isn't?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
opened the door and called loudly. 'Block! Come<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>here!
Sarah, tell Block I want him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Block
appeared from the kitchen, his face as blank as<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>usual.
Mr. Lenoir wrote something down quickly on a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>piece
of paper and gave it him to read. Block nodded. 'I've told him to take you to
your room, lock you in, and give you nothing but bread and water for the rest
of the day,' said Mr. Lenoir, fiercely. 'That will teach you to behave yourself
in the future. Any more nonsense, and I'll whip you myself.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'My
father won't be very pleased when he hears you're t punishing me like this,'
began George in a trembling voice. But Mr. Lenoir sneered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Pah!
Wait till he hears from me how you have misbehaved yourself, and I am sure he
will agree with me. Now go, and you will not be allowed out of your room till<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>tomorrow.
I will make your excuses to your father, when<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>he
comes.'<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Poor George was propelled
upstairs by Block, who was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>only
too delighted to be punishing one of the children. As she came to the door of
the room George shouted to the others who were in Julian's room next door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Julian!
Dick! Help me! Quick, help me!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Fourteen<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
VERY PUZZLING THING<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>JULIAN,
Dick, and the others rushed out at once, just in time to see Block shove George
roughly into her room and shut the door. There was a click as he locked it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Here!
What are you doing?' cried Julian, indignantly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Block
took no notice, but turned to go. Julian caught hold of his arm, and yelled
loudly in his ear. 'Unlock that door at once! Do you hear?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Block
gave no sign whether he had or not. He shook off Julian's hand, but the boy put
it back again at once, getting angry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Mr.
Lenoir gave me orders to punish that girl,' said Block, looking at Julian out
of his cold, narrow eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
you jolly well unlock that door,' commanded Julian, and he tried to snatch the
key from Block. With sudden vicious strength the man lifted his hand and struck
Julian, sending him half across the landing. Then he went swiftly downstairs to
the kitchen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
looked after him, a little scared. 'The brute!' he said. 'He's as strong as a
horse. George, George, what-ever's happened?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
answered angrily from the locked bedroom. She told the others everything, and
they listened jn silence. 'Bad luck, George,' said Dick. 'Poor old girl! Just
as you were feeling for the opening to the passage too!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
must apologize for my stepfather,' said Sooty. 'He has such a terrible temper.
He wouldn't have punished you like this if he had thought you were a girl. But
he keeps thinking you're a boy.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
don't care,' said George. 'I don't care about any punishment. It's only that
I'm so worried about Timmy. Well, I suppose I'll have to stay here now, till
I'm let out tomorrow. I shan't eat anything that Block brings , me, you can
tell him. I don't want to see his horrid face again!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'How
shall I go to bed tonight?' wailed Anne. 'All my things are in your room,
George.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You'll
have to sleep with me,' said little Marybelle, who looked very frightened. 'I
can lend you a nightie. Oh dear - what will George's father say when he comes?
I hope he will say that George is to be set free at once.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
he won't,' said George, from behind the locked door. 'He'll just think I've
been in one of my bad moods, and he won't mind my being punished at all. Oh
dear -1 wish Mother was coming too.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others were very upset about George, as well as<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>about
Timmy. Things seemed to be going very wrong indeed. At tea-time they went to
the schoolroom to have tea, wishing they could take George some of the
chocolate cake set ready for them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
felt lonely when the others had gone to tea. It was five o'clock. She was
hungry. She wanted Timmy. She was angry and miserable, and longed to escape.
She went to the window and looked out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Her
room looked straight down the cliff-side, just as Booty's old room did. Below
was the city-wall that ran round the town, going unevenly up and down as it
followed the contours of the hillside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
knew that she could not jump down to the wall. She might roll off it and fall
straight down to the marsh below. That would be horrible. Then she suddenly
remembered the rope-ladder that they used when they got down into the pit each
day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
had at first been kept in Marybelle's room, on the shelf in the cupboard, but
since the children had been scared by knowing that someone had tried the handle
of the door one morning, they had decided to keep the ladder in George's room
for safety. They were afraid that perhaps Block might go snooping round
Marybelle's room and find it. So George had smuggled it to her own room, and
hidden it in her suitcase, which she had locked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
her hands shaking a little with excitement, she unlocked her suitcase and took
out the rope-ladder. She might perhaps escape out of the window with it. She
looked out again, the rope in her hands.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
windows overlooked the city-wall just there. The kitchen too must be just
below, and maybe Block would see her climbing down. That would never do. She
must wait till it was twilight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
the others came back she told them what she was going to do, speaking in a low
voice through the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I'll
get down on the wall, walk along it for some way, and then jump down and creep
back, she said. 'You get some food for me somehow, and I'll have it. Then
tonight, when everyone has gone to bed I'll get into the study again and find
the way through to the secret passage. Sooty can help me. Then I can get
Timmy.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Right,'
said Sooty. 'Wait till it's fairly dark before you go down the ladder, though.
Block has gone to his room with a bad headache, but Sarah and Harriet are in
the kitchen, and you don't want to be seen.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So,
when the twilight hung like a soft purple curtain over the house, George slid down
the rope-ladder out of the window. She only needed to let about a quarter of it
out for it was far too long for such a short distance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
fastened it to the legs of her heavy little oak bed. Then she climbed out of
the window and slid quietly down the rope-ladder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
passed the kitchen window, which fortunately had its blinds drawn down now. She
landed squarely on the old wall. She had brought a torch with her so that she
could see.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
debated with herself what to do. She did not want to run any risk of coming up
against either Block or Mr. Lenoir. Perhaps it would be best to walk along the
wall till she came to some part of the town she knew. Then she could jump off
and make her way cautiously back up the hill, looking out for the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
she began to walk along the broad top of the old wall. It was very rough and
uneven in places, and many stones were missing. But her torch showed a steady
light and she did not miss her footing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
wall ran round some stables, then round the backs of some quaint old shops.
Then it ran round a big yard belonging to some house, and then round the house
itself. Then down it went, around some more houses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
could look into those windows that were not curtained. Lights shone out from
them now. It was queer being able to see into the windows without being seen. A
little family sat at a meal in one room, their faces cheerful and happy. An old
man sat alone in another, leading and smoking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
woman sat listening to a wireless, knitting, as George silently walked on the
wall outside her window. Nobody heard her. Nobody saw her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
she came to another house, a big one. The wall ran close against it, for it was
built where the cliff ran steeply down to the marsh just there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a lighted window there. George glanced in as she passed. Then she stood
still in great surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Surely,
surely that was Block in there! He had his back to her, but she could have
sworn it was Block. The same head, the same ears, the same shoulders!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Who
was he talking to? George tried to see - and all at once she knew. He was
talking to Mr. Barling, whom everyone said was a smuggler - the smuggler of
Castaway Hill!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
wait a minute - could it be Block? Block was deaf, and this man evidently
wasn't. He was listening to Mr. Barling, that was plain, and was answering him,
though George could not hear the words, of course.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
oughtn't to be snooping like this,' said George to herself. 'But it's very
strange, very puzzling and very interesting. If only the man would turn round
I'd know at once if it was Block!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
he didn't turn. He just sat in his chair, his back to George. Mr. Barling, his
long face lighted up by the nearby lamp, was talking animatedly, and Block, if
it was Block, was listening intently and nodding his head in agreement every
now and again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
felt puzzled. If she only knew for certain that it was Block! But why should he
be talking to Mr. Barling - and wasn't he stone deaf after all then?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
jumped down from the wall into a dark little passage and made her way through
the town, up to Smuggler's Top. Outside the front door, hiding in the shadows
was Sooty. He laid his hand on George's arm, making her jump.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Come
on in. I've left the side-door open. We've got a fine spread for you!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two slipped in at the side-door, tiptoed past the study, across the hall, and
up to Julian's bedroom. Truly there was a spread there!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
went and raided the larder,' said Sooty, with satisfaction. 'Harriet was out,
and Sarah had run along to the post. Block has gone to bed for a rest, because,
he said, he had such an awful headache.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,'
said George, 'then it couldn't have been Block I saw. And yet I'm as certain as
certain can be that it was!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Whatever
do you mean?' asked the others, in surprise. George sat down on the floor and
began to gobble up cakes and tarts, for she was terribly hungry. Between her
mouthfuls she told them how she had got out of the window, walked along the
city-wall, and found herself unexpectedly by Mr. Barling's house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'And
I looked into a lighted window there, and saw Block talking to Mr. Barling -
and listening to him and answering him!' she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others could not believe this. 'Did you see his face?' asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,'
said George. 'But I'm certain it was Block. Go and peep into his room and see
if he's there, Sooty. He wouldn't be back yet from Mr. Barling's, because he
had a glass full of something or other, which would take him some time to
drink. Go and peep.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
vanished. He came back quickly. 'He's in bed!' he said. 'I could see the shape
of his body and the dark patch of his head. Are there two Blocks then? Whatever
does this mean?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

HAPPENINGS<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>IT
certainly was very puzzling - most of all to George, who felt so certain it had
been Block talking to the well-known smuggler. The others did not feel so
certain, especially as George admitted that she had not seen his face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Is
my father here yet?' asked George, suddenly, remembering that he was supposed
to come that evening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes.
Just arrived,' said Sooty. 'Just before you came. I nearly got run over by the
car! Just hopped aside in time. I was out there waiting for you.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
are our plans?' asked George. Til have to get Timmy tonight, or he'll be
frantic. I think I'd better go and climb back through my window again now, in
case Block comes along and finds I've disappeared. I'll wait till everyone is
in bed and then I'll slip out of the window again, and you must let me into the
house, Sooty, please. Then I'll go to the study with you and you must open the
secret way for me. Then I'll find Timmy and everything will be all right.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
don't see that everything will be all right,' said Sooty, doubtfully. 'But
anyway, your plan is the only one to follow. You'd better get back into your
room now, if you've had enough to eat.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I'll
take a few buns back with me,' said George, stuffing them into her pocket.
'Sooty, come and knock at my door when everyone is in bed and I'll know then
that it's safe for me to slip out of the window, and come into the house again.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
wasn't long before George was back in her room once<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>more
- just in time too, for Block appeared a little while after with a plate of dry
bread and a glass of water. He unlocked the door and put them on the table.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Your
supper,' he said. George looked at his blank face and disliked it so much that
she felt she must do something about it. So she took up the water and threw it
deftly at the back of his head. It dripped down his neck and made him jump.
Block took a step towards her, his eyes gleaming - but Julian and Dick were by
the door, and he did not dare to strike her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I'll
pay you out for that,' he said. 'See? You will never get that dog of yours back
again!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went out and locked the door. Julian called through as soon as he had gone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
did you do that for, you idiot? He's a bad enemy to make.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
know. I just couldn't help it somehow,' said George, forlornly. 'I wish I
hadn't now.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others had to go down to see Mr. Lenoir. They left George feeling lonely. It
was horrid to be locked up like this, even though she could escape through the
window whenever she wanted to. She listened for the others to come back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
soon did, and reported their meeting with George's father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Uncle
Quentin is awfully tired and a bit cross, and frightfully annoyed with you for
misbehaving,' said Julian, through the door. 'He said you were to be locked up
the whole of tomorrow too, if you don't apologize.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
didn't mean to apologize. She couldn't bear Mr. Lenoir, with his false smiles
and laughter, and his sudden queer rages. She said nothing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We've
got to go and have our supper now,' said Sooty. 'We'll save you some of it as
soon as Block goes out of the room. Look out for a knocking on your door
tonight. It'll be me, telling you everyone's in bed.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
lay on her bed, thinking. Many things puzzled her. She couldn't get them
straight somehow. The signaller in the tower - the queer man, Block - Mr.
Barling's talk to a man who looked so like Block; but Block was all the time in
his bed at home. As she lay thinking, her eyes closed, and she fell asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
went to bed with Marybelle, and came to whisper good-night to her. The boys all
went into the next room, for Sooty was now to share Julian's and Dick's
bedroom. George woke up enough to say good-night and then slept again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
midnight she awoke with a jump. Someone was knocking softly and impatiently on
her door. It was Sooty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Coming!'
whispered George through the door, and took up her torch. She went to the
window and was soon safely down the rope-ladder. She jumped down from the wall,
and went to the side-door of the house. Sooty was there. She slipped in
thankfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Everyone's
gone to bed,' whispered Sooty. 'I thought | your father and my stepfather were
never going. They stayed talking in the study for ages!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Gome
on. Let's go there,' said George, impatiently. They went to the study-door, and
Sooty turned the handle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was locked again! He pushed hard, but it wasn't a bit of good. It was well and
truly locked!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
might have thought of that,' said George, in despair. 'Blow, blow, blow! What
are we to do now?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
thought for a few moments. Then he spoke in a low voice, in George's ear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'There's
only one thing left to do, George. I must creep into your father's room - my
old bedroom - when he is asleep - and I must get into the cupboard there, open
the entrance to the secret passage, and slip in that way. I'll find Timmy and
bring him back the same way, hoping that your father won't wake!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh!
Would you really do that for me?' said George, gratefully. 'You are a good
friend, Sooty! Would you rather I did it?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No.
I know the way up and down that passage better than you do,' said Sooty. 'It's
a bit frightening to be all alone there at midnight too. I'll go.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
went with Sooty up the stairs, across the wide landing, to the door at the end
of the passage that led to Sooty's old room, where George's father was now
sleeping. When they got there, George pulled his arm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Sooty!
The buzzer will go as soon as you open the door - and it will wake my father
and warn him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Idiot!
I disconnected it as soon as I knew my room was to be changed,' said Sooty,
scornfully. 'As if I wouldn't think of that!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
opened the door that led into the passage. He crept up to his old room. The
door was shut. He and George listened intently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Your
father sounds a bit restless,' said Sooty. 'I'll wait my chance to creep in,
George, and then, as soon as possible, slip into the cupboard and open the
secret passage to find Tim. As soon as I've got Timmy I'll bring him along to
you. You could wait in Marybelle's room if you liked. Anne's there too.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
crept into the room next door, where Anne and Marybelle lay fast asleep. She
left the door open, so that she might hear when Sooty returned. How lovely it
would be to have dear old Timmy again! He would lick her and lick her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
crept into the room where George's father lay, half-asleep. He made no sound.
He knew every creaking board and avoided them. He made his way quietly to a big
chair, meaning to hide behind it till he was certain George's father was sound
asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
some time the man in the bed tossed and turned. He was tired with his long
journey, and his mind was excited with his talk with Mr. Lenoir. He muttered
now and again, and Sooty began to feel he would never be sound asleep! He grew
sleepy himself, and yawned silently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
last George's father grew quiet and peaceful. No more creaks came from the bed.
Sooty cautiously moved out from behind the chair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
suddenly something startled him. He heard a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>sound
over by the window! But what could it be? It was a very small sound, like a
tiny creak of a door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
night was rather dark, but the window, its curtains pulled right back, could
easily be seen as a square of grey. Sooty fixed his eyes on it. Was someone
opening the window?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>No.
The window did not move. But something queer was happening under it, near the
sill.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
big window-seat was built in under the window, wide and comfortable. Sooty knew
it well! He had sat on it hundreds of times to look out of the window. Now,
what was happening to it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
looked as if the top, or lid of the seat was slowly moving upwards, bit by bit.
Sooty was puzzled. He had never known it could be opened like that. It had
always been screwed down, and he had thought it was just a seat and nothing
else. But now it looked as if someone had unscrewed the top, and had hidden
himself inside, lifting up the top like a lid when he thought it was safe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
stared at the upward-moving lid, quite fascinated. Who was in there? Why had he
hidden? It was rather frightening, seeing the lid move slowly, bit by bit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
last the lid was wide open and rested against the window-pane. A big figure
cautiously and slowly got out, not making the slightest sound. Sooty felt his hair
rising up on his head. He was afraid, terribly afraid. He could not utter a
sound.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
figure tiptoed over to the bed. He made a quick and sudden movement, and there
was a stifled sound from George's father. Sooty guessed he had been gagged, so
that he could not cry out. Still the boy could not move or speak. He had never
been so scared in all his life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
intruder lifted the limp body from the bed, and went to the window-seat. He put
George's father into the darkness there. What he had done to make him unable to
struggle Sooty didn't know. He only knew that poor George's father was being
put down in the window-seat, and couldn't seem to move a hand to help himself!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy suddenly found his voice. 'Hie!' he yelled. 'Hie! What are you doing? Who
are you?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
remembered his torch and switched it on. He saw a face he knew, and cried out
in surprise. 'Mr. Barling!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
someone hit him a hard blow on the head and he remembered nothing more at all.
He did not know that he was lifted into the window-seat too. He did not know
that the intruder followed after him. He knew nothing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George,
awake in the next room, suddenly heard Sooty's voice crying out. 'Hie!' she
heard. 'Hie, what are you doing? Who are you?' And then, as she slipped out of
bed, she heard the next cry. 'Mr. Barling!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was extremely startled. What was going on next door? She fumbled about for her
torch. Anne and Marybelle were still asleep. George could not find her torch.
She fell over a chair and banged her head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
at last she had found her torch she tiptoed, trembling, to the door. She shone
her torch and saw that the door next to hers was a little ajar, just as Sooty
had left it, when he had crept inside. She listened. There was absolutely no
sound at all now. She had heard a small bumping noise after Sooty's last cry,
but she didn't know what it was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
suddenly put her head round the door of her father's room, and shone her torch
again. She stared in surprise. The bed was empty. The room was empty. There was
no one there at all! She flashed her torch all round.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
opened the cupboard door fearfully. She looked under the bed. She was, in fact,
extremely brave.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
last she sank down on the window-seat, frightened and puzzled. Where was her
father? Where was Sooty? Whatever had been happening here that night?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

MORNING<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
George sat by the window, on the very seat into which everyone had
unaccountably disappeared, though she did not know it, she heard a faint sound
from the passage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Quick
as lightning the girl slipped under the bed. Someone was creeping down the long
passage! George lay silently on the floor, lifting the valance a little to try
and see who it was. What queer things were going on tonight!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Someone
came in at the door. Someone stopped there, as if to look and listen. Then the
Someone crept over to the window-seat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
watched and listened, straining her eyes in the darkness. She dimly saw the
Someone outlined against the grey square of the window. He was bent over the
window-seat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
showed no light at all. But he made some curious little sounds. First came the
sound of his fingers tapping about on the closed lid of the seat. Then came the
clink of something metallic, and a very faint squeaking. George could not
imagine what the man - if it was a man - was doing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
about five minutes the Someone worked away at his task in the darkness. Then,
as quietly as he had come, he went away. George couldn't help thinking it was
Block, though his outline against the dark-grey of the window was too dim to
recognize. But he had once given a little cough exactly like Block so often
gave. It must be Block! But whatever was he doing in her father's room at
night, on the window-seat?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
felt as if she was in a bad dream. The queerest things happened and kept on
happening, and they didn't seem to make sense at all. Where was her father? Had
he left his room and gone wandering over the house? Where was Sooty, and why
had he called out? He wouldn't have shouted out like that, surely, if her father
had been asleep in the room!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
lay under the bed, shivering, for a little while longer. Then she rolled out
softly and went out of the door. She crept down the long passage to the end.
She opened the door there and peeped out. The whole house was in darkness.
Little sounds came to George's ears - a window rattling faintly, the creak of
some bit of furniture - but nothing else.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
had only one thought in her mind, and that was to get to the boys' room and
tell them the mysterious things that had happened. Soon she was across the
landing, and had slipped through the door of Julian's bedroom. He and Dick were
awake, of course, waiting for Sooty to come with Timmy and George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
only George arrived. A scared George, with a very curious story to tell. She
wrapped herself in the eiderdown on Julian's bed, and told what had happened,
in whispers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were amazed. Uncle Quentin gone! Sooty disappeared! Someone creeping into the
room and fiddling about on the window-seat! What did it all mean?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We'll
come to Uncle Quentin's room with you, straight away now,' said Julian, pulling
on a dressing-gown, and hunting about for his slippers. 'I've got a feeling
that things are getting pretty serious.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all padded off to the other rooms. They went into Marybelle's room and woke her
and Anne. Both little girls felt scared. Soon all five children were in the

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>room,
from which George's father and Sooty had so strangely vanished.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
shut the door, drew the curtains and switched on the light. At once they all
felt better. It was so horrid to grope about in the dark with torches.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
looked round the silent room. There was nothing there to show them how the
others had disappeared. The bed was crumpled and empty. On the floor lay
Booty's torch, where it had fallen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
repeated again what she had thought she had heard Sooty call out, but it made
no sense to anyone. 'Why call out Mr. Barling's name, when there was only your
father in the room?' said Julian. 'Surely Mr. Barling wasn't hiding here - that
would be nonsense. He had nothing to do with your father, George.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
know. But I'm sure it was Mr. Barling's name that I heard Sooty call out,' said
George. 'Do you think - oh yes, do you think Mr. Barling could possibly

work or other - and have gone back the same way, taking the others with him
because they discovered him?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
seemed a likely explanation, though not a very good one. They all went to the
cupboard and opened it. They groped between the clothes for the secret opening.
But the little iron handle set there to pull on the stone at the back, was
gone! Someone had removed it - and now the secret passage could not be entered,
for there was no way of opening it just there!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Look
at that!' said Julian in astonishment. 'Someone's been tampering with that too.
No, George, the midnight visitor, whoever he was, didn't go back that way.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
looked pale. She had been hoping to go and fetch Timmy, by slipping through the
secret opening in the cupboard. Now she couldn't. She longed for Timmy<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>with
all her heart, and felt that if only the big faithful dog were with her things
would seem much brighter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I'm
sure Mr. Lenoir is at the bottom of all this!' said Dick. 'And Block too. I bet
that was Block you saw in here tonight, doing something in the dark, George. I
bet he and Mr. Lenoir are hand in glove with each other over something.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
then - we can't possibly go and tell them what has happened!' said Julian. 'If
they are at the bottom of all these queer happenings it would be foolish to go
and tell them what we know. And we can't tell your mother, Marybelle, because
she would naturally go to your father about it. It's a puzzle to know what to
do!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
began to cry. Marybelle, frightened and puzzled, at once began to sob too.
George felt tears pricking the backs of her eyelids, but she blinked them away.
George never cried!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>6I
want Sooty,' wept Marybelle, who adored her cheeky, daring brother. 'Where's he
gone? I'm sure he's in danger. I do want Sooty.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We'll
rescue him tomorrow, don't you worry,' said Julian, kindly. 'We can't do
anything tonight, though. There's nobody at Smuggler's Top we can possibly get
advice or help from, as things are. I vote we go to bed, sleep on it, and make
plans in the morning. By that time Sooty and Uncle Quentin may have turned up
again. If they haven't, Mr. Lenoir will have to be told by someone, and we'll
see how he behaves! If he's surprised and upset, we'll soon know if he has had anything
to do with this mystery or not. He'll have to do something - go to the police,
or have the house turned upside down to find the missing people. We'll soon see
what happens.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
felt a little comforted after this long speech. Julian sounded cheerful and
firm, though he didn't feel<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>at
all happy, really. He knew, better than any of the others, that something very
strange, and probably dangerous, was going on at Smuggler's Top. He wished the
girls were not there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Now
listen,' he said. 'George, you go and sleep with Anne and Marybelle next door.
Lock your door and keep the light on. Dick and I will sleep here, in Booty's
old room, also with the light on, so you'll know we are quite nearby.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was comforting to know that the two boys were so near. The three girls went at
last into Marybelle's room, tired out. Anne and Marybelle got into bed again,
and George lay down on a small but comfortable couch, pulling a thick rug over
her. In spite of all the worry and excitement the girls were asleep in a half a
minute, quite exhausted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys talked a little, as they lay in Booty's old bed, where their Uncle Quentin
had been asleep some time before. Julian did not think anything more would
happen that night. He and Dick fell asleep, but Julian was ready to wake at the
slightest noise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Next
morning they were awakened by a most surprised Sarah, who had come in to draw
the curtains and bring George's father a pot of early-morning tea. She could
not believe her eyes when she saw the two boys in the visitor's bed - and no
visitor!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What's
all this?' said Sarah, gaping. 'Where's your uncle? Why are you here?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
we'll explain later,' said Julian, who did not want to enter into any details
with Sarah, who was a bit of a chatterbox. 'You can leave the tea, Sarah. We'd
like it!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,
but where's your uncle? Is he in your room?' said the puzzled Sarah. 'What's
up?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
can go and look in our room if you like and see<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>if
he's there,' said Dick, wanting to get rid of the amazed woman. She
disappeared, thinking that the household must be going mad. She left the hot
tea behind, though, and the boys at once took it into the girls' room. George
unlocked the door for them. They took it in turns to sip the hot tea from the
one cup.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Presently
Sarah came back, with Harriet and Block. Block's face was as blank as usual.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'There's
nobody in your room, Master Julian,' began Sarah. Then Block gave a sudden
exclamation and stared at George angrily. He had thought she was locked in her
room - and here she was in Marybelle's room, drinking tea!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'How
did you get out?' he demanded. Til tell Mr. Lenoir. You're in disgrace.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Shut
up,' said Julian. 'Don't you dare to speak to my cousin like that. I believe
you're mixed up in this curious business. Clear out, Block.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Whether
Block heard or not, he gave no sign of going. Julian got up, his face set.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Clear
out of this room,' he said, narrowing his eyes. 'Do you hear? I have a feeling
that the police might be interested in you, Block. Now clear out!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Harriet
and Sarah gave little shrieks. The sudden mystery was too much for them. They
gazed at Block and began to back out of the room. Fortunately Block went too,
casting an evil look at the determined Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
shall go to Mr. Lenoir,' said Block, and disappeared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
a few minutes along came Mr. and Mrs. Lenoir to Marybelle's room. Mrs. Lenoir
looked scared out of her life. Mr. Lenoir looked puzzled and upset.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Now,
what's all this?' he began. 'Block has been to me with a most curious tale.
Says your father has disappeared, George, and ...'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'And
so has Sooty,' suddenly wailed Marybelle, bursting into tears again. 'Sooty's
gone. He's gone too.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Lenoir gave a cry. 'What do you mean? How can he have gone? Marybelle, what do
you mean?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Marybelle,
I think I had better take charge of the telling,' said Julian, who was not
going to let the little girl give away all the things they knew. After all, Mr.
Lenoir was probably at the bottom of everything, and it would be foolish to
tell him what they suspected about him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Julian
- tell me what has happened. Quickly!' begged Mrs. Lenoir, looking really
upset.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Uncle
Quentin disappeared from his bed last night, and Sooty has vanished too,' said
Julian, shortly. 'They may turn up, of course.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Julian!
You are keeping back something,' said Mr. Lenoir, suddenly, watching the boy
sharply. 'You will tell us everything, please. How dare you keep anything back
at a moment like this?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Tell
him Julian, tell him,' wailed Marybelle, Julian looked obstinate, and glared at
Marybelle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
tip of Mr. Lenoir's nose went white. 'I am going to the police,' he said.
'Perhaps you will talk to them, my boy. They will knock some sense into you!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was surprised. 'Why - I shouldn't have thought you would want to go to the
police!' he blurted out. 'You've got too many secrets to hide!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Seventeen<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>MORE
AND MORE PUZZLING<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>MR.
LENOIR stared in the utmost amazement at Julian. There was a dead silence after
this remark. Julian could have kicked himself for making it, but he couldn't
unsay it now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Lenoir opened his mouth to say something at last, when footsteps came to the
door. It was Block.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Come
in, Block!' said Mr. Lenoir. 'There seem to have been queer happenings here.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Block
did not appear to hear, and remained outside the door. Mr. Lenoir beckoned him
in impatiently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,'
said Julian, firmly. 'What we have to say is not to be said in front of Block,
Mr. Lenoir. We don't like him and we don't trust him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
do you mean?' cried Mr. Lenoir, angrily. 'What do you know about my servants?
I've known Block for years before he came into my service, and he's a most
trustworthy fellow. He can't help being deaf, and that makes him irritable at
times.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
remained obstinate. He caught an angry gleam in Block's cold eyes, and glared
back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
this is incredible!' said Mr. Lenoir, trying not to lose his temper. 'I can't
think what's come over everybody - disappearing like this - and now you
children talking to me as if I wasn't master in my own house. I insist that you
tell me all you know.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I'd
rather tell it to the police,' said Julian, his eye on Block. But Block showed
no trace of expression on his face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Go
away, Block,' said Mr. Lenoir at last, seeing that there was no hope of getting
anything out of Julian while the servant was there. 'You'd better all come down
to my study. This is getting more and more mysterious. If the police have got
to know, you may as well tell me first. I don't want to look a complete idiot
in my own house in front of them.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
couldn't help feeling a bit puzzled. Mr. Lenoir was not behaving as he had
thought he might behave. He seemed sincerely puzzled and upset, and he was
evidently planning to get the police in himself. Surely he wouldn't do that if
he had had a hand in the disappearances? Julian was lost in bewilderment again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Lenoir was now crying quietly, with Marybelle sobbing beside her. Mr. Lenoir
put an arm round his wife and kissed Marybelle, suddenly appearing very much
nicer than he had ever seemed before. 'Don't worry,' he said, in a gentle
voice. 'We'll soon get to the bottom of this, if I have to get the whole of the
police force in. I think I know who's at the bottom of it all!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
surprised Julian even more. He and the others followed Mr. Lenoir down to his
study. It was still locked. Mr. Lenoir opened it and pushed aside a great pile
of papers that were on his desk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Now
- what do you know?' he said to Julian quietly. The children noticed that the
top of his nose was no longer white. Evidently he had got over his burst of
temper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
sir - I think this is a queer house, with a lot of queer things happening in
it,' said Julian, not quite knowing how to begin. 'I'm afraid, sir, you won't
like me telling the police all I know.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Julian,
don't speak in riddles!' said Mr. Lenoir, impatiently. 'You act as if I were a
criminal, in fear of the police. I'm not. What goes on in this house?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
- the signalling from the tower, for instance,' said Julian, watching Mr.
Lenoir's face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Lenoir gaped. It was clear that he was immensely astonished. He stared at
Julian, and Mrs. Lenoir cried out suddenly:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Signalling!
What signalling?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
explained. He told how Sooty had discovered the light-flashing first, and then
how he and Dick had gone with him to the tower when they had seen the flashing
again. He described the line of tiny, pricking lights across the marsh from the
seaward side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Lenoir listened intently. He asked questions about dates and times. He heard
how the boys had followed the signaller to Block's room, where he had
disappeared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Got
out of the window, I suppose,' said Mr. Lenoir.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Block's
got nothing to do with this, you can rest assured of that. He is most faithful
and loyal, and has been a great help to me while he has been here. I have an
idea that Mr. Barling is at the bottom of all this. He can't signal from his
house to the sea because it's not quite high enough up the hill, and is in the
wrong position. He must have been using my tower to signal from - coming
himself to do it too! He knows all the secret ways of this house, better than I
do! It would be easy for him to come here whenever he wanted to.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children thought at once that probably Mr. Barling had been the signaller! They
stared at Mr. Lenoir. They were all beginning to think that he really and truly
had nothing to do with the queer goings-on after all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
don't see why Block shouldn't know all this,' said Mr. Lenoir, getting up.
'It's plain to me that Barling could explain a lot of the queer things that
have been happening. I'll see if Block has ever suspected anything.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
pursed his lips together. If Mr. Lenoir was going<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>to
tell everything to Block, who certainly must be in the plot somehow, he wasn't
going to tell him anything more!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I'll
see what Block thinks about everything, and then if we can't solve this mystery
ourselves, we'll get in the police,' said Mr. Lenoir, going out of the room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
did not want to say anything much in front of Mrs. Lenoir. So he changed the
subject completely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
about breakfast?' he said. Tm feeling hungry!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
they all went to have breakfast, though Mar/belle could eat nothing at all,
because she kept thinking of poor Sooty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
think,' said Julian, when they were alone at the table, 'I rather think we'll
do a little mystery-solving ourselves. I'd like a jolly good look round that
room of your father's, George, to begin with. There must be some other way of
getting out of there, besides the secret passage we know.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What
do you think happened there last night?' said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
I imagine that Sooty went there and hid, to wait until it was safe to try and
get into the secret passage as soon as Uncle Quentin was asleep,' said Julian,
thoughtfully. 'And while he was hiding, someone came into that room from
somewhere, to kidnap Uncle Quentin. Why, I don't know, but that's what I think.
Then Sooty yelled out in surprise, and got knocked on the head or something.
Then he and Uncle Quentin were kidnapped together, and taken off through some
secret way we don't know.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes,'
said George. 'And it was Mr. Barling who kidnapped them! I distinctly heard
Sooty yell out &quot;Mr. Barling&quot;. He must have switched on his torch and
seen him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'They
are quite probably hidden somewhere in Mr. Barling's house, 'said Anne,
suddenly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes!'
said Julian. 'Why didn't I think of that? Why, that's just where they would be,
of course. I've a jolly good mind to go down and have a look!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
let me come too,' begged George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,'
said Julian. 'Certainly not. This is rather a dangerous adventure, and Mr.
Barling is a bad and dangerous man. You and Marybelle are certainly not to
come. I'll take Dick.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
are absolutely meanl' began George, her eyes flashing. 'Aren't I as good as a
boy? I'm going to come.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
if you're as good as a boy, which I admit you are,' said Julian, 'can't you
stay and keep an eye on Anne and Marybelle for us? We don't want them kidnapped
too.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
don't go, George,' said Anne. 'Stay here with us.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
think it's mad to go, anyhow,' said George, 'Mr. Barling wouldn't let you in.
And if you did get in you wouldn't be able to find all the secret places in his
house. There must be as many, and more, as there are here.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
couldn't help thinking George wag right. Still, it was worth trying.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
and Dick set out after breakfast, and went down the hill to Mr. Barling's. But
when they got there they found the whole house shut up. Nobody answered their
knocking and ringing. The curtains were drawn across the closed windows, and no
smoke came from the chimney.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Mr.
Barling's gone away for a holiday,' said the gardener who was working in the
next door flower-beds. 'Went this morning, he did. In his car. All his servants
have got a holiday too.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh!'
said Julian, blankly. 'Was there anyone with him in the car - a man and a boy,
for instance?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
gardener looked surprised at this question, and shook his head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No.
He was alone, and drove off himself.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Thanks,'
said Julian, and walked back with Dick to Smuggler's Top. This was queer. Mr.
Barling had shut up the house and gone off without his captives! Then what had
he done with them? And why on earth had he kidnapped Uncle Quentin? Julian
remembered that Mr. Lenoir had not put forward any reason for that. Did he know
one, and hadn't wanted to say what it was? It was all most puzzling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Meantime
George had been doing a little snooping<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>round
on her own. She had slipped into Uncle Quentin's room, and had had a really
good look round everywhere to see if by chance there was another secret passage
Sooty hadn't known about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
had tapped the walls. She had turned back the carpet and examined every inch of
the floor. She had tried the cupboard again, and wished she could get through
into the secret passage there and find Timmy. The study door downstairs was
again locked, and she did not dare to tell Mr. Lenoir about Timmy and ask his
help.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was just about to leave the quiet room when she noticed something on the floor
near the window. She bent to pick it up. It was a small screw. She looked
round. Where had it come from?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
first she couldn't see any screws of the same size at all. Then her eyes slid
down to the window-seat. There were screws there, screwing down the top oaken
plank to the under ones that supported it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Had
the screw come out of the window-seat? Why should it, anyway? The others there
were all screwed down tightly. She examined one. Then she gave a low cry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'One's
missing. The one in the middle of this side. Now just let me think.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
remembered last night. She remembered how someone had crept in, while she had
hidden under the bed, and had fiddled about by the window, bending over the
polished window-seat. She remembered the little noises - the metallic clinks
and the tiny squeaks. It was screws being screwed into the seat!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Someone
screwed down the window-seat last night -and in the darkness, dropped one of
the little screws,' thought George, beginning to feel excited. 'Why did he<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>screw
it down? To hide something? What's in this window-seat? It sounds hollow
enough. It never lifted up. I know that. It was always screwed down, because I
remember looking for a cupboard under it, like the one we have at home, and
there wasn't one.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
began to feel certain there was some secret about the window-seat. She rushed
off to get a screwdriver. She found one and hurried back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
shut the door and locked it behind her in case Block should come snooping
around. Then she set to work with the screwdriver. What would she find in the
window-seat? She could hardly wait to see!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Eighteen CURIOUS DISCOVERIES.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>JUST
as she had unscrewed almost the last screw there came a tapping at the door.
George jumped and stiffened. She did not answer, afraid that it was Block, or
Mr. Lenoir.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then,
to her great relief she heard Julian's voice. 'George! Are you in here?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
little girl hurried across to the door and unlocked it. The boys came in,
looking surprised, followed by Anne and Marybelle. George shut the door and
locked it again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Mr.
Barling's gone away and shut up the house,' said Julian. 'So that's that. What
on earth are you doing, George?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Unscrewing
this window-seat,' said George, and told them about the screw she had found on
the floor. They all crowded round her, excited.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Good
for you, George!' said Dick. Tlere, let me finish the unscrewing.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No,
thanks. This is my job!' said George. She took out the last screw. Then she
lifted the edge of the window-seat. It came up like a lid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
peered inside, rather scared. What would they see? To their great surprise and
disappointment they saw nothing but an empty cupboard! It was as if the
window-seat was a box, with the lid screwed down for people to sit on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
- what a disappointment!' said Dick. He shut down the lid. 'I don't expect you
heard anyone screwing down the lid, really, George. It might have been your
imagination.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
it wasn't,' said George, shortly. She opened the lid again. She got right into
the box-like window-seat and stamped, and pressed with her feet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
quite suddenly, there came a small creaking noise, and the bottom of the empty
window-seat fell downwards like a trap-door on a hinge!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
gasped and clutched at the side. She kicked about in air for a moment and then
scrambled out. Everyone looked down in silence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
looked down a straight yawning hole, which, however, came to an end only about
eight feet down. There it appeared to widen out, and, no doubt, entered a
secret passage which ran into one of the underground tunnels with which the
whole hill was honeycombed. It might even run to Mr. Barling's house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Look
at that!' said Dick. 'Who would have thought of that? I bet even old Sooty
didn't know about this.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Shall
we go down?' said George. 'Shall we see where it goes to? We might find old
Timmy.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
came the noise of someone trying the handle of the door. It was locked. Then there
was an impatient rapping, and a cross voice called out sharply:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Why
is this door locked? Open it at once! What are you doing in here?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
father!' whispered Marybelle, with wide eyes. 'I'd better unlock the door.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
shut the lid of the window-seat down at once, very quietly. She did not want
Mr. Lenoir to see their latest discovery. When the door was opened Mr. Lenoir
saw the children standing about, or sitting on the window-seat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I've
had a good talk to Block,' he said, 'and, as I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>thought,
he doesn't know a thing about all the goings-on here. He was most amazed to
hear about the signalling from the tower. But he doesn't think it's Mr.
Barling. He thinks it may be a plot of some sort against me'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh!'
said the children, who felt that they would not believe Block so readily as Mr.
Lenoir appeared to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
quite upset Block,' said Mr. Lenoir. 'He feels really sick, and I've told him
to go and have a rest till we decide what to do next.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children felt \hat Block would not be so easily upset as all that. They all
suspected at once that he would not really go to rest, but would probably sneak
out on business of his own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I've
some work to attend to for a little while,' said Mr. Lenoir. 'I've rung up the
police, but unluckily the Inspector is out. He will ring me directly he comes
back. Now can you keep out of mischief till I've finished my work?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children thought that was a silly question. They made no reply. Mr. Lenoir gave
one of his sudden smiles and little laughs, and went.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I'm
going to pop along to Block's room and see if he really is there,' said Julian,
as soon as Mr. Lenoir was out of sight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went to the wing where the staff bedrooms were, and stopped softly outside
Block's. The door was a little ajar, and Julian could see through the crack. He
saw the shape of Block's body in the bed, and the dark patch that was his head.
The curtains were drawn across the window to keep out the light, but there was
enough to see all this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
sped back to the others. 'Yes, he's in bed all right,' he said. 'Well, he's
safe for a bit. Shall we have a shot at getting down the window-seat hole? I'd
dearly like to see where it leads to!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
yes!' said everyone. But it was not an easy job to drop eight feet down without
being terribly jolted! Julian went first and was very much jarred. He called up
to Dick: 'We'll have to get a bit of rope and tie it to something up there, and
let it hang down the hole - it's an awful business to let yourself drop down.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
just as Dick went to find a rope, Julian called up again. 'Oh, it's all right!
I've just seen something. There are niches carved into the sides of the hole -
niches you can put foot or hand into. I didn't see them before. You can use
them to help you down.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
down went everyone, one after another, feeling for the niches and finding them.
George missed one or two, clawed wildly at the air, and dropped down the last
few feet, landing with rather a bump, but she was not hurt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
they had thought, the hole led to another secret passage in the house, but this
one went straight downwards by means of steps, so that very soon they were well
below the level of the house. Then they came into the .maze of tunnels that
honeycombed the hill. They stopped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Look
here - we can't possibly go any farther,' said Julian. 'We shall get lost. We
haven't got Sooty with us now, and Marybelle isn't any good at finding the way.
It would be dangerous to wander about.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Listen!'
said Dick, suddenly, in a low voice. 'There's someone coming!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
could hear the hollow sound of footsteps coming from a tunnel to the left of
them. They all shrank back into the shadows, and Julian switched off his torch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
two people!' whispered Anne, as two figures came out of the nearby tunnel. One
was very tall and long. The other - yes, surely the other was Block! If it
wasn't Block it was someone the exact image of him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
men were talking in low voices, answering one another. How could it be Block,
though, if he could hear as well as that? Anyway, Block was asleep in bed. It
was hardly ten minutes since Julian had seen him there. Were there two Blocks,
then, thought George, as she had once thought before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
men disappeared into another tunnel, and the bright light of their lanterns
disappeared gradually. The muffled rumble of their voices echoed back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Shall
we follow them?' said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Of
course not,' said Julian. 'We might lose them - and lose ourselves too! And
supposing they suddenly turned back and found us following them? We should be
in a horrid fix.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tm
sure the first man was Mr. Barling,' said Anne, suddenly. 'I couldn't see his
face because the light of the lantern wasn't on it - but he seemed just like
Mr. Barling - awfully tall and long everywhere!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'But
Mr. Barling's gone away,' said Marybelle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'''Supposed
to have gone away!' said George. 'It looks as if he's come back, if it was him.
I wonder where those two have gone - to see my father and Sooty, do you think?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Quite
likely,' said Julian. 'Come on, let's get back. We simply daren't wander about
by ourselves in these old tunnels. They run for miles, Sooty said, and cross
one another, and go up and down and round about - even right down to the marsh.
We should never, never find our way out if we got lost.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
turned to go back. They came to the end of the steps they had been climbing,
and found themselves at the bottom of the window-seat hole. It was quite easy
to pull themselves up by the niches in the sides of the hole.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
they were all in the room again, glad to see the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>sunshine
streaming in at the window. They looked out. The marshes were beginning to be
wreathed in mist once more, though up here the hill was golden with sunlight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tm
going to put the screws back into the window-seat again,' said Julian, picking
up the screwdriver, and shutting down the lid. Then if Block comes here he
won't guess we've found this new secret place. I'm pretty certain that he
unscrewed the seat so that Mr. Barling could get into this room, and then
screwed it down again so that no one would guess what had happened.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
quickly put in the screws. Then he looked at his watch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Almost
dinner-time, and I'm jolly hungry. I wish old Sooty was here - and Uncle
Quentin. I do hope they're all right - and Timmy too,' said Julian. 'I wonder
if Block is still in bed - or wandering about the tunnels. I'm going to have a
peep again.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
soon came back, puzzled. 'Yes, he's there all right, safe in bed. It's jolly
funny.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Block
did not appear at lunch time. Sarah said he had asked not to be disturbed, if
he did not appear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'He
does get the most awful sick headaches,' she said. 'Maybe he'll be all right
this afternoon.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
badly wanted to talk about everything, but the children had decided not to tell
her anything. She was very nice and they liked her, but somehow they didn't
trust anyone at Smuggler's Top. So Sarah got nothing out of them at all, and
retired in rather a huff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
went down to speak to Mr. Lenoir after the meal. He felt that even if the
Inspector of police was not at the police-station, somebody else must be
informed. He was very worried about his uncle and Sooty. He couldn't help
wondering if Mr. Lenoir had made up the bit about the Inspector being away, to
put off time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Lenoir was looking cross when Julian knocked at his study-door. 'Oh, it's you!'
he said to Julian. 'I was expecting Block. I've rung and rung for him. The bell
rings in his room and I can't imagine why he doesn't come. I want him to come
to the police-station with me.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Good!'
thought Julian. Then he spoke aloud. 'I'll go and hurry him up for you, Mr.
Lenoir. I know where his room is.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
ran up the stairs and went to the little landing up which the back-stairs went
to the staff bedrooms. He pushed open Block's door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Block
was apparently still asleep in bed! Julian called loudly, then remembered that
Block was deaf. So he went over to the bed and put his hand rather roughly on
the hump of the shoulder between the clothes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it was curiously soft! Julian drew his hand away, and looked down sharply. Then
he got a real shock.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no Block in the bed! There was a big ball of some sort, painted black to
look like a head almost under the sheets - and, when Julian threw back the
covers, he saw instead of Block's body, a large lumpy bolster, cleverly moulded
to look like a curved body!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'That's
the trick Block plays when he wants to slip off anywhere, and yet pretend he's
still here!' said Julian. 'So it was Block we saw in the tunnel this morning -
and it must have been Block that George saw talking to Mr. Barling yesterday, when
she looked through the window. He's not deaf, either. He's a very clever - sly
- double-faced - deceitful ROGUE!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Nineteen MR. BARLING TALKS.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>MEANTIME,
what was happening to Uncle Quentin and Sooty? Many strange things!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin had been gagged, and drugged so that he could neither struggle nor make
any noise, when Mr. Barling had crept so unexpectedly into his room. It was
easy to drop him down the hole in the window-seat. He fell with a thud that
bruised him considerably.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
poor Sooty had been dropped down too, and after them had come Mr. Barling,
climbing deftly down by the help of the niches in the sides.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Someone
else was down there, to help Mr. Barling. Not Block, who had been left to screw
down the window-seat so that no one might guess where the victims had been
taken, but a hard-faced servant belonging to Mr. Barling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Had
to bring this boy, too - it's Lenoir's son,' said Mr. Barling. 'Snooping about
in the room. Well, it will serve Lenoir right for working against me!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two were half-carried, half-dragged down the long flight of steps and taken
into the tunnels below. Mr. Barling stopped and took a ball of string from his
pocket. He tossed it to his servant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Here
you are. Tie the end to that nail over there, and let the string unravel as we
go. I know the way quite well, but Block doesn't, and he'll be coming along to
bring food to our couple of prisoners tomorrow. Don't want him to lose his way!
We can tie the string up again just before we get to the place I'm taking them
to, so that they won't see it and use it to escape by.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
servant tied the string to the nail that Mr. Barling pointed out, and then as
he went along he let the ball unravel. The string would then serve as a guide
to anyone not knowing the way. Otherwise it would be very dangerous to wander
about in the underground tunnels. For some of them ran for miles.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
about eight minutes the little company came to a kind of rounded cave, set in
the side of a big, but rather low tunnel. Here had been put a bench with some
rugs, a box to serve as a table, and jug of water. Nothing else.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
by now was coming round from his blow on the head. The other prisoner, however,
still lay unconscious, breathing heavily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No
good talking to him' said Mr. Barling. 'He won't be all right till tomorrow.
We'll come and talk to him then. I'll bring Block.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
had been put on the floor. He suddenly sat up, and put his hand to his aching
head. He couldn't imagine where he was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
looked up and saw Mr. Barling, and then suddenly he remembered everything. But
how had he got here, in this dark cave?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Mr.
Barling!' he said. 'What's all this? What did you hit me for? Why have you
brought me here?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Punishment
for a small boy who can't keep his nose out of things that don't concern him!'
said Mr. Barling, in a horrid sarcastic voice. 'You'll be company for our
friend on the bench there. He'll sleep till the morning, I'm afraid. You can
tell him all about it, then, and say I'll be back to have a little
heart-to-heart talk with him! And see here, Pierre - you do know, don't you,
the foolishness of trying to wander about these old passages? I've brought you
to a little-known one, and if you want to lose yourself<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and
never be heard of again, well, try wandering about, that's all!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
looked pale. He did know the danger of wandering about those lost old tunnels.
This one he was in he was sure he didn't know at all. He was about to ask a few
more questions when Mr. Barling turned quickly on his heel and went off with
his servant. They took the lantern with them and left the boy in darkness. He
yelled after them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Hie,
you beasts! Leave me a light!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
there was no answer. Sooty heard the footfalls going farther and farther away,
and then there was silence and darkness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy felt in his pocket for his torch, but it wasn't there. He had dropped it in
his bedroom. He groped his way over to the bench, and felt about for George's
father. He wished he would wake up. It was so horrid to be there in the
darkness. It was cold, too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
crept under the rugs and cuddled close to the unconscious man. He longed with
all his heart for him to wake up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>From
somewhere there sounded the drip-drip-drip of water. After a time Sooty
couldn't bear it. He knew it was only drops dripping off the roof of the tunnel
in a damp place, but he felt he couldn't bear it. Drip-drip-drip.
Drip-drip-drip. If only it would stop!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I'll
have to wake George's father up!' thought the boy, desperately. 'I must talk to
someone!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
began to shake the sleeping man, wondering what to call him, for he did not
know his surname. He couldn't call him 'George's father!' Then he remembered
that the others called him Uncle Quentin, and he began yelling the name in the
drugged man's ear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Uncle
Quentin! Uncle Quentin! Wake up! Do wake up! Oh, won't you please wake up!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin stirred at last. He opened his eyes in the darkness, and listened to
the urgent voice in his ear feeling faintly puzzled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Uncle
Quentin! Wake up and speak to me. I'm scared!' said the voice. 'UNCLE QUENTIN!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
man thought vaguely that it must be Julian or Dick. He put his arm round Sooty
and dragged him close to him. 'It's all right. Go to sleep,' he said. 'What's
the matter, Julian? Or is it Dick? Go to sleep.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
fell asleep again himself, for he was still half-drugged. But Sooty felt
comforted now. He shut his eyes, feeling certain that he couldn't possibly go
to sleep. But he did, almost at once! He slept soundly all through the night,
and was only awakened by Uncle Quentin moving on the bench.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
puzzled man was amazed to find his bed so un-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>expectedly
hard. He was even more amazed to find someone in bed with him, for he
remembered nothing at all. He stretched out his hand to switch on the
reading-lamp which had been beside his bed the night before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it wasn't there! Strange! He felt about and touched Sooty's face. Who was this
beside him? He began to feel extremely puzzled. He felt ill, too. What could
have happened?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Are
you awake?' said Sooty's voice. 'Oh, Uncle Quen-tin, I'm so glad you're awake.
I hope you don't mind me calling you that, but I don't know your surname. I
only know you are George's father and Julian's uncle.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
- who are you?' said Uncle Quentin, in wonder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
began to tell him everything. Uncle Quentin listened in the utmost amazement.
'But why have we been kidnapped like this?' he said, astonished and angry. 'I
never heard of such a thing in my life!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
don't know why Mr. Barling has kidnapped you -but I know he took me because I
happened to see what he was doing,' said Sooty. 'Anyway, he's coming back this
morning, with Block, and he said he would have a heart-to-heart talk with you.
We'll have to wait here, I'm afraid. We can't possibly find our way to safety
in the darkness, through this maze of tunnels.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
they waited - and in due course Mr. Barling did come, bringing Block with him.
Block carried some food, which was very welcome to the prisoners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
beast, Block!' said Sooty, at once, as he saw the servant in the light of the
lantern. 'How dare you help in this? You wait till my stepfather hears about
it! Unless he's in it too!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Hold
your tongue!' said Block.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
stared at him. 'So you can hear!' he said. 'All this time you've been
pretending you can't! What a sly fellow you are! What a lot of secrets you must
have learnt, pretending to be deaf, and overhearing all kinds of things not
meant for you. You're sly, Block, and you're worse things than that!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Whip
him, Block, if you like,' said Mr. Barling, sitting down on the box. 'I've no
time for rude boys myself.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
will,' said Block, grimly, and he undid a length of rope from round his waist.
I've often wanted to, cheeky little worm!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
felt alarmed. He leapt off the bench and put up his fists.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Let
me talk to our prisoner first,' said Mr. Barling. 'Then you can give Pierre the
hiding he deserves. It will be nice for him to wait for it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin was listening quietly to all this. He looked at Mr. Barling, and spoke
sternly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
owe me an explanation for your strange behaviour. I demand to be taken to
Smuggler's Top. You shall answer to the police for this!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
no, I shan't,' said Mr. Barling, in a curiously soft voice. 'I have a very
generous proposal to make to you. I know why you have come to Smuggler's Top. I
know why you and Mr. Lenoir are so interested in each other's experiments.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'How
do you know?' said Uncle Quentin. 'Spying, I suppose!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes
- I bet Block's been spying and reading letters!' cried Sooty, indignantly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Barling took no notice of the interruption. 'Now, my dear sir,' he said to
Uncle Quentin, 'I will tell you very shortly what I propose. I know you have
heard that I am a smuggler. I am. I make a lot of money from it. It is easy to
run a smuggling trade here, because no one can patrol the marshes, or stop men
using the secret path that only<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
and a few others know. On favourable nights I send out a signal - or rather
Block here does so, for me, using the convenient tower of Smuggler's Top...'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh!
So it was Block!' cried Sooty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Then
the goods arrive,' said Mr. Barling 'and again at a favourable moment I - er -
dispose of them. I cover my tracks very carefully, so that no one can possibly
accuse me because they never have any real proof.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Why
are you telling me all this?' said Uncle Quentin scornfully. 'It's of no
interest to me. I'm only interested in a plan for draining the marshes, not in
smuggling goods across them!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Exactly,
my dear fellow!' said Mr. Barling, amiably. 'I know that. I have even seen your
plans and read about your experiments and Mr. Lenoir's. But the draining of the
marsh means the end of my own business! Once the marsh is drained, once houses
are built there, and roads made, once the mists have gone, my business goes
too! A harbour may be built out there, at the edge of the marsh - my ships can
no longer creep in unseen, bringing valuable cargoes! Not only will my money
go, but all the excitement, which is more than life to me, will go too!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You're
mad!' said Uncle Quentin, in disgust.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Barling was a little mad. He had always felt a great satisfaction in being a
successful smuggler in days when smuggling was almost at an end. He loved the
thrill of knowing that his little ships were creeping in the mist towards the
treacherous marshes. He liked to know that men were making their way over a
small and narrow path over the misty marsh to the appointed meeting-place,
bringing smuggled goods.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
should have lived a hundred years or more ago!' said Sooty, also feeling that
Mr. Barling was a little mad. 'You don't belong to nowadays.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Barling turned on Sooty, his eyes gleaming dangerously in the light of the
lantern.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Another
word from you and I'll drop you in the marshes!' he said. Sooty felt a shiver
go down his back. He suddenly knew that Mr. Barling really did mean what he
said. He was a dangerous man. Uncle Quentin sensed it too. He looked at Mr.
Barling warily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'How
do I come into this?' he asked. 'Why have you kidnapped me?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
know that Mr. Lenoir is going to buy your plans from you,' said Mr. Barling. 'I
know he is going to drain the marsh by using your very excellent ideas. You
see, I know all about them! I know, too, that Mr. Lenoir hopes to make a lot of
money by selling the land once it is drained. It is all his, that misty marsh -
and no use to anyone now, except to me! But that marsh is not going to be
drained - I am going to buy your plans, not Mr. Lenoir!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Do
you want to drain the marsh, then?' said Uncle Quentin, in surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Barling laughed scornfully. 'No! Your plans, and the results of your
experiments, will be burnt! They will be mine, but I shall not want to use
them. I want the marsh left as it is, secret, covered with mist, and
treacherous to all but me and my men. So, my dear sir, you will please name
your price to me, instead of to Mr. Lenoir, and sign this document, which I
have had prepared, making over all your plans to me!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
flourished a large piece of paper in front of Uncle Quentin. Sooty watched
breathlessly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin picked up the paper. He tore it into small pieces. He threw them into
Mr. Barling's face and said, scornfully: 'I don't deal with madmen, nor with
rogues, Mr. Barling!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Twenty TIMMY TO THE RESCUE.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>MR.
BARLING went very pale. Sooty gave a loud crow of delight. 'Hurrah! Good for
you, Uncle Quentin!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Block
gave a loud exclamation, and darted to the excited boy. He took him by the
shoulder, and raised the rope to thrash him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'That's
right,' said Mr. Barling, in a funny kind of hissing voice^ 'Deal with him
first, Block, and then with this -this - stubborn - obstinate - fool! We'll
soon bring them to their senses. A good thrashing now and again, a few days
here in the dark, without any food - ah, that will make them more biddable!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
yelled at the top of his voice. Uncle Quentin leapt to his feet. The rope came
down and Sooty yelled again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
there suddenly came the pattering of quick feet, and something flung itself on
Block. Block gave a scream of pain and turned. He knocked the lantern over by
accident, and the light went out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a sound of fierce growling. Block staggered about trying to keep off the
creature that had fastened itself on to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Barling!
Help me!' he shouted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Barling went to his aid, but was attacked in his turn. Uncle Quentin and Sooty
listened in amazement and fear. What creature was this that had suddenly
arrived? Would it attack them next? Was it a giant-rat - or some fierce wild
animal that haunted these tunnels?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
fierce animal suddenly barked. Sooty gave a squeal of joy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>TIMMY!
It's you, Timmy! Oh, good dog, good dog! Go for him, then, go for him! Bite
him, Jimmy, bite hard.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two frightened men could do nothing against the angry dog. Soon they were
running down the tunnel as fast as they could go, feeling for the string for
fear of being lost. Timmy chased them with much enjoyment, and then returned to
Sooty and George's father, rather pleased with himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
had a tremendous welcome. George's father made a great fuss of him, and Sooty
put his arms round the big dog's neck.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'How
did you come here? Did you find your way out of the secret passage you've been
in? Are you half-starved? Look, here's some food.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
ate heartily. He had managed to devour a few rats, but otherwise had had no
food at all. He had licked the drops that here and there he had found dripping
from the roof, so he had not been thirsty. But he had certainly been extremely
puzzled and worried. He had never before been so long away from his beloved
mistress!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Uncle
Quentin - Timmy could take us safely back to Smuggler's Top, couldn't he?' said
Sooty, suddenly. He spoke to Timmy. 'Can you take us home, old boy? Home, to
George?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
listened, with his ears cocked up. He ran down the passage a little way, but
soon came back. He did not like the idea of going down there. He felt that
enemies were waiting for them all. Mr. Barling and Block were not likely to
give in quite so easily!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timmy knew other ways about the tunnels that honeycombed the hillside. He knew,
for instance, the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>way
down to the marsh! So he set off in the darkness, with Uncle Quentin's hand on
his collar, and Sooty following close behind, holding on to Uncle Quentin's
coat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
wasn't easy or pleasant. Uncle Quentin wondered at times if Timmy really did
know where he was going. They went down and down, stumbling over uneven places,
sometimes knocking their heads against an unexpectedly low piece of roof. It
was not a pleasant journey for Uncle Quentin, for he had no shoes on his feet,
and was dressed only in pyjamas and rugs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
a long time they came out on the edge of the marsh itself, at the bottom of the
hill! It was a desolate place, and the mists were over it, so that neither
Sooty nor Uncle Quentin knew which way to turn!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Never
mind,' said Sooty, 'we can easily leave it to Timmy. He knows the way all
right. He'll take us back to the town, and once there we'll know the way home
ourselves!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
suddenly, to their surprise and dismay, Timmy stopped dead, pricked up his
ears, whined and would go no farther. He looked thoroughly miserable and
unhappy. What could be the matter?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then,
with a bark, the big dog left the two by themselves, and galloped back into the
tunnel they had just left. He disappeared completely!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Timmy!'
yelled Sooty. 'Timmy! Come here! Don't leave us! TIMMY!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timmy was gone; why, neither Sooty nor Uncle Quentin knew. They stared at one
another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
- I suppose we'd better try to make our way over this marshy bit,' said Uncle
Quentin, doubtfully, putting a foot out to see if the ground was hard. It
wasn't! He drew back his foot at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
mists were so thick that it was really impossible to see anything. Behind them
was the opening to the tunnel. A steep rocky cliff rose up above it. There was
no path that way, it was certain. Somehow they had to make their way round the foot
of the hill to the main-road that entered the town - but the way lay over
marshy ground!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Let's
sit down and wait for a bit to see if Timmy comes back,' said Sooty. So they
sat down on a rock at the entrance to the tunnel and waited.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sooty
began to think of the others. He wondered what they had thought when they had
discovered that both he and Uncle Quentin were missing. How astonished they
must have been!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
wonder what the others are doing?' he said, aloud. Tdlove to know!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others, as we know, had been doing plenty. They had found the opening in the
window-seat where Mr. Barling had taken the captives, and they had gone down it
and actually seen Mr. Barling and Block on their way to talk to Uncle Quentin
and Sooty!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had found out, too, that Block hadn't been in his bed - he had left a dummy
there instead. Now everyone was talking at once, and Mr. Lenoir was suddenly
convinced that Block had been a spy, put in his house by Mr. Barling, and not
the good servant he had appeared!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Once
Julian felt that he was convinced of this he spoke to him more freely, and told
him of the way through the window-seat, and of how they had seen Mr. Barling
and Block that very day, in the underground tunnels!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Good
heavens!' said Mr. Lenoir, now looking thoroughly alarmed. 'Barling must be
mad! I've always thought he was a bit queer - but he must be absolutely mad to
kidnap people like this - and Block must be, too. This is a plot! They've heard
what I've been planning with your uncle - and they've made up their minds to<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>stop
it because it will interfere with their smuggling. Goodness knows what-they'll
do now! This is serious!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'If
only we had Timmy!' suddenly said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Lenoir looked astonished.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Who's
Timmy?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
you might as well know everything now,' said Julian, and he told Mr. Lenoir
about Timmy, and how they had hidden him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Very
foolish of you,' said Mr. Lenoir, shortly, looking displeased. 'If you'd told
me I would have had someone in the town look after him. I can't help not liking
dogs. I detest them, and never will have them in the house. But I would
willingly have arranged for him to be boarded out, if I'd known you'd brought
him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children felt sorry and a little ashamed. Mr. Lenoir was a queer, hot-tempered
person, but he didn't seem nearly as horrid as they had thought he was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I'd
like to go and see if I can find Timmy,' said George. 'You'll get the police in
now, I suppose, Mr. Lenoir, and perhaps we could go and find Timmy? We know the
way into the secret passage from your study.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
- so that's why you were hiding there in the afternoon yesterday,' said Mr.
Lenoir. 'I thought you were a very bad boy. Well, go and try and find him if
you like, but don't let him come anywhere near me. I really cannot bear dogs in
the house.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went to telephone the police-station again. Mrs. Lenoir, her eyes red with
crying, stood by him. George slipped away to the study, followed by Dick and
Julian and Anne. Marybelle stayed beside her mother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Come
on - let's get into that secret passage and try and find old Timmy,' said
George. 'If we all go, and whistle and shout and call, he's sure to hear us!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
found the way into the passage, by doing the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>things
they had done before. The panel slid back, and then another, larger opening
came as before. They all squeezed through it, and found themselves in the very
narrow passage that led from the study up to Sooty's bedroom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timmy was not there! The children were surprised, but George soon thought why.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Do
you remember Sooty telling us there was a way into this passage from the
dining-room, as well as from the study and Sooty's bedroom? Well, I believe I
saw a door or something there, as we passed where the dining-room must be, and
it's likely Timmy may have pushed through it, and gone into another passage
somewhere.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went back, one by one. They came to the dining-room - or rather, they walked
behind the dining-room wall. There they saw the door that George had noticed as
they passed - a door, small and set quite flat to the wall, so that it was
difficult to see. George pushed it. It opened easily, and then flapped shut,
with a little click. It could be opened from one side but not from the other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'That's
where Timmy's gone!' said George, and she pushed the door open again. 'He
pushed against the door and it opened - he went through, and the door fastened
itself so that he couldn't get back. Come on, we must find him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went through the small door. It was so low that they had to bend their
heads to go through, even Anne. They found themselves in a passage rather like
the one they had just left, but not quite so narrow. It suddenly began to go
downwards. Julian called back to the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
believe it goes down to the passages where we used to take Timmy when we let
him down into that pit to go for a walk! Yes, look - we've come to where the
pit itself is!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went on, calling Timmy, and whistling loudly, but no Timmy came. George began
to feel worried.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Hallo!
- surely this is where we came out when we climbed down all those steps from
the window-seat passage!' said Dick, suddenly. 'Yes, it is. Look, there's the
tunnel where we saw Block and Mr. Barling going!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
- do you think they've done something to Timmy?* said George, in a frightened
voice. 'I never thought of that!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
felt alarmed. It was strange that Block and Mr. Barling could go about
unmolested by Timmy if Timmy was somewhere near! Could they have harmed him in
any way? They had no idea that Timmy was at that very minute with George's
father and Sooty!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Look
at this!' said Julian, suddenly, and he shone his torch on to something to show
the others. 'String! String going right down this tunnel. Why?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
the tunnel that Mr. Barling and Block took!' said George. 'I believe it leads
to where they've taken my father and Sooty! They're keeping them prisoners down
here! I'm going to follow the string and find them! Who's coming with me?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Twenty-one A JOURNEY THROUGH THE HILL.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I'm
coming!' said everyone at once. As if they would let George go alone!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
down the dark tunnel they went, feeling the string and following it. Julian ran
it through his fingers, and the others followed behind, holding hands. It would
not do for anyone to get lost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
about ten minutes they came to the rounded cave where Sooty and George's father
had been the night before. They were not there now, of course - they were on
their way down to the marsh!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Hallo,
look! This is where they must have been!' cried Julian, shining his torch
round. 'A bench - with tumbled rugs - and an over-turned lamp. And look here,
scraps of paper torn into bits! Something's been happening here!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Quick-witted
George pieced it together in her mind. 'Mr. Barling took them here and left
them. Then he came back with some sort of proposal to Father, who refused it!
There must have beeen a struggle of some sort and the lamp got broken. Oh - I
do hope Father and Sooty got away all right.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
felt gloomy. CI hope to goodness they haven't gone wandering about these awful
tunnels. Even Sooty doesn't know a quarter of them. I wish I knew what's
happened.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Someone's
coming!' suddenly said Dick. 'Snap out the light, Ju.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
snapped off the torch he carried. At once they<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>were
all four in darkness. They crouched at the back of the cave, listening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yes
- footsteps were coming. Rather cautious footsteps. 'Sounds like two or three
people,' whispered Dick. They came nearer. Whoever was coming was plainly
following the tunnel where the string was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Mr.
Barling perhaps - and Block,' whispered George. 'Come to have another talk with
Father! But he's gone!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
brilliant light flashed suddenly round the cave -and picked out the huddled
children. There was a loud exclamation of astonishment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Good
heavens! Who's here? What's all this?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was Mr. Barling's voice. Julian stood up, blinking in the bright light.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'We
came to took for my uncle and Sooty,' he said. 'Where are they?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Aren't
they here?' said Mr. Barling, seeming surprised. 'And is that horrible brute of
a dog gone?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
- was Timmy here?' cried George, joyfully. 'Where is he?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
were two other men with Mr. Barling. One was Block. The other was his servant.
Mr. Barling put down the lantern he was carrying.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Do
you mean to say you don't know where the others are?' he said, uneasily. 'If
they've gone off on their own, they'll never come back.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
gave a little scream. 'It's all your fault, you horrid man!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Shut
up, Anne!' said Julian. 'Mr. Barling,' he said, turning to the angry smuggler,
'I think you'd better come back with us and explain things. Mr. Lenoir is now
talking to the police.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
is he?' said Mr. Barling. 'Then I think it would be as well for us all to stay
down here for a while! Yes,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>you
too! I'll make Mr. Lenoir squirm! I'll hold you all prisoners - and this time
you shall be bound so that you don't go wandering off like the others! Got some
rope, Block?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Block
stepped forward with the other man. They caught hold of George first, very
roughly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
screamed loudly. 'Timmy! Timmy! Where are you? Timmy, come and help! Oh, TIMMY!'
&gt;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
no Timmy came. She was soon in a corner with her hands tied behind her. Then
they turned to Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You're
mad' Julian said to Mr. Barling, who was standing nearby, holding the lantern.
'You must be mad to do things like this.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Timmy!'
shouted George, trying to free her hands. 'Timmy, Timmy, Timmy!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
didn't hear. He was too far away. But the dog suddenly felt uneasy. He was with
George's father and Sooty at the edge of the marsh, about to lead them round
the hill to safety. But he stopped and listened. He could hear nothing of
course. But Timmy knew that George was in danger. He knew that his beloved
little mistress needed him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
ears did not tell him, nor did his nose. But his heart told him. George was in
danger!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
turned and fled back into the tunnel. He tore up the winding passages at top
speed, panting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And,
quite suddenly, just as Julian was angrily submitting to having his hands tied
tightly together, a furry thunderbolt arrived! It was Timmy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
smelt his enemy, Mr. Barling, again! He smelt Block. Grrrrrrrr-rrrnr!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Here's
that awful dog again!' yelled Block, and leapt away from Julian. 'Where's your
gun, Barling?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timmy didn't worry about guns. He leapt at Mr. Barling and got him on the
floor. He gave him a nip in the shoulder that made him yell. Then he leapt at
Block, and got him down, too. The other man fled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Call
your dog off; call him off, or he'll kill us!' cried Mr. Barling, struggling
up, his shoulder paining him terribly. But nobody said a word. Let Timmy do what
he liked!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
wasn't long before all three of the men had gone into the dark tunnel,
staggering about without a light, trying to find their way back. But they
missed the string, and went wandering away in the darkness, groaning and
terrified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
came running back very pleased with himself. He went to George and, whining
with joy, he licked his little mistress from head to foot. And George, who
never cried, was most astonished to find the tears pouring down her cheeks.
'But I'm glad, not sad!' she said. 'Oh, somebody undo my hands! I can't pat
Timmy!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
undid her hands and Julian's. Then they all had a marvellous time making a fuss
of Timmy. And what a fuss he made of them too! He whined and barked, he rolled
over and over, he licked them and butted them all with his head. He was wild
with delight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh
Timmy - it's lovely to have you again,' said George, happily. 'Now you can lead
us to the others. I'm sure you know where Father is, Timmy, and Sooty.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
did, of course. He set off, his tail wagging, George's hand on his collar, and
the others behind in a line, holding hands.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had the lantern with them and two torches, so they could see the way easily.
But they would never have taken the right tunnels if Timmy hadn't been with
them. The dog had explored them all thoroughly, and his sense of smell enabled
him to go the right way without mistake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'He's
a marvellous dog,' said Anne. 'I think he's the best dog in the world, George.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Of
course he is,' said George, who had always thought that ever since she had had
Timmy as a puppy. 'Darling Tim - wasn't it wonderful when he came racing up and
jumped at Block just as he was tying Julian's hands? He must have known we
needed him!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
suppose he's taking us to wherever your father and Sooty are,' said Dick. 'He
seems certain of the way. We're going steadily downhill. I bet we'll be at the
marshes soon!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
they at last came to the bottom of the hill, and emerged from the tunnel in the
mists, George gave a yell. 'Look! There's Father - and Sooty too!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Uncle
Quentin!' shouted Julian, Dick and Anne. 'Sooty! Hallo, here we are!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin and Sooty turned in the greatest surprise. They jumped up and went to
meet the dog and the excited children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'How
did you get here?' said George's father, giving her a hug. 'Did Timmy go back
for you? He suddenly deserted us and fled back into the tunnel.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What's
happened?' asked Sooty, eagerly, knowing that the others would have plenty of
news.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Heaps,'
said George, her face glowing. It was so nice all to be together again, Timmy
too. She and Julian and Dick began to tell everything in turn, and then her
father told his tale, too, interrupted a little by Sooty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,'
said Julian at last, 'I suppose we ought to be getting back, or the police will
be sending out bloodhounds to trace us all! Mr. Lenoir will be surprised to see
us all turning up together.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
wish I wasn't in pyjamas,' said his uncle, drawing the rugs about him. 'I shall
feel queer walking the streets like this!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Never
mind - it's awfully misty now,' said George, and she shivered a little, for the
air was damp. 'Timmy - show us the way out of this place. I'm sure you know
it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
had never been out of the tunnel before, but he seemed to know what to do. He
set off round the foot of the hill, the rest following, marvelling at the way
Timmy found a dry path to follow. In the mist it was almost impossible to see
which place was safe to walk on and which was not. The treacherous marsh was
all around them!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Hurrah!
There's the road!' cried Julian, suddenly, as they came in sight of the roadway
built over the marsh, running up the hill from the salty stretches of mud. They
picked their way to it, their feet soaked with wet mud. Timmy tried to take a
flying leap on to it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
somehow or other he slipped! He fell back into the marsh, tried to find a safe
foothold and couldn't. He whined.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Timmy!
Oh look, he's in the mud - and he's sinking!' screamed George, in panic.
'Timmy, Timmy, I'm coming!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
was about to step down into the marsh to rescue Tim, but her fatter pulled her
back roughly. 'Do you want to sink in, too?' he cried. 'Timmy will get out all
right.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
he wasn't getting out. He was sinking. 'Do something, oh, do something!'
shouted George, struggling to get away from her father's hold. 'Oh, save Timmy,
quick!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Twenty-two THINGS COME RIGHT AT LAST.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>BUT
what could anyone do? In despair they all gazed at poor Timmy, who was
struggling with all his might in the sinking mud. 'He's going down!' wept Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly
there came the sound of rumbling wheels along the road to the hill. It was a
lorry carrying a load of goods - coal, coke, planks, logs, sacks of various
things. George yelled to it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Stop,
stop! Help us! Our dog's in the marsh.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
lorry came to a stop. George's father ran his eye over the things it carried.
In a trice he and Julian were dragging out some planks from the load. They
threw these into the marsh, and, using them as stepping-stones, the two reached
poor sinking Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
lorry-driver jumped down to help. Into the marsh, crosswise on the other
planks, went some more wood, to make a safe path. The first lot were already
sinking jn the mud.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Uncle
Quentin's got Timmy - he's pulling him up! He's got him!' squealed Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
had sat down suddenly at the edge of the road, looking white. She saw that
Timmy would now be rescued, and she felt sick with shock and relief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was a difficult business getting Timmy right out, for the mud was strong, and
sucked him down as hard as it could. But at last he was out, and he staggered
across the sinking planks, trying to wag a very muddy tail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Muddy
as he was George flung her arms round him. 'Oh Timmy - what a fright you gave
us all! Oh, how<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>you
smell - but I don't care a bit! I thought you were gone, poor, poor Timmy!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
lorry-driver looked ruefully at his planks in the marsh. They were now out of
sight beneath the mud. Uncle Quentin, feeling rather foolish in pyjamas and
rugs, spoke to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I've
no money on me now, but if you'll call at Smuggler's Top sometime I'll pay you
well for your lost planks and your help.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
I'm delivering some coal to the house next to Smuggler's Top,' said the man,
eyeing Uncle Quentin's curious attire. 'Maybe you'd all like a lift? There's
plenty of room at the back there.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was getting dark now, as well as being foggy, and everyone was tired.
Thankfully they climbed up into the lorry, and it roared up the hill into
Castaway. Soon they were at Smuggler's Top, and they all clambered down,
suddenly feeling rather stiff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I'll
be calling tomorrow,' said the driver. 'Can't stop now. Good evening to you
all!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
little company rang the bell. Sarah came hurrying to the door. She almost fell
over in surprise as she saw everyone standing there in the light of the
hall-lamp.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Lands'
sakes!' she said. 'You're all back! My, Mr. And Mrs. Lenoir will be glad -
they've got the police hunting everywhere for you! They've gone down secret
passages, and they've been to Mr. Barling's, and...'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
bounced into the hall, the mud now drying on him, so that he looked most
peculiar. Sarah gave a scream. 'What's that? Gracious, it can't be a dog!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Come
here, Tim!' said George, suddenly remembering that Mr. Lenoir detested dogs.
'Sarah, do you think you'd have poor Timmy in the kitchen with you? I really<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>can't
turn him out into the streets - you've no idea how brave he's been.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Come
along, come along!' said her father, impatient with all this talk. 'Lenoir can
put up with Timmy for a few minutes, surely!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
I'll have him with pleasure!' said Sarah. 'I'll give him a bath. That's what he
wants. Mr. and Mrs. Lenoir are in the sitting-room, sir. Oh, sir, shall I get
you some clothes?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
little party went in, and made their way to the sitting-room, while Timmy went
docilely to the kitchen with the excited Sarah. Mr. Lenoir heard the talking
and flung open the sitting-room door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Lenoir fell on Sooty, tears pouring down her cheeks. Marybelle pawed at him in
delight, just as if she was a dog! Mr. Lenoir rubbed his hands, clapped everyone
on the back, and said: 'Well, well! Fine to see you all safe and sound. Well,
well! What a tale you've got to tell, I'm sure!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
a strange tale, Lenoir,' said George's father. 'Very strange. But I'll have to
see to my feet before I tell it. I've walked miles in my bare feet, and they're
very painful now!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So,
with bits of tales pouring out from everyone, the household bustled round and
got hot water for bathing Uncle Quentin's feet, a dressing-gown for him, food
for everyone, and hot drinks. It was really a most exciting time, and now that
the thrills were all over, the children rather felt important to be able to
relate so much.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
the police came in, of course, and the Inspector at once asked a lot of
questions. Everyone wanted to answer them, but the Inspector said that only
George's father, Sooty and George were to tell the tale. They knew most about
everything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Lenoir was perhaps the most surprised person there. When he heard how Mr.
Barling had actually offered to buy the plans for draining the marsh, and how
he had frankly admitted to being a smuggler, he sat back in his chair, unable
to say a word.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'He's
mad, of course!' said the Inspector of Police. 'Doesn't seem to live in this
world at all!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'That's
just what I said to him,' said Sooty. 'I told him he ought to have lived a
hundred years ago!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
we've tried to catch him in the smuggling business many and many a time,' said
the Inspector, 'but he was too artful. Fancy him planting Block here as a spy,
sir - that was a clever bit of work - and Block using your tower as a
signalling place! Bit of nerve, that! And Block isn't deaf, after all? That was
clever, too - sending him about, pretending he was stone-deaf, so that he could
catch many a bit of knowledge not meant for his ears!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Do
you think we ought to do something about Block and Mr. Barling and the other
man?' said Julian, suddenly. 'For all we know they're still wandering about in
that maze of tunnels - and two of them are bitten by Timmy, we know.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Ah
yes - that dog saved your lives, I should think,' said the Inspector. 'A bit of
luck, that. Sorry you don't like dogs, Mr. Lenoir, but I'm sure you'll admit it
was a lucky thing for you all that he was wandering about!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Yes
- yes, it was,' said Mr. Lenoir. 'Of course, Block never wanted dogs here,
either - he was afraid they might bark at his curious comings and goings, I
suppose. By the way - where is this marvellous dog? I don't mind seeing him for
a moment - though I do detest dogs, and always shall.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I'll
get him,' said George. 'I only hope Sarah's done what she said, and bathed him.
He was awfully muddy!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
went out and came back with Timmy. But what a different Timmy! Sarah had given
him a good hot bath, and had dried him well. He smelt sweet and fresh, his coat
was springy and clean, and he had had a good meal. He was feeling very pleased
with himself and everything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Timmy
- meet a friend,' said George to him, solemnly. Timmy looked at Mr. Lenoir out
of his big brown eyes. He trotted straight up to him, and held up his right paw
politely to shake hands, as George had taught him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Lenoir was rather taken aback. He was not used to good manners in dogs. He
couldn't help putting out his hand to Timmy - and the two shook hands in a most
friendly manner. Timmy didn't attempt to lick Mr.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Lenoir
or jump up at him. He took away his paw, gave a little wuff as if to say
'How-do-you-do?' and then went back to George. He lay down quietly beside her.
'Well -he doesn't seem like a dog!' said Mr. Lenoir, in surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
he is,' said George, at once, very earnestly. 'He's a real, proper dog, Mr.
Lenoir - only much, much cleverer than most dogs are. Could I keep him, please,
while we stay here, and get someone in the town to look after him?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
- seeing he is such a very fine fellow - and seems so sensible - I'll let you
have him here,' said Mr. Lenoir, making a great effort to be generous. 'Only -
please keep him out of my way. I'm sure a sensible boy like you will see to
that.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
grinned when Mr. Lenoir called George a boy. He never seemed to realize she was
a girl. She grinned, too. She wasn't going to tell him she wasn't a boy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You'll
never see him!' she said, joyfully. 'I'll keep him right out of your way. Thank
you very much. It's awfully good of you.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Inspector liked Timmy, too. He looked at him and nodded across to George. 'When
you want to get' rid of him, sell him to me!' he said. 'We could do with a dog
like that in our police force! Soon round up the smugglers for us!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
didn't even bother to reply! As if she would ever sell Timmy, or let him go
into the police force!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
the same, the Inspector had to call on Timmy for help before long. When the
next day came, and no one had found Mr. Barling and his companions in the maze
of tunnels, and they hadn't turned up anywhere, the Inspector asked George if
she would let Timmy go down into the tunnels and hunt them out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Can't
leave them there, lost and starving,' he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Bad
as they are we'll have to rescue them! Timmy is the only one who can find
them.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
was true, of course. So Timmy once more went underground into the hill, and
hunted for his enemies. He found them after a while, lost in the maze of
passages, hungry and thirsty, in pain and frightened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
took them like sheep to where the police waited for them. And after that Mr.
Barling and his friends disappeared from public life for quite a long time!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'The
police must be glad to have got them at last,' said Mr. Lenoir. 'They have
tried to stop this smuggling for a long time. They even suspected me at one
time! Barling was a clever fellow, though I still think he was half mad. When
Block found out my ideas about draining the marsh, Barling was afraid that once
the mists and the marsh were gone, that would be the end of all his excitements
- no more smuggling! No more waiting for his little ships to come creeping up
in the fog - no more lines of men slipping across the secret ways of the marsh
- no more signalling, no more hiding away of smuggled goods, Did you know that
the police had found a cave full of them inside the hill?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was an exciting adventure to talk about, now that it was all over. The children
felt sorry about one thing, though - they were sorry that they had thought Mr.
Lenoir so horrid. He was a queer man in many ways, but he could be kind and
jolly too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Did
you know we're leaving Smuggler's Top?' said Sooty. 'Mother was so terribly
upset when I disappeared, that Father promised her he'd sell the place and
leave Castaway, if I came back safe and sound. Mother's thrilled!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'So
am I,' said Marybelle. 'I don't like Smuggler's Top - it's so queer and secret
and lonely!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
if it will make you all happy to leave it, I'm glad,' said Julian. 'But I like
it! I think it's a lovely place, set on a hill-top like this, with mists at its
foot, and secret ways all about it. I'll be sorry never to come here again, if
you leave.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'So
will I,' said Dick, and Anne and George nodded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It's
an adventurous place!' said George, patting Timmy. 'Isn't it, Timmy? Do you
like it, Timmy? Have you enjoyed your adventure here?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Woof!'
said Timmy, and thumped his tail on the floor. Of course he had enjoyed
himself. He always did, so long as George was anywhere about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well
- now perhaps we'll have a nice peaceful time!' said Marybelle. 'I don't want
any more adventures.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Ah,
