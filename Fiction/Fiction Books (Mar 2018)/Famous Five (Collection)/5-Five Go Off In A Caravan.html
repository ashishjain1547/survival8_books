Georgina's home for holidays, at Kirrin — but this time, for a change, they
were all at the home of Julian, Dick and Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

came next. <st1:place w:st="on">Georgina</st1:place> looked more like a curly-headed
boy than a girl, and she insisted on being called George. Even the teachers at

she was really growing taller now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

half-term, and Mother said Father was just beginning one of his experiments in
something or other — and you know what that means. If we go there we'd have to
walk about on tiptoe, and talk in whispers, and keep out of his way the whole
time.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a father,' said Dick, lying down on his back and shutting his eyes. 'Well, your
mother couldn't cope with us and with your father, too, in the middle of one of
his experiments at the same time. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Sparks</st1:place></st1:City>

then,' said Julian, yawning. 'Not these hols, anyhow. You can always go and see
Mother for a week or so, George, when you want to. What shall we do, then? Stay
here all the time?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'You know, I think if we were allowed to go
off by ourselves somewhere, it would be rather fun,' said George, biting a
blade of grass and squinting up into the deep blue sky. The biggest fun we've
ever had was when we were alone on <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Kirrin</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Island</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, for instance.
Couldn't we go off somewhere all by ourselves?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'But where?' said Dick. 'And how? I mean we
aren't old enough to take a car — though I bet I could drive one. It wouldn't
be much fun going on bicycles, because Anne can't ride as fast as we can.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the field,' said Dick. 'He is ours. He used to draw the pony-cart, but we don't
use it any more now he's turned out to grass.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>There was a silence, and everyone thought
lazily about holidays. Timmy snapped at a fly, and his teeth came together with
a loud click.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'All right, all right,' said Julian. 'Think
of a better idea, then.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'I'd like to go somewhere where we could
bathe,' said Anne. 'In a lake, for instance, if we can't go to the sea.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Sounds nice,' said Dick. 'My goodness, I'm
sleepy. Let's hurry up and settle this matter, or I shall be snoring hard.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>But it wasn't easy to settle. Nobody wanted
to go off to an hotel, or to rooms. Grown-ups would want to go with them and
look after them. And nobody wanted to go walking or cycling in the hot August
weather.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Looks as if we'll have to stay at home all
the hols, then,' said Julian. 'Well — I'm going to have a snooze.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>In two minutes they were all asleep on the
grass except Timmy. If his family fell asleep like this, Timmy considered
himself on guard. The big dog gave his mistress George a soft lick and sat up
firmly beside her, his ears cocked, and his eyes bright. He panted hard, but
nobody heard him. They were all snoozing deliciously in the sun, getting
browner and browner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The garden sloped up a hillside. From where
he sat Timmy could see quite a long way, both up and down the road that ran by
the house. It was a wide road, but not a very busy one, for it was a country
district.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Timmy heard a dog barking in the distance,
and his ears twitched in that direction. He heard people walking down the road
and his ears twitched again. He missed nothing, not even the robin that flew
down to get a caterpillar on a bush not far off. He growled softly in his
throat at the robin — just to tell it that he was on guard, so beware.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then
something came down the wide road, something that made Timmy shake with
excitement, and sniff at the strange smells that came floating up to the
garden. A big procession came winding up the road, with a rumble and clatter of
wheels — a slow procession, headed by a very strange thing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Timmy had no idea what it was that headed
the procession. Actually it was a big elephant, and Timmy smelt its smell,
strange and strong, and didn't like it. He smelt the scent of the monkeys in
their travelling cage, too, and he heard the barking of the performing dogs in

bad-tempered, the children thought, and he scowled so fiercely as he chewed on

and shining, a great wagon carrying benches and forms and tents, caravans for
the circus folk to live in, and a host of interesting people to see, sitting on

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Oh, I like adventures,' said George,
shaking the reins and making Trotter do a little trot. 'I wouldn't a bit mind
having another one. But we shan't this time, Anne. No such luck!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>They stopped for a meal at half-past twelve,
all of them feeling very hungry. Dobby and Trotter moved towards a ditch in
which long, juicy grass grew, and munched away happily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The children lay on a sunny bank and ate and
drank. Anne looked at George. 'You've got more freckles these hols, George,
than you ever had in your life before.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'That doesn't worry me!' said George, who
never cared in the least how she looked, and was even angry with her hair for
being too curly, and making her look too much like a girl. 'Pass the
sandwiches, Anne — the tomato ones — golly, if we always feel as hungry as this
we'll have to buy eggs and bacon and butter and milk at every farm we pass!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>They set off again. Dick took his turn at
driving Dobby, and Julian walked to stretch his legs. George still wanted to
drive, but Anne felt too sleepy to sit beside her with safety.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'If I shut my eyes and sleep I shall fall
off the seat,' she said. 'I'd better go into the caravan and sleep there.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>So in she went, all by herself. It was cool
and dim inside the caravan, for the curtains had been pulled across the window
to keep the inside cool. Anne climbed on to one of the bunks and lay down. She
shut her eyes. The caravan rumbled slowly on, and the little girl fell asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

Julian's heels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The two caravans covered quite a good
distance that day, even though they went slowly. Julian did not miss the way
once. He was very good indeed at map-reading. Anne was disappointed that they
could not see the hills they were making for, at the end of the day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Goodness, they're miles and miles away!'
said Julian. 'We shan't arrive for at least four or five days, silly! Now, look
out for a farm, kids. There should be one near here, where we can ask
permission to camp for the night.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'There's one, surely,' said George, after a
few minutes. She pointed to where a red-roofed building with moss-covered
barns, stood glowing in the evening sun. Hens clucked about it, and a dog or
two watched them from a gateway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Yes, that's the one,' said Julian,
examining his map. 'Longman's Farm. There should be a stream near it. There it
is, look — in that field. Now, if we could get permission to camp just here, it
would be lovely.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Julian went to the farm to see the farmer,
and Anne went with him to ask for eggs. The farmer was not there, but the
farmer's wife, who liked the look of the tall, well-spoken Julian very much,
gave them permission at once to spend the night in the field by the stream.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'I know you won't leave a lot of litter, or
go chasing the farm animals,' she said. 'Or leave the gates open like some
ill-bred campers do. And what's that you want, Missy — some new-laid eggs. Yes,
of course, you can have some — and you can pick the ripe plums off that tree,
too, to go with your supper!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>There was bacon in the larder of the
caravans, and Anne said she would fry that and an egg each for everyone. She
was very proud of being able to cook them. She had taken a few lessons from
Cook in the last few days, and was very anxious to show the others what she had
learnt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Julian said it was too hot to cook in the
caravan, and he built her a fine fire in the field. Dick set the two horses
free and they wandered off to the stream, where they stood knee-high in the
cool water, enjoying it immensely. Trotter nuzzled against Dobby, and then
tried to nuzzle down to Timmy, too, when the big dog came to drink beside him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Doesn't the bacon smell lovely?' called
Anne to George, who was busy getting plates and mugs out of the red caravan.
'Let's have ginger-beer to drink, George. I'm jolly thirsty. Watch me crack
these eggs on the edge of this cup, everybody, so that I can get out the yolk
and white and fry them.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Crack! The egg broke against the edge of the
cup — but its contents unfortunately fell outside the cup instead of inside.
Anne went red when everyone roared with laughter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Timmy came and licked up the mess. He was
very useful for that sort of thing. 'You'd make a good dust-bin, Timmy,' said
Anne. 'Here's a bit of bacon-rind, too. Catch!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Anne fried the bacon and eggs really well.
The others were most admiring, even George, and they all cleared their plates
well, wiping the last bit of fat off with bread, so that they would be easy to
wash.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Do you think Timmy would like me to fry him
a few dog-biscuits, instead of having them cold?' said Anne, suddenly. 'Fried
things are so nice. I'm sure Timmy would like fried biscuits better than
ordinary ones.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

Pass the plums, Dick. They look super.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

washing in the stream. They all undressed, and got into the inviting bunks. There
was a sheet, one blanket and a rug — but all the children threw off both
blanket and rug and kept only a sheet over them that hot night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

bunk, beneath George — but Timmy would keep on trying to clamber up to get to
George. He wanted to lie on her feet as usual. Anne got cross.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

Timmy made no more noise, but lay contentedly at the end of George's bunk on
the rolled-up blanket, while Anne lay in the bunk above, trying not to go to
sleep because it was such a lovely feeling to be inside a caravan that stood by
a stream in a field.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Owls hooted to one another, and Timmy
growled softly. The voice of the stream, contented and babbling, could be quite
clearly heard now that everything was so quiet. Anne felt her eyes closing. Oh
dear — she would simply have to go to sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>But something suddenly awoke her with a
jump, and Timmy barked so loudly that both Anne and George almost fell out of
their bunks in fright. Something bumped violently against the caravan, and
shook it from end to end! Was somebody trying to get in?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Timmy leapt to the floor and ran to the
door, which George had left open a little because of the heat. Then the voices
of Dick and Julian were heard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'What's up? Are you girls all right? We're
coming!' And over the wet grass raced the two boys in their dressing-gowns.
Julian ran straight into something hard and warm and solid. He yelled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Dick switched on his torch and began to
laugh helplessly. 'You ran straight into Dobby. Look at him staring at you! He
must have lumbered all round our caravans making the bumps we heard. It's all
right, girls. It's only Dobby.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

set free at night they made for the stream together, and stood in the water
side by side, nuzzling one another happily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ever had,' said Anne, busily cooking something in a pan. 'It's exciting without
being adventurous. And although Julian thinks he's in charge of us, I am

kept clean if it wasn't for me!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

'I'm just telling the truth. Why, you've never even made your own bunk once,
George. Not that I mind doing it. I love having two houses on wheels to look
after.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

off the camp-fire and put the contents on to four plates. 'Come along!' she

Anne had given up looking for the hills where they hoped to find the circus
folk camping. In fact she secretly hoped they wouldn't find them, because she
was so much enjoying the daily wanderings over the lovely countryside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Julian, who now rather prided himself on picking excellent camping-sites.

map. The two girls came back with the clean crockery, and Anne put it neatly
back on the shelves in the red caravan. Trotter came to look for Timmy, who was

get under the caravan too. But he couldn't possibly, of course, for he was much
too big. So he lay down on the shady side, as near to Timmy as he could get.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

what will you think of all the circus animals, I wonder! I do hope we see the

day as the caravans rumbled slowly down the lanes, pulled by Trotter and Dobby.

be the Merran Hills — and Merran Lake must lie at the foot. I say, I hope the

a camping site there tonight. I'm afraid,' he said. 'We'd better camp a little

Captain! There should be a farm about two miles on, according to the book.

wide stream that ran swiftly along. Julian went as usual to ask permission to
camp, and Dick went with him, leaving the two girls to prepare a meal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

farmer's daughter, a plump jolly girl, sold the boys eggs, bacon, milk, and
butter, besides a little crock of yellow cream. She also offered them
raspberries from the garden if they liked to pick them and have them with the
cream.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lake.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Yes, it went by about a week ago,' said the
girl. 'It goes camping there every year, for a rest. I always watch the
caravans go by — quite a treat in a quiet place like this! One year they had
lions, and at nights I could hear them roaring away. That fair frizzled my
spine!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

camp tomorrow all right,' said Julian. 'I shall enjoy camping up in the hills,
won't you, Dick? It will be cooler up there, I expect — usually there's a
breeze on the hills.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

on what the children hoped would be the last lap of their journey. They would

each day to his parents, telling them where he was, and that everything was
fine. He had found out from the farm-girl the right address for that district,
and he planned to arrange with the nearest post office to take in any letters
for them that came. They had not been able to receive any post, of course, when
they were wandering about in their caravans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

dived into their caravans, stripped off jeans and blouses and pulled on
bathing-things. Then, without even a towel to dry themselves on, they tore down

but further in, where it was deep, the lake was deliciously cold. All the
children could swim strongly, and they splashed and yelled in delight. The
bottom of the lake was sandy, so the water was as clear as crystal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Julian,' said Anne, getting up. She knew perfectly well what there was in the
larder — but it made her feel grown-up and important to go and look. It was
nice to feel like that when she so often felt small and young, and the others
were big and knew so much.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

clouds across the sky for the first time. Not a star showed and there was no
moon. It was pitch-black, and Julian, looking out of the window of his caravan,
before clambering into his bunk, could not even see a shimmer of water from the
lake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>He got into his bunk and pulled the covers
up. In the other caravan George and Anne were asleep. Timmy was, as usual, on
George's feet. She had pushed him off them once or twice, but now that she was
asleep he was undisturbed, and lay heavily across her ankles, his head on his
paws.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Suddenly his ears cocked up. He raised his
head cautiously. Then he growled softly in his throat. He had heard something.
He sat there stiffly, listening. He could hear footsteps from two different
directions. Then he heard voices — cautious voices, low and muffled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Timmy growled again, more loudly. George
awoke and reached for his collar. 'What's the matter?' she whispered. Timmy
listened and so did she. They both heard the voices.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

went to the half-open door of the caravan. She could not see anything outside
at all because it was so dark. 'Don't make a noise, Tim,' she whispered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

but George could feel the hairs rising all along the back of his neck.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The voices seemed to come from not very far
away. Two men must be talking together, George thought. Then she heard a match
struck, and in its light she saw two men lighting their cigarettes from the
same match. She recognised them at once — they were Nobby's Uncle Dan and Lou
the acrobat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Okay, then — that's settled.' Then came the
sound of footsteps again, this time towards George's caravan. The men walked
straight into the side of it, exclaimed in surprise and pain, and began to feel
about to find out what they had walked into.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

angry voice. He rapped loudly on the walls of the caravan, and Anne woke up
with a jump. George, just inside the caravan with Timmy, jumped in fright, too.
Timmy barked in rage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

didn't. He pretended to, though, and growled so fiercely that they were scared
out of their wits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the farm, a rambling collection of old buildings sprawling down the hillside.
Hens ran about, clucking. Sheep grazed above the farm, and cows chewed the cud

anything — even to walk down to the lake and bathe! The children were glad they
were up in the hills, for at least there was a little breeze that fanned them
now and again. They did not expect to see Nobby again that day, but they hoped
he would come up the next day. If not they would go down and bathe in the lake
and hope to see him somewhere about there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

The children retreated to the clump of birch trees, which at least cast some
shade. They took books with them, and Timmy came along, too, panting as if he
had run for miles. He kept going off to the little spring to drink. Anne filled
a big bowl with the cold water, and stood it in a breezy place near by, with a
cup to dip into it. They were thirsty all day long, and it was pleasant to dip
a cup into the bowl of spring-water and drink.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

much exercise today, and it would do us good to walk down and have a swim. We
won't take Timmy in case we happen to come across Lou or Dan. He'd certainly
fly at them today. We can always keep an eye open for those two and avoid them
ourselves — but Timmy would go for them as soon as he spotted them. We might be

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Nobby felt very much tempted to go and have
a meal up in the hills with the children. But he was afraid of meeting Lou and
his uncle coming back from their walk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'We can easily look out for them and warn
you if we see or hear them,' said Dick, 'and you can flop under a bush and hide
till they go past. You may be sure we'll be on the look-out for them ourselves,
because we don't want to meet them either!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Well, I'll come,' said Nobby. 'I'll take
Barker and Growler too. They'll like to see Timmy.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>So all five of them, with the two dogs, set
off up the hill. They climbed up short cuts at first, but they were soon
panting, and decided to take the track, which, although longer, was easier to
follow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>They all kept a sharp look-out for the two
men, but they could see no sign of them. 'We shall be at our caravans soon,'
said Julian. Then he heard Timmy barking in the distance. 'Hallo! What's old
Tim barking for? I wonder if those fellows have been up to our caravans?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Good thing we left Timmy on guard if so,'
said Dick. 'We might have missed something if not.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Then he went red, remembering that it was
Nobby's uncle he had been talking of. Nobby might feel upset and offended to
hear someone speaking as if he thought Tiger Dan would commit a little robbery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>But Nobby wasn't at all offended. 'Don't you
worry about what you say of my uncle,' he said, cheerfully. 'He's a bad lot. I
know that. Anyway, he's not really my uncle, you know. When my father and
mother died, they left a little money for me — and it turned out that they had
asked Tiger Dan to look after me. So he took the money, called himself my
uncle, and I've had to 'be with him ever since.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Was he in the same circus, then?' asked
Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Oh yes. He and my father were both clowns,'
said Nobby. 'Always have been clowns, in my family. But wait till I'm old
enough, and I'll do a bunk — clear off and join another circus, where they'll
let me look after the horses. I'm mad on horses. But the fellow at our circus
won't often let me go near them. Jealous because I can handle them, I suppose!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The children gazed at Nobby in wonder. He
seemed an extraordinary boy to them — one who walked about with a tame
chimpanzee, exercised hordes of performing dogs, lived with the chief clown in
the circus, could turn the most marvellous cart-wheels, and whose only ambition
was to work with horses! What a boy! Dick half-envied him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Haven't you ever been to school?' he asked
Nobby.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The boy shook his head. 'Never! I can't
write. And I can only read a bit. Most circus folk are like that, so nobody
minds. Jumping Jiminy, I bet you're all clever, though! I bet even little Anne
can read a book!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'I've been able to read for years,' said
Anne. 'And I'm up to fractions now in numbers.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Coo! What's fractions?' said Nobby,
impressed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Well — quarters and halves and seven-eighths,
and things like that,' said Anne. 'But I'd rather be able to turn a cart-wheel
like you can, Nobby, than know how to do fractions.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Whatever is Timmy barking for?' said George
as they came near the clump of birch trees. Then she stopped suddenly, for she
had seen two figures lying down in the grass below the trees. Lou — and Tiger
Dan!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>It was too late for Nobby to hide. The men
saw him at once. They got up and waited for the children to come near. George
felt thankful that Timmy was within whistling distance. He would come at the
first call or whistle, she knew.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Julian looked at the men. To his surprise
they appeared to be quite amiable. A faint scowl came over Tiger Dan's face
when he caught sight of Nobby, but it passed at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Good evening,' said Julian curtly, and
would have passed on without another word, but Lou stepped up to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'We see you're camping up by here,' said
Lou, and smiled showing yellow teeth. 'Ain't you going over the hill?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'I don't need to discuss my affairs with
either you or your friend,' said Julian, sounding extremely grown-up. 'You told
us to clear out from down below, and we have. What we do now is nothing to do
with you.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Ho yes, it is,' said Tiger Dan, sounding as
if he was being polite with great difficulty. 'We come up here tonight to plan
a place for some of our animals, see? And we don't want you to be in no
danger.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'We shan't be,' said Julian, scornfully.
'And there is plenty of room on these hills for you and your animals and for
us, too. You won't scare us off, so don't think it. We shall stay here as long
as we want to — and if we want help there's the farmer and his men quite near
by — to say nothing of our dog.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Did you leave that there dog on guard?' asked
Lou, as he heard Timmy barking again. 'He ought to be destroyed, that dog of
yours. He's dangerous.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'He's only dangerous to rogues and scamps,'
said George, joining in at once. 'You keep away from our caravans when Timmy's
on guard. He'll maul you if you go near.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Lou began to lose his temper. 'Well, are you
going or ain't you?' he said. 'We've told you we want this here bit of the
hill. You can come down and camp by the lake again if you want to.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Yes — you come,' said Tiger Dan to the
children's growing astonishment. 'You come, see? You can bathe in the lake
every day, then — and Nobby here can show you round the camp, and you can make
friends with all the animals, see?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Now it was Nobby's turn to look amazed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Jumping Jiminy! Didn't you beat me black
and blue for making friends with these kids?' he demanded. 'What's the game,
now? You've never had animals up in the hills before. You've . . .'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Shut up,' said Tiger Dan in such a fierce
voice that all the children were shocked. Lou nudged Dan, and he made an effort
to appear pleasant again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'We didn't want Nobby to make friends with
posh folk like you,' he began again. 'But it seems as if you want to pal up
with him — so it's okay with us. You come on down and camp by the lake, and
Nobby'll show you everything in the circus. Can't say fairer than that.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'You've got other reasons for making all
these suggestions,' said Julian, scornfully. 'I'm sorry — but our plans are
made, and I am not going to discuss them with you.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Come on,' said Dick. 'Let's go and find
Timmy. He's barking his head off because he can hear us, and it won't be long
before he comes flying along here. Then we shall find it difficult to keep him
off these two fellows.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The four children began to move off. Nobby
looked doubtfully at his uncle. He didn't know whether to go with them or not.
Lou nudged Dan again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'You go, too, if you want to,' said Tiger
Dan, trying to grin amiably at the surprised Nobby. 'Keep your fine friends,
see! Much good may they do you!' The grin vanished into a scowl, and Nobby
skipped smartly out of reach of his uncle's hand. He was puzzled and wondered
what was behind his uncle's change of mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>He tore after the children. Timmy came to
meet them, barking his head off, waving the plumy tail wildly in joy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Good dog, good dog!' said George, patting
him. 'You keep on guard beautifully. You know I would have whistled for you if
I'd wanted you, didn't you, Timmy? Good dog!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'I'll get you some supper,' said Anne to
everyone. 'We're all famishing. We can talk while we eat. George, come and
help. Julian, can you get some ginger-beer? And, Dick, do fill up the
water-bowl for me.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The boys winked at one another. They always
thought that Anne was very funny when she took command like this, and gave her
orders. But everyone went obediently to work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Nobby went to help Anne. Together they
boiled ten eggs hard in the little saucepan. Then Anne made tomato sandwiches
with potted meat and got out the cake the farmer's wife had given them. She
remembered the raspberry syrup, too — how lovely!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Soon they were all sitting on the rocky
ledge, which was still warm, watching the sun go down into the lake. It was a
most beautiful evening, with the lake as blue as a cornflower and the sky
flecked with rosy clouds. They held their hard-boiled eggs in one hand and a
piece of bread and butter in the other, munching happily. There was a dish of
salt for everyone to dip their eggs into.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

picnics always taste so much nicer than the ones we have indoors,' said George.
'For instance, even if we had hard-boiled eggs and bread and butter indoors,
they wouldn't taste as nice as these.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

pleased. Nobby might not have their good manners, but he always seemed to say
just the right thing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

over the startled chimpanzee! The children yelled with laughter, and roared
again to see Pongo falling in fright off Old Lady's back. Splash! He went right
in and got himself wet from head to foot — a thing he hated doing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

sit on, and circus 'props' of that kind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

quietly sleeping with one ear cocked. Julian lay in bed and thought hard.
Probably Lou and Dan had come creeping up in the dark, hoping that Timmy had
taken the meat and been poisoned. But when they heard him bark, they knew he
was all right, and they must have gone away again. What plan would they make

he had come. He saw a little lane leading off up into the hills and decided to
take it. It led him not very far from Mrs Mackie's farm, so he soon knew where
he was. He went back to the caravans, and quickly made himself some sandwiches
and cut some cake to take to his hiding-place. He might have a long wait!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>A tree? No, there wasn't one that was near
enough or thick enough. Behind a bush? No, the men might easily come round it
and see him. What about the middle of a thick gorse bush? That might be a good
idea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

rope hung down over the side of the caravan, ready for him to swarm up. He
threw his packet of food up on to the roof and then climbed up himself. He
pulled up the rope and coiled it beside him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

about ten minutes and Julian began to feel uncomfortably hot. Then it went in

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>He suddenly heard somebody whistling and
stiffened himself in expectation — but it was only someone belonging to the
farm, going down the hill some distance away. The whistle had carried clearly in
the still air.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

not even a butterfly sailed by. He could see no birds except a yellow-hammer
that sat on the topmost spray of a bush and sang: '
Little-bit-of-bread-and-no-cheese', over and over again in a most maddening
manner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

eyes to the track that led up the hill. His heart began to beat. He could see
two men. Were they Lou and Dan?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

them when they came nearer in case they spotted him. But he knew their voices
when they came near enough!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

There was no mistaking those two harsh, coarse voices. The men came right into
the hollow, and Julian heard them talking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'I saw them get on the bus, dog and all, I
told you,' growled Lou. 'There'll be nobody here for the day. We can get what
we want to.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Julian waited to see where they would go to.
But they didn't go out of the hollow. They stayed there, apparently beside the
caravans. Julian did not dare to look over the edge of the roof to see what
they were up to. He was glad he had fastened all the windows and locked the
doors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

sounds, and the men panted. The caravan on which Julian was lying began to
shake a little.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

bewilderment. In intense curiosity he slid quietly to the edge of the caravan
roof and cautiously peeped over, though he had firmly made up his mind not to
do this on any account.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>He looked down on the ground. There was
nobody there at all. Perhaps the men were the other side. He slid carefully
across and peeped over the opposite side of the caravan, which was still
shaking a little, as if the men were bumping against it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>There was nobody the other side either! How
very extraordinary! 'Golly! They must be underneath the caravan!' thought
Julian, going back to the middle of the roof. 'Underneath! What in the wide
world for?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>It was quite impossible to see underneath
the caravan from where he was, so he had to lie quietly and wonder about the
men's doings. They grunted and groaned, and seemed to be scraping and
scrabbling about, but nothing happened. Then Julian heard them scrambling out from
underneath, angry and disappointed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

if he had better slide off the roof and run. He wouldn't have much chance if
the caravan went hurtling down the hill! But he didn't move. He clung to the

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>It ran a few feet to the rocky ledge, and
then stopped. Julian felt his forehead getting very damp, and he saw that his
hands were trembling. He felt ashamed of being so scared, but he couldn't help
it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

in alarm, and Julian's heart felt lighter. So they didn't mean to destroy the
caravan in that way! They had just moved it to get at something underneath. But
what could it be? Julian racked his brains to try and think what the floor of
the hollow had been like when Dobby and Trotter pulled their caravans into it.
As far as he could remember it was just an ordinary heathery hollow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

the back steps of the caravan. Julian was absolutely eaten up with curiosity,
but he did not dare even to move. He could find out the secret when the men had
gone. Meantime he really must be patient or he would spoil everything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

couldn't catch a word. Then, quite suddenly, there was complete and utter
silence. Not a word. Not a bump against the caravan. Not a pant or even a
grunt. Nothing at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

spray. It flicked its wings and looked about for crumbs. It was a robin that
came around when the children were having a meal — but it was not as tame as
most robins, and would not fly down until the children had, left the hollow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

aren't here now, or the birds and animals wouldn't be about like this. There's
another rabbit. Those men have gone somewhere — though goodness knows where. I

roof at the back end of the caravan. He looked down at the ground. There was
absolutely nothing to be seen to tell him what the men had been doing, or where
they had gone! The heather grew luxuriantly there as it did everywhere else.
There was nothing to show what the men had been making such a disturbance
about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'This is really very queer,' thought Julian,
beginning to wonder if he had been dreaming. 'The men are certainly gone —
vanished into thin air, apparently! Dare I get down and explore a bit? No, I
daren't. The men may appear at any moment, and it's quite on the cards they'll
lose their temper if they find me here, and chuck both me and the caravans down
the hill! It's pretty steep just here, too.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

very hungry and thirsty. Thank goodness he had been sensible enough to take
food up to the roof! He could at least have a meal while he was waiting for the
men to come back — if they ever did!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

very good indeed. He finished them all and began on the cake. That was good,
too. He had brought a few plums up as well, and was very glad of them because
he was thirsty. He flicked the plum stones from the roof before he thought what
he was doing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

call out, and Julian shook his head frantically to stop him, pointing downwards
to try and warn Nobby that somebody was there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

pretty exciting adventures with men just as tough as Dan and Lou,' said Dick.
'We always seem to be falling into the middle of some adventure or other. Now,

said George. 'He doesn't like it. Come on, Pongo. You'll be all right. We've
all got torches!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

that hole again. He cried like a baby when Nobby tried to make him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'What — and miss all the excitement!' cried
Nobby indignantly. 'I jolly well won't. We can tie old Pongo up to a wheel of
the van so that he won't wander off. Lou and Dan are away somewhere, and no one
else is likely to tackle a big chimp like Pongo. We'll tie him up.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>So Pongo was tied firmly to one of the
caravan wheels. 'You stay there like a good chimp till we come back,' said
Nobby, putting a pail of water beside him in case he should want a drink.
'We'll be back soon!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

would have made him go down that hole again! So he sat watching the children
disappear one by one. Timmy jumped down, too, and they were all gone. Gone on
another adventure. What would happen now?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

getting Timmy up to the cavern, but they managed it at last. Timmy put his tail

it round and about, picking out the dark, rocky corners. 'Can't see anything

their shoulders in some places, and it wound about as it went further into the
hill. Julian thought that at one time water must have run through it. But it
was quite dry now. The floor of the tunnel was worn very smooth, as if a stream
had hollowed it out through many, many years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was beginning to feel it must go on for ever. Then the wall at one side widened
out and made a big rocky shelf. Julian, who was first, flashed his torch into
the hollow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

could, each of them flashing their torch brightly. On the wide, rocky shelf lay
boxes and packages, sacks and cases. The children stared at them. 'What's in
them?' said Nobby, full of intense curiosity. 'Let's see!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

beautiful silver cup. 'Lou could climb anywhere — up ivy, up pipes — even up
the bare wall of a house, I shouldn't wonder! And jump! He can jump like a cat.
He and Tiger Dan have been in this business for a long time, I expect. That's
where Uncle Dan went at night, of course, when we were on tour, and I woke up

that wagon of his you showed us,' said Julian, remembering. 'You told us how
angry he was with you once when you went and rummaged about in it. He probably
stored it there, and then he and Lou came up here each year and hid the stuff

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The tunnel came out into another cave, not
nearly as big as the one they had left behind. At one end something gleamed

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

Can't you hear it flowing along? It's an underground stream, flowing through
the hill to find an opening where it can rush out.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

our caravan camping-place,' said George. 'It rushed out of the hill. Do you

to it and watched it. It rushed along in its own hollowed out channel, close to
the side of the cave-wall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Maybe at one time it ran across this cave
and down the tunnel we came up by,' said Julian. 'Yes, look — there's a big
kind of groove in the floor of the cave here — the stream must have run there
once. Then for some reason it went a different way.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Let's get back,' said Nobby. 'I want to
know if Pongo's all right. I don't somehow feel very comfortable about him. And
I'm jolly cold, too. Let's go back to the sunshine and have something to eat. I
don't want a picnic down here, after all.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

their way back through the tunnel. They passed the rock shelf on which lay the
treasure, and came at last to the enormous gleaming cavern. They went across it
to the hole that led down into the small cave. Down they went. Julian and
George trying to manage Timmy between them. But it was very awkward, for he was
a big dog.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

last. 'We might as well go somewhere more comfortable, and sit down and talk

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

through the hole in the roof, and into the enormous cavern. They found a sandy
corner and sat down. Julian handed Anne the kitbag and she undid it to get the
food inside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

torches. The idea of being lost in the dark inside the hill wasn't at all nice!
Anne handed out slices of bread and butter, and the children put thin slices of

were told not to drink water that wasn't boiled while we were caravanning — but
we didn't know this sort of thing was going to happen! We'll go through the
tunnel and get some water to drink from the stream.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

winding tunnel, and passed the shelf of stolen goods. Then on they went and
came out into the cave through which the stream rushed so quickly. They dipped
in their hands and drank thirstily. The water tasted lovely — so clear and
cold.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

adventure, but so long as he was with George he was happy. If his mistress

hole in the hillside, and pours out there,' said Julian, suddenly. 'If it does,
and we could follow it, we might be able to squeeze out.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

into a tunnel rather like the dry one they had come along. Julian shone his

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

is very fast but not very deep. I know — I'll go along it myself and see where
it goes, and come back and tell you.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>One by one they waded into the stream. The
current tugged at their legs, for the water ran very fast. But it was only just
above their knees there. They waded along by the light of their torches,
wondering where the tunnel would lead to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Timmy half-waded, half-swam. He didn't like
this water-business very much. It seemed silly to him. He pushed ahead of
Julian and then a little further down, jumped up to a ledge that ran beside the
water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Good idea, Tim,' said Julian, and he got up
on to it too. He had to crouch down rather as he walked because his head
touched the roof of the tunnel if he didn't — but at least his legs were out of
the icy-cold water! Ail the others did the same, and as long as the ledge ran
along beside the stream they all walked along it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>But at times it disappeared and then they
had to wade in the water again, which now suddenly got deeper. 'Gracious! It's
almost to my waist,' said Anne. 'I hope it doesn't get any deeper. I'm holding
my clothes up as high as I can, but they'll get soaked soon.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Fortunately the water got no deeper, but it
seemed to go faster. 'We're going down hill a bit,' said Julian at last.
'Perhaps we are getting near to where it pours out of the hill.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>They were! Some distance ahead of him Julian
suddenly saw a dim light, and wondered whatever it could be. He soon knew! It
was daylight creeping in through the water that poured out of the hole in the
hillside — poured out in a torrent into the sunshine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>With light hearts the children waded along
in the water. Now they would soon be out in the warm sunshine. They would find
Pongo, and race down the hill in the warmth, catch the first bus, and go to the
police station.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>But nothing like that happened at all. To
their enormous disappointment the water got far too deep to wade through, and
Nobby stopped in fright. 'I dursent go no further,' he said. 'I'm almost off my
feet now with the water rushing by.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Perhaps I can swim out,' said Julian, and
he struck out. But he gave it up in dismay, for the torrent of water was too
much for him, and he was afraid of being hurled against the rocky sides and
having his head cracked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

at all. All that wading for nothing. It's far too dangerous to go any further —
and yet daylight is only a few yards ahead. It's too sickening for words.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

painfully and slowly, for it was not so easy against the current. Julian

Pongo's neck and sending him out of the hole again, to take the letter to the
camp?' said Dick. 'He won't go to Lou or Dan because he's scared of them — but
he'd go to any of the others all right, wouldn't he? Larry would be the best
one. He seems to be a good fellow.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

him here and there sometimes, just for fun — to take the elephant's bat to

'I've got a notebook and a pencil. I'll write a note and wrap it up in another

passage that leads to the hole,' said Dick, getting up. 'It's quite likely that

way down the tunnel that led past the hidden store of valuables, and came out
into the enormous cave. There was a nice sandy corner just by the hole that led
down into the first small cave, and the children decided to sit there, rather
than in the passage or in the first rocky and uncomfortable little cave. They
cuddled up together for warmth, and felt hungry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

almost fell asleep, too. But the boys and Timmy kept awake, and talked in low
voices. At least, Timmy didn't talk, but wagged his tail whenever either Dick

nothing. But Timmy went on growling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the hole nearby, and a torch shone on them. Timmy growled ferociously and

pointing a gun at poor Timmy. She gave a scream and flung herself in front of
him. 'Don't you dare to shoot my dog! I'll — I'll — I'll . . .'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

do to the man who could shoot Timmy, and she stopped, choked by tears of rage
and fear. Timmy, not knowing what the gun was, couldn't for the life of him

too, with his head poking through a hole like that. Timmy felt he could deal
with that head very quickly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

walk towards the entrance of the tunnel. One by one they climbed into it.
George first with Timmy. She dared not let his collar go for an instant. A few
paces behind them came Lou with his revolver, and Dan with a couple of big
sacks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

may be Pongo by himself — he may not have gone back to the camp at all — he may
have wandered about and at last gone down the entrance-hole by the caravans,
and come up behind Tiger Dan. If so he won't have much chance because Lou's got
a gun and will shoot him. And we shan't be rescued. So I'm going to slip down
the tunnel while there's a chance and hide in the big cave.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Pongo appeared to have got hold of both men at once! Their torches were out,
and Lou did not dare to shoot for fear of hurting Dan. Dick could see very
little of this; he could only hear snarlings and shouting. He took a wide
course round the heaving heap on the floor and made his way as quickly as he
could in the dark to where he thought the hole was that led down into the first
passage. He had to go carefully for fear of falling down it. He found it at
last and let himself down into the cave below, and then, thinking it safe to
switch on his torch in the passage he flashed it in front of him to show him
the way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ramming them in with all his strength, and then rolled some heavy stones on
top? He couldn't move the caravan over the boards, for it was far too heavy for
a boy to push. But heavy stones would probably do the trick. The men would
imagine that it was the caravan overhead again!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

boards, lugging them into place, panting and puffing. Then he flashed his torch
round for stones. There were several small rocks nearby. He could not lift
them, but he managed to roll them to the boards. Plonk! They went on to them
one by one. Now nobody could move the boards at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

themselves from the angry chimpanzee. They were badly bitten and mauled, but
Pongo was not as strong and savage as usual because of his bad head-wound. The

the tunnel, sniffing out the children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Pongo again either. Keeping his torch carefully switched on and his revolver

their wagon down the track.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

The children were not there. Julian had taken Dick's advice and had gone off to

he said. 'I'll be proper set on by them all — about you going there and

best acrobat!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'You can 'phone from my house,' said Mrs
Mackie, so Julian thought he would. They talked as they went along and suddenly
a bright idea struck Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'I say — I suppose Farmer Mackie doesn't
want anyone to help him with his horses, does he?' he asked. 'He wouldn't want
a boy who really loves and understands them and would work hard and well?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Well, now, I dare say he would,' said Mrs
Mackie. 'He's a bit short-handed now. He was saying the other day he could do
with a good lad, just leaving school.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

from the circus camp?' said Julian. 'He's mad on horses. He can do anything
with them. And he's been used to working very hard. I'm sure he'd do well.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Before Julian had left the farmhouse after
telephoning to his amazed parents, he had had a long talk with Farmer Mackie —
and now he was running back with the good news to the caravans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

How would you like to go and work for Farmer Mackie and help with the horses?
He says you can start tomorrow if you like — and live at the farm!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

startled and disbelieving. 'At the farm? Work with the horses? Coo — I wouldn't
half like that. But Farmer Mackie wouldn't have the likes of me.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

Julian. 'We've got to start back home tomorrow, and you can be with us till
then. You don't need to go back to the camp at all.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Well — but what about Growler?' said Nobby.
'I'd have to have him with me. He's my dog. I expect poor old Barker's dead.
Would the farmer mind me having a dog?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'I shouldn't think so,' said Julian. 'Well,
you'll have to go down to the camp, I suppose, to collect your few things — and
to get Growler. Better go now, Nobby, and then you'll have the rest of the day
with us.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Nobby went off, his face shining with
delight. 'Well, I never!' he kept saying to himself. 'Well, I never did! Dan
and Lou gone, so they'll never hurt me again — and me not going to live in the
camp any more — and going to have charge of them fine farm horses. Well, I
never!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The children had said good-bye to Pongo
because he had to go back with Nobby to the camp. He belonged to Mr Gorgio, and
Nobby could not possibly keep him. Anyway, it was certain that even if he could
have kept him, Mrs Mackie wouldn't have let him live at the farm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Pongo shook hands gravely with each one of
them, even with Timmy. He seemed to know it was good-bye. The children were
really sorry to see the comical chimpanzee go. He had shared in their adventure
with them and seemed much more like a human being than an animal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>When he had gone down the hill a little way
he ran back to Anne. He put his arms round her and gave her a gentle squeeze,
as if to say: 'You're all nice, the lot of you, but little Anne's the nicest!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Oh, Pongo, you're really a dear!' said
Anne, and gave him a tomato. He ran off with it, leaping high for joy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The children cleared up everything, put the
breakfast things away, and cleaned the caravans, ready for starting off the
next day. At dinner-time they looked out for Nobby. Surely he should be back
soon?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>They heard him whistling as he came up the track.
He carried a bundle on his back. Round his feet ran two dogs. Two!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

George in delight. 'He must have got better! How simply marvellous!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Nobby came up, grinning. They all crowded
round him, asking about Barker.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Yes, it's fine, isn't it?' said Nobby,
putting down his bundle of belongings. 'Lucilla dosed him all right. He almost
died — then he started to wriggle a bit, she said, and the next she knew he was
as lively as could be — bit weak on his legs at first — but he's fine this
morning.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Certainly there didn't seem anything wrong
with Barker. He and Growler sniffed round Timmy, their tails wagging fast.
Timmy stood towering above them, but his tail wagged, too, so Barker and
Growler knew he was friendly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'I was lucky,' said Nobby. 'I only spoke to
Lucilla and Larry. Mr Gorgio has gone off to answer some questions at the
police station, and so have some of the others. So I just told Larry to tell Mr
Gorgio I was leaving, and I got my things and hopped it.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Well, now we can really enjoy our last
day,' said Julian. 'Everybody's happy!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>And they did enjoy that last day. They went
down to the lake and bathed. They had a fine farmhouse tea at Mrs Mackie's, by
special invitation. They had a picnic supper on the rocky ledge, with the three
dogs rolling over and over in play. Nobby felt sad to think he would so soon
say good-bye to his 'posh' friends — but he couldn't help feeling proud and
pleased to have a fine job of his own on the farm — with the horses he loved so
much.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Nobby, Barker, Growler, Farmer Mackie and
his wife all stood on the cart-track to wave good-bye to the two caravans the
next morning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
