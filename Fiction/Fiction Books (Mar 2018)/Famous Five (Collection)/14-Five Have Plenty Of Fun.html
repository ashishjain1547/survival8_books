One<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>AT
KIRRIN COTTAGE<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
feel as if we’ve been at Kirrin for about a month already!’ said Anne,
stretching herself out on the warm sand, and digging her toes in. ‘And we’ve
only just come!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- it’s funny how we settle down at Kirrin so quickly,’ said Dick. ‘We only came
yesterday, and I agree with you, Anne - it seems as if we’ve been here ages. I
love Kirrin.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hope this weather lasts out the three weeks we’ve got left of the holiday,’
said Julian, rolling away from Timmy, who was pawing at him, trying to make him
play. ‘Go away, Timmy. You’re too energetic. We’ve bathed, had a run, played
ball - and that’s quite enough for a little while. Go and play with the crabs!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof!’
said Timmy, disgusted. Then he pricked up his ears as he heard a tinkling noise
from the promenade. He barked again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Trust
old Timmy to hear the ice-cream man,’ said Dick. ‘Anyone want an ice-cream?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
did, so Anne collected the money and went off to get the ice-creams, Timmy
close at her heels. She came back with five cartons of ice-cream, Timmy jumping
up at her all the way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can’t think of anything nicer than lying down on hot sand with the sun on every
part of my body, eating an ice-cream, and knowing there are still three weeks’
holiday in front of us - at Kirrin too!’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
It’s heaven,’ said Anne. ‘It’s a pity your father has visitors today, George.
Who are they? Have we got to dress up for them?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t think so,’ said George. ‘Timmy, you’ve eaten your ice-cream in one gulp.
What a frightful waste!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘When
are these people coming?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘About
half past twelve,’ said George. ‘They’re coming to lunch - but thank goodness
Father told Mother he didn’t want a pack of children gobbling all round him and
his friends at lunch, so Mother said we could go in at half past twelve, say
how-do-you-do and then clear off again with a picnic basket.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
must say I think your father has some good ideas at times,’ said Dick. ‘I
suppose they are some scientist friends of his?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
Father’s working on some great scheme with these two men,’ said George. ‘One of
them’s a genius, apparently, and has hit on an idea that’s too wonderful for
words.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
kind of modern idea is it?’ said Julian, lazily, holding out his finger-tips
for Timmy to lick off smears of ice-cream. ‘Some space-ship to take us on
day-trips to the moon - or some new bomb to set off - or...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
I think it’s something that will give us heat, light and power for almost
nothing!’ said George. ‘I heard Father say that it’s the simplest and best idea
anyone had ever worked out, and he’s awfully excited about it. He called it a
“gift to mankind” and said he was proud to have anything to do with it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Uncle
quentin is very clever, isn’t he?’ said Anne. George’s father was the uncle of
Julian, Dick and Anne, and they were cousins to George - short for Georgina.
Once more they had all come down to Kirrin for part of their holiday, the last
three weeks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George’s
father was certainly clever. All the same, George sometimes wished that he was
a more ordinary parent, one who would play cricket or tennis with children, and
not be so horrified at shouting and laughter and silly jokes. He always made a
fuss when George’s mother insisted that George should have her cousins to stay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Noisy,
rowdy, yelling kids!’ he said. ‘I shall lock myself in my study and stay
there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right, dear,’ said his wife. ‘You do that. But you know perfectly well that
they will be out practically all day long. George must have other children to
stay sometimes, and her three cousins are the nicest ones I know. George loves
having them here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four cousins were very careful not to upset George’s father. He had a very hot
temper and shouted at the top of his voice when he was angry. Still, as Julian
said, he really couldn’t help being a genius, and geniuses weren’t ordinary
people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Especially
scientific geniuses who might easily blow up the whole world in a fit of
temper,’ said Julian, solemnly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I wish he wouldn’t keep blowing me up if I let a door bang, or set Timmy
barking,’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
only to keep his hand in,’ said Dick. ‘Just a bit of practice at blowing up!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
be an ass,’ said George. ‘Does anyone feel like another bathe?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
But I don’t mind going and lying in the very edge of the sea, and letting the
waves there just curl over me,’ said Dick. ‘I’m absolutely baked lying here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
sounds lovely,’ said Anne. ‘But the hotter you are the colder the water feels.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on!’ said Dick, getting up. ‘I shall hang my tongue out and pant like Timmy
soon.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went down to the edge of the water and lay down flat in the tiny curling
waves there. Anne gave a little shriek.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
feels icy! I knew it would. I can’t lie down in it yet - I can only sit up!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>However
they were soon all lying full-length in the shallow waves at the edge of the
sea, sliding down the sand a little every now and again as the tide ebbed
farther from them. It was lovely to feel the cool fingers of the sea on every
part of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly
Timmy barked. He was not in the water with them, but was just at the edge. He
thought that lying down in the sea was quite unnecessary! George raised her
head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
the matter?’ she said. ‘There’s nobody coming.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Dick had heard something too. He sat up hurriedly. ‘Gosh, I believe that’s
someone ringing a bell for us. It sounds like the bell from Kirrin Cottage!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
it can’t be dinner-time yet!’ said Anne in dismay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
must be,’ said Julian, leaping up. ‘Blow! This is what comes of leaving my
watch in my blazer pocket! I ought to have remembered that time at Kirrin goes
more quickly than anywhere else!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
ran up the beach to his blazer and took his wristwatch from the pocket. ‘It’s
one o’clock!’ he yelled. ‘In fact, it’s a minute past. Buck up, we’ll be
awfully late!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Blow!’
said George. ‘Mother won’t be at all pleased with us, because those two
scientist people will be there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
collected their blazers and tore up the beach. It was not very far to Kirrin
Cottage, fortunately, and they were soon running in at the front gate. There
was a very large car outside, one of the latest American models. But there was
no time to examine it!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
trailed in quietly at the garden door. George’s mother met them, looking rather
cross.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sorry,
Aunt Fanny,’ said Julian. ‘Please forgive us. It was my fault entirely. I’m the
only one with a watch.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Are
we awfully late?’ asked Anne. ‘Have you begun lunch yet? Would you like us just
to take our picnic basket and slip off without interrupting?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said her aunt. ‘Fortunately your uncle is still shut up in his study with his
friends. I’ve sounded the gong once but I don’t expect they’ve even heard it! I
rang the bell for you because I thought that any moment they might come out,
and your uncle would be cross if you weren’t there just to say how-do-you-do!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
Father’s friends don’t usually want to see us,’ said George, surprised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
one of them has a girl a bit younger than you, George - younger than Anne too,
I think,’ said her mother. ‘And he specially asked to see you all, because his
daughter is going to your school next term.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’d
better buck up and have a bit of a wash then,’ said Julian - but at that very
moment the study door opened, and his Uncle Quentin came out with two men.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>‘Hallo - are these your kids?’ said one of the
men, stopping.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’ve
just come in from the beach,’ said Aunt Fanny hurriedly. ‘I’m afraid they are
not really fit to be seen. I...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Great
snakes!’ said the man, ‘don’t you dare to apologise for kids like these! I
never saw such a fine lot in my life - they’re wunnerful!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
spoke with an American accent, and beamed all over his face. The children
warmed to him at once. He turned to George’s father. ‘These all yours?’ he
asked. ‘I bet you’re proud of them! How did they get that tan - they look like
Red Indians! My, my - wish my Berta looked like that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’re
not all mine,’ said Uncle Quentin, looking quite horrified at the thought.
‘Only this one is mine,’ and he put his hand on George’s shoulder. ‘The others
are nephews and a niece.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I must say you’ve got a fine boy,’ said the American, ruffling George’s short
curls. As a rule she hated people who did that, but because he mistook her for
a boy, she grinned happily!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘My
girl’s going to your school,’ he said to Anne. ‘Give her a bit of help, will
you? She’ll be scared stiff at first.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course I will,’ said Anne, taking a liking to the huge loud-voiced American. He
didn’t look a bit like a scientist. The other man did, though. He was
round-shouldered and wore owl-like glasses, and, as Uncle Quentin often did, he
stared into the distance as if he was not hearing a single word that anyone
said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin thought this gossiping had lasted long enough. He waved the children
away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
and have lunch,’ he said to the other men. The second man followed him at once,
but the big American stayed behind. He thrust his hands into his pocket and
brought out a pound note. He gave it to Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Spend
that on yourselves,’ he said. ‘And be kind to my Berta, won’t you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
disappeared into the dining-room and shut the door with a loud bang. ‘Goodness
- what will Father say to a bang like that!’ said George, with a sudden giggle.
‘I like him, don’t you? That must be his car outside. I can’t imagine the other
man even riding a bicycle, let alone driving a car!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Children
- take your picnic basket and go!’ said Aunt Fanny, urgently. ‘I must run and
see that everything is all right!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
thrust a big basket into Julian’s hands, and disappeared into the dining-room.
Julian grinned as he felt the weight of the basket.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
along,’ he said. ‘This feels good! Back to the beach, everyone!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Two<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
VISITOR IN THE NIGHT<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Five were on the beach in two minutes, and Julian undid the basket. It was full
of neatly packed sandwiches, and packets of biscuits and chocolate. A bag
contained ripe plums, and there were two bottles of lemonade.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Home-made!’
said Dick, taking it out. And icy-cold. And what’s this? A fruit cake - a whole
fruit cake - we’re in luck.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, approvingly, and sniffled inside the basket.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wrapped
in brown paper were some biscuits and a bone, together with a small pot of
paste. George undid the packet. ‘I packed these for you, Timmy,’ she said. ‘Say
thank you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
licked her so lavishly that she cried out for mercy. ‘Pass me the towel, Ju!’
she said. ‘Timmy’s made my face all wet. Get away now, Timmy - you’ve thanked
me quite enough! Get away, I said. How can I spread paste on your biscuits if
you stick your nose into the pot all the time?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
spoil Timmy dreadfully,’ said Anne. ‘All right, all right - you needn’t scowl
at me, George! I agree that he’s worth spoiling. Take your bone a bit farther
away from me, Tim - it’s smelly!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were soon eating sardine sandwiches with tomatoes, and egg-and-lettuce
sandwiches after that. Then they started on the fruit cake and the lemonade.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can’t think why people ever have table-meals when they can have picnics,’ said
Dick. ‘Think of Uncle and Aunt and those two men tucking into a hot meal indoors
on a day like this. Phew!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
liked that big American,’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Aha!
We all know why,’ said Dick, annoyingly. ‘He thought you were a boy. Will you
ever grow out of that, George?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy’s
trying to get at the cake!’ said Anne. ‘Quick, George, stop him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all lay back on the sand after their picnic, and Julian began a long story of
some trick that he and Dick had played on their form-master at school. He was
most annoyed because nobody laughed at the funny part, and sat up to see why.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
asleep!’ he said, in disgust. Then he cocked his head just as Timmy pricked up
his ears. A loud roaring noise came to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Just
the American revving up his car, do you think, Tim?’ said Julian. The boy stood
up and saw the great car tearing down the sea road.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
day was too hot to do anything but laze. The Five were quite content to do that
on their first day together again. Soon they would want to plan all kinds of
things, but the first day at Kirrin was a day for picking up old threads,
teasing Timmy, getting into the ‘feel’ of things again, as Dick said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
and Julian had been abroad for four weeks, and Anne had been away to camp and
had had a school friend to stay with her at home afterwards. George had been
alone at Kirrin so it was wonderful to all the Five to meet together once more
for three whole summer weeks. At Kirrin too, Kirrin by the sea, with its lovely
beach, its fine boating - and its exciting little island across Kirrin Bay!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
usual the first day or two passed in a kind of dream, and then the children
began to plan exciting things to do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
go to Kirrin Island again,’ said Dick. ‘We’ve not been there for ages.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
go fishing in Lobster Cove,’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
go and explore some of the caves in the cliffs,’ said George. ‘I meant to do
that these hols, but somehow it’s no fun going alone.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
the third day, just as they were finishing making their beds, the telephone
bell rang.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
go!’ yelled Julian to his aunt, and went to answer it. An urgent voice spoke at
the other end.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who’s
that? Oh, you, Julian - you’re Quentin’s nephew, aren’t you? Listen, tell your
uncle I’m coming over tonight - yes, tonight. Latish, say. Tell him to wait up
for me. It’s important.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But,
won’t you speak to him yourself?’ said Julian, surprised. ‘I’ll fetch him, if
you’ll...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the line had gone dead. Julian was puzzled. The man hadn’t even given his name
- but Julian had recognised the voice. It was the big, cheery American who had
come to see his uncle two days before! What had happened? What was all the
excitement about?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went to find his uncle but he was not in his study. So he found his aunt
instead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Aunt
Fanny,’ he said, ‘I think that was the big American on the phone - the one who
came to lunch the other day. He said I was to tell Uncle Quentin that he was
coming here tonight - late, he said - and that Uncle was to wait up for him,
because it was important.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dear
me!’ said his aunt, startled. ‘Is he going to stay the night then? We’ve no
bedroom free now you and the others are here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
didn’t say, Aunt Fanny,’ said Julian. ‘I’m awfully sorry not to be able to tell
you any details - but just as I was saying I’d fetch Uncle Quentin, he rang off
- in the very middle of what I was saying.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
mysterious!’ said his aunt. ‘And how annoying. How can I put him up, if he
wants to stay? I suppose he’ll come roaring down at midnight in that enormous
car of his. I only hope nothing’s gone wrong with this latest work your uncle
is doing. I know it’s tremendously important.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Perhaps
Uncle will know the American’s telephone number and he can ring him up to find
out a bit more,’ said Julian, helpfully. ‘Where is Uncle?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
gone down to the post-office, I think,’ said his aunt. ‘I’ll tell him when he
gets back.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
told the others about the mysterious phone call. Dick was pleased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
didn’t have a chance of getting a good look at that enormous car the other
day,’ he said. ‘I think I’ll keep awake tonight till the American comes and
then nip down and have a look at it. I bet it’s got more gadgets on the
dashboard than any car I’ve ever seen!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin appeared to be as surprised as anyone else at the phone call, and was
inclined to blame Julian for not finding out more details.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
he want now?’ he demanded, almost as if Julian ought to know! ‘I fixed
everything up with him the other day. Everything! Each of us three has his own
part to do. Mine’s the least important, as it happens - and his is the most
important. He took all the papers away with him; he can’t have left any behind.
Coming down in the middle of the night like this - quite extraordinary!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>None
of the children except Dick meant to stay awake and listen for the American’s
coming. Dick put on his bed-light and took up a book to read. He knew he would
fall asleep and not wake up for any noise, if he didn’t somehow keep himself
wide awake!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
listened as he read, his ear alert to hear the coming of any car. Eleven
o’clock came - then midnight struck. He listened to the twelve dongs from the
big grandfather clock in the hall. Goodness - Uncle Quentin wouldn’t be at all
pleased that his visitor was so late!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
yawned, and turned over his page. He read on and on. Half past twelve. One
o’clock. Then he thought he heard a sound downstairs and opened his door. Yes -
it was Uncle Quentin in his study. Dick could hear his voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Poor
old Aunt Fanny must be up too,’ he thought. ‘I can hear their voices. Gosh, I
shall soon fall asleep over my book. I’ll slip down and out into the garden for
a breath of fresh air. I shall keep awake then.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
put on his dressing-gown and went quietly down the stairs. He undid the bolt of
the garden door and slipped out. He stood listening for a moment, wondering if
he would hear the roar of the American’s car in the stillness of the night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
all he heard was the sound of the tyres of a bicycle on the road outside. A
bicycle! Who was riding about at this time of night? Perhaps it was the village
policeman?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
stood in the shadows and watched. A man was on the bicycle. Dick could just
make him out dimly, a big black shadow in the starlit night. To the boy’s
enormous surprise, he heard the sound of the man dismounting, then the swish of
the leaves in the hedge as the bicycle was slung there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
someone came quietly up the path and went round to the window of the study. It
was the only room in the house that was lighted. Dick heard a tapping on the
window, and then it was opened cautiously. His uncle’s head appeared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who
is it?’ he said, in a low tone. ‘Is it you, Elbur?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
apparently was. Dick saw that it was the big American who had visited his uncle
two days before. ‘I’ll open the door,’ said his aunt, but Elbur was already
putting his leg across the window-sill!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
went back to bed, puzzled. How strange! Why should the American come so
secretly in the night, why should he ride a bicycle instead of driving his car?
He fell asleep still wondering.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
did not know whether the American rode away again, or whether his aunt made a
bed for him on a couch downstairs. In fact, when he awoke the next morning, he
really wondered if it had all been a dream.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
asked his aunt, when he went down to breakfast. ‘Did that man who telephoned
come last night?’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
aunt nodded her head. ‘Yes. But please say nothing about it. I don’t want
anyone to know. He’s gone now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Was
it important?’ asked Dick. ‘Julian seemed to think it was, when he answered the
phone.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- it was important,’ said Aunt Fanny. ‘But not in the way you think. Don’t ask
me anything now, Dick. And keep out of your uncle’s way. He’s rather cross this
morning.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Then
something must have gone wrong with this new work he’s doing,’ thought Dick,
and went to warn the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
sounds rather exciting,’ said Julian. ‘I wonder what’s up?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
kept out of Uncle Quentin’s way. They heard him grumbling loudly to his wife
about something, they heard him slam down his desk-lid as he always did when he
was bad-tempered, and then he settled down to his morning’s work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
came running to the others after a time, looking surprised. ‘George! I’ve just
been into our room and what do you think! Aunt Fanny’s put a camp-bed over in
the corner - a camp-bed made up with blankets and everything! It looks an awful
squash with two other beds as well in the room - mine and yours!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh
- someone else is coming to stay then - a girl,’ said Dick. ‘Or a woman. Aha! I
expect it’s a governess engaged to look after you and Anne, George, to see that
you behave like little ladies!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
be an idiot,’ said George, surprised and cross at the news. ‘I’m going to ask
Mother what it’s all about. I won’t have anyone else in our room. I just will
not!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
just as she was marching off to tell her mother this, the study door downstairs
opened and her father bellowed into the hall, calling his wife.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Fanny!
Tell the children I want them. Tell them to come to my study AT ONCE!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gracious
- he does sound cross. Whatever can we have done?’ said Anne, scared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four children and Timmy trooped down the stairs together. George’s mother was
in the hall, just going to call them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
there you are,’ she said. ‘Well, I suppose you heard that you’re wanted in the
study. I’m coming too. And listen - please don’t make any more fuss than you
can help. I’ve had quite enough fuss made by Quentin!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
was very mysterious! What had Aunt Fanny to do with whatever trouble there was?
Into the study went the Five, Timmy too, and saw Uncle Quentin standing on the
hearthrug looking as black as thunder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Quentin,
I could have told the children,’ began his wife, but he silenced her with a
scowl exactly like the one George sometimes put on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
got something to say to you,’ he began. ‘You remember those two friends of mine
- scientists working on a scheme with me - you remember the big American?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said everyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
gave us a whole pound,’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin took no notice of that remark. ‘Well,’ he said, ‘he’s got a daughter -
let’s see now - she’s got some silly name...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Berta,’
said his wife.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
interrupt me,’ said Uncle Quentin. ‘Yes, Berta. Well, Elbur, her father, has
been warned that she’s going to be kidnapped.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Whatever
for?’ said Julian, amazed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Because
it so happens that her father knows more secrets about a new scheme we’re
planning than anyone else in the world,’ said his uncle. ‘And he says, quite
frankly, that if this girl - what’s her name now...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Berta,’
said everyone, obligingly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
if this Berta is kidnapped, he will give away every single secret he knows to
get her back,’ said Uncle Quentin. ‘Pah! What’s he made of? Traitor to us all!
How can he even think of giving away secrets for the sake of a silly girl?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Quentin,
she’s his only child and he adores her,’ said Aunt Fanny. ‘I should feel the
same about George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Women
are always soft and silly,’ said her husband, in a tone of great disgust. ‘It’s
a good thing you don’t know any secrets - you’d give them away to the milkman!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
was so ridiculous that the children laughed. Uncle Quentin glared at them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
is no laughing matter. It has been a great shock to me to be told by one of the
leading scientists of the world that he feels certain he might give all our
secrets to the enemy if this - this...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Berta,’
said everyone again, at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
this Berta was kidnapped,’ went on Uncle Quentin. ‘So he came to ask if we’d
take this - this Berta into our own home for three weeks. By that time the
scheme will be finished and launched, and our secrets will be safe.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a silence. Nobody looked very pleased. In fact, George looked furious. She
burst out at last.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
that’s who the bed is for in our room! Mother, have we got to be squashed up
with nowhere to move about the room, for three whole weeks? It’s too bad.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘For
once you and I agree, George,’ said her father. ‘But I’m afraid you’ll have to
put up with it. Elbur is in such a state about this kidnapping warning that he
couldn’t be reasoned with. In fact he threatend to tear up all his figures and
diagrams and burn them, if I didn’t agree to this. That would mean we couldn’t
get on with the scheme.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
why has she got to come here?’ said George, fiercely. ‘Why put her on to us?
Hasn’t she any relations or friends she can go to?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George,
don’t be so fierce,’ said her mother. ‘Apparently Berta has no mother, and has
been everywhere with her father. They have no relations in this country - and
no friends they can trust. He won’t send her back to America because he has
been warned by the police that she might be followed there - and at the moment
he can’t leave this country himself to go with her.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
why choose us?’ said George again. ‘He doesn’t know a thing about us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,’
said her mother, with a small smile, ‘he met you all the other day, you know -
and he was apparently very struck with you - and especially with you, George,
though I can’t imagine why. He said he’d rather his Berta was with you four
than with any other family in the world.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
paused and looked at the four, a harassed expression on her face. Julian went
over to her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
you worry!’ he said. ‘We’ll look after Berta! I won’t pretend I’m pleased at
having a strange girl to join us these last three precious weeks - but I can
see her father’s point of view - he’s scared for Berta, and he’s scared he
might find himself spilling the beans if anything happened to her! It might be
the only way he could get her back.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘To
think of such a thing!’ burst out Uncle Quentin. ‘All the work of the last two
years! The man must be mad!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
Quentin, don’t think any more about it,’ said his wife. ‘I’m glad to have the
child here. I would hate George to be kidnapped, and I know exactly how he
feels. You won’t even notice she’s here. One more will make no difference.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
you say,’ grumbled her husband. ‘Anyway, it’s settled.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘When
is she coming?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Tonight.
By boat,’ said his uncle. ‘We’ll have to let Joan the cook into the secret -
but nobody else. That’s understood, isn’t it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course,’ said the four at once. Then Uncle Quentin sat down firmly at his desk,
and the children went hurriedly out of the room, Aunt Fanny behind them, and
Timmy pushing between their ankles.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
such a pity, and I’m so sorry,’ said Aunt Fanny. ‘But I do feel we can’t do
anything else.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
bet Timmy will hate her,’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
don’t you go and make things difficult, George, old thing,’ said Julian. ‘We’re
all agreed it can’t be helped, so we might as well make the best of it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hate making the best of things,’ said George, obstinately.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,’
said Dick, amiably, ‘Julian and Anne and I could go back home and take Berta
with us if you hate everything so much. I don’t particularly want to stay here
for three weeks if you’re going to put on a Hate all the time.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right, I won’t,’ said George. ‘I’m only letting off steam. You know that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
never sure, with you,’ said Dick, with a grin. ‘Well, look - let’s not spoil
this one day when we will be by ourselves!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all tried valiantly to have as good a time as possible, and went out in
George’s boat for a long row to Lobster Cove. They didn’t do any fishing there,
but bathed from the boat instead, in water as green and clear as in an open-air
bath. Timmy didn’t approve of bathing from boats. It was quite easy to jump out
of the boat into the water - but he found it extremely difficult to jump in again!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Aunt
Fanny had again packed them a wonderful lunch. ‘An extra good one to make up
for a disappointment,’ she said, smiling. Anne had given her a hug for that.
Here they had all been making such a fuss about having someone extra - and Aunt
Fanny had been the only one to feel a real kindness for a child in danger.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had enough food for tea too, and did not get home until the evening. The sea
was calm and blue, and the children could see almost to the bottom of the
water, when they leaned over the side of the boat. The sky was the colour of
harebells as they rowed into the bay and up to the beach.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Will
Berta be there yet, do you suppose?’ said George, mentioning the girl for the
first time since they had set out that morning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
shouldn’t think so,’ said Julian. ‘Your father said she would be coming tonight
- and I imagine that, as she’s coming by boat, it will be dark - so that she
won’t be seen.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
expect she’ll be feeling very scared,’ said Anne. ‘It must be horrid to be sent
away to a strange place, to strange people. I should hate it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
beached the boat and left it high and dry. Then they made their way to Kirrin
Cottage. Aunt Fanny was pleased to see them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
are in nice time for supper,’ she said. ‘Though if you ate all I gave you today
for your picnics, you’ll surely find it difficult to eat very much supper.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
I’m terribly hungry,’ said Dick. He sniffed, holding his nose up in the air
just as Timmy often did. ‘I believe you’ve been making your special tomato
soup, with real tomatoes, Aunt Fanny!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
too good at guessing,’ said his aunt with a laugh. ‘It was meant to be a
surprise! Now go and wash and make yourselves tidy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Berta
hasn’t come yet, I suppose, has she?’ asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said his aunt. ‘And we’ll have to think of another name for her, Julian. It
would never do to call her Berta now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin didn’t appear for supper. ‘He is having his in the study by himself,’
said Aunt Fanny.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a sigh of relief. Nobody had looked forward to seeing Uncle Quentin that
night. It took him quite a long time to get over any annoyance!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
sunburnt you all are!’ said Aunt Fanny, looking round the table. ‘George, your
nose is beginning to peel.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
know,’ said George. ‘I wish it didn’t. Anne’s never does. Gosh, I’m sleepy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
go to bed as soon as you’ve finished your supper,’ said her mother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’d
like to. But what about this Berta?’ said George. ‘What time is she coming? It
would be rather mean to be in bed when she arrives.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
no idea what time she will come,’ said her mother. ‘But I shall wait up, of
course. There’s no need for anyone else to. I expect she’ll be tired and
scared, so I shall give her something to eat - some of the tomato soup, if
you’ve left any! - and then pop her into bed. I expect she would be quite glad
not to have to meet any of you tonight.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- I shall go to bed,’ said Dick. ‘I heard Mr Elbur arriving last night, Aunt
Fanny, and it was pretty late, wasn’t it? I can hardly keep my eyes open
tonight.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on, then - let’s all go up,’ said Julian. ‘We can read if we can’t sleep. Good
night, Aunt Fanny. Thank you for that lovely picnic food again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
the four went upstairs, Anne and Dick yawning loudly, and setting the others
off too. Timmy padded behind them, quite glad that George was going to bed so
early.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were all asleep in ten minutes. The boys slept like logs and didn’t stir at
all. The girls fell fast asleep for about four hours - and then George was
awakened by hearing Timmy growl. She sat up at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
is it?’ she said. ‘Oh - is it Berta arriving, Tim? Let’s keep quiet and see
what she’s like!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
a minute Timmy growled again. George heard the sound of quiet footsteps on the
stairs. Then the bedroom door was slid softly open, and two people stood in the
light of the landing lamp. One was Aunt Fanny.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
other, of course, was Berta.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Four<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>BERTA<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
sat up in bed and stared at Berta. She looked very peculiar indeed. For one
thing she was so bundled up in coats and wraps that it was difficult to see if
she was fat or thin, tall or short, and for another thing she was crying so
bitterly that her face was all screwed up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
didn’t wake up. Timmy was so astonished that, like George, he simply sat and
stared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Tell
Timmy not to make a sound,’ whispered George’s mother, afraid that the dog
might bark the house down, once he began.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
laid a warning hand on Timmy. Her mother gave Berta a little push farther into
the room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She’s
been terribly seasick, poor child,’ she told George. ‘And she’s scared and
upset. I want her to get into bed as soon as possible.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
was still sobbing, but the sobs grew quieter as she began to feel less sick.
George’s mother was so kind and sensible that she felt comforted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
take these things off,’ she said to Berta. ‘My word, you are bundled up! But if
you came in an open motorboat I expect you needed them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
am I to call you?’ asked Berta, with one last sniff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’d
better call me Aunt Fanny, as the others do, I think,’ said George’s mother. ‘I
expect you know why you’ve come to stay with us for a while, don’t you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Berta. ‘I didn’t want to come. I wanted to stay with my father. I’m not
afraid of being kidnapped. I’ve got Sally to look after me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who’s
Sally, dear?’ asked Aunt Fanny, taking a coat or two off Berta.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘My
dog,’ said Berta. ‘She’s downstairs in the basket I was carrying.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
pricked up her ears at that bit of news! ‘A dog!’ she said. ‘We can’t have a
dog here. Mine would never allow that. Would you, Timmy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
gave a small wuff. He was watching this night arrival with great interest. Who
was she? He was longing to get down from George’s bed and go to sniff at her,
but George had her hand on his collar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I’ve brought my dog, and I just reckon she’ll have to stay now,’ said Berta.
‘The boat’s gone back. Anyway, I wouldn’t go anywhere without Sally. I told my
father that, and he said all right then, take her with you! So I did.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mother,
tell her how fierce Timmy is and that he would fight any other dog who came
here,’ said George, urgently. ‘I won’t have anybody else’s dog at Kirrin
Cottage.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
George’s annoyance her mother took not the slightest notice. She went on
helping Berta take off scarves and leggings and goodness knows what. George
wondered how anyone could possibly exist in all those clothes on a warm
summer’s night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
last Berta stood in a simple jersey and skirt, a slim, pretty little girl with
large blue eyes and wavy golden hair. She shook back her hair and rubbed her
face with a hanky.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thank
you,’ she said. ‘Can I get Sally my dog now?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
tonight,’ said Aunt Fanny. ‘You see, you are to sleep in that little camp-bed
over in the corner - and I can’t let you have your dog here too, because she
and Timmy might fight unless we introduce them to one another properly. And
there is no time to bother about that tonight. Do you feel hungry now? Would
you like some tomato soup and biscuits?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
please. I do feel a bit hungry,’ said Berta. ‘I’ve been so sick on that awful
bumpy boat that I don’t expect there’s anything left inside me at all!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
look - you unpack your little night-case, and have a wash in the bathroom if
you want to, and then get into your pyjamas,’ said Aunt Fanny. ‘Then hop into
bed and I’ll bring you up some soup.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
one look at the scowling George made her change her mind. Better not leave poor
Berta with an angry George on her very first night!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think perhaps I won’t get the soup myself,’ she said. ‘George, you go and get
it, will you? It’s warming up in the saucepan on the stove downstairs. You’ll
see the little soup-cup on the table, and some biscuits too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
got out of bed, still looking very mutinous. She watched Berta shake out a
nightdress from her night-case and pursed up her lips.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She
doesn’t even wear pyjamas!’ she thought. ‘What a ninny! And she’s had the sauce
to bring her own dog, too - spoilt little thing! I wonder where it is? I’ve a
good mind to have a look at it when I’m downstairs.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
her mother had an idea that George might do that and she went to the door after
her. ‘George!’ she said, warningly, ‘I don’t want you to open the dog’s basket
downstairs. I’m not having any dog-fights tonight. I shall put him in Timmy’s
kennel outside before I go to bed.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
said nothing but went on downstairs. The soup was just about to boil and she
whipped it off the stove at once. She poured it into the little soup-cup,
placed it on the saucer, and put some biscuits on the side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
heard a small whimpering sound, and turned round. It came from a fairly large
basket over in the corner. George was terribly tempted to go and undo it - but
she knew perfectly well that if the new dog ran upstairs to find its mistress,
Timmy would bark and wake everybody up! It wasn’t worth risking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
took up the soup. Berta was now in the camp-bed and looked very cosy. Anne was
still sleeping peacefully, quite undisturbed by all that was going on. Timmy
had taken the opportunity of jumping off George’s bed and had gone to examine
this newcomer. He sniffed her delicately, and Berta put out her hand and
stroked his head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
lovely eyes he’s got,’ she said. ‘But he’s a mongrel, isn’t he? A sort of
mixture-dog.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
you say anything like that to George,’ said Aunt Fanny. ‘She adores Timmy. Now
- do you feel better? I hope you’ll be happy with us, Berta, dear - I am sure
you didn’t want to come - but your father was so worried. And it will be nice
for you to get to know Anne and Georgina before you go to their school next
term.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
- was that Georgina - the one you called George?’ said Berta in surprise. ‘I
wasn’t really sure if she was a boy or not. My father told me there were three
boys here and one girl - and that’s the girl, isn’t it - in bed there?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
pointed to Anne. Aunt Fanny nodded. ‘Yes, that’s Anne. Your father thought
George was a boy, that’s why he told you there were three boys and only one
girl here, I suppose. The two boys are in the next room.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t like George very much,’ said Berta. ‘She doesn’t want me here, does she -
or my dog?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
you’ll find George great fun when you get to know her,’ said Aunt Fanny. ‘Here
she comes now with your soup.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
came in with the soup, and was not at all pleased to see Timmy standing by the
camp-bed, being petted by Berta. She set the soup down sharply, and pushed
Timmy away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thank
you,’ said Berta, and took the soup-cup eagerly into her hands. ‘What lovely
soup!’ she said. George got into bed and turned over on her side. She knew she
was behaving badly, but the thought of someone daring to bring another dog to
live at Kirrin Cottage was more than she could bear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
leapt up to lie at her feet as usual. Berta looked at this with much approval.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
have Sally on my feet tomorrow!’ she said. ‘That’s an awfully good idea. Pops -
that’s my father - always let me have Sally in my room, but she had to be in
her basket, not on my bed. Tomorrow night she can sleep on my feet, like Timmy
does on George’s.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She
will not,’ said George, in a fierce voice. ‘No dog sleeps in my bedroom except
Timmy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
don’t talk any more,’ said Aunt Fanny, hurriedly. ‘We can settle everything
tomorrow when you’re not so tired. I’ll look after Sally tonight for you, I
promise. Lie down now and go to sleep. You look as if you’re half asleep
already!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
was suddenly overcome with sleep and flopped down into bed. Her eyes closed,
but she managed to force them open and look up at George’s mother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
night, Aunt Fanny,’ she said, sleepily. ‘That’s what I was to call you, wasn’t
it? Thank you for being so kind to me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
was asleep almost before she had finished speaking. Aunt Fanny took up the
soup-cup and went to the door. ‘Are you awake, George?’ she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
lay absolutely still. She knew that her mother was not pleased with her. It
would be better to pretend to be fast asleep!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
am sure you are awake,’ said her mother. ‘And I hope you are ashamed of
yourself. I shall expect you to make up for this silly behaviour in the
morning. It is a pity to behave in such a childish manner!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
went out of the room, closing the door softly. George put out her hand to
Timmy. She was ashamed of herself, but she wasn’t at all certain that she would
behave better in the morning. That silly, soppy girl! Her dog would be as silly
as herself, she was sure! And Timmy would simply hate having another dog in the
house. He would probably growl and snarl to such a degree that Berta would be
forced to send her dog away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
a good thing too,’ murmured George, as Timmy licked her fingers lovingly. ‘You
don’t want another girl in the house or another dog either, do you Timmy?
Especially a girl like that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Aunt
Fanny saw to Berta’s dog, and put her safely into Timmy’s kennel outside. It
had a little door to it, which could be shut, so the dog was safe there, and
would not be able to run out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
went back into the house, cleared up Berta’s belongings a little, for they had
been thrown higgledy-piggledy into the room, and then turned out the light.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
went upstairs to bed. Her husband had slept soundly all through Berta’s late
arrival. He had been very sure that he would wake up and welcome the girl as
well as his wife, but he hadn’t even stirred!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Aunt
Fanny was glad. It was much easier for her to deal with a seasick, frightened
girl by herself. She climbed thankfully into bed and lay down with a sigh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
dear - I don’t look forward to the morning! What will happen then, with George
in this mood, and two dogs to sort out? Berta seems a nice little thing. Well -
perhaps they will all get on better than I think!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yes
- things wouldn’t be too easy in the morning. That was quite certain!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was the first to wake up in the morning. She at once remembered the events of
the night before and looked across at Berta in the camp-bed. The girl was
asleep, her wavy golden hair spread over the pillow. George leaned across
Anne’s bed and gave her a sharp nudge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
woke up at once and gazed sleepily at George. ‘What’s the matter, George? Is it
time to get up?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
over there,’ whispered George, nodding her head towards Berta. Anne turned over
and looked. Unlike George she liked the look of Berta. Her sleeping face was
pleasant and open, and her mouth turned up, not down. Anne couldn’t bear people
whose mouths turned down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She
looks all right,’ whispered back Anne. George frowned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She
howled like anything when she came,’ she told Anne. ‘She’s a real baby. And
she’s brought a dog!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Goodness
- Timmy won’t like that,’ said Anne, startled. ‘Where is it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Down
in Timmy’s kennel,’ said George, still whispering. ‘I haven’t seen it. It was
in a closed basket last night and I didn’t dare open it in case it tore
upstairs and had a row with Tim. But it can’t be very big. I expect it’s a
horrible Peke, or some silly little lap-dog.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Pekes
aren’t horrible,’ said Anne. ‘They may be small and have funny little
pug-noses, but they’re awfully brave. Fancy having another dog! I can’t think
what Timmy will say!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
a pity Berta isn’t our kind,’ said George. ‘Look at her pale face - not a scrap
of sun-tan! And she looks weedy, doesn’t she? I’m sure she couldn’t climb a
tree, or row a boat, or...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sh!
She’s waking up,’ said Anne warningly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
yawned and stretched herself. Then she opened her eyes and looked round. At
first she had no idea where she was, and then she suddenly remembered. She sat
up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo!’
said Anne, and smiled at her. ‘You weren’t here when I came to bed last night.
I was surprised to see you this morning.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
took an immediate liking to Anne. ‘She’s got kind eyes,’ she thought. ‘She’s
not like the other girl. I like this one!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
smiled back at Anne. ‘Yes - I came in the middle of the night,’ she said. ‘I
came by motor-boat, and the sea was so bumpy that I was frightfully sick. My
father didn’t come with me but a friend of his did, and he carried me from the
boat to Kirrin Cottage. Even my legs felt sea-sick!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Bad
luck!’ said Anne. ‘You didn’t really enjoy the adventure then!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
I can do without adventures!’ said Berta. ‘I’m not keen on them. Especially
when Pops gets all excited and worried about me - he fusses round me like a
hen, dear old Pops. I shall hate being away from him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was listening to all this. Not keen on adventures! Well, a girl like that
wouldn’t be, of course!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
not very keen on adventures either,’ said Anne. ‘We’ve had plenty, goodness
knows. I prefer adventures when they’re all over!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
exploded. ‘Anne! How can you talk like that! We’ve had some smashing
adventures, and we’ve enjoyed every one of them. If you feel like that we’ll
leave you out of the next one.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
laughed. ‘You won’t! An adventure comes up all of a sudden, like a wind blowing
up in the sky, and we’re all in it, whether we like it or not. And you know
that I like sharing things with you. I say - isn’t it time we got up?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said George, looking at the clock on the mantelpiece. ‘Unless Berta wants to
have her breakfast in bed? I bet she always does at home.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
I don’t. I hate meals in bed,’ said Berta. ‘I’m going to get up.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
leapt out of bed and went to the window. Immediately she saw the wide sweep of
the bay, sparkling in the morning sun, as blue as cornflowers. The sea-sparkle
was reflected into the bedroom, and made it very bright indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh!
I wondered why our room was so full of brilliant light,’ said Berta. ‘Now I
know! What a view! Oh, how lovely the sea looks this morning! And what’s that
little island out there? What a lovely place it looks.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
Kirrin Island,’ said George, proudly. ‘It belongs to me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
laughed, thinking that George was joking. ‘Belongs to you! I bet you wish it
did. It’s really wunnerful!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wunnerful!’
said George imitating her. ‘Can’t you say “wonderful”? It’s got a D in the
middle, you know.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I’m always being told things like that,’ said Berta, still staring out of the
window. ‘I had an English governess and she tried to make me speak like you do.
I do try, because I’ve got to go to an English school. My, my - I wish that
island belonged to me. I wonder if my Pops could buy it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
exploded again. ‘Buy it! You donkey, I told you it was mine, didn’t I?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
turned round in surprise. ‘But - you didn’t mean it, did you?’ she said.
‘Yours? But how could it be?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
is George’s,’ said Anne. ‘It has always belonged to the Kirrin family. That’s
Kirrin Island. George’s father gave it to her, after an adventure we once had.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
stared at George in awe. ‘Great snakes! So it is yours! Aren’t you the lucky
one! Will you take me to visit it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
see,’ said George gruffly, glad to have impressed this American girl so much.
Getting her ‘Pops’ to buy the island indeed! George snorted to herself. What
next!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
shout came from the next room. It was Julian. ‘Hey, you girls! Are you getting
up? We’re all too late for a bathe before breakfast this morning. Dick and I
have only just woken up.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Berta’s
here!’ shouted back Anne. ‘We’ll get dressed, all of us, and then we’ll
introduce Berta to you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Are
they your brothers?’ asked Berta. ‘I haven’t got any. Or sisters either. I
shall be pretty scared of them-’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
won’t be scared of Julian and Dick,’ said Anne, proudly. ‘You’ll wish you had
brothers like them. Won’t she, George?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said George, shortly. She was feeling rather annoyed just then because Timmy
was standing by Berta, wagging his plumy tail. ‘Come here, Timmy. Don’t make a
nuisance of yourself.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
he’s not,’ said Berta, and patted his big head. ‘I like him. He seems simply
ENORMOUS after my Sally. But you’ll love Sally, George, you really will.
Everyone says how sweet she is - and I’ve trained her beautifully.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
took no interest in these remarks at all. She flounced off to wash in the
bath-room, but Julian and Dick were there, and there was a lot of yelling and
shouting as George tried to make them hurry up and get out. Berta laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
sounds nice and family-like,’ she said. ‘You don’t get that sort of thing if
you’re an only child. What do I wear here?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
- something very simple,’ said Anne, looking at the suitcase open on the floor,
showing a collection of Berta’s clothes. ‘That shirt and those jeans will do.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were ready just as the gong rang for breakfast. A delicious smell of frying
bacon and tomatoes came up the stairs, and Berta sniffed in delight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
do like English breakfast,’ she said. ‘We haven’t gotten around to a proper
breakfast in America yet! That’s bacon and tomatoes I smell, isn’t it? My
English governess always said that bacon and eggs made the best breakfast in
the world, but I guess the one we’re going to have will taste pretty good.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin was at the table when the children came down. He looked most surprised
to see Berta, having quite forgotten that she was coming. ‘Who’s this?’ he
said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
Quentin - don’t pretend you don’t know!’ said his wife. ‘It’s Elbur’s girl -
your friend Elbur. She came in the middle of the night, but I didn’t wake you,
you were so sound asleep.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah
yes,’ said Uncle Quentin, and he shook hands with the rather scared Berta.
‘Glad to have you here, er - let me see now - what’s your name?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Berta,’
said everyone in a chorus.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
yes - Berta. Sit down, my dear. I know your father well. He’s doing some
wonderful work.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
beamed. ‘He’s always at work!’ she said. ‘He works all through the night
sometimes.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Does
he? Well, what a thing to do!’ said Uncle Quentin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
a thing you often do yourself, Quentin,’ said his wife, pouring out coffee.
‘Though I don’t suppose you even realize it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin looked surprised. ‘Do I really? Bless us all! Don’t I go to bed some
nights then?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
laughed. ‘You’re like my Pops! Sometimes he doesn’t know what day of the week
it is, even! And yet he’s supposed to be one of the cleverest guys in the
world!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Guy?’
said Uncle Quentin, surprised, immediately thinking of Firework Night. Everyone
laughed. Anne patted her uncle’s knee. ‘It’s all right, Uncle,’ she said, ‘he’s
not going to sit on the top of a bonfire!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Uncle Quentin was not listening. He had suddenly seen a letter marked
‘IMPORTANT’ on the top of his pile of correspondence, and he picked it up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
unless I’m much mistaken, here’s a letter from your father,’ he said to Berta.
‘I’ll see what he says.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
opened the letter and read it to himself. Then he looked up. ‘It’s all about
you - er - er...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Her
name’s Berta,’ said Aunt Fanny, patiently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘About
you, Berta,’ said Uncle Quentin. ‘But I must say your father has some very
strange ideas. Yes, very strange.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
are they?’ asked his wife.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- he says she must be disguised - in case anyone comes to find her here,’ said
Uncle Quentin. ‘And he wants her name changed - and, bless us all, he wants us
to buy her boys’ clothes - and cut her hair short - and dress her up as a boy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
listened in surprise. Berta gave a little squeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
won’t! I WON’T be dressed up as a boy! I won’t have my hair cut off. Don’t you

looked so upset that Aunt Fanny acted quickly and firmly. ‘Don’t bother about
that letter now, Quentin,’ she said. ‘We’ll go through it afterwards and decide
what to do. Let’s have our breakfast in peace.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
won’t have my hair cut off,’ said Berta, again. Uncle Quentin was not used to
being defied openly like this, and he scowled. He looked at his wife.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Surely
you are not going to let this - er what’s her name now - Bertha...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Berta,’
said everyone automatically.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
said that we would not discuss this till after breakfast,’ said Aunt Fanny, in
the kind of voice that made everyone, including Uncle Quentin, quite certain
that she meant what she said. Her husband folded up the letter and opened the
next one, frowning. The children looked at one another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
to be a boy! Goodness! If ever anyone looked less like a boy it was Berta!
George was most annoyed. She loved to dress like a boy, but she didn’t feel
inclined to urge anyone else to! She looked at Berta, who was eating her
breakfast with tears in her eyes. What a baby! She wouldn’t even look like a
boy, if she was dressed in boys’ clothes. She would just look absolutely silly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
began a conversation with his aunt about the garden. She was grateful to him
for breaking up the sudden awkwardness caused by the letter. She was very fond
of Julian. ‘I can always depend on him,’ she thought, and talked gladly of the
garden fruit, and who would pick the raspberries for lunch and whether the
wasps would eat all the plums or not!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
joined in, and Anne, and soon Berta did too. Only George and her father
remained gloomy. They both looked so exactly alike in solemn, rather frowning
expressions that Julian nudged Dick and nodded towards them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
grinned. ‘Like father, like daughter!’ he said. ‘Cheer up, George. Don’t you
like your breakfast?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was just about to answer crossly when Anne gave an exclamation. ‘Oh, look at
Uncle Quentin! He’s putting mustard on his toast - Aunt Fanny, stop him - he’s
just going to eat it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
roared with laughter. Aunt Fanny managed to smack her husband’s hand down from
his mouth, just as he was putting his toast and mustard up to it, reading a
letter at the same time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hey
- what’s the matter?’ he said, startled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Quentin
- that’s the second time this month you’ve spread your toast with mustard
instead of with marmalade,’ said his wife. ‘Do have a little sense.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
that everyone became very cheerful. Uncle Quentin laughed at himself, and
George saw the funny side and laughed loudly too, which made Timmy bark, and
Berta giggled. Aunt Fanny was quite relieved that her husband had done such a
silly thing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
you remember when Father poured custard all over his fried fish once?’ George
said, entering into the talk for the first time. ‘And he said it was the best
egg-sauce he had ever tasted?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
conversation was very animated after that, and Aunt Fanny felt happier. ‘You
girls can clear away and wash up the breakfast things for Joan,’ she said. ‘Or
two of you can and the other can make the beds with me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
about my little dog?’ said Berta, suddenly remembering her again. ‘I haven’t
seen her yet, because I was only just in time for breakfast. Where is she?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
can go and get her now,’ said Aunt Fanny. ‘We’ve all finished. Are you going to
start your work, Quentin?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
I am,’ said her husband. ‘So I don’t want any yelling or shouting or barking
outside my study door.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
got up and went out of the room. Berta stood up too. ‘Where’s the kennel?’ she
said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
show you,’ said Anne. ‘We’ll go and get your dog and introduce it to Timmy.
Coming, George?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
can bring the dog in here, and we’ll see what Timmy says,’ said George, going
all gloomy again. ‘If he doesn’t like the dog - and he won’t - it will have to
live out in the kennel.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no,’ said Berta, at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you don’t want Timmy to eat it, do you?’ said George. ‘He’s very jealous of
other dogs in the house. He might go for yours and savage it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no!’ said Berta, again, looking upset. ‘Timmy’s nice. He’s not a fierce dog.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
all you know!’ said George. ‘Well, I’ve warned you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on,’ said Anne, pulling at Berta’s sleeve. ‘Let’s go and fetch Sally. She must
be wondering why nobody bothers about her. I bet Timmy won’t mind terribly.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
soon as the two had gone out, George spoke in Timmy’s ear. ‘You don’t like
strange dogs who want to come and live here, do you, Tim? You’ll growl and
snarl like anything, won’t you? Growl your very fiercest! I know you won’t bite
but if you could just growl your loudest, that will be enough. Berta will make
that Sally-dog live out of doors then!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
she heard footsteps returning, and Anne’s voice exclaiming in delight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
she’s sweet! Oh, what a darling! Sally, you’re a pet! Julian, Dick, Aunt Fanny
- do come and see Berta’s dog!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
came into the room, led by Berta and Anne. Berta held the dog in her arms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was a tiny black poodle, whose woolly fur was cut away here and there to give
it a very fashionable look. Sally was certainly an attractive little thing! Her
sharp little nose sniffed all the time she was carried into the room, and her
quick little eyes looked everywhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
put her down, and the little poodle stood there, poised on her dainty feet like
a ballet dancer about to perform. Everyone but George exclaimed in delight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She’s
a poppet!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sally!
Sally, you’re a pet!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
a poodle! I do love poodles! They look so knowing.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
stood by George, sniffing hard to get the smell of this new dog. George had her
hand on his collar in case he sprang. His tail was as stiff as a ramrod.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
poodle suddenly saw him. She stared at him out of bright little eyes, quite
unafraid. Then she pulled away from Berta’s hand and trotted right over to
Timmy, her funny little tail wagging merrily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
backed a little in surprise. The poodle danced all round him on her toes, and a
little whimpering bark, which said as plainly as possible, I want to play with
you!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
sprang. He leapt in the air and came down with a thud on his big paws, and the
little poodle dodged. Timmy’s tail began to wag wildly. He sprang again in
play, and almost knocked the little poodle over. He barked as if to say ‘Sorry,
I didn’t mean that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
he and the poodle played a most ridiculous game of dodge and run, and although
one or two chairs went flying nobody minded - they were all laughing so much at
the sight of the quick little poodle leading Timmy such a dance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
last Sally was tired and sat down in a corner. Timmy pranced about in front of
her, showing off. Then he went up to her and sniffed her nose. He licked it
gently, and then lay down in front of her, gazing at her adoringly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
gave a little squeal of laughter. ‘He’s gazing at Sally exactly as he gazes at
you, George!’ she cried.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
George was not at all pleased. In fact she was quite astounded. To think that
Timmy should welcome another dog! To think that he should behave like this when
she had told him to do the opposite!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Aren’t
they sweet together?’ said Berta, pleased. ‘I thought Timmy would like Sally.
Of course Sally is a pedigree dog, and cost a lot of money - and Timmy’s only a
mongrel. I expect he thinks she’s wunnerful.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
Tim may be a mongrel, but he’s absolutely wunnerful too,’ said Dick, hastily,
pronouncing the word like Berta, to try and get a laugh. He saw George’s scowl,
and knew how cross she felt at hearing her beloved Timmy compared with a
pedigree dog. ‘He’s a magnificent fellow, aren’t you, Timmy?’ went on Dick.
‘Sally may be a darling, but you’re worth more than a hundred darlings, aren’t
you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think he’s beautiful,’ said Berta, looking down at Timmy. ‘He’s got the
loveliest eyes I ever did see.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
began to feel a little better. She called Timmy. ‘You’re making rather a fool
of yourself,’ she said to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
that Timmy and Sally are going to be friends, can I have Sally to sleep on my
bed at night, like George has Timmy?’ said Berta. ‘Please say yes, Aunt Fanny.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said George at once. ‘Mother, I won’t have that. I won’t!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we’ll see what we can do about it,’ said her mother. ‘Sally was quite happy in
the kennel last night, I must say.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
going to have her sleep with me,’ said Berth, scowling at George. ‘My father
will pay you a lot of money to make me happy. He told me he would.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
be silly, Berta,’ said Aunt Fanny, firmly. ‘This isn’t a question of money.
Now, leave this for a little while, please, and go and do your jobs, all of
you. And then we must consider your father’s letter, Berta, and see exactly
what he wants done. We must certainly try to follow his advice about you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
I don’t want to...’ began Berta, and then felt a firm hand on her arm. It was
Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on, kid,’ he said. ‘Be your age! Remember you’re a guest here and put on a few
of your best manners. We like American children - but not spoilt ones!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
had quite a shock to hear Julian speaking like this. She looked up at him and
he grinned down at her. She felt near tears, but she smiled back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
haven’t any brothers to keep you in your place,’ said Julian, linking his arm
in hers. ‘Well, from now on, while you’re here, Dick and I are your brothers,
and you’ve got to toe the line, just like Anne. See? What about it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
felt that there was nothing in the world she would like better than having
Julian for a brother! He was big and tall and had twinkling kindly eyes that
made Berta feel he was as responsible and trustable as her father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Aunt
Fanny smiled to herself. Julian always knew the best thing to say and do. Now
he would take Berta in hand and see that she didn’t upset the household too
much. She was glad. It wasn’t easy to run a big family like this, with a
scientist husband to cope with, unless everyone pulled together!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
go and help Aunt Fanny with the beds,’ said Julian to Berta. ‘And take your
Sally-dog with you. She’s great! But so is Timmy, and don’t you forget it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Peace
reigned in the house for a little while. George and Anne went to help the cook
with the washing-up. Joan was pleased, because with eight people in the house,
including herself, there was a lot to do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
had been very astonished that morning to find a fifth child added to the
household, but had been told that after breakfast she could go into the
sitting-room and hear an explanation. Joan must certainly be in the secret too!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Upstairs
Berta was helping with the beds - not very successfully because she was not
used to doing things for herself. But she was very willing to learn and Aunt
Fanny was quite pleased with her. Timmy and Sally darted about together and
made things rather more dificult than they need have been, popping under beds
and out again at top speed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
glad Timmy likes Sally,’ said Berta. ‘I knew he would. I can’t think why George
thought he wouldn’t. George is funny, I think.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
really,’ said Aunt Fanny. ‘She hasn’t any brothers or sisters to rub off her
corners, and she didn’t even know her three cousins till a few years ago, or go
to school. Lonely people aren’t so easy to get on with as others - but she is
great fun now, as you will soon find out.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
an only child too,’ said Berta. ‘But I’ve always had plenty of other children
to play with. My Pops saw to that. He’s wunnerful - I mean wonDERful. I’ll say
that word “wonDERful” twenny times, then maybe, I’ll get it right.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
say the word “twenty” as well!’ said Aunt Fanny. ‘It has a letter T at the end
as well as at the beginning, you know. It’s “twenTY” not “twenny”. But don’t
make yourself too English. It’s nice to have a change!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘WonDERful,
wonDERful, wonDERful! TwenTY, twenTY!’ chanted Berta, as she made the beds.
Dick looked into the room and chuckled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Great
snakes!’ he said, with a grin, and an American accent. ‘You shore are
wunnerful, baby!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
be so silly, Dick,’ said his aunt, laughing. ‘Now - I think we’ve finished all
we have to do, Berta. We’ll go downstairs and have a conference. Tell the
others, will you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta,
followed closely by Sally, who was also followed closely by an adoring Timmy,
went to tell Dick and Julian, and then George and Anne. George was not too
pleased with Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
have you been?’ she said. ‘Can’t you stop running about after Sally? She’ll get
very very tired of you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wuff!’
said Sally, in a high little bark, not at all like Timmy’s deep ‘Woof!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
all five children and the two dogs, and also Joan, were in the sitting-room
with Aunt Fanny. Berta began to look a little nervous. Aunt Fanny had the
letter that Berta’s father had sent. She did not read it out to the children,
but told them what was in it. She also explained to Joan about Berta.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Joan,
you have always known what important work the master does,’ she said. ‘Well,
Miss Berta’s father does the same kind of work in America, and he and the
master are working on a great new scheme together.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes, Mam,’ said Joan, very much interested.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Berta’s
father has been warned by the police that it is possible Berta may be kidnapped
and held to ransom, not for money, but for the scientific secrets that he knows,’
went on Aunt Fanny. ‘So she has been sent to us to be kept safe for three
weeks. By that time the scheme will be finished and made public. Berta is going
to the same school as Miss Anne and Miss George, and it is a good idea to let
them know one another first.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Joan
nodded. ‘I understand that, Mam,’ she said. ‘I think we can keep Miss Berta
safe, don’t you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Aunt Fanny. ‘But her father has now put up some further ideas that he
wants us to follow. He says it would be best to disguise her as a boy...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Jolly
good idea,’ interrupted Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
to give her another name - a boy’s name,’ said Aunt Fanny. ‘He wants her to
have her hair cut short and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
please not that!’ begged Berta, shaking back her fair, wavy hair. ‘I’d hate it.
Girls with short hair like boys look so silly, they...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
nudged her and frowned. Berta stopped hurriedly, remembering that George had
curly hair cut as short as any boy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think we’ll have to do what your father says,’ said Aunt Fanny. ‘This is very
important, Berta. You see, if anyone should come here looking for you, thinking
of kidnapping, they would never recognize you if you were looking exactly like
a boy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
my hair,’ said Berta, almost in tears. ‘How could Pops say I’m to have my hair
off? He always said it was wunnerful!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
liked to point out that there was a D in wonderful just then! Berta was really
so very upset about her hair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Your
hair will grow quickly enough,’ said Aunt Fanny.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Her
head’s a good shape,’ said Julian, looking at it consideringly. ‘She should
look nice with short hair.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
cheered up. If Julian thought that, then it wouldn’t be so bad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
what about clothes?’ she said, remembering this point with a look of horror.
‘Girls look frightful in boys’ clothes. Pops always said so till now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
won’t look any worse than George does,’ said Dick. ‘She’s got on a boy’s
jersey, boy’s jeans and boy’s shoes this very minute!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think she looks awful,’ said Berta, obstinately, and George scowled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I think you’d look horrible,’ she said. ‘You wouldn’t even look like a boy,
you’d look little-girlish, silly little sissy-boy. I think it’s a fat-headed
idea to put you into boys’ clothes!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Aha!
Our George wants to be the only one!’ said Dick, slyly, and quickly got out of
the way of a punch from the furious George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,’
said Julian, ‘I’ll go out and buy some things for Berta this morning, so that’s
settled. What about her hair? Shall I cut it short?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Aunt
Fanny was amused at Julian’s high-handed way of dealing with Berta and her
troubles, and even more amused to see that Berta did not even argue with
Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
can certainly go shopping for Berta if you like,’ she said. ‘But I’d rather you
didn’t cut her hair. You’d make her look a scarecrow!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t mind if Julian cuts it,’ said Berta, surprisingly meek all at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
shall cut it for you myself,’ said Aunt Fanny. ‘Now - what about a boy’s name?
We can’t call you Berta any more, that’s certain.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’d
rather not have a boy’s name,’ said Berta. ‘It’s silly for a girl to be called
by a boy’s name, like George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
you mean to be rude to me, I’ll ...’ began George, but got no farther. Julian
and Dick had burst into laughter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
George - you and Berta will be the death of us!’ said Julian. ‘Here are you
doing all you can to pretend to be a boy - and here is Berta doing all she can
to get out of it? For goodness’ sake, let’s settle the matter without any more
bickering. We’ll call Berta Robert.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
- that’s too like Berta,’ said Dick. ‘It ought to be a completely different
name. We’ll call her a good plain boy’s name like Jim or Tom or John.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said Berta. ‘I don’t like any of them. Let me have my second name, please.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
that? Another girl’s name?’ asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
But it’s used for a boy too, only then it’s spelt differently,’ said Berta.
‘It’s Lesley. It’s a nice name, I think.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Lesley.
Yes - it rather suits you,’ said Julian. ‘It suits you better than Berta. We’ll
call you Lesley - and people will think it’s Leslie spelt l-i-e at the end, and
not l-e-y. All right. Everything’s settled.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
quite,’ said his aunt. ‘I just want to say that you mustn’t let Berta - I mean
Lesley - out of your sight at all. And you must report at once any mysterious
happening or any stranger you see. The local police here know that we have
Lesley with us, and why - and anything can be reported to them at once. They
also are keeping a good look-out, of course.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
almost sounds as if we’re in the middle of an adventure!’ said Dick, looking
pleased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hope not,’ said his aunt. ‘I don’t imagine that anyone will ever guess Berta -
I mean Lesley - is anything more than she will appear to be - a boy friend of
yours and Julian’s, come to stay for a while. Dear me, it’s going to be
dificult to refer to HER and HIM all the time!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
certainly is,’ said Julian, standing up. ‘If you’ll give me some money, Aunt
Fanny, I’ll go and do a little shopping for Lesley. What size do you think HE
needs?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
laughed. ‘HE wears size three shoes,’ said Joan, smiling. ‘I noticed that this
morning.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
HE will have to get used to doing his coat buttons up on the right-hand side
instead of on the left,’ said Anne, joining in the fun.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘SHE
will soon get used to that?’ said George. ‘Won’t SHE, Timmy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
spoil it all now, George,’ said Julian. ‘A slip of the tongue, saying SHE
instead of HE, might lead to danger for her - I mean Lesley.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
I know,’ said George. ‘It’s just that she’ll never look like a boy, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t want to look like a boy,’ said Berta. ‘I think you look...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here
we go again!’ said Julian. ‘Stop it, Lesley, stop it, George. George, you’d
better come out and help me to get the things for Lesley. Come on. And take
that scowl off your face. You look like a sulky girl!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
made George alter her face at once. She couldn’t help grinning at the artful
Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
coming,’ she said, ‘Good-bye, Berta. When we come back, you’ll be Leslie,
haircut and all!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
and Julian went off. Anne fetched her aunt’s sharpest scissors and draped a big
towel round Berta’s shoulders. Berta looked as if she was going to cry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Cheer
up,’ said Dick. ‘You’re going to look angelic with short hair! Begin, Aunt
Fanny. Let’s see what she’s like with shorn locks.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sit
quite still,’ said Aunt Fanny and began. Clip-clip-clip! The wavy golden hair
fell to the floor in big strands and Berta began to weep in earnest. ‘My hair!
I can’t bear this. Oh, my hair!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
most of it was on the floor, and Aunt Fanny began to clip what was left as best
she could, to make it look as boyish as possible. She made a very good job of
it indeed. Dick and Anne watched with the greatest interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There!
It’s done!’ said Aunt Fanny at last. ‘Stop crying, Lesley - and let’s have a
look at you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
stood in the middle of the floor, blinking her tears away. Anne gave a gasp.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
know - it’s very odd - but she does look rather like a boy - a very, very
good-looking boy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘An
angelic boy,’ said Dick. ‘A choirboy or something. She looks smashing! Who would
have thought it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Aunt
Fanny was very struck with Berta’s appearance too. ‘It’s certainly very odd,’
she said. ‘But there’s no doubt about it - when she’s - I mean he’s - dressed
in boy’s clothes, he’ll make a fine boy. Better than George, actually, because
her hair’s really too curly for a boy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
went to the looking-glass on the wall. She gave a wail. ‘I look awful! I don’t
know myself! Nobody would EVER recognize me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Splendid!’
said Dick, at once. ‘You’ve hit the nail right on the head. Nobody would
recognize you now. Your father was quite right to say, cut your hair off and
dress up as a boy. Any prowling kidnapper would never think you were Berta, the
pretty little girl.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’d
rather be kidnapped than look like this,’ wept Berta. ‘What will the girls at
your school say, Anne, when they see me?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
don’t say anything to George about her short hair, and they won’t say anything
to you,’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Stop
crying, Bert - er - Lesley,’ said Aunt Fanny. ‘You make me feel quite
miserable. You’ve been very good to stand so still all that time. Now I really
must think of a little reward for you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
stopped crying at once. ‘Please,’ she said, ‘there’s only one thing I want now.
I want Sally-dog to sleep with me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
dear, Ber - er Lesley - I really can’t have another dog in that little
bedroom,’ said poor Aunt Fanny. ‘And George would make things most unpleasant
if I did.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Aunt
Fanny - Sally is a very very good guard for me,’ said Berta. ‘She barks at the
very slightest sound. I’d feel safe with her in the bedroom.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’d
like you to have her,’ said Aunt Fanny, ‘but...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Joan
had come into the room to put away some things and had heard the conversation.
She stared in admiration at Berta’s neat golden head, and then made a
suggestion. ‘If you’ll excuse me, Mam,’ she said, ‘Miss Berta could have her
camp-bed in my room. I don’t mind the dog a bit, she can have her and welcome,
he’s a pet, that little poodle. It’s very crowded in the girls’ room now, with
three beds in it, and my room’s a nice big one. So, if Miss Berta doesn’t mind
sharing it, she’s welcome.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
Joan - that’s good of you,’ said Aunt Fanny, relieved at such a simple
solution. ‘Also, your room is up in the attic - it would be very difficult for
kidnappers to find their way there - and nobody would think of looking into
your room for one of the children.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thank
you, Joan, you’re just wunnerful!’ said Berta, in delight. ‘Sally, do you hear
that? You’ll be sleeping on my feet tonight, like Timmy does on George’s.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t really approve of that, you know, Berta,’ said Aunt Fanny. ‘Oh dear - I
called you Berta again. Lesley, I mean. What a muddle I’m going to get into!
Anne, get the dustpan and sweep up the hair on the floor.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
Julian and George came back there was no sign of the golden hair on the floor.
They put their parcels down on the table and shouted for Aunt Fanny. ‘Mother!’
called George. ‘Aunt Fanny!’ shouted Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
came running downstairs with Berta and Anne and Dick. Julian and George looked
at Berta, thunderstruck. ‘Gosh - is it really you, Berta?’ said Julian. ‘I
simply don’t recognize you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
- you do look like a boy!’ said George. ‘I never thought you would.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
jolly good-looking boy,’ said Julian. ‘Well, your father was right. It’s the
best disguise you could have!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
are the clothes?’ asked Berta, rather pleased at all the interest in her looks.
They opened the parcels and pulled out the things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were not really very exciting - a boy’s blazer in navy blue, two pairs of boy’s
jeans, two grey jerseys, a few shirts, a tie and a pull-over without sleeves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
shoes and socks,’ said George. ‘But we decided you’d got plenty of socks that
would do, so we only bought one pair of those. Oh - and here’s a boy’s grey
felt hat in case the sun’s too hot - and a cap!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
put on the cap at once. There were squeals of laughter from everyone. ‘It suits
her! She’s got it on at just the right angle. She looks a real boy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
put it on, George,’ said Berta, and George took it, eager to share in the admiration.
But it looked ridiculous on her curls, and wouldn’t sit down flat as it should.
Everyone hooted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
makes you look a girl! Take it off!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
took it off in disappointment. How very aggravating that this girl Berta should
make a better boy than she did! She threw the cap on the table, half-cross that
they had bought it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Go
upstairs and put some of the things on,’ said Aunt Fanny, amused at all these
goings-on. Up went Berta obediently, and soon came down again, neatly arrayed
in jeans, grey shirt and blue tie.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
roared with laughter. Berta was now quite enjoying herself and paraded round
the room, her cap tilted on one side of her head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She
looks like a very tidy, neat little boy, a good and most angelic child!’ said
Julian. ‘Dear Lesley, you must get yourself just a little dirty - you look too
good to be true.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t like getting dirty,’ said Berta. ‘I think...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
what she thought nobody knew because at that moment the door opened and Uncle
Quentin came into the room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’d
like to know how you think I can do my work with all this hooting and cackling
going on,’ he began, and then he suddenly saw Berta, and stopped.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who’s
this?’ he said, looking Berta up and down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
you know, Father?’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course not. Never seen him in my life before!’ said her father. ‘Don’t tell me
it’s somebody else come to stay.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
Berta,’ said Anne, with a giggle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Berta
- now who’s Berta?’ said Uncle Quentin, frowning. ‘I seem to have heard that
name before.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
girl you thought might be kidnapped,’ explained Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
Berta - Elbur’s girl!’ said Uncle Quentin, ‘I remember her all right. But who’s
this? This boy? I’ve never seen him before. What’s your name, boy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Lesley,’
said Berta. ‘But I was Berta when you saw me at breakfast.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
heavens!’ said Uncle Quentin amazed. ‘What a - what a transformation! Why, your
own father wouldn’t know you. I hope I remember who you are. Keep reminding me,
if I don’t.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Off
he went, back to his study. The children laughed, and Aunt Fanny had to laugh
too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘By
the way,’ she said, ‘I want you all to have lunch at home today, because it’s
really too late now to start making sandwiches for a picnic; it’s only cold ham
and salad, so don’t get too hungry, will you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
there time for a bathe?’ asked Julian, looking at his watch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- if you’ll come in about twelve o’clock and pick the fruit for a pudding for
lunch,’ said his aunt. ‘It takes ages to pick enough for eight people, and Joan
and I have a lot to do today.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right.
We’ll go for a bathe now, and then we’ll ALL pick fruit,’ said Julian. ‘Bags I
pick the plums. The raspberries are such fiddley little things.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Have
you a swim-suit, Berta, I mean Lesley?’ asked George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
It’s an absolutely plain one, like a boy’s, so I’ll be all right in it,’ said
Berta. ‘Hurray, I shan’t need to wear a cap. Boys never do.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta’s
cases were now all in Joan’s big room and she ran to get into her swim-suit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Bring
your blazer and a towel,’ yelled George, and went into her own room with Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
bet Berta can’t swim,’ she said. ‘That will be a pity, because most boys swim
well. We’ll have to teach her.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
don’t duck her too often!’ said Anne, seeing a look in George’s eye that was
not too kindly. ‘Blow - my swim-suit isn’t here - I’m sure I brought it in from
the clothes-line.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
took quite a while to find it, and the boys and Berta had already gone down to
the beach with Sally by the time Anne and George were ready to follow with the
impatient Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were down on the beach at last, and there was Sally-dog guarding the blazers
belonging to Julian, Dick and Berta. She was lying on them, and she even dared
to growl at Timmy when he came near.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
laughed. ‘Growl back, Timmy! Don’t let a little snippet like that cheek you. Growl
back!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timmy wouldn’t. He just sat down out of reach of Sally, and looked at her
sadly. Wasn’t she friends with him any more?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
are the others?’ said Anne, shading her eyes from the glare of the sun and
looking out to sea. ‘Goodness, how far out they’ve swum! That can’t be Berta
with them, surely!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
looked out over the stretch of blue sea at once. She saw three heads bobbing.
Yes, Berta was out there!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She
must be a jolly good swimmer,’ said Anne, admiringly. ‘I couldn’t swim out as far
as that. We were wrong about Berta. She swims like a fish!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
said nothing. She ran to the waves, plunged through a big one just as it was
curling over, and swam out strongly. She couldn’t believe that it was Berta out
there! And if it was, the boys must be helping her!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it was Berta. Her golden head glistened wet in the water, and she shouted in
glee as she swam.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
is great! This is wunnerful! Gee, I’m enjoying this! Hi there, George - isn’t
the water warm?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and Dick grinned round at the panting George. ‘Lesley’s a fine swimmer,’ said
Dick. ‘Gosh, I thought she was going to race me at one time. She’d beat you,
George!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She
wouldn’t,’ said George, but all the same she didn’t challenge Berta to race!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was fun to be five, fun to chase one another in the sea, to swim under the
water and grab somebody's leg. And Anne laughed till she choked when she saw
somebody heave themselves out of the water right on to George’s back, and duck
her well and truly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was Berta! And what was more, the angry George couldn’t catch her afterwards.
Berta could swim much too fast!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
soon settled down happily with the Five. George couldn’t bear to think that the
girl had to be dressed like a boy, but her jealousy wore off a little as the
days went by - though she couldn’t help feeling annoyed that Berta proved to be
such a good swimmer!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
could dive well too, and swim under water even longer than the boys could, much
to their surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
well, you see, back home, we’ve got a pool in our garden,’ she said. ‘A
wonDERful pool, gee, you should see it. And I learnt to swim in it when I was
two. Pops always called me a water-baby.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
ate just as much as the others, although she was not so sturdy and well built.
She was loud in her praise of the meals, and this pleased Aunt Fanny and Joan
very much.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
getting fatter, Lesley,’ said Aunt Fanny a week later, looking at her as she
sat eating her lunch with the others. ‘And what is better still - you’re
getting a really good sun-tan. You’re almost as brown as the others!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I thought so too,’ said Berta, pleased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
a good thing you caught the sun so easily,’ said Aunt Fanny. ‘Now, if any
kidnappers come round looking for a long-haired pale-faced American girl, they
would take one look at the lot of you and off they would go! Nobody would guess
you were Berta!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
the same, I’d much rather be Berta,’ said Berta. ‘I still don’t like pretending
to be a boy. It’s silly, and it makes me feel silly. Anyway, thank goodness my
hair’s growing a bit longer. I don’t look quite so much like a boy now!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dear
me, you’re right,’ said Aunt Fanny, and everyone looked at Berta. ‘I shall have
to cut it short again.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh!’
said Berta, ‘why did I say that? You wouldn’t have noticed if I hadn’t
mentioned it. Let it grow again, please, Aunt Fanny. I’ve been here a week and
there isn’t even a smell of a kidnapper - and I reckon there won’t be either!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Aunt Fanny was firm about the hair, and after the meal she made Berta stand
still while she clipped it a little shorter. It was not a bit curly like
George’s, and now that it was short, the wave had almost gone from it. She
really did look like a good clean little boy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Rather
a wishy-washy one!’ said George, unkindly, but everyone knew what she meant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sally
the poodle was a great success. Even George couldn’t go on disliking the happy,
dancing little dog. She trotted and capered about on her slim little legs, and
Timmy was her adoring slave.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She
always looks as if she’s running about on tiptoe,’ said Anne, and so she did.
She made friends with everyone, even the paper-boy, who was really scared of
dogs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin was the only one who didn’t get used to Berta and Sally. When he met
them together, Berta so like a small boy, Sally at her heels, he stopped and
stared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
let me see - who are you?’ he said. ‘Yes - you’re Berta!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
- he’s LESLEY!’ everyone would say.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
must not call her Berta, dear,’ said his wife. ‘You really must not. It’s a funny
thing that you never could remember she was Berta, and now that we’ve made her
into Lesley, you immediately remember she’s Berta!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I must say you’ve made her look exactly like a boy,’ said Uncle Quentin, much
to George’s annoyance. George was beginning to be afraid that Berta looked more
boyish than she did! ‘Well, I hope you’re having a good time with the others,
er - er...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Lesley
is the name,’ said Aunt Fanny with a little laugh. ‘Quentin, do try and
remember.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
day passed peacefully by, and the five children and two dogs were out of doors
all day long, swimming, boating, exploring, really enjoying themselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
wanted to go over to Kirrin Island, but George kept making excuses not to go.
‘Don’t be mean,’ said Dick. ‘We all want to go. It’s ages since we went. It’s
just that you don’t want to let Lesley do something she’d like to do!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
isn’t,’ said George. ‘Perhaps we’ll go tomorrow.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
when tomorrow came something happened that upset their plans for going to
Kirrin Island. A telephone call came for Uncle Quentin, and immediately he was
in a panic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Fanny!
Fanny, where are you?’ he called. ‘Pack my bag at once. At once, do you hear?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
wife came running down the stairs at top speed. ‘Quentin, why? What’s
happened?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Elbur’s
found a mistake in our calculations,’ said Uncle Quentin. ‘What nonsense!
There’s no mistake. None at all.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
why can’t he come here and work it out with you?’ asked his wife. ‘Why have you
got to rush off like this? Tell him to come here, Quentin. I’ll find him a bed
somehow.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
says he doesn’t want to, while his daughter - his daughter - what’s her name
now?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Lesley,’
said his wife. ‘All right, don’t bother to explain. I see now that it would be
foolish for him to come while Lesley’s here - she’d be calling him Pops,
and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Pops?’
said her husband, startled. ‘What do you mean - Pops?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
what she calls her father, dear,’ said Aunt Fanny, patiently. ‘Anyway, he’s
quite right. It would be foolish to hide Lesley here so well, and then have
everyone hear her calling him Pops, and him calling her Berta - if any
kidnappers followed him, they would soon find out where his daughter was -
here, with our four!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- that’s what I was trying to tell you,’ said her husband, impatiently. ‘Anyway
I must go to Elbur straightaway. So pack my bag, please. I’ll be back in two
days’ time.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘In
that case I’ll go with you, Quentin,’ said his wife. ‘I could do with a quiet
two days - and you’re not much good when you’re alone, are you - losing your
socks, and forgetting to have your shoes cleaned, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Her
husband gave a sudden smile that lighted up his face and made him seem quite
young. ‘Will you really come with me? I thought you’d hate to leave the
children.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
only for two days,’ said his wife. ‘And Joan is very good with them. I’ll
arrange that they shall go out on all-day picnics in the boat - they’ll be
quite safe then. If any kidnappers were around they’d find it difficult to
snatch Lesley out of a boat! But I’m beginning not to believe that tale of
Elbur’s. He just got into a panic when he heard the rumour, I expect.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children were told of the sudden decision when they got back to lunch that day.
Joan had to tell them, because Aunt Fanny and her husband had already departed,
complete with two suitcases, one containing precious papers and the other
clothes for two days.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh!’
said Julian, surprised. ‘I hope nothing horrid’s happened.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no - it was just a sudden telephone call from Master Lesley’s father,’ said
Joan, smiling at Berta. ‘He had to see your uncle in a hurry - about some
figures.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
didn’t Pops come down here - then he could have seen me?’ demanded Berta at
once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Because
everyone would have known who you are, then,’ said Dick. ‘We’re hiding you,
don’t forget!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes - well I do believe I had forgotten,’ said Berta, rather surprised at
herself. ‘It’s so lovely down here in Kirrin with you all. The days seem to
swim by!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Your
mother said you had better go off on all-day picnics in the boat,’ said Joan to
George. ‘That was to make things easy for me, of course. But I don’t mind what
you do - you can come back to lunch each day, if you like.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
do so like you, Joan!’ said Berta, giving the surprised cook a sudden hug.
‘You’re a real honey!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘In
fact, she’s quite wunnerful!’ said Dick. ‘It’s all right, Joan - we’ll go out
for the midday meal, and for tea, till my aunt comes back. And we’ll make the
sandwiches and pack up everything ourselves.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
that’s nice of you,’ said Joan. ‘Why don’t you go across to Kirrin Island for
the day? Master Lesley keeps wanting to go.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
grinned at Joan. It always struck her as extremely funny to be called Master
Lesley, and Joan never once forgot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
go if the boat is ready,’ said George, rather reluctantly. ‘You know James is
mending one of the row-locks. We’ll go and see if it’s finished.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went to see, but James was not there. His father was working on another
boat, over by the jetty, and he called to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
you want my James? He’s gone off in his uncle’s boat for a day’s fishing. He
said to tell you the row-lock’s not mended yet, but he’ll do it for certain
tonight when he comes back.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right.
Thank you,’ called back Julian. Berta looked very disappointed. ‘Cheer up,’ he
said. ‘We’ll be able to go tomorrow.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
shan’t,’ said Berta, mournfully. ‘Something else will happen to prevent us - or
George will think of another excuse not to go. Gee, if I had a wunnerful -
wonDERful - island like that, I’d go and live on it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went back to Kirrin Cottage and packed up a very good lunch for themselves.
Berta’s father had sent down a parcel of American goodies three days before,
and they meant to try them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Snick-snacks!’
said Dick, reading the name on a tin. ‘Shrimp, lobster, crab and a dozen other
things all in one tin. Sounds good. We’ll make sandwiches with this!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gorgies,’
said Anne, reading the name on another tin. ‘What a peculiar name! Oh - I
suppose it’s something you gorge yourself with. Let’s open it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
opened half a dozen tins with most exciting names and made themselves so many
sandwiches that Joan exclaimed in amazement. ‘However many have you made for
each of you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Twenny
each - I mean twenTY,’ said Berta. ‘But we won’t be back to lunch or tea, Joan.
I guess we’ll be plenny hungry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘PlenTy!’
chorused everyone, and Berta obediently repeated the word, a grin on her
sun-tanned face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
a day they had! They walked for miles and picnicked in a shady wood near a
little stream that bubbled along near by, sounding very cool and enticing. They
decided to sit with their feet in it as they ate, and Anne gave continual
little squeals because she said the water tickled the soles of her feet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were so tired when they got home that night that it was all they could do to
eat their supper and stagger upstairs to bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
shan’t wake till half past twelve tomorrow morning,’ yawned Dick. ‘Oh my poor
feet! Gosh, I’m so tired I shall probably fall asleep cleaning my teeth.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
a peaceful night!’ said Anne, looking out of her window. ‘Well - sleep tight,
everyone. I don’t expect any of us will open an eye till late tomorrow morning.
I know I shan’t!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
she did. She opened both eyes very wide indeed in the middle of the night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
was quiet in Kirrin Cottage. The two boys slept soundly in their room, and
George and Anne slept without stirring in theirs. Berta was up in Joan’s attic
room, and hadn’t moved since she had flopped into bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was on George’s feet, as usual, and Sally the poodle was curled up in the crook
of Berta’s knees, looking like a ball of black wool! Nobody stirred.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
black cloud crept up the sky and blotted out the stars one by one. Then a low
roll of thunder came. It was far off, and only a rumble, but it woke both the
dogs, and it woke Anne too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
opened her eyes, wondering what the noise was. Then she knew - it was thunder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
I hope a storm won’t come and break up this wonderful weather!’ she thought, as
she lay and listened. She turned towards the open window and looked for the
stars, but there were none to see.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
if a storm’s coming, I’ll go and watch it at the window,’ thought Anne. ‘It
should be a magnificent sight over Kirrin Bay. I’m so hot too - I’d like a
breath of fresh air at the window!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
got quietly out of bed and padded over to the open window. She leaned out,
sniffing the cool air outside. The night was very dark indeed, because of the
great black cloud.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
thunder came again, but not very near - just a low growl. Timmy jumped off
George’s bed and went to join Anne. He put his great paws up on the windowsill
and looked out solemnly over the bay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then both he and Anne heard another sound - a faraway chug-chug-chug-chug-chug.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
a motor-boat,’ said Anne, listening. ‘Isn’t it Timmy? Someone’s having a very
late trip! Can you see any ship-lights, Tim? I can’t.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
engine of the motor-boat cut out just then, and there was complete silence
except for the swish-swash-swish of the waves on the beach. Anne strained her
eyes to see if she could spot any light anywhere to show where the motor-boat
was. It sounded quite far out on the bay. Why had it stopped on the water? Why
hadn’t it gone to the jetty?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
she did see a light, but a very faint one, right out at the entrance of the
bay, about the middle. It shone for a while, moved here and there, and then
disappeared. Anne was puzzled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Surely
that’s just about where Kirrin Island is?’ she whispered to Timmy. ‘Is anyone
there? Has the motor-boat gone there, do you suppose? Well, we’ll listen to see
if it leaves again and goes away.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
no further sound came from across the bay, and no light shone either. ‘Perhaps
the motor-boat is behind Kirrin Island,’ thought Anne, suddenly. ‘And then I
wouldn’t be able to see any lights on it - the island would hide the boat and
its lights. But what was that moving light I saw? Was it someone on the island?
Oh dear, my eyes are getting so sleepy again that I can hardly keep them open.
Perhaps I didn’t hear or see anything after all!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no more thunder, and no lightning at all. The big black cloud began to thin
out and one or two stars appeared in the gaps. Anne yawned and crawled into
bed. Timmy jumped back on George’s bed and curled himself up with a little
sigh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the morning Anne had almost forgotten her watch at the open window the night
before. It was only when Joan mentioned that a big storm had burst over a town
fifty miles away that Anne remembered the thunder she had heard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh!’
she said, suddenly. ‘Yes - I heard thunder too, and I got out of bed, hoping to
watch a storm. But it didn’t come. And I heard a motor-boat far out on the bay,
but I couldn’t see any lights - except for a faint, moving one I thought was on
Kirrin Island.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
sat up in her chair as if she had had an electric shock. ‘On Kirrin Island!
Whatever do you mean? Nobody’s there. Nobody’s allowed there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- I may have been mistaken,’ said Anne. ‘I was so very sleepy. I didn’t hear
the motor-boat go away. I just went back to bed.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
might have waked me, if you thought you saw a light on my island,’ said George.
‘You really might!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
Miss Anne - it wouldn’t be kidnappers, would it!’ said Joan, at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
laughed. ‘No, Joan. What would be the use of them going to Kirrin Island? They
couldn’t do any kidnapping there, in full view of all the houses round the
bay!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
guess it was only a dream, Anne,’ said Berta. ‘I guess you heard the thunder in
your sleep and it turned into the sound of a motor-boat chugging - dreams do
that sort of thing. I know once I left the tap running in my basin when I went
to sleep, and I dreamed all night long I was riding over the Niagara Falls!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
laughed. Berta could be very droll at times. ‘If the boat’s ready, we’ll
certainly go over to Kirrin Island today,’ said George. ‘If any trippers are
there I’ll send Timmy after them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
will only be the rabbits,’ said Dick. ‘I wonder if there are still hundreds
there - my word, last time we went they were so tame that we nearly fell over
them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- but we didn’t have Timmy with us,’ said Anne. ‘George, it will be nice to go
to Kirrin Island again. We’ll have to tell Lesley about the adventures we’ve
had there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
washed up after breakfast, made the beds and did their rooms. Joan put her head
round Julian’s bedroom door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Will
you want a packed lunch for a picnic again, Master Julian?’ she said. ‘If you
don’t, I can get you a nice bit of cold ham for lunch. The grocer’s just rung
up.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
the boat’s mended, we’re going over to the island, Joan,’ said Julian. ‘And
then we’d like a packed lunch. But if we don’t go, we’ll stay for lunch. It
will be easier for you in a way, won’t it? We all got up so late this morning
that there’s not much time to make sandwiches and pick fruit and so on.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you tell me, as soon as you know about the boat,’ said Joan, and disappeared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
came in. ‘I’m going to see if the boat is mended,’ she said. ‘I’ll only be gone
a minute. Joan wants to know.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
was back almost at once. ‘It’s not ready,’ she said, disappointed. ‘But it will
be ready at two o’clock this afternoon. So we’ll have lunch here, shall we, and
then go over to the island afterwards. We’ll pack up a picnic tea.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Julian. ‘I vote we bathe from the beach this morning, then. The tide will
be nice and high and we can have some fun with the big breakers.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
also keep an eye on James to see that he keeps his word about the boat,’ said
Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So,
when all their jobs were finished - and they were very conscientious about them
- the five children and the two dogs went off down to the beach. It was a
little cooler after the thunder, but not much, and they were quite warm enough
in their swim-suits, with a blazer to wear after a bathe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
nothing nicer than to feel hot and go into the sea and get cool, and then come
out and get hot in the sun again, and then go back into the sea,’ began Berta.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
say that every single day!’ said George. ‘It’s like a gramophone record! Still,
I must say that I agree with you! Come on - let’s have a jolly good swim!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all plunged through the big, curling breakers, squealing as the water dashed
over their bodies, cold and stinging. They chased one another, swam under water
and grabbed at the legs swimming there, floated on their backs, and wished they
hadn’t forgotten to bring the big red rubber ball with them. But nobody wanted
to go and fetch it so they had to do without it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
and Sally raced about in the shallow waves at the edge of the sea. Timmy was a
fine swimmer, but Sally didn’t much like the water, so they always played
together at the edge. They really were most amusing to watch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
dogs were glad when the children came panting out of the water. They lay down
on the warm beach and Timmy flopped down beside George. She pushed him away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
smell of seaweed,’ she said. ‘Pooh!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
a while Dick sat up to pull on his blazer. He gazed over the bay to where
Kirrin Island lay basking in the sun and gave a sudden exclamation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say! Look, all of you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
sat up. ‘There’s someone on Kirrin Island, though we can’t see them,’ said
Dick. ‘Someone lying down, looking through binoculars at our beach. Can you see
the sun glittering on the glasses?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes!’
said Julian. ‘You’re right! Someone must be using binoculars to examine this
beach. We can’t see them as you say - but it’s easy enough to see the sunlight
glinting on the glasses. Gosh, what cheek!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Cheek!’
said George, her face crimson with rage. ‘It’s a lot more than cheek! How dare
people go on my island and use it to spy on people on the beach? Let’s spy on
them! Let’s get our own field-glasses and look through them. We’ll see who it
is, then!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
get them,’ said Dick and ran off to Kirrin Cottage. He felt worried. It seemed
a strange thing to do - to spy on people sitting on the beach round the bay, using
binoculars on Kirrin Island. What was the reason?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
came back with the binoculars, and handed them to Julian. ‘I think they’ve gone
now, whoever it was,’ said Julian. ‘I don’t mean gone off the island, but gone
somewhere else on it. We can’t see the glint of the sun on their glasses any
more.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
buck up and see if you can spy anyone through our glasses,’ said George,
impatiently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
adjusted them, and gazed through them earnestly. The island seemed very near
indeed when seen through the powerful glasses. Everyone watched him anxiously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘See
anyone?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
a soul,’ said Julian, disappointed. He handed the glasses to the impatient
George, who put them to her eyes at once. ‘Blow!’ she said. ‘There’s not a
thing to be seen, not a thing. Whoever it was has gone into hiding somewhere.
If it’s trippers having a picnic there I’ll be absolutely furious. If we see
smoke rising we’ll know it is trippers!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
no smoke arose. Dick had a turn at looking through the glasses, and he looked
puzzled. He took them down from his eyes and turned to the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
ought to be able to see the rabbits running about,’ he said. ‘But I can’t see a
single one. Did either of you, Julian and George?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- now I come to think of it - no, I didn’t,’ said Julian, and George said the
same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
were frightened by whoever was there, of course,’ said Dick. ‘I suppose it will
he all right to take Lesley with us when we go to the island this afternoon? I
mean - it’s just a bit queer that anyone should be using the island to spy
from.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I see what you mean,’ said Julian. ‘If it occurred to the kidnappers, whoever
they are, that Berta might be down here with us, it would be quite a good idea
on their part to land on the island and use it as a place from which to spy on
the beach. They would guess we would come down to bathe every day.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
And they would see five children instead of four and would begin to make
inquiries about the fifth!’ said Dick. ‘They would hope actually to see Berta
on the beach - they’ve probably got a photograph of her - and they would be
looking for a girl with long wavy hair.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
there isn’t one!’ said Anne. ‘Mine’s not wavy and it’s not right down to my
shoulders as Lesley’s was. How muddled they would be!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
one thing that would tell them that Berta was here though,’ said Julian,
suddenly. He pointed to Sally.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
gracious, yes!’ said Dick. ‘Sally would give the game away all right! Whew!
We’ll have to think about all this!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
wanted to get her boat and go across to the island immediately. She was so
furious at the thought of anyone else being there without permission that all
she wanted to do was to chase them away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Julian said no. ‘For one thing the boat won’t be ready till two,’ he said. ‘For
another thing we’ve got to consider whether it’s a sensible thing to do, to go
to the island if possible kidnappers are here, on the lookout for Berta -
Lesley, I mean.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
could go without her,’ said George. ‘We could leave her safely with Joan.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
would be a foolish thing to do,’ said Dick. ‘Anyone watching us coming across
in the boat would see that one of the five was missing, and would guess at once
it was Berta. If we go, all of us must go.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Actually
I think it might be a good thing to go,’ said Julian. ‘Carry the war right into
the enemy’s camp, so to speak - if there are enemies! It would be a most useful
thing if we could see what they are like and give a description to the police.
I rather vote we go.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes!’ said Dick. ‘Anyway, we’ll have Tim with us. He can deal with any bad
behaviour on the part of the intruders!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t really think it’s anybody but trippers,’ said Julian. ‘I think we’re
making too much of the whole thing just because someone gazed at the beach
through glasses!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Remember
that I think I saw a light on the island last night,’ Anne reminded him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
I’d forgotten that,’ said Julian, looking at his watch. ‘It’s almost
lunch-time. Let’s go and have something to eat, and then fetch the boat. James
is working on it now. We’ll give him a shout to see if it will be ready at
two.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>James
was hailed, and he shouted back. ‘Yes, sir! Be ready sharp at two o’clock, if
you want her. I’ve done one or two little jobs on her besides the rowlock.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
good,’ said Dick, and they walked back to Kirrin Cottage. ‘Well - we’ll soon
find out who’s on your island, George - and if they are obstinate about
leaving, we’ll have a little fun with Timmy! He can round them up all right,
can’t you, Tim!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
could Sally,’ said Berta. ‘Sally’s teeth aren’t very big, but they’re sharp.
She once went for a man who accidentally pushed into me, and you should have
seen the nips she gave him, all down his leg!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
Sally would come in useful,’ said Dick. George looked rather scornful. ‘That
silly little poodle!’ she thought. ‘A fat lot of good she would be! Timmy’s
worth a hundred of her!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Joan
had a fine lunch ready for them - ham and salad and new potatoes piled high in
a big dish. There were firm red tomatoes from the greenhouse, and lettuces with
enormous yellow-green hearts, crisp radishes, and a whole cucumber ready for
anyone to cut as they liked. Slices of hard-boiled egg were mixed in with the
salad, and Joan had put in tiny boiled carrots and peas as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
a salad!’ said Dick. ‘Fit for a king!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
big enough for several kings!’ said Anne. ‘How many potatoes, Ju? Small or
large ones?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
looked at the piled-up dish. ‘Ha - I can really go for these potatoes!’ he
said. ‘I’ll have three large and four small.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
for pudding?’ asked Berta. ‘I like this kind of salad so much that I might not
have room for a stodgy sort of pudding.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
fresh raspberries from the garden, sugar and home-made ice-cream,’ said Joan.
‘I didn’t think you’d want a hot pudding. My sister came to see me this
morning, so I got her to pick the raspberries for me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can’t think of a nicer meal than this,’ said Berta, helping herself to the
salad. ‘I really can’t. I like your meals better than the ones we have at home
in America.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
turn you into a proper little English boy before you know where you are!’ said
Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
told Joan about what they had seen that morning on the island. She took a grave
view of it at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
you know what your aunt said, Master Julian,’ she said. ‘The police have got to
have a report of anything suspicious. You’d better ring them up.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
will when we’ve been over to the island and back,’ said Julian. ‘I don’t want
to look an ass, Joan. If it’s only harmless trippers who don’t know any better
there’s no need to bother the police. I promise to ring the police if we find
anything suspicious.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think you ought to ring them now,’ said Joan. ‘And what’s more I don’t think
you ought to go over to the island if you’re suspicious of the people there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
have Timmy with us,’ said Dick. ‘Don’t worry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
Sally too,’ added Berta at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Joan
said no more, but went out to get the raspberries and ice-cream, looking
worried. She brought in an enormous glass dish of fresh red raspberries and
another dish of creamy-looking ice-cream blocks from the refrigerator.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
sigh of admiration went up from everyone. ‘Who could want anything better?’
said Dick. ‘And that ice-cream - how do you get it like that, Joan - not too
frozen and not too melty? Just how I like it. I do hope some American doesn’t
get hold of you and whisk you away across the ocean - you’re worth your weight
in gold!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Joan
laughed. ‘You say such extravagant things, Master Dick - and all because of an
ordinary dish like raspberries and ice-cream. Get along with you! Master Lesley
will tell you there’s nothing clever about raspberries and cream.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
agree with every word the others say,’ said Berta fervently. ‘You’re wunnerful,
you’re a honey, you’re...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Joan had run out of the room, laughing, very pleased. She didn’t mind what she
did for children like these!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
they had finished lunch, they went down to the beach. James was still with the
boat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She’s
finished!’ he called. ‘You going out in her now? I’ll give you a hand down with
her, then.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
all five children and the dogs as well were in George’s boat. The boys took the
oars and began to pull hard towards the island. Timmy stood at the prow as he
loved to do, fore-paws on the edge of the boat, looking out across the water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
fancies himself as a figure-head,’ said Dick. ‘Ah, here comes Sally - she wants
to be one too. Mind you don’t fall overboard, Sally, and get your pretty feet
wet. You’ll have to learn to swim if you do!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sally
stood close beside Timmy, and both dogs looked eagerly towards the island -
Timmy because he knew there were hundreds of rabbits there, and Sally because
for her it was still quite an adventure to go out in a boat like this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta,
too, gazed eagerly at the little island as they drew near. She had heard so
many tales about it now! She looked especially at the old castle rising up from
it. It was in ruins, and Berta thought it must be very old indeed. Like all
Americans, she loved old buildings and old customs. How lucky George was to own
an island like this!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Rocks
guarded the island, and the sea ran strongly over them, sending up spray and
foam.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘However
are we going to get safely to the shore of the island?’ said Berta, rather
alarmed at the array of fierce-looking rocks that guarded it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
a little cove we always use,’ said George. She was at the tiller, and she
steered the boat cleverly in and out of the rocks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
rounded a low wall of very sharp rocks and Berta suddenly saw the little cove.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
- is that the cove you mean?’ she said. ‘Why, it’s like a little harbour going
right up to that stretch of sand!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a smooth inlet of water running between rocks, making a natural little
harbour, as Berta said. The boat slid smoothly into the inlet and up to the
beach of sand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
leapt out and pulled it up the shore. ‘She’s safe here,’ he told Berta.
‘Welcome to Kirrin Island!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
laughed. She felt very happy. What a truly wonderful place to come to!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
led the way up the sandy beach to the rocks behind, and they climbed over them.
They stopped at the top, and Berta exclaimed in amazement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Rabbits!
Thousands of them! Simply thousands. My, my, I never saw such tame ones in my
life. Will they let me pick them up?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said George. ‘They’re not as tame as that! They’ll run away when we go near -
but they will probably not go into their holes. They know us - we’ve so often
been here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sally
the poodle was amazed at the rabbits. She couldn’t believe her eyes. She stood
close beside Berta, staring at the scuttling rabbits, her nose twitching as she
tried to get their smell. She simply couldn’t understand why Timmy didn’t run
at them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
stood quite still beside George, his tail down, looking very mournful. A visit
to Kirrin Island was not such a pleasure to him as to the children, because he
wasn’t allowed to hunt the rabbits. What a waste of rabbits!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Poor
old Tim! Look at him!’ said Julian. ‘He looks the picture of misery. Look at
Sally, too - she’s longing to go after the rabbits, but she doesn’t think it’s
good manners to chase them till Timmy does!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Good
manners or not, little Sally could bear it no longer! She suddenly made a dart
at a rabbit who had come temptingly near, and it leapt into the air in fright.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sally!’
called George, in a most peremptory manner. ‘NO! You’re not to chase my
rabbits! Tim - go and fetch her here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
went off to Sally and gave a tiny little growl. Sally looked at him in
amazement. Could her friend Timmy really be growling at her? Timmy began to
push himself against her and she found herself shep-herded over to George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
dog, Timmy,’ said George, pleased to have shown everyone how obedient he was.
‘Sally, you mustn’t chase these rabbits, because they are too tame! They
haven’t learnt to run away properly yet, because not many people come here and
frighten them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Whoever
was here this morning scared them all right,’ said Julian, remembering. ‘Gosh,
don’t let’s forget there may be people here. Well - I can’t see anyone so far!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went cautiously forward, towards the old castle. Timmy running ahead. Then
Julian stopped and pointed to the ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Cigarette
ends - look! Fresh ones, too. There are people here, that’s certain. Walk ahead
of us, Tim.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
at that moment there came the sound that Anne had heard the night before - the
sound of a motor-boat’s engine. R-r-r-r-r-r-r-r!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’re
escaping!’ cried Dick. ‘Quick, run to the other side of the island! We may see
them then!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Twelve<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>VERY
SUSPICIOUS<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children, with the two dogs barking excitedly, ran to the other, seaward side
of the island. Great rocks lay out there, and the sea splashed over them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
it is - a motor-boat!’ cried Dick. They all stood and watched the boat riding
over the sea at a very fast speed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
are the glasses - did we bring them with us?’ said Julian. ‘I’d like to focus
them on the boat and see if I can read the name - or even see the men in it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the glasses had been left behind at Kirrin Cottage - what a pity!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
must have anchored their motor-boat out there, and somehow clambered inshore
over the rocks,’ said George. ‘It’s a dangerous thing to do if you don’t know
the best way.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- and if they came last night, as I think they must have done, because I’m sure
now it was the engine of the motor-boat that I heard,’ said Anne, ‘if they came
last night, they must have clambered to the shore in the dark. I wonder they
managed it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
must have been the light of a lantern or a torch you saw on the island in the
night,’ said Julian. ‘They probably didn’t want to be seen arriving on the
island, and that’s why they went to the other side, the seaward side. I wonder
if they were men spying to find out if Berta is with us or not.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
snoop around a bit more and see if we can find anything else,’ said Anne. ‘The
motor-boat is almost out of sight now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went back to the other side of the island. Berta looked with awe at the old
ruined castle in the middle. Jackdaws circled round a tower, calling loudly.
‘Chack-chack-chack!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Once
upon a time my castle had strong walls all round it,’ said George. ‘And there
were two great towers. One’s almost in ruins, as you can see, but the other is
fairly good. Come right into the castle.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
followed the others in, struck dumb with awe. To think that this island, and
this wonderful old ruined castle, belonged to George! How very, very lucky she
was!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
went through a great doorway, and found herself in a dark room, with stone
walls enclosing it. Two narrow, slit-like windows brought in all the light there
was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
strange and old and mysterious,’ said Berta, half to herself. ‘It’s asleep and
dreaming of the old days when people lived here. It doesn’t like us being
here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wake
up!’ said Dick. ‘You look quite dopey!’ Berta shook herself and looked round
again. Then she went on through the castle and looked at other rooms, some
without roofs, some without one or two of their walls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
a honey of a castle!’ she said to George. ‘A real honey. Wunnerful. WonDERful.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
wandered all round, showing the awe-struck Berta everything. ‘We’ll show you
the dungeons too,’ said George, very pleased to be impressing Berta so much.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dungeons!
You’ve got dungeons too - oh, of course, you told me about them,’ said Berta.
‘Dungeons! You don’t say! My my, I’ll never forget this afternoon.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
they walked over the old courtyard Timmy suddenly growled and stood still, his
tail down, the hackles on his neck rising. Everyone automatically stood still
too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
is it, Tim? asked George, in a whisper. Timmy’s nose was pointing towards the
little harbour where they had left their boat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
must be someone there,’ said Dick. ‘Don’t say they’re going off with our boat!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
gave a scream. Her boat! Her precious boat! She set off at top speed with Timmy
bounding in front.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
back, George - there may be danger!’ shouted Julian, but George didn’t listen.
She ran over the rocks that led down to the little harbour-beach, and then
stopped still in surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Two
policemen were walking up the sandy beach! Their boat was drawn up beside
George’s. They saluted her and grinned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Afternoon,
Miss George!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
are you doing on my island?’ demanded George, recognising them. ‘Why have you
come here?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Someone
reported suspicious people on the island,’ said the first policeman.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who
did?’ said George. ‘Nobody knew about it but us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
bet I know who reported it,’ said Dick suddenly. ‘Joan did! She didn’t like us
going off by ourselves; she said we ought to telephone the police.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
right,’ said the policeman. ‘So we came to see for ourselves. Found anyone?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
took command then, and related how they had first seen the cigarette ends, and
then heard the motor-boat starting up, and had gone to see it roaring away from
the island.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah,’
said both policemen, profoundly. ‘Ah!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
do you mean - “AH”?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Fred
here heard a motor-boat somewhere in the bay in the night,’ said the first man.
‘What was it doing there, I’d like to know?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
would we,’ said Julian. ‘We saw someone on the island looking through
binoculars at the beach this morning.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
brought forth two more ‘Ahs’, and the policemen exchanged glances.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
thing you’ve got a couple of dogs with you,’ said the one called Fred. ‘Well -
we’ll just have a bit of a look round, and then we’ll go back on our beats
again. And mind you ring us up next time anything turns up, Miss George, see?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Off
they went together, looking closely at the ground. They found the cigarette
ends and picked them up. Then on they went again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
go back,’ said George, in a low voice. ‘It spoils things if other people are on
the island. I don’t want to have a picnic here now. We’ll go off in the boat
somewhere and have a picnic tea in a cove.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
they dragged the boat down to the water and jumped in. Sally was very pleased
to be back in the boat and ran from end to end wagging her stiff little tail in
delight. Timmy followed her up and down and got in everyone’s way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
can I row if you keep on jumping over me, Timmy?’ complained Dick. ‘Sally,
you’re just as bad. Berta, are you all right? You look a bit green?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
only excitement and the bumpy bit past the rocks,’ said Berta, anxious not to
appear seasick in front of the others. ‘I’ll be all right as soon as we get on
to calm waters.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
she wasn’t, so it was regretfully decided that they must row to the shore. They
had a lazy tea on the beach, and Berta recovered enough to join in heartily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Anyone
got room for an ice-cream?’ asked Anne. ‘Because if so I’ll stroll down to the
shops and get some. I want to buy a new pair of shoe-laces too. One of mine
broke this morning.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
appeared to have room for an ice-cream, so Anne set off with Sally, who wanted
to come with her. She went to the draper’s and got the laces, and then went to
the tea-shop that sold ices.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Seven,
please,’ she said. The girl in the shop smiled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Seven!
You used to ask for five.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
I know. But we’ve got someone staying with us - and another dog,’ explained
Anne. ‘And both dogs like ice-creams.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
reminds me - someone was in my shop yesterday asking about your uncle,’ said
the girl. ‘He said he knew him. He wanted to know how many children were
staying at Kirrin Cottage, and I thought only the four of you were there - and
Timmy, of course. He seemed surprised, and said, surely there was another
girl?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
gracious!’ said Anne, startled. ‘Did he really? How inquisitive! What did you
say then?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
just said there were two boys and a girl, and a girl who liked to dress as a
boy,’ said the girl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
was glad to think the shop-girl hadn’t known about Berta. ‘What was the man
like?’ she asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Quite
ordinary,’ said the girl, trying to remember. ‘He wore dark glasses like so
many visitors do in the bright sun. I noticed he had a large gold ring on his
finger when he paid my bill. That’s all I can remember.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
if anyone else asks you about us, just say we’ve got a friend staying with us
called Lesley,’ said Anne. ‘Good-bye.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
went off at top speed, anxious to tell the others. The man in the tea-shop must
have been one of those who had gone to the island to watch the beach - he might
have been staring at the five of them as they had played together. He must be
one of the men now in the motor-boat. Anne didn’t like it, and it made her feel
very uneasy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
told the others what the shop girl had said as they sat in the sand and ate
their ice-creams. Timmy gobbled his almost at once, and sat patiently watching
for Sally to deal with hers, hoping that she would leave some.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
the four listened intently to Anne’s little story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
settles it,’ said Dick. ‘Those men are certainly snooping round trying to find
out if Lesley is here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
are getting uncomfortably close,’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Still,
your uncle and aunt come back tomorrow,’ said Berta. ‘We’ll tell them, and maybe
they’ll have some good plan.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hope those men don’t know that they are away,’ said Dick, uneasily. ‘I think
we’ll have to keep a pretty close watch from now on. I wonder if Berta ought to
stay on here with us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘See
what Father says tomorrow,’ said George. So it was decided that nothing should
be done except to keep a sharp look-out until George’s parents came back. They
all went back rather soberly to Kirrin Cottage and told Joan what had happened
on the island.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
telephoned to the police, Joan!’ said Dick, shaking his finger at her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
did. And I was right to,’ said Joan. ‘And what’s more Master Lesley’s bed is
going to be moved away from the window tonight and the window’s going to be
fastened even if we melt, and the door will be locked.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
lend you Timmy, too, if you like,’ said George ‘He can sleep in the room with
Sally. You ought to be safe then!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
really only meant it as a joke, but to her surprise Joan accepted at once.
‘Thank you, Miss,’ she said. ‘I’d be glad of Timmy. I feel all of a dither,
left on my own like this, and kidnappers closing in on us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
laughed. ‘Oh, it’s not so bad as that, Joan! Only one more night and Uncle
Quentin and Aunt Fanny will be back.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
- I quite forgot to tell you,’ said Joan. ‘Look, there’s a telegram come.
They’re staying away a whole week! That’s why I feel so scared. A week - well a
lot can happen in a week!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
HORRID SHOCK<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was not very happy to hear that his aunt and uncle were staying away for a week.
He picked up the telegram. It was addressed to George, but Joan had opened it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
returning for a week,’ it said. ‘Complications have arisen, Hope all goes well.
Love from Mother.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no address. How annoying! Now Julian couldn’t even let them know that he
was feeling uneasy. He made up his mind to guard Berta every minute! Thank
goodness they had Timmy. Nobody would dare to do any kidnapping under Timmy’s
eye!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
thought it was a good idea to put Timmy in Joan’s room that night with Berta. In
fact, if George would agree, it would be best to do that each night. He thought
it would not be wise to ask George now, though, because he could see that she
was half sorry she had made the offer to Joan!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was quite fussy that evening. He insisted on the blinds being drawn when they
sat down to play cards after their supper. He would not let Berta take Sally
out for a run, but took her himself, watching for any strange person as he went
down the lane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
making me feel quite scared!’ said Anne with a laugh. ‘Oh Ju, it’s so hot in
this room. Do, do let’s have the blind up for a few minutes and let some air
in. I shall begin to sizzle if we don’t. Timmy would soon growl if there was
anyone outside.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right,’ said Julian and drew up the blind. It was dark outside now, and the
light streamed out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
better,’ said Anne, mopping her wet forehead. ‘Now, whose turn is it? Yours,
George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
sat round the table, playing. Julian and Berta sat side by side, as Julian was
helping her in a new game of cards. She looked exactly like a very earnest
little boy, with her straight close-cut fair hair. George sat opposite the
window with Dick on one side of her and Anne on the other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Your
turn, Dick,’ said George. ‘Do buck up, you’re slow tonight.’ She sat and
waited, looking out of the window into the darkness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
suddenly she slammed down her cards and leapt up, shouting. Everyone jumped
almost out of their skins.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
is it, what is it, George?’ cried Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Out
there - look - a face! I saw a face peeping in at us - the light of the window
just caught it! Timmy, Timmy! Quick, go after him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timmy wasn’t there! Nor was Sally. George called frantically again. ‘TIMMY!
Come here, quickly. Oh, blow him, that fellow will get away. TIM!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
came bounding up the hall and into the sitting-room, barking. Sally followed
behind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
were you! Fathead!’ cried George furiously. ‘Jump out of the window - go on -
chase him, find him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
leapt out of the window and Sally tried to do the same, but couldn’t. She
barked and yelped, trying again and again to jump out. Joan came running in,
panic-stricken, wondering what was happening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Listen,’
said Julian, suddenly. ‘Shut up, Sally, Listen!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were all suddenly quiet, Sally too. There was the sound of a car being revved
up down the lane, and then the sound died down as the car sped away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
got away, whoever he was,’ said Dick, and sat down suddenly. ‘Gosh, I feel as
if I’d been running a mile. You nearly scared the life out of me when you
slammed down your cards like that, George, and yelled in my ear.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
leapt in at the window at that moment and Dick almost jumped out of his skin
again. So did everyone else, including Sally, who fled behind the sofa in
panic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
all this about?’ said Joan, quite fiercely. ‘Really!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was in a tearing rage - with Timmy of all things! She shouted at the surprised
dog and he put his tail down at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
were you? Why did you slink out of the room into the kitchen? How dare you
leave me and go off like that? Just when we needed you! I’m ashamed of you,
Timmy - you could have caught that fellow easily!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
don’t,’ said Berta, almost in tears. ‘Poor Timmy! Don’t George!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
George turned on Berta. ‘You just let me scold my own dog if he needs it! And
you go and scold yours too. I bet Timmy followed your horrid little woolly pet
out into the kitchen - it was her fault, not his!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shut
up, George,’ said Julian. ‘Your temper gets us nowhere. Calm down and let’s
hear what you saw. CALM DOWN, I say.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
stared at him, about to retort with something defiant. Then Timmy gave a small
whimper - his heart was almost broken to hear George - George, his beloved
mistress - rave at him in such anger. He had no idea what he had done to displease
her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
whimper brought George to her senses. ‘Oh Timmy!’ she said, and knelt down and
flung her arms round his neck. ‘I didn’t mean to shout at you. I was so angry
because we missed our chance of getting that man who was peeping in at us. Oh
Timmy, it’s all right, it really is.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was extremely glad to hear it. He licked George lavishly, and then lay down by
her very soberly. He wished he knew what all the excitement was about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
did Joan. She thumped on the table to get everyone’s attention, and at last got
Julian to explain everything to her. She stared out of the window,
half-thinking that she could see faces in the darkness outside. She drew the
blind down sharply.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
go to bed,’ she said. ‘All of us. I don’t like this. I shall ring up the police
and warn them. Master Lesley, you come with me straightaway now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think perhaps you’re right, Joan,’ said Julian. ‘I’ll lock up everywhere. Come
on, girls.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was astonished and upset to find himself handed over to Joan and Berta. Was George
still cross with him then? It was a very, very long time since he had slept
away from her at night. He cheered up a little when he saw that Sally was going
to be with him, and trotted rather mournfully up the attic stairs to Joan’s
room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Joan
soon got Berta into bed, and then undressed herself. She fastened the window
and locked the door. She gave Timmy a rug in a corner, and Sally jumped up on
Berta’s bed as usual.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
we ought to be quite safe!’ said Joan, and settled creakingly into her bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
the floor below the two boys followed the same procedure, and so did Anne and
George. Doors were locked and windows fastened, though it was a hot night and
they were all sure they would be melted by the morning. George couldn’t bear to
think of Timmy with Berta and Joan - especially as she had been so very cross
with him. She lay in bed, full of remorse. Dear, kind, faithful Timmy - how
could she have shouted at him like that?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
you suppose Timmy is feeling very upset?’ she said, when she and Anne were in
bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
bit, perhaps,’ said Anne. ‘But dogs are very forgiving.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
know. That somehow makes it worse,’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you really shouldn’t get into such tempers,’ said Anne, seizing the opportunity
to tell George a few home truths. ‘I thought you were getting over the tantrums
you used to have. But these hols you’ve been pretty bad. Because of Berta, I
suppose.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wish I could go up and say good night to Timmy,’ George began again, after a
few minutes’ silence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
for goodness’ sake George!’ said Anne, sleepily. ‘Do be sensible. You can’t go
and bang on Joan’s door and ask for Timmy - you’d scare them to death!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
fell asleep, but George didn’t. Then suddenly she heard the sound of a door
being unlocked, and sat up. It sounded as if it came from the attic. Was it
Joan unlocking her door? What did she want?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
cautious little knock came at George’s door. ‘Who is it?’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Me.
Joan,’ said Joan’s voice. ‘I’ve brought Sally down, Miss George. Timmy keeps
trying to get up on Miss Berta’s bed to be with Sally, and she simply can’t go
to sleep, her camp-bed is too small to hold all three of them. So will you have
Sally, please?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
blow!’ said George, and went to open her door. ‘How’s Timmy?’ she said, in a
low voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right,’ said Joan. ‘He’ll be annoyed I’ve taken Sally away. I’m glad to have
him up here tonight with all these goings on!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
he - is he happy, Joan?’ asked George, but Joan had turned away and didn’t
hear. George sighed. Why had she offered to let Joan and Berta have Timmy
tonight of all nights, when she had scolded him so unfairly? Now she had got to
have this silly little Sally instead!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sally
whimpered. She didn’t like being away from Berta, and she was not fond of
George. She wriggled out of George’s arms and ran round the room, still
whimpering.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
woke up with a jump. ‘Whatever’s going on?’ she said. ‘Why - it’s Sally in the
room! How did she get here?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
told her, sounding very cross. ‘Well, I hope she’ll settle down,’ said Anne. ‘I
don’t want her to whimper and run round the bedroom all night long.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Sally wouldn’t settle down. Her whimpering became louder, and when she took a
flying jump on to George’s bed and landed right on George’s middle, the girl
had had enough of it. She sat up and spoke in a fierce whisper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
little idiot! I’m jolly well going to take you downstairs and put you into
Timmy’s kennel!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
idea,’ said Anne, sleepily. George picked up the lively little poodle and went
out of the room, shutting the door softly. Anne promptly went to sleep again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
crept down the stairs and went to the garden door. She undid it and walked out
in dressing-gown and pyjamas, her curly hair all tousled, carrying the
whimpering little dog.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly
she felt Sally stiffen in her arms, and growl. Grrrrrrr! George stood quite
still. What had Sally heard?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
things happened very suddenly indeed. A torch was flashed in her face, and
before she could cry out, a cloth was thrown over her head so that she could
not make a sound.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
is the one!’ said a low voice. ‘The one with curly hair! And this is her dog,
the poodle. Put him in that kennel, quick, before he barks the place down.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sally,
too scared even to growl, was pushed into the kennel and the door shut on her.
George, struggling and trying vainly to call out, was lifted off her feet and
carried swiftly down to the front gate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
garden door swung creaking to and fro in the night wind. Sally whimpered in her
kennel. But no one heard either door or dog. Everyone in Kirrin Cottage was
sound asleep!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Next
morning, about half past seven, Joan went downstairs as usual. Berta was awake
and decided to fetch Sally from George’s bedroom. She put on her dressing-gown
and padded downstairs with Timmy behind her, to George’s room on the floor
below. The door was shut, and she knocked gently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
in,’ said Anne’s sleepy voice. ‘Oh, it’s you, Berta.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I’ve come for Sally,’ said Berta. ‘Hallo - where’s George?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
looked at the empty bed beside hers. ‘I don’t know. The last thing I heard of
her was in the middle of the night when we got cross because Sally wouldn’t
settle down, and George said she would take her down to the kennel.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh.
Well, probably George has gone down to fetch her back,’ said Berta. ‘I’ll go up
and dress. It’s a heavenly morning again. Are you going to bathe before
breakfast, because if so I’ll just put on my swim-suit.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I think we might today - we’re nice and early,’ said Anne, scrambling out of
bed. ‘Go and wake the boys. Timmy, go down and find George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
and Julian were awake, and quite ready for a before-breakfast bathe. Anne
joined them as they went downstairs. Berta had already gone down and had
discovered Sally in the kennel, most excited to see her. She pranced round
barking happily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
came up to the children, looking puzzled. He had hunted everywhere for George
and hadn’t found her. ‘Woof,’ he said to Anne. ‘Woof, woof!’ It was just as if
he were saying, ‘Please, where is George?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Haven’t
you found George yet?’ said Anne in surprise. She called to Joan. ‘Joan,
where’s George? Has she gone down to bathe already?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
haven’t seen her,’ said Joan. ‘But I expect she has because the garden-door was
open when I came down, and I guessed one of you had gone for an early bathe.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
George must be down on the beach, then,’ said Anne, feeling rather puzzled. Why
hadn’t George wakened her and told her to come too?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
all four were on the beach with the two dogs, Sally very happy to be with Berta
again, and Timmy very downcast and puzzled, He stood staring up the beach and
down, looking quite lost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can’t see George anywhere,’ said Dick, suddenly feeling scared. ‘She’s not in
the sea.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all gazed over the water, but no one was bathing that morning. Anne turned to
Julian in sudden panic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ju!
Where is she?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wish I knew,’ said Julian, anxiously. ‘She’s not here. And she hasn’t gone out
in her boat - it’s over there. Let’s go back to the house.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t think George would have gone for an early bathe without telling me,’ said
Anne. ‘And I also think I would surely have woken up just for a moment when she
came back after taking Sally down - oh Julian, I think something happened when
she went downstairs with Sally late last night!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
been thinking that too,’ said Julian soberly. ‘We know that there was someone
about last night, because George saw a face outside the window. Let’s go back
to the house and see if we can spot anything to help us near the garden door or
the kennel.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went back, looking very anxious. As soon as they began to look about near the
kennel, Anne gave an exclamation and bent down. She picked up something and
held it out to the others without a word.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
is it - gosh, it’s the girdle off George’s dressing-gown!’ said Dick, startled.
‘That proves it! George was caught when she came down to put Sally into her
kennel!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
must have thought she was me,’ said Berta, in tears. ‘You see - she was
carrying Sally and they know Sally belongs to me - and she has short hair too
and dresses like a boy in the daytime.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
it!’ said Julian. ‘Actually you look like a boy in your boy’s things, but
George doesn’t - and the kidnappers are looking for a girl dressed as a boy -
and George fitted the bill nicely, especially as she had the poodle with her.
She’s been kidnapped!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
will my father get the usual note to say his daughter will not be harmed if he
does what the kidnappers want, and hands over this new secret?’ said Berta.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sure
to,’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
will they say when they know they’ve got George, not me?’ asked Berta.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well...’
said Julian, considering. ‘I really don’t know. They might try the same thing
with Uncle Quentin, but of course, he hasn’t got the figures they want.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
about Berta now?’ asked Dick. ‘Once those men find they’ve got the wrong girl,
they’ll be after Berta in a trice!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George
won’t tell them,’ said Anne, at once. ‘She’ll know that Berta would be in
immediate danger if she did tell them - so she’ll say nothing as long as she
can.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Would
she really?’ said Berta, wonderingly. ‘She’s brave, isn’t she? She could get
herself set free at once if she said she wasn’t me, and proved it. Gee, she’s
wunnerful if she could do a thing like that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George
is brave all right,’ said Dick. ‘As brave as any boy could be when she’s in a
fix! Julian, let’s go and tell Joan. We’ve GOT to make up our minds what we are
going to do about this - and also, we must safeguard Berta somehow. She can’t
possibly wander round with us any more.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
all at once began to feel scared. George’s sudden disappearance had brought
home to her the very real danger she was in. She had not really believed in it
before. She looked over her shoulder and all round and about as if she expected
someone to pounce on her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
all right, Berta - there’s no one here at present!’ said Dick, comfortingly.
‘But you’d better get indoors, all the same. I don’t think George would give
away the fact that she wasn’t you, but the men might find out some other way -
and back they would come, hotfoot!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
raced indoors as if someone was chasing her! Julian shut and locked the garden
door and called Joan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had a very serious conference indeed. Joan was horrified. She wept when she
heard that George must have been kidnapped in the middle of the night. She
wiped her eyes with her apron.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
said we must lock the doors and the windows, I said we must tell the police -
and then Miss George has to go down all by herself into the garden!’ she said.
‘If only she hadn’t had the poodle with her! No wonder they thought she was
Berta, with Sally in her arms.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Listen,
Joan,’ said Julian. ‘There are a lot of things to do. First we must tell the
police. Then somehow we must contact Aunt Fanny and Uncle Quentin - it’s so
like them not to give us an address! Then we must most certainly decide about
Berta. She must be well hidden away somewhere.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
That’s certain,’ said Joan, wiping her eyes again. She sat and thought for a
minute, and then her face lightened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
know where we could hide her!’ she said. ‘You remember Jo - the little gypsy
girl you’ve had one or two adventures with?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Julian. ‘She lives with your cousin now, doesn’t she?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She
does,’ said Joan. ‘And my cousin would have Berta straightaway if she knew
about this. She lives in a quiet little village where nothing ever happens, and
nobody would think anything of my cousin having a child to stay with Jo. She
often does.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
really seems an idea,’ said Dick. ‘Doesn’t it, Julian? We’ve simply got to get
Berta away at once. We could trust Jo to look after her, too - Jo’s as sharp as
a packet of needles!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
police would know, too,’ said Julian, ‘and would keep an eye on her as well.
Joan, can you ring up and get a taxi and take Berta now, this very minute?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’ll
be a surprise for my cousin, my arriving this time of the morning,’ said Joan,
standing up and taking off her apron, ‘but she’s quick on the uptake, and
she’ll do it, I know. Master Lesley, get a few things together - nothing posh,
mind, like your silver hairbrush.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
looked extremely scared by now, and was inclined to refuse to go. Julian put
his arm round her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look,’
he said, ‘I bet George is holding her tongue so that we can get you away in
safety before the men tumble to the fact that they’ve got the wrong boy - so
you can play up, too, can’t you, and be brave?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Berta, looking up at Julian’s kind, serious face. ‘I’ll do what you say -
but what’s this Jo like? Joan said she was a little gypsy girl. I don’t like
gypsies.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’ll
like this one all right,’ said Julian. ‘She’s a pickle and a scamp and a
scallywag - but her heart’s in the right place - isn’t it, Joan?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Joan
nodded. She had always been fond of the reckless, cheeky little Jo, and it was
she who had found a home for her when Jo’s father had had to go to prison.
‘Come on, Master Lesley,’ she said. ‘We must hurry. Master Julian, is she to go
as a girl or a boy now - we’ve got to decide that too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
girl, please - please, please, a girl!’ said Berta, at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
considered. ‘Yes, I think you’re right,’ he said. ‘You’d better be a girl now -
but for goodness’ sake don’t call yourself Berta yet.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She
can be Jane,’ said Joan, firmly. ‘That’s a nice name, but quite ordinary enough
for nobody to notice. Berta is too noticeable a name. Come along, now - we’ll
have to pick out your simplest clothes!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
I’ll ring up the police,’ said Julian, ‘and also ring for a taxi.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
don’t get a taxi for us,’ said Joan. ‘I don’t want to arrive at my cousin’s
little cottage in a taxi, and make everyone stare! Jane and I will catch the
market bus and people will think I’m going off to market. We can get another
bus there, that will take us almost all the way to my cousin’s. We’ve only to
walk down the lane then.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
idea,’ said Julian, and went to the telephone. He got hold of the police
sergeant, and told his tale. The man showed not the least excitement, but took
down quickly all that Julian told him. ‘I’ll be up in ten minutes,’ he said.
‘Wait in till I come.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
put down the receiver. Dick and Anne were watching him with troubled eyes. What
was happening to George? Was she frightened - or furious - or perhaps hurt?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was absolutely miserable. He knew by now that something had happened to George.
He had gone a dozen times to the place where her dressing-gown girdle had been
found, and had sniffed round disconsolately.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sally
knew he was unhappy and trotted after him soberly. When he lay down she lay
down beside him. When he got up, she got up too. It would have been amusing to
watch if anyone had felt like being amused. But nobody felt that way!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Footsteps
came up the path. ‘The police!’ said Julian. ‘They’ve not been long!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sergeant had come and also a constable. Anne felt comforted when she saw the
big, solid, responsible-looking men. Julian took them into the sitting-room,
and began to tell all that had happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the middle of it there came the sound of footsteps racing down the stairs, and
up the hall. ‘We’re just off!’ shouted Joan’s voice. ‘Can’t stop to say
good-bye, or we shall miss the bus!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Down
the garden path rushed Joan, carrying a small suitcase of her own, which she
had lent Berta, because Berta’s was too grand. In it she had packed the very
simplest of Berta’s clothes, but secretly she had thought that she would tell
her cousin to dress Berta in some of Jo’s things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
ran behind her - a different Berta now, dressed in a frock instead of jeans and
jersey. She waved to the others as she went, trying to smile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
old Berta!’ said Dick. ‘She’s got quite a lot in her, that kid.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘In
fact, she’s quite a honey!’ said Julian, trying to make Anne smile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
all that?’ said the sergeant, in surprise, nodding his head towards the front
path, down which Joan and Berta had just rushed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
explained. The sergeant frowned. ‘You shouldn’t have arranged about that till
you’d consulted us,’ he said. Julian was quite taken aback.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you see,’ he said, ‘it seemed to me that I must get Berta out of the house and
hidden away at once in case the kidnappers realised quickly that they’d got the
wrong girl.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
so,’ said the sergeant. ‘Still, you should have consulted us. It seems quite a
good idea to put her in that quiet village, with Jo to see to her - she’s
sharp, that Jo. I wouldn’t put it past her to hoodwink the kidnappers any day!
But this is a very serious business, you realise, Master Julian - it can’t be
dealt with by children.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Can
you get George back?’ asked Anne, breaking in with the question she had been
longing to ask ever since the police came.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Maybe,’
said the sergeant. ‘Now I’ll get in touch with your aunt and uncle, Master
Julian, and with Mr Elbur Wright, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
telephone rang just then and Anne answered it. ‘It’s for you, Sergeant,’ she
said, and he took the receiver from her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ha.
Hm. Just so. Yes, yes. Right. Ha. Hm.’ The sergeant replaced the receiver and
went back to Julian and the others. ‘News has just come in that the kidnappers
have contacted Mr Elbur Wright, and told him they’ve got his daughter Berta,’
he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh!
And have they demanded that he shall tell them the secret figures he knows?’
asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sergeant nodded. ‘Yes. He’s almost off his head with shock! He’s promised to
give them all they want. Very foolish!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh
- you’d better tell him it’s not Berta they’ve got, but George,’ said Dick.
‘Then he’ll sit tight!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sergeant frowned. ‘Now, you leave this to us,’ he said, ponderously. ‘You’ll
only hinder us if you interfere or try meddling on your own. You just sit back
and take things easy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What!
With George kidnapped and in danger'?’ exploded Dick. ‘What are you going to do
to get her back?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now,
now!’ said the sergeant, annoyed. ‘She is in no danger - she’s not the person
they want. They will free her as soon as they realise that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
won’t,’ said Dick. ‘They’ll get on to her father and make him give up a few
secrets!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
that will give us a little more time to find these men,’ said the irritating
sergeant, and he stood up, big and burly in his navy blue uniform. ‘Let me know
at once if you have any other news, and please do not try to meddle. I assure
you that we know the right things to do.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went out with the constable. Julian groaned. ‘He doesn’t see that this is
urgent. It’s so complicated too - the wrong girl kidnapped, the wrong father
informed, the right one not at all inclined to give up powerful secrets - and
poor old George not knowing what is happening!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
thank goodness we got Berta out of the way,’ said Dick. ‘Anne, you look queer -
are you all right?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I think I’m just shocked - and oh dear, I feel awfully empty!’ said Anne,
pressing her tummy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh
- we forgot all about breakfast!’ said Dick staring at the clock. ‘And it’s
almost ten o’clock now! What have we been doing all this time? Come on, Anne -
get us some food, there’s a dear. We shall all feel better then.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
so sorry for poor old Timmy and little Sally,’ said Anne, going into the
kitchen. ‘Timmy, darling, don’t look at me like that! I don’t know where your
beloved George is, or I’d take you to her straight away! And Sally, you will
have to put up with me for a little while, because although I do know where
Berta is, I can’t possibly take you there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were soon sitting down to a plain breakfast of boiled eggs, toast and butter.
It seemed queer only to be three. Dick tried to make conversation, but the
other two were very quiet. Timmy sat under the table with his head on Anne’s
foot, and Sally stood beside her, paws on her knee. Anne comforted both the
mournful dogs as best she could!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
breakfast Anne went to wash up and make the beds, and the boys went outside to
have another look at the place where George’s dressing-gown girdle had been
found. Sally and Timmy came with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
sniffed around a good bit, and then, nose to ground, went down the garden path
to the front gate, and then pushed it open and went through it. Nose to ground
he went down the lane and turned off into a little path.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dick
- he’s following some kind of trail,’ said Julian. ‘I’m certain it’s George’s.
Even if somebody carried her away, Timmy is clever enough to know George might
be with him - he might just get a whiff of her.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on then - let’s follow Timmy,’ said Dick, and the boys and Sally went along the
little path, hot on Timmy’s track. Timmy began to run, and Dick called to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
so fast, old boy! We’re coming too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timmy did not slow down. Whatever it was he smelt, the scent was quite strong.
The boys ran after him, beginning to feel excited.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
soon Timmy came to a full stop, in a little clearing in the wood. Dick and
Julian panted up to where he was nosing round. He looked up at them forlornly.
Evidently the scent came to an end there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Car-tracks!’
said Dick, pointing down to where the dampish grass under a great oak tree had
been rutted with big tyre-marks. ‘See? The men brought a car here and hid it,
then crept through the woods to Kirrin Cottage, and waited for a chance to get
Berta. They got George instead - but they wouldn’t have got anyone if only
George hadn’t been ass enough to take Sally to the kennel! The house was well
and truly locked and bolted!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was looking at the wheel-tracks. ‘These tracks were made by very big tyres,’ he
said. ‘It was a car - and I rather think these are American tyre-marks. I can
check that when I get back - I’ll go and ask Jim, at the local garage - he’ll
know. I’ll just sketch one quickly.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
took out a notebook and pencil and began to sketch. Dick bent down and looked
more carefully at the tracks. ‘There is quite a lot of criss-crossing of
tracks,’ he said. ‘I think the men came here and waited. Then, when they got
George, they must have pushed her into the car, and turned it to go back the
way they came - see, the tracks lead down that wide path over there. They made
a mess of the turning, though - bumped into this tree, look - there’s a mark
right across it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where?’
said Julian at once. ‘Yes - a bright blue mark - the car was that colour - or
the wings were, at any rate. Well, that’s something we’ve learnt! A big blue
car, probably American. Surely the police could trace that?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy’s
still nosing round, the picture of misery,’ said Dick. ‘Poor old Tim. I expect
he knows George was pushed into a car just there. Hallo - he’s scraping at something!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
ran to see what it was. Timmy was trying to get at some small object embedded
in a car-rut. Evidently, in turning, the car had run over whatever it was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
saw something broken in half - something green. He picked up the halves. ‘A
comb! Did George have a little green comb like this?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
She did,’ said Julian. ‘She must have thrown it down when she got near to the
car - to show us she was taken here - hoping we would find it. And look, what’s
that?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was a handkerchief hanging on a gorse bush. Julian ran to it. It had the
initial G on it in blue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
it’s George’s,’ he said. ‘She’s got six of these, all with different-coloured
initials. She must have thrown this out too. Quick, Dick, look for anything
else she might have thrown out of the car, while they were trying to turn it.
They would probably put her in the back, and she would just have had a chance
to throw out anything she had in her dressing-gown pocket, to let us know she
was here if we came along this way.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
searched for a long time. Timmy found one more thing, again embedded in a
car-rut - a boiled sweet wrapped in cellophane paper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look!’
said Dick, picking it up. ‘One of the sweets we all had the other night! George
must have had one in her dressing-gown pocket! If only she had had a pencil and
bit of paper - she might have had time to write a note too!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
an idea!’ said Julian. ‘We’ll hunt even more carefully&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
although they searched every bit of ground and every bush, there was no note to
be found. It was too much to hope for!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
just follow the car-tracks and make sure they reached the road,’ said Julian.
So they followed them down the wide woodland path.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
the side, a little way along, a piece of paper blew in the wind, hopping an
inch or two each time the breeze flapped it. Dick picked it up - and then
looked at Julian excitedly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She
did have time to write a note! This is her writing. But there’s only one word,
look - whatever does it mean?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and Dick frowned over the piece of paper. Yes, it was George’s writing - the G
was exactly like the way she always wrote the big G at the beginning of her
signature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gringo,’
read Julian. ‘Just that one word. Gringo! What does it mean? It’s something she
heard them say, I suppose - and she just had time to write it and throw out the
paper. Gringo! Timmy, what does Gringo mean?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Sixteen<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>JO!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
and Julian went back to Kirrin Cottage with the two disconsolate dogs. They
showed Anne the things they had found, and she too puzzled over the word
Gringo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
have to tell the police what you have discovered,’ she said. ‘They might trace
the car, and they might know who or what Gringo is.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
telephone them now,’ said Julian. ‘Dick, you go down to the garage with this
sketch of the tyre-mark, and see if it’s an American design.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
police were interested but not helpful. The sergeant said he would send his
constable up to examine the place where the car had stood in the clearing, and
gave it as his opinion that the bit of paper wasn’t much use, as the boys had
found it some way from the turning-place of the car.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Your
cousin wouldn’t be able to throw it out of the window once the car was going,’
he said. ‘There would be sure to be someone in the back with her. The only
reason she could throw things out at the clearing would be because the second
fellow - and there would certainly be two - would be guiding the other man in
the turning of the car.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
wind might have blown the note along the path,’ said Julian. ‘Anyway, I’ve given
you the information.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was a very miserable day, although the sun shone down warmly, and the sea was
blue and most inviting. But nobody wanted to bathe, nobody really wanted to do
anything but talk and talk about George and what had happened, and where she
could be at that moment!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Joan
came back in time to get their lunch, and was pleased to find that Anne had
done the potatoes and prepared a salad, and that Dick had managed to pick some
raspberries. They were very glad to see Joan. She was someone sensible and
comforting and matter-of-fact.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
Miss Jane is now safely in my cousin’s cottage,’ she said. ‘She was very
miserable but I told her she must smile and play about, else the neighbours
would wonder about her. I put her into some of Jo’s clothes - they fitted her
all right. Hers are too expensive-looking, and would make people talk!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
told Joan what they had discovered in the clearing that morning. She took the
note and looked at it. ‘Gringo!’ she said. ‘That’s a queer word - sounds like a
gypsy word to me. It’s a pity Jo isn’t here - she might tell us what it means!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Did
you see Jo?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
She was out shopping,’ said Joan, lifting the lid to look at the potatoes. ‘I
only hope she gets on with Miss Jane all right. Really, it’s getting very
difficult to remember that child’s change of names!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
only fresh news that day was a worried telephone-call from Aunt Fanny. She was
shocked and amazed at the news she had heard. ‘Your uncle has collapsed!’ she
said. ‘He has been working very hard, you know, and now this news of George has
been quite the last straw. He’s very ill. I can’t leave him at the moment - but
anyway we couldn’t do anything! Only the police can help now. To think those
horrible men took George by mistake!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
worry too much, Aunt Fanny,’ said Julian. ‘We’ve hidden Berta away safely, and
I expect the men will free George as soon as she tells them she’s the wrong
girl.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
she does tell them!’ said Dick, under his breath. ‘She might not, for Berta’s
sake, for a few days at any rate!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
went miserable to bed that night. Anne took Timmy and Sally with her, for both
were so forlorn that she couldn’t bear to do anything else. Timmy wouldn’t eat
anything at all, and Anne was worried about him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
could not go to sleep. He tossed and turned, thinking about George.
Hot-tempered, courageous, impatient, independent George! He worried and worried
about her, wishing he could do something!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
small stone suddenly rattled against his window! He sat up, alert at once. Then
something fell right into the room, and rolled over the floor. Julian was at
the window in a trice. Who was throwing pebbles at his window?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
leaned out. A voice came up to him at once. ‘Is it you, Dick?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Jo!
What are you doing here?’ said Julian, startled. ‘It’s Julian speaking. Dick’s
asleep. I’ll wake him, and let you in.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
he did not need to go down and let Jo in. She was up a tree outside the window
and across some ivy and on his window-sill before he had even shaken Dick
awake!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
slid into the room. Julian switched on his light. There was Jo, sitting at the
end of Dick’s bed, the familiar cheeky grin on her face! She was very brown,
but still showed her freckles, and her hair was as short and curly as ever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
had to come,’ she said. ‘When I got home from shopping, there was this girl
Jane! She told me all about how George had been captured in mistake for her -
and when I said to her, “You go straightaway and say you’re safe and sound, and
it’s all a mistake, and George has got to be set free!” she wouldn’t! She just
wouldn’t! All she did was to sit and cry. Little coward!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
no, Jo,’ said Dick, and tried to explain everything to the indignant girl. But
he could not convince her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
I was that girl Jane I wouldn’t let someone stay kidnapped because of me,’ she
said. ‘I don’t like her, she’s silly. And I’m supposed to keep an eye on her!
Phoo! Not me! I’d like her to be kidnapped, the way she’s behaving about
George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
looked at Jo. She was very, very loyal to the Five, and proud of being their
friend. She had been in two adventures with them now, an artful little gypsy
girl, but a very loyal friend. Her father was in prison, and she was living
with a cousin of Joan’s, and, for the first time in her life, going to school to
learn lessons!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Listen,
Jo - we’ve found out a few more things since Berta - I mean Lesley - no, I
don’t, I mean Jane...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
do you mean?’ said Jo, puzzled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
mean Jane,’ said Julian. ‘We’ve found out something else since Joan parked Jane
with her cousin this morning.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Go
on, tell me,’ said Jo. ‘Have you found out where George is? I’ll go and break
in and get her out, if you do!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
Jo - it’s no use just being fierce,’ said Dick. ‘Things are not so easy as all
that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George
threw out a bit of paper with this written on it,’ said Julian, and he put it
before Jo. ‘See? Just that one word - “Gringo”. Does it mean anything to you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gringo?’
said Jo. ‘That rings a bell! Let’s see now - Gringo!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
frowned as she thought hard. Then she nodded. ‘Oh yes, I remember now. A Fair
came to the town a few weeks back - the big town not far from our village. It
was called Gringo’s Great Fair.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
did it go?’ asked Dick, eagerly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
was going to Fallenwick, then to Granton,’ said Jo. ‘I made friends with the
boy whose father owned the roundabout, and gosh, I had about a hundred free
rides.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
would!’ said both boys together, and Jo grinned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
you suppose this Gringo, who runs the Fair, could be anything to do with the
name Gringo that George wrote on this paper?’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
dunno!’ said Jo. ‘But if you like I can go and find the Fair and get hold of
Spiky - that’s the roundabout boy - and see if I can find out anything. I know
Spiky said Gringo was a real horror to work for, and thought himself as good as
a lord!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Had
he a car - a big car?’ asked Dick, suddenly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
dunno that either,’ said Jo. ‘I can find out. Here - I’ll go now! You lend me a
bike and I’ll bike to Granton?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Certainly
not,’ said Julian, startled at the idea of Jo biking the twelve miles to
Granton in the middle of the night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right,’ said Jo, rather sulkily. ‘I just thought you’d like me to help. It
might be that this Gringo has got George somewhere. He was the kind of fellow
who was a go-between, if you know what I mean.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How?’
asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
Spiky said that if anyone wanted something dirty done, this Gringo just held
out his hand, and if a wad of notes was put into it, he’d do it, and nothing
said!’ said Jo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
see,’ said Julian. ‘Hm - it sounds as if kidnapping would be right up his
street, then.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
laughed scornfully. ‘That would be nothing to him - chicken-feed. Come on,
Julian - let me have a lend of your bike.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘NO,’
said Julian. ‘Thanks very, very much, but I’m not letting anyone ride to a Fair
in the middle of the night to find out if a fellow called Gringo has anything
to do with George. I can’t believe he has, either - it’s too far-fetched.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right. But you asked me if the name meant anything to me,’ said Jo, sounding
offended. ‘Anyway, it’s a common enough nickname in the Circus world and the
Fair world too. There’s probably a thousand Gringos about!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
time you went back home,’ said Julian, looking at his watch. ‘And be decent to
Berta - I mean Jane - please, Jo. You can come over tomorrow to see if there’s
any more news. How did you get here tonight, by the way?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Walked,’
said Jo. ‘Well - ran, I mean. Not by the roads, though - they take too long. I
go like the birds do - as straight as I can, and it’s much shorter!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
had a sudden picture of the valiant little Jo speeding through woods and
fields, over hills and through valleys, as straight as a crow flying homewards.
How did she find her way like that? He knew he would never be able to!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
slipped out over the window-sill, and down the tree, as easily as a cat. ‘Bye!’
she said. ‘See you soon.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Give
our love to Jane,’ whispered Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shan’t!’
said Jo, much too loudly, and disappeared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
switched out the light. ‘Whew!’ he said, ‘I always feel as if I’ve been blown
about by a strong, fresh wind when I see Jo. What a girl! Fancy wanting to ride
all the way to Granton tonight, after running all the way here from Berta’s!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I’m jolly glad you wouldn’t let her take your bike,’ said Dick. ‘It’s a good
thing she wouldn’t dare to disobey you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
got into bed - and just at that very moment the two boys heard a loud ringing
noise. Dick sat up straightaway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
I’m blowed!’ he said. ‘The little wretch!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
up?’ said Julian, and then he too realised what the ringing was - a Bicycle
Bell. Yes, a bell rung loudly and defiantly by someone cycling swiftly along
the sea-road towards Granton!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
Jo!’ said Dick. ‘And she’s taken my bike! I know its bell. Gosh, won’t I rub
her face in the mud when I get hold of her!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
gave a loud guffaw. ‘She’s a monkey, a gallant, plucky, loyal, aggravating
monkey. What a cheek she’s got! She didn’t dare to take my bike when I’d said
no - so she took yours. Well - we can’t do a thing about it now. What that
roundabout boy is going to think when he’s awakened in the middle of the night
by Jo, I cannot imagine.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
probably used to her,’ said Dick. ‘Well, let’s go to sleep. I wonder if George
is asleep or awake? I hate to think of her a prisoner somewhere.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
bet Timmy hates it more than we do,’ said Dick, hearing a long-drawn whimper
from the next room. ‘Poor old Tim. He can’t go to sleep either!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
and Julian managed to go to sleep at last, both thinking of a speedy little
figure on a bicycle, racing through the night to ask questions of a roundabout
boy called Spiky!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
half past seven next morning Joan came running upstairs to Julian’s bedroom, a
piece of paper in her hand. She knocked on the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Master
Julian! A dirty little note was on the front door mat when I got down this
morning. It’s folded over with your name on the outside.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was out of bed in a trice. A note from the kidnappers perhaps? No - it couldn’t
be. They wouldn’t write to him!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was from Jo! She had scribbled it so badly that Julian could hardly read it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian,
I saw Spiky, he’s coming to the beech at levven I took Dick’s bike to go home
on I will bring it back at levven, don’t be too cross. Jo.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
suppose “beech” doesn’t mean a tree, it means the beach, the sands,’ said Dick.
‘And “levven” means eleven o’clock. Little scallywag - I hope she hasn’t
damaged my bike in any way.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
hadn’t. She had actually managed to find time to clean it before she left home,
and arrived with it so bright and gleaming that Dick hadn’t the heart to scold
her!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
was early so she came to the house instead of the beach. She rode through the
gate and up the front path and Timmy ran to greet her with a volley of
delighted barks. He liked Jo - in fact he really loved the little gypsy girl.
She certainly had a way with animals! Sally followed, dancing on her tiptoes as
usual, ready to welcome as a friend anyone that Timmy liked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
hailed Jo from the front door as she came up. ‘Hallo, bicycle-stealer! My word,
what’s happened to my bike - have you spring-cleaned it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
grinned, looking at Dick warily. ‘Yes. I’m sorry I took it, Dick.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
not a bit sorry - but I’ll forgive you,’ said Dick, grinning too. ‘So you got
to the Fair safely after all?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes - and I woke up Spiky - he wasn’t half surprised,’ said Jo. ‘But his Pa was
sleeping in the same caravan as he was, so I couldn’t say much. I just told him
to be on Kirrin Beach at eleven. Then I rode back home. I ought to have left
your bike on the way back, but I was a bit tired, so I rode home, instead of
walking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
can’t have had much sleep last night,’ said Julian, looking at the sunburnt
girl with her untidy curly hair. ‘Hallo - who’s that?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
short, plump boy was hurrying past the gate. He had a mop of black hair which
stuck up into curious spikes of hair at the crown.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
- that’s Spiky!’ said Jo. ‘He’s on time, isn’t he? He’s called Spiky because of
his hair. You won’t believe it, but he spends a fortune on hair-oil, trying to
make those spiky bits go flat. But they won’t.’ She called loudly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Spiky!
Hey, SPIKY!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Spiky
turned at once. He had a pleasant, rather lopsided face, and eyes as black as
currants. He stood staring at Jo and the boys. ‘I’m just off to the beach,’ he
said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right.
We’re coming too,’ said Jo, and she and the boys went to join. They met the
ice-cream man on the way and Julian bought an ice-cream for each of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Coo
- thanks,’ said Spiky, pleased. He was rather shy of Dick and Julian, and
wondered very much why he had been asked to come.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
sat down on the beach. ‘I wasn’t half scared when you came tapping at the
window last night,’ he said to Jo, licking his ice-cream with a very pink
tongue. ‘What’s it all about?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,’
said Julian, cautiously, ‘we’re interested in somebody called Gringo.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Old
Gringo?’ said Spiky. ‘A lot of people’s interested in Gringo. Do you know what
we say at the Fair? We say Gringo ought to put up a notice. “All dirty work
done here!” He’s a bad lot, Gringo is - but he pays us well, even if he makes
us work like slaves.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
owns the Fair, doesn’t he?’ said Julian, and Spiky nodded. ‘I expect he uses it
as a cover for all his other, bigger jobs,’ Julian said to Dick. He looked at
the plump, black-eyed boy, wondering how far he could trust him. Jo saw the
look and knew what it meant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
all right,’ she said, nodding towards Spiky. ‘You can say what you like. He’s
an oyster, he is. Ain’t you, Spiky?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Spiky
grinned his lop-sided grin. Julian decided to trust him, and speaking in a low
voice that really thrilled Spiky, he told him about the kidnapping of George.
Spiky’s eyes nearly fell out of his head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Coo!’
he said. ‘I bet old Gringo’s at the bottom of that. Last week he went off up to
London - he told my Pa he was on to a big job - an American job, he said it
was.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- it sounds as if it all fits,’ said Julian. ‘Spiky, this kidnapping happened
the night before last. Did anything unusual occur in the Fair camp, do you
know? It must have happened in the middle of the night.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Spiky
considered. He shook his head. ‘No - I don’t think so. Gringo’s big
double-caravan is still there - so he can’t have gone. He had it moved right
away from the camp yesterday morning - said there was too much noise for his
old Ma, who lives in his posh caravan and looks after him. We was all glad it
was moved - now he can’t spy on us so easily!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
suppose you...’ began Julian, and then stopped as Dick gave an exclamation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
got an idea!’ he said. ‘Suppose that caravan was moved for another reason -
suppose someone was making a row inside the van - someone shouting for help,
say! Gringo would have to move it away from the rest of the camp in case that
someone was heard.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a pause, and then Spiky nodded. ‘Yes. It could be,’ he said. ‘I’ve never
known Gringo move his caravan away from the camp before. Shall I do a bit of
snooping for you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Julian, excited. ‘My word - it would be a bit of luck if we could find
George so quickly - and so near us too! A Fair camp would be a fine place to
hide her, of course. Thank goodness we found that bit of paper with “Gringo”
written on it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
all go to the Fair this afternoon,’ said Dick. ‘Timmy too. He’d smell out
George at once.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hadn’t
we better tell the police first?’ said Julian. At once Spiky and Jo got up in
alarm. Spiky looked as if he were going to run away immediately!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
you get the police, Julian!’ said Jo urgently. ‘You won’t get anything more out
of Spiky, if you do. Not a thing.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
going,’ said Spiky, still looking terrified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
you’re not,’ said Dick, and caught hold of him. ‘We shan’t go to the police.
They might frighten off Gringo and make him smuggle George away at once. I’ve
no doubt he has plans to do so at any minute. We shan’t say a word, so sit down
and be sensible.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
can believe him,’ Jo told Spiky. ‘He’s straight, see?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Spiky
sat down, still looking wary. ‘If you’re coming to the Fair, come at four,’ he
said. ‘It’s half-day closing today for the towns around, and the place will be
packed. If you want to do any snooping, you won’t be noticed in that crowd.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Julian. ‘We’ll be there. Look out for us, Spiky, in case you’ve got any
news.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Spiky
then left, and the boys couldn’t help smiling at his back view - the spikes of
hair at the top of his head were so very noticeable!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’d
better stay to lunch with us, Jo,’ said Dick, and the delighted girl beamed all
over her face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Will
Joan’s cousin mind you not being back to dinner?’ asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
I said I wouldn’t be back all day,’ said Jo. ‘It’s still school holidays, you
see. Anyway, I can’t stand that Jane - she moons about all the time - and she’s
got some of my clothes on, too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
sounded so indignant about Berta that the boys had to laugh. They all went back
to Kirrin Cottage, and found Joan and Anne hard at work in the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you monkey!’ said Joan to Jo. ‘Up to tricks as usual, I hear. Throwing stones
at people’s windows in the middle of the night. You just try that on my window
and see what happens to you! Now, put on that apron, and help round a bit.
How’s Miss Jane?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Joan
was most excited to hear about the boys’ latest ideas as to where George might
be. Julian gave her a warning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
no ringing up the police behind our backs this time, Joan,’ he said. ‘This is
something best done by Dick and me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Can’t
I come with Sally?’ asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
can’t possibly take Sally,’ said Dick, ‘in case Gringo’s about and recognises
her. So you’d better stay and look after her, and we’ll take Timmy. He would be
sure to smell where George is, if she’s hidden anywhere in the camp. But I
think she’s probably in Gringo’s own caravan.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
pricked up his ears every time he heard George’s name mentioned. He was a very
miserable dog indeed, and kept running to the front gate, hoping to see George
coming along. Whenever they missed him, they knew where to find him - lying
mournfully on George’s empty bed - probably with an equally mournful Sally
beside him!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys and Jo set off to the Fair about half past three, on their bicycles. Jo
rode Anne’s this time, and Timmy ran valiantly beside them. Jo glanced at
Dick’s bicycle from time to time, proud of its brilliant look - how well she
had cleaned it that morning!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came to the Fair. ‘You can put your bikes up against Spiky’s caravan,’ said Jo.
‘They’ll be safe there. Will you pay, and then we’ll get in straightaway? You
needn’t pay for me - I’m going through the gap in the hedge. I’m Spiky’s
friend, so it’s all right.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
gave Dick her bicycle and disappeared. Julian paid and went in at the gate.
They saw Jo waving wildly to them from the side of the big field and wheeled
the three bicycles over to her, Timmy following closely at their heels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo!’
said Spiky, appearing suddenly. ‘See you soon! I’ve got to go and ’tend to the
roundabout. I’ve got a bit of news, but not much. That’s Gringo’s caravan over
there, the double-one, big van in front, little van behind.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
nodded his head to where a most magnificent caravan stood, right away from the
rest of the camp. There were people milling about all round the other vans, but
there was nobody at all by Gringo’s. Evidently no one dared to go too near.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
vote we buy a ball at one of the stands, and then go and play near Gringo’s
caravan,’ said Dick, in a low voice. ‘Then one of us will throw the ball too
hard and it will go near the van - and we’ll somehow manage to get a peep
inside. Timmy can go sniffing round while we play. If George is there he’ll
bark the place down.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Jolly
good idea!’ said Julian. ‘Come on, Jo! And keep your eyes open all the time in
case you’ve got to warn us of danger.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two boys and Jo, with Timmy at their heels, wandered round the Fair to find
somewhere to buy a ball. There seemed to be none for sale, so they had a go at
a Hoopla stall, and Julian managed to get a ring round a small red ball. Just
the thing!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was a big and noisy Fair, and hundreds of people from the near-by towns had
come on this shops’ closing day to enjoy the fun. The roundabout played its
loud, raucous music all the time, swings went to and fro, the dodgem cars
banged and bumped one another as usual, and men went round shouting their
wares.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Balloons!
Giant balloons! Three pence each!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

All flavours.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Tell
your fortune, lady? I’ll tell it true as can be!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
was very much at home in the Fair. She had been brought up in one, and knew all
the tricks of the trade. Timmy was rather amazed at the noise, and kept close
to the boys, his tail still down because he could not forget that George was
missing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
let’s play our little game of ball,’ said Julian. ‘Come on, Tim - and if we get
into any trouble, just growl and show your teeth, see?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
three of them, with Timmy, went to the clear space of field that separated the
magnificent caravan from the rest of the Camp. A man at a near-by stall called
to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hey!
You’ll get into trouble if you play there!’ But they took no notice and he
shrugged his shoulders and began to shout his wares.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
threw the ball to one another, and then Julian flung it so wildly that it ran
right up to the wheels of the front caravan of the pair. In a trice Dick and Jo
were after it. Jo leapt up on a wheel and looked in at the big window, while
Dick ran to the small van that was attached behind the big one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
quick glance assured Jo that the big caravan was empty. The interior was
furnished in a most luxurious way and looked like a very fine bed-sitting-room.
She leapt down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
peered into the window of the smaller van. At first he thought there was no one
there - and then he saw a pair of very fierce, angry eyes looking at him - the
eyes of a small, bent old woman with untidy hair. She looked rather like a
witch, Dick thought. She was sitting sewing in a bunk, and, as he looked in,
she shook her fist at him and called out something he couldn’t hear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
jumped down and joined the others. ‘No one at all in the big van,’ said Jo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Only
a witch-like old woman in the other,’ reported Dick, in deep disappointment.
‘Unless George is pushed under a bunk or squashed into a cupboard, she’s
certainly not there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy
doesn’t seem interested in the caravans at all, does he?’ said Julian. ‘I’m
sure if George really was in one of those caravans, he’d bark and try to get
inside.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- I think he would,’ said Dick. ‘Hallo, there’s somebody coming out of the
second van. It’s the old lady! She’s in a fine old temper!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
she was! She came down the steps to the van, shouting and shaking her fist at
them. ‘Tim - go and find, go and find - in that van!’ said Julian, suddenly, as
the old woman came towards them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
three of them stood their ground as the old woman came right up. They couldn’t
understand a word she said, partly because she had no teeth, and partly because
she spoke a mixture of many languages. Anyway, it was quite obvious that she
was ticking them off for daring to play near the two vans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
had understood what Julian had said, and had slipped inside the second van. He
was there for half a minute, and then he barked. The boys jumped, and Dick made
a move towards the van.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
Timmy appeared, dragging something behind him with his teeth. He tried to bark
at the same time, but he couldn’t. He dragged the coat-like thing right down to
the ground before the old woman was on him, screaming in a high voice, and
hitting him. She pulled the garment away and went up the steps, kicking out at
the surprised Timmy as he tried to pull it away. The door slammed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
that old woman hadn’t been old, Timmy would have soon shown her he was top
dog!’ said Dick. ‘Whatever was he pulling out of the van?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
over here, out of sight of the van,’ said Julian, urgently. ‘Didn’t you
recognise it, Dick? It was George’s dressing-gown!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘My
word!’ said Dick, stopping in surprise. ‘Yes, you’re right - it was. Whew! What
does that mean exactly? George certainly isn’t in those vans, or Timmy would
have found her.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
sent him in to see if he could smell that George had been hidden there,’ said
Julian. ‘I thought he would bark excitedly if he smelt her scent anywhere - on
the bunk, perhaps. I never guessed he’d find her dressing-gown and drag it out
to show us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
old Timmy! Clever old Timmy!’ said Dick, patting the dog, whose tail was now at
half-mast instead of right down. He had at least found George’s dressing-gown -
but how surprising to find it in that caravan!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
on earth didn’t they take the dressing-gown with them, when they took George
off?’ wondered Julian. ‘There’s no doubt that she has been in that caravan -
she was taken straight there the night before last, I expect. Where is she
now?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She
must have been dressed differently,’ said Dick. ‘They must have had to dress
her properly, when they took her somewhere else. After all, she was only in
pyjamas and dressing-gown.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
was listening to all this, puzzled and worried. She nudged Dick. ‘Spiky’s
beckoning to us,’ she said. They went over to the roundabout boy, whose father
was now in charge of the noisy machine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Spiky
took them into his caravan, a small and rather dirty one, in which he lived
with his father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
saw Gringo’s old Ma chasing you!’ he said with his lop-sided grin. ‘What was
your dog dragging out of the van?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
told him. He nodded. ‘I’ve been asking round a bit, cautious-like,’ he said.
‘Just to see if anyone had heard anything from Gringo’s caravan - and the
fellow whose caravan is nearest told me he heard shouts and yells two nights
ago. He reckoned it was someone in Gringo’s van - but he’s too scared of Gringo
to go and interfere, of course.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
would be George yelling,’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
then Gringo’s vans were moved the next day right away from the other vans,’
said Spiky. ‘And this afternoon, before the Fair opened, Gringo got his car and
towed the little van - the second one - out of the field, and set off with it.
We all wondered why, but he told somebody it needed repairing.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Whew!
And George was inside!’ said Dick. ‘What a cunning way of moving her off to
another hiding-place.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘When
did the van come back?’ asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Just
before you came,’ said Spiky. ‘I don’t know where it went. It was gone an hour,
I should think.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘An
hour,’ said Dick. ‘Well, suppose it goes at an average of 25 miles an hour -
you can’t go very fast if you are towing something - that would mean he had
gone somewhere about 12 miles or so away, and come back the same distance -
making about an hour’s drive, allowing for a stop when they arrived at the
place they had to leave her at.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Julian. ‘But there are lots of places within the radius of 12 miles!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
Gringo’s car?’ said Dick suddenly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Over
there, under that big tarpaulin,’ said Spiky. ‘It’s a silver-grey one -
American and very striking, He thinks the world of it, Gringo does.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
going to have a peep at it,’ said Julian, and strode off. He came to the
tarpaulin, which covered the car right to the ground. He lifted it and was just
about to look under it when a man ran up, shouting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here,
you! Leave that alone! You’ll be turned out of the Fair if you mess about with
things that don’t concern you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timmy was with Julian, and he turned and growled so fiercely that the man
stopped in a hurry. Julian had plenty of time to take a good look under the
tarpaulin!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yes
- the car was silver-grey, a big American one - and the wings were bright blue!
Julian took a quick look at the two left-hand ones and saw a deep scratch on
one of them. Before he dropped the tarpaulin he had time to glance at the
tyres. He was sure they had the same pattern as those shown in the wheel-tracks
he had sketched! He had checked the sketch with Jim, at Kirrin Garage, who had
told him they were an American design.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yes
- this was the car that had hidden in the clearing the night before last - the
car that had turned with difficulty and made those deep ruts - the car that had
taken George away, and this afternoon had towed away the caravan with her
inside, to hide her somewhere else.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
dropped the tarpaulin and walked back to the others, excited, taking no notice
of the rude things that the near-by man called out to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
the car, all right,’ said Julian. ‘Now - WHERE did it go this afternoon? If
only we could find out!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
such a very striking car that anyone would notice it - especially as it was
towing a rather nice little caravan,’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- but we can’t go round the countryside asking everyone we meet if they’ve
noticed a silver-grey car with blue wings,’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
go back home and get a map and see the lie of the country round about,’ said
Dick. ‘Spiky, which way did the car turn when it went out of the field-gate?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Towards
the east,’ said Spiky. ‘On the road to Big Twillingham.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
that’s something to know,’ said Dick. ‘Come on, let’s get our bikes. Thanks
most awfully, Spiky. You’ve been a terrific help. We’ll let you know what
happens.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Call
on me if ever you want more help,’ said Spiky, proudly, and gave them a smart
little salute, bobbing his head so that his spikes of hair shook comically.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
three of them rode off, with Timmy running beside them again. As soon as they
got home they told Anne and Joan all they had found out. Joan was for ringing
up the police at once again, but Julian stopped her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think perhaps we can do this next bit of work better than they can,’ he said.
‘We’re going to try and find out where the car went, Joan. Now - where are the
maps of the district?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
found them and began to pore over them. Jo was quite lost when it came to
map-reading. She could find her way anywhere, day or night - but not with a
map!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
- here’s the road to Big Twillingham and Little Twillingham,’ he said. ‘Let’s
list carefully all the roads the car could take from there. My word - it’s a
job!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

fifteen minutes they had six towns on their list, all of which could have been
reached in about half-an-hour from Big Twillingham, which was two miles away
from the Fair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
now what do you propose to do, Ju?’ asked Dick. ‘Bike over to all the towns and
ask if anyone has seen the car?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
We can’t possibly do that,’ said Julian. ‘I’m going down to the garage to see
our friend Jim, and get his help! I’m going to ask him to ring up any friends
he has in the garages in those towns, and ask if they’ve seen the car passing
through.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Won’t
he think it’s a bit funny?’ asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
But he won’t mind how funny it is if we pay the telephone-calls and give him
fifty pence for his trouble!’ said Julian, folding up the map. ‘And what’s more
he won’t ask any questions either. He’ll probably think it’s some silly bet
we’ve got on with one another.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jim
was quite willing to ring up the garages for them. He knew boys working in main
garages in four of the towns, and he knew the hall-porter of a hotel in the
fifth town. But he knew no one in the sixth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
don’t matter!’ he said. ‘We’ll ring up the garage in the High Street there, and
just ask whoever comes to the phone.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jim
rang up the garage in Hillingford, and had a rather cheeky conversation with
his friend there. He put the receiver down. ‘No go,’ he said. ‘He says no car
like that came through Hillingford, or he’d have noticed it that time of day.
I’ll ring up Jake at Green’s Garage in Lowington now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
no go, either,’ he said, after a minute’s telephone conversation. ‘I’ll try my

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The

is it?’ asked Dick, eagerly, when Jim at last put down the receiver.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Pat
- that’s the hall porter - says he was off duty this afternoon, and went to buy
some cigarettes at a little shop in the main street of Graysfield, where his
hotel is - and as he stood talking to the fellow in the shop an enormous car
drew up at the kerb - silver-grey, with blue wings - an American car, left-hand
drive and all.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- what next?’ said Julian, eagerly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
the driver got out to get some cigarettes at the shop. He had dark glasses on,
and a big gold ring on his finger - Pat noticed that...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
must be the man who asked about us at the tea-shop in Kirrin!’ said Julian,
remembering. ‘Go on, Jim - this is wonderful!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
Pat’s interested in big cars, so he went out and had a good look at it,’ said
Jim. ‘He said the car had its blinds drawn down at the back, so he couldn’t see
inside. The fellow with the dark glasses came out and got into the driver’s
seat again. He called out to whoever was behind and said “Which way now?” ’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
yes - did he hear the answer?’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Somebody
called back and said, “Not far now. Into Twining, turn to the left, and it’s
the house on the hill.” ’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well!
Of all the luck!’ said Dick. ‘Would that be where G ...’ He stopped at a sharp
nudge from Julian, and remembered that he mustn’t give too much away to the
helpful Jim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
passed over fifty pence to the pleased garage boy, who pocketed it at once,
grinning. ‘Now, you just come along to me if you want to know about any more
cars,’ he said. ‘I’ll phone all over the place for you! Thanks a lot!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
sped back to Kirrin Cottage, too excited even to talk. They flung their
bicycles against the wall and ran in to tell Anne and Joan. Timmy and Sally
sensed their excitement and danced round, barking loudly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
know where George is!’ cried Dick. ‘We know, we know!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Joan
and Anne listened eagerly. ‘Well, Master Julian,’ said Joan, in admiration, ‘it
was really smart of you to make Jim phone up like that. The police couldn’t
have done better. What are you going to do now? Ring up that sergeant?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said Julian. ‘I’m so afraid that if the police get moving on this now, they’ll
alarm Gringo and he’ll spirit George away somewhere else. Dick and I will go to
this place tonight, and see if we can’t get hold of George and bring her back!
After all - it’s only an ordinary house, I imagine - and as Gringo doesn’t
suspect that anyone knows where George is, he won’t be on the look out!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good!’
said Dick. ‘Good, good, good!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
coming too,’ said Jo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
are not,’ said Julian, at once. ‘That’s flat - you are NOT COMING, Jo. But I
shall take Timmy, of course.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
said no more, but looked so sulky that Anne laughed. ‘Cheer up, Jo. You can
keep me and Sally company. Oh Julian - wouldn’t it be wonderful to find George
and rescue her!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was more map-reading as the boys decided which was the best way to bicycle over
to Graysfield. ‘Look out the best torches we’ve got, Anne, will you?’ said
Dick. ‘And let me see - how can we bring George back once we’ve got her? On my
bike-step, I think, though I know it’s not allowed. But this is very urgent. We
can’t very well take a third bike with us. Gosh, isn’t this exciting!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
really ought to ring up the police,’ said Joan, who kept saying this at
intervals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Joan,
you sound like a parrot!’ said Julian. ‘If we’re not back by morning you can
ring up all the police in the country if you want to!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
been another phone-call from your aunt today, Master Julian - I nearly forgot
to tell you,’ said Joan. ‘Your uncle is better and they are coming home as soon
as possible.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
this evening, I hope,’ said Julian, in alarm. ‘Did they tell you anything about
Mr Elbur Wright - Berta’s father?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
he’s hanging on to his secrets quite happily now that he knows it isn’t Berta
who is kidnapped,’ said Joan. ‘I don’t know if the kidnappers even know they’ve
got the wrong girl yet. It’s all very hush-hush. Even your uncle and aunt are
having to obey the police. Your poor aunt is so terribly upset about George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
She must be frightfully worried,’ said Julian, soberly. ‘We’ve had so much
excitement today that I’ve almost forgotten to worry. And anyway when you’re
able to do something, things don’t seem so bad.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
be careful you don’t go and do too much and land yourself in trouble,’ said
Joan, darkly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
be careful!’ said Julian, winking at Dick. ‘I say - isn’t it nearly supper-time?
I feel awfully hungry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we haven’t had any tea,’ said Dick. ‘How extraordinary to have forgotten about
tea. No wonder we’re hungry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Would
you like bacon and eggs for a treat?’ said Joan, and there was a chorus of
approval at once. Timmy and Sally wagged their tails as if Joan’s question
applied to them too!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
set off as soon as it’s dark,’ said Julian. ‘Jo, you’d better go home after
supper. They’ll be worrying about you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right,’ said Jo, pleased to have been asked to supper, but still sulky at being
forbidden to go with Julian and Dick that night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
disappeared after supper, with many messages to Berta from Dick, Julian, Anne
and Sally.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
I bet she doesn’t give a single one of them!’ said Dick. ‘Now, let’s have a
game before we set off, Julian. Just to take our minds off the excitement. I’m
getting all worked-up!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Joan
went up to bed at ten because she was tired. Anne stayed up to see the boys
off. ‘You will be careful,’ she kept saying. ‘You will be careful, won’t you?
Oh dear, I think it’s almost worse to stay behind and wonder what’s happening
to you, than to go with you and find out!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
last the time came for the boys to go. It was a quarter to twelve and, except
for a small moon, was a dark night, with great clouds looming up, often hiding
the moon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on, Timmy,’ said Dick. ‘We’re going to find George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof!’
said Timmy, delighted. Sally wuffed too, and was most disappointed at being
left behind. The boys wheeled their bicycles to the front gate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
long, Anne!’ said Dick. ‘Go to bed - and hope to see George when you wake up!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
set off on their bicycles, with Timmy loping along beside them. They soon
arrived at the field where the Fair was, and went swinging away to the east,
following the road the silver-grey car had gone that afternoon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
knew the way by heart, for they had studied the map so well. As they passed the
signposts they felt their excitement beginning to mount. ‘Graysfield next,’
said Dick at last. ‘Soon be there, Timmy! You’re not getting tired, are you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came into Graysfield silently. The town was asleep, and not a single light
showed in any window. A policeman suddenly loomed up out of the shadows, but
when he saw two boys cycling, he did not stop them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
- into Twining Village, turn to the left - and look for the house on the hill!’
said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
rode through the tiny, silent village of Twining, and took the lane to the
left. It led up a steep, narrow lane. The boys had to get off and walk because
the hill was too much for them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
the house!’ said Julian, suddenly whispering. ‘Look - through those trees. My
word, it looks a dark and lonely one!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came to some enormous iron gates, but when they tried to open them, they found
them locked. A great wall ran completely round the grounds. They followed it a
little way, leaving their bicycles against a tree by the gate, but it was soon
certain that nobody could climb a wall like that!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Blow!’
said Julian. ‘Blow!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
about the gates?’ whispered Dick. Then he glanced round him nervously, hearing
a twig crack. ‘Did you hear that? There’s nobody following us, is there?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No!
Don’t get the jitters, for goodness’ sake!’ said Julian. ‘What was it you were
saying?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
said “What about the gates?” ’ said Dick. ‘I don’t see why we can’t climb over
them, do you? Nobody would do that in the daytime, they’d be seen - but I can’t
see why we can’t do it now - they didn’t look too dificult - just ordinary
wrought-iron ones.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes!
Of course!’ said Julian. ‘That’s a brain-wave. Come on!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two boys went back to the gates. Dick turned round and looked behind him two or
three times. ‘I do hope nobody is shadowing us!’ he said. ‘I keep on feeling
somebody’s watching us all the time.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
stuff!’ said Julian, impatiently. ‘Look - here are the gates. Give me a leg-up
and I’ll be over in a jiffy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
gave him a shove, and Julian climbed over the gates without much difficulty.
They were bolted, not locked. He slid the great bolts carefully, and opened one
gate a little for Dick and Timmy. ‘Timmy can’t be left behind!’ he said. ‘And
he certainly couldn’t climb this gate!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
kept to the shadowed side of the drive as they walked up towards the house. The
small moon came out from behind a cloud as they came near. It was an old house,
with high chimneys, an ugly house with narrow windows that seemed like watching
eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
glanced behind him suddenly and Julian saw him. ‘Got the jitters again?’ he
said, impatiently. ‘Dick, don’t be an ass. You know perfectly well that if
anyone was shadowing us, Timmy would hear them and go for them at once.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
I know,’ said Dick. ‘I’m an idiot - but I’ve just got that feeling tonight -
the feeling that someone else is there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came right up to the house. ‘How shall we get in?’ whispered Julian. ‘The doors
are all sure to be locked. We’ll have to try the windows.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
tiptoed silently round the big house. As Julian had said, the doors were all
locked. The windows were all fastened too - well and truly fastened. Not one
was open or could be opened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
this is a house belonging to Gringo he must be able to hide plenty of things in
absolute safety - bolted gates, high walls, locked doors, fastened windows!’
said Dick. ‘No burglar could possibly get in.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
neither can we,’ said Julian, desperately. ‘We’ve been all round the house
three times now! There’s no door, no window we can get in. No balcony to climb
up to - no ivy to hang on to - nothing!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
go round once more,’ said Dick. ‘We might have missed something.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
once more they went round - and discovered something curious when they got to
the kitchen quarters. The moon came out, and showed them a round black hole in
the ground! Whatever could it be?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
tiptoed to it just as the moon went in again. They shone their torches on it
briefly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
a coal-hole!’ said Dick, astonished. ‘Why didn’t we see it before? Look,
there’s the lid just beside it. It’s been left open. I suppose the moon was in
last time we came by this part of the house. I can’t think how we didn’t notice
it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was uneasy. ‘I didn’t see it before, certainly. It’s queer. Could it be a trap,
do you think?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t see how it could be,’ said Dick. ‘Come on - let’s get down. At least it’s
a way in.’ He shone his torch into the hole. ‘Yes, look - there’s a whole lot
of coke down there - we can easily jump on to it. Tim, you go first and spy out
the land.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
jumped down at once, the coke slithering away from beneath his four paws. ‘He’s
down all right,’ said Julian. ‘I’ll go next.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Down
he jumped, and the coke slithered away again, making what seemed to be a very
loud noise in the silent night. Julian shone his torch around.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were standing on a very large heap of coke in the middle of a big cellar. At
the end was a door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hope
it’s not locked,’ said Dick, in a whisper. ‘Now, Tim, keep to heel, for
goodness’ sake, and don’t make a sound!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went to the door, treading on gritty bits of coke. Julian turned the dirty
handle - and the door opened inwards! ‘It’s not locked!’ said Julian,
thankfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
crept through it, Timmy treading on their heels, and found themselves in
another cellar, set with stone shelves on which were piled tins and boxes and
crates. ‘Enough food here to stand a siege!’ whispered Dick. ‘Where are the
cellar-steps? We’ve got to get out.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Over
there,’ said Julian. Then he stopped and put out his torch. He had heard
something.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Did
you hear that?’ he whispered. ‘It sounded like somebody treading on the coke in
the coal-cellar! Gosh, I hope nobody is shadowing us. We’ll soon be prisoners
if so.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
listened but heard nothing further. Up the stone steps they went and undid the
door at the top. A big kitchen lay beyond, lighted by the dim moon. A shadow
rose suddenly in front of them and Timmy growled. Dick’s heart almost stopped
beating. What in the world was that, crawling silently over the floor and
disappearing in the shadows? He clutched at Julian and made him jump.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
do that, ass! That was only the kitchen cat you saw,’ whispered Julian. ‘Gosh,
you made me jump. Wasn’t it a good thing that Timmy didn’t go for the cat?
There would have been an awful yowling!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
do you suppose George will be?’ asked Dick. ‘Somewhere at the top of the
house?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
no idea. We’ll just have to look into every room,’ said Julian. So they looked
into every room on the ground floor, but they were empty. They were huge rooms,
ugly and over-furnished.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on - up the stairs!’ said Dick, and up they went. They came to an enormous
landing, hung with tapestry curtains at the windows. Timmy suddenly gave a
small growl and in a trice both boys had hidden themselves in the folds of the
long window-curtains. Timmy went with them, feeling surprised. Dick peeped out
after a minute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think it was that cat again,’ he whispered. 'Look, there it is, up on that
chest. It’s following us, wondering what on earth we’re doing, I expect!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Blow
it!’ said Julian. ‘I’m getting the jitters now, being watched by a shadowy cat.
I suppose it is real?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy
thinks so!’ said Dick. ‘Come on - there are any amount of bedroom doors on this
landing.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
tiptoed into the ones whose doors were open, but no one was sleeping in the
beds there. They came to a closed door and listened. Someone was snoring
inside!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
not George,’ said Dick. ‘Anyway, she’d be locked in, and the key is in this
door.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went to the next door, which was also shut. They listened and could hear
someone breathing heavily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
George,’ said Dick, and they went on up to the next flight of stairs. There
were four more rooms there, two of them not even furnished. The doors of the
other two were ajar, and it was clear that people were sleeping in them,
because once more there was loud breathing to be heard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
don’t seem to be any more rooms,’ said Dick, in dismay, as they flashed their
torches carefully round the top landing. ‘Blow! Where’s George then?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
- there’s a little wooden door there,’ said Julian, in Dick’s ear. ‘A door
leading into the cistern room, I should think.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She
wouldn’t be there,’ said Dick. ‘But wait - look, there’s a strong bolt on the
door! And cistern rooms don’t have bolts on their doors, or even locks. This
one hasn’t a lock, but it has a bolt.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sh!
Not so loud!’ said Julian. ‘Yes, that’s funny, I must say. How can we get the
door open without waking the people in those other two rooms?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
shut their doors very quietly, and we’ll lock them!’ said Dick, excited. ‘I’ll
go and do it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
drew the doors gently to, and then locked first one and then the other, having
taken the keys from the other side of the doors to do so. Except that one made
a slight click as he locked it, there was no noise. Nobody stirred in the two
rooms, and the boys breathed freely again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went to the little wooden door opposite. They pulled gently at the bolt, afraid
that it might squeak. But it didn’t. It was obviously quite new, and ran
easily. The door opened outwards with a small creak. There was pitch darkness
inside, and the sound of trickling water from the cistern.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
flashed his torch on and off quickly. In that second he saw something that made
his heart jump!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a small mattress on the floor of the little cistern room, and someone was
lying on it, rolled so completely in blankets that even the head was covered!
Julian had seen it too, and he put his arm on Dick’s, afraid that it might not
be George, afraid that it might be someone who would give the alarm, perhaps
another prisoner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timmy knew who it was! Timmy ran straight in with a small, loving whimper and
flung himself on the sleeping figure!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
shut the cistern room door at once, afraid of the noise being heard. Timmy
might bark with joy in a moment, or George might shout!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
figure gave a grunt and sat up. The blanket fell away from the head - and there
was George’s curly nob, and her startled face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sh!’
said Dick, raising his finger warningly. ‘SH!’ Timmy was licking George from
head to foot, wild with delight, but extraordinarily silent - clever old Timmy
knew that this was one of the times when joy must be dumb!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh!’
said George, hugging Timmy anywhere she could. ‘Oh, Timmy! I missed you so!
Darling, darling, Tim! Oh Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
stood by the closed door, listening to find out if anyone was stirring in the
other rooms. He heard nothing at all. Julian went to George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Are
you all right, George?’ he asked. ‘Have you been treated well?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
very,’ said George. ‘But then I didn’t behave very well! I did quite a lot of
kicking and biting - so they locked me in here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Poor
old George!’ said Julian. ‘Well, we’ll hear everything when we’ve got out of
here. So far, we’ve been jolly lucky. Can you come now?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said George and got off the mattress. She was dressed in an odd selection of
clothes, and looked rather peculiar. ‘That awful old woman - Gringo’s mother -
found these for me when I was taken to the caravan,’ she said. ‘Gosh, I’ve got
a lot to tell you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sh!’
said Dick, at the door. ‘Not a sound, now! I’m going to open the door!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
opened it slowly. All was quiet. ‘Now we’ll go down the stairs,’ he said. ‘Not
a sound!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went down the first flight of stairs and on to the enormous landing. Then, just
as Dick put his foot on to the next stair down, he trod on something soft that
yowled, spat and scratched. It was that cat!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
fell half-way down the stairs, and Timmy could not stop himself from chasing
the cat up the landing and up the top stairs to the cistern room. Nor could he
stop himself from barking!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Shouts
came from two of the near-by bedrooms and two men appeared in pyjamas. One
switched on the landing light, and then both of them tore down the stairs after
the three children. Dick picked himself up, but he had ricked his ankle and
could not even walk!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Run,
George - I’ll see to Dick!’ yelled Julian. Rut George stopped too - and in a
trice the two men were on to them, catching hold of Dick and Julian, and
jerking them into a near-by room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Tim!
TIM!’ shouted George. ‘Help, Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
before Timmy could come pelting down the stairs from the attic George was shoved
into the room too, and the door locked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
out for the dog!’ shouted one of the men. ‘He’s dangerous!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
certainly was! He came tearing towards the men, snarling, his eyes blazing,
showing all his teeth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
men darted into the room next to the one into which they had locked the
children, and banged the door. Timmy flung himself against it in rage, snarling
and growling in a most terrifying manner. If only he could get at those men! If
only he could!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Twenty-one<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>MOST
UNEXPECTED!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
there was real pandemonium in the old house! The sleepers in the rooms on the
top landing awoke suddenly and found their doors locked, and began to bang on
them and shout. The three children in the locked room on the ground floor
shouted and banged too - and Timmy nearly went mad!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Only
the men in the room next to the children were silent. They were terrified at
Timmy’s growling and snarling. They would have liked to lock themselves in, but
the key was on the other side of the door - and they certainly didn’t dare to
open it to get the key!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
the children quietened down. Dick sat on a chair, exhausted. ‘That cat! That
wretched, prowling, sly old cat! Gosh, I stepped on it and it scratched me to
the bone - to say nothing of pitching me headlong down the stairs and making me
wrench my ankle!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
so nearly managed to escape!’ groaned Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can’t think what will happen now!’ said George. ‘Timmy’s out there and can’t
get in to us, and we can’t possibly get out to him because the door’s locked - and
those men won’t dare to set a foot outside their door while Tim’s there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
we’ve locked the people into their rooms upstairs!’ said Julian. ‘Well, it’s
certain that nobody can get out of their rooms to help anyone else - so it
looks as if we’ll all be here till Doomsday!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
certainly did seem a very poor look-out! The only people who were not behind
locked doors were the two men, whoever they were - and they simply dared not
put a foot outside their room. Timmy roamed about, occasionally whimpering and
scratching outside the children’s door, but more often growling outside the
next door, sometimes flinging his heavy body against it as if he would break it
down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
bet the men are shaking with fright,’ said Dick. ‘They won’t even dare to try
and get out of a window in case they meet Timmy outside somewhere!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Serve
them right,’ said George. ‘Gosh, I’m glad you came! Wasn’t I an absolute ass to
take Sally down to the kennel that night?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
were,’ said Julian, ‘I agree wholeheartedly. The men were waiting for a chance
to get Berta, of course, and they saw you, complete with Berta’s dog, and
thought you were the girl they wanted!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
They flung something all over my head so that I couldn’t make a sound,’ said
George. ‘I fought like anything, and my dressing-gown girdle must have slipped
off - did you find it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Dick. ‘We were jolly glad to find a few other things too - the comb - the
hanky - the sweet - and of course the note!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
carried me quite a way to somewhere in the wood,’ said George. ‘Then they
plonked me down at the back of the car. But they had to turn it and it was
difficult - and I had the bright thought of throwing out all the things in my
dressing-gown pocket just in case you came along and saw them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
about that note - with the word Gringo on?’ asked Julian. ‘That was a terrific
help. We wouldn’t be here tonight if it hadn’t been for that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I heard one of the men call the other Gringo,’ said George. ‘And it was such an
unusual name I thought I’d scribble it on a bit of paper and throw that out too
- it was just on chance I did it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
jolly good chance!’ said Dick. ‘Good thing you had a notebook and pencil with
you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hadn’t,’ said George. ‘But one of the men had left his coat in the back of the
car and there was a notebook with a pencil in the breast-pocket. I just used
that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Jolly
good!’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
they whizzed me off in the car to some Fairground or other,’ said George. ‘I
heard the roundabout music next day. There was a horrid old witch-like woman in
the caravan; she didn’t seem at all pleased to see me. I had to sleep in a
chair that night, and I got so wild that I yelled and shouted and threw things
about and smashed quite a lot of cups and saucers. I enjoyed that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys couldn’t help laughing. ‘Yes - I bet you did,’ said Dick. ‘They had to
move the caravan away from the Fair itself, because they were afraid people
would hear you. In fact, I expect that’s why Gringo decided to hide you here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I suddenly felt a jolt, and found the caravan we were in was being towed away!’
said George. ‘I was awfully surprised. I waved at the windows and shouted as we
drove through the streets, but nobody seemed to notice anything wrong - in fact
some people waved back to me! Then we swung in through some gates, and came
here - and, as I told you, they put me up here because I made such a nuisance
of myself!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Did
you tell them you weren’t Berta?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said George. ‘Of course not. For two reasons - I knew there would be no fear of
Berta’s father giving those secrets away, because he’d be told by you that I
had been kidnapped, not his precious Berta. So he’d hang on to them. And also I
thought Berta would be safe, so long as I didn’t tell the men they’d got the
wrong person.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
a good kid, George,’ said Julian, and slapped her gently on the back. ‘A - very
- good - kid. I’m jolly proud of you. There’s nobody like our George!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
be a fathead,’ said George, but she was very pleased all the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
there’s no more to tell,’ she said, ‘except that the cistern room was most
frightfully draughty, and I had to wrap my head up as well as my body when I
lay down. And the cistern made awful noises - sort of rude noises, that made me
want to say “I beg your pardon!” all the time! Of course I knew you’d rescue
me, so I wasn’t awfully worried!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
we haven’t rescued you!’ said Julian. ‘All we’ve done is to get ourselves
locked up as well as you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Tell
me how you found out I was here,’ said George. So the boys told her everything
and she listened, thrilled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
Berta went to stay with Jo!’ she said. ‘I bet Jo didn’t like that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She
didn’t,’ said Julian. ‘But she’s been quite a help. I only wish she was here
now, and could do one of her ivy-climbing stunts, or something!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say - Timmy’s very quiet all of a sudden!’ said George, listening. ‘What’s
happened?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
listened. Timmy was not barking or whimpering. There was no sound of him at
all. What was happening? George’s heart sank - perhaps those men had managed to
do something to him?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
suddenly they heard him again, whimpering - but whimpering gladly and
excitedly. And then a familiar voice came to their ears.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dick!
Julian! Where are you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh
- it’s JO!’ said Dick, astounded. He limped to the door. ‘We’re in here, Jo.
Unlock the door!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
unlocked it and looked in, grinning. Timmy tore in like a whirlwind and flung
himself on George, almost knocking her over. Dick limped out of the room
immediately. Jo rushed in, much to everyone’s astonishment. Then he returned,
looking rather pleased with himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
go while the going’s good,’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- but be careful, those men will be out, now that Timmy isn’t there to guard
them!’ cried Julian, suddenly realising that the two angry fellows could easily
escape while Timmy was in with them - and might lock the door on the lot of
them, Timmy too!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
all right - there’s no desperate hurry!’ said Dick. ‘I thought of that. I
slipped out and locked their door on them, as soon as Jo rushed in to us. And
there they can stay till the police arrive in the morning. They can then
collect the whole lot - the men upstairs too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
I’m sure the police will be quite pleased to search the house and the cellars,’
said Julian. ‘There will be plenty of stuff here that they will be interested
in! Well, let’s go at once.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
called a cheery good-bye to the two men. ‘We’re off!’ shouted Dick. ‘You’d
better look out for the dog in case he gets you!’ They all went down the hall,
Dick hobbling, for his ankle was still painful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
might as well leave in style,’ said Julian, and unbolted and unlocked the front
door. ‘Also it would be as well to leave this door open for the police to come
in by - I don’t expect they will want to come in through the coal-hole! It was
a good idea of yours to let the men think we were leaving Tim behind to guard
them, Dick - they won’t dare even to climb out of the windows in case he’s
waiting for them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ve
left a good many lights on,’ said George, looking back. ‘Never mind - we’re not
paying the bill! Come on, Timmy, out into the dark, dark night!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went down the front steps and into the dark drive. Everyone felt safe with
Timmy running ahead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Jo
- exactly how did you get here?’ said Dick, suddenly. ‘You were forbidden to
come.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
know,’ said Jo. ‘Well, I just took Anne’s bike and followed you, that’s all.
And I walked in through the front gates when you’d left them open, of course.
That was easy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh
- I kept feeling there was someone behind me!’ said Dick. ‘And there was - it
was you, you little horror! No wonder Timmy didn’t bother to bark or growl.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
it was me,’ said Jo. ‘And I followed you round and round the house, while you
were trying to get in - and I thought you never would see that coal-hole - so I
took the lid off and put it on the ground, hoping you’d see it then. And you
did!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
you did that!’ said Dick. ‘I must say I was astonished to see it. I knew we
must have passed it before. So that was you too! You want spanking, you
disobedient, cheeky little wretch!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
laughed. ‘I couldn’t bear you to go off without me,’ she said. ‘It’s a good
thing I did come! I waited and waited inside that coal-hole for you to come
back with George - and when you didn’t, I left the coalhole and got into the
house. And Timmy heard me and came running down the stairs. He nearly knocked
me over, he was that pleased!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here
are the gates at last,’ said George. ‘What are we going to do about bikes?
There isn’t one for me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Jo
can stand behind on my step and hold on to my shoulder,’ said Julian. ‘You take
Anne’s bike, George. We’ll leave these gates open. The police ought to be
pleased with us for saving them so much trouble!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Off
they went down the steep hill, Timmy running behind, his tail wagging happily.
He had got George back again. All was well again in his doggy world!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘THESE
KIDS SURE ARE WUNNERFUL!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
shrieks and shouts there were from Joan and Anne when the four arrived at
Kirrin Cottage at last, at half past three in the morning! Joan was awake, but
Anne had just gone to sleep. She was sleeping in Joan’s room for company and
Sally was there too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
stories had to be told again and again. First Dick, then Julian, then George,
then Jo - they all talked without stopping, excited and happy. Sally ran from
one to the other, and followed Timmy about - but sometimes her little stiff
tail drooped when she remembered that Berta was not there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say,’ said Dick, suddenly drawing back the sitting-room curtains - it’s
daylight! The sun’s up! And all the time I’ve been thinking it was still
night!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
use going to bed, then,’ said Jo, at once. She was so much enjoying this that
she felt as if she never wanted it to stop!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I suppose it isn’t,’ said Joan. ‘I know what we’ll do - we’ll have a big
breakfast now, a very big one to celebrate - and then we’ll all go back to bed
and sleep till lunchtime. We’re tired out really - just look at our
black-rimmed eyes and pale cheeks!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Joan!
We’re all as sunburnt as can be, you’re just making that up!’ said George.
‘Come on - let’s get this celebration breakfast going! Bacon - eggs - tomatoes
- fried bread. Oh, and mushrooms too - have you any mushrooms, Joan? And lots
and lots of hot coffee, and toast and marmalade. I’m ravenous.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
discovered that they all were, and twenty minutes later they sat at the table
tucking in as if they had eaten nothing for a month.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can’t eat a thing more,’ said Dick, ‘and I don’t know what’s happening to my
eyes - they keep closing!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
do mine,’ said George, with an enormous yawn. ‘Joan - don’t say we’ve got to do
the washing-up, will you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course not!’ said Joan. ‘Go on up to your beds now - don’t even bother to
undress.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
feel as if there’s something I ought to do - but I can’t remember it,’ said
Julian, sleepily, staggering upstairs. ‘I - just - can’t remember!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
flopped on his bed and was asleep as soon as his head fell on the pillow. In
two minutes everyone but Joan was asleep too. Joan stopped to give Timmy a
drink, and then he bounded up to George and curled up in the crook of her knees
as usual.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Joan
went to lie down too, thinking she would just have a rest, but not go to sleep.
But in half a second she slept too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sun rose higher in the sky. The milkman came whistling up the path and left
four bottles of milk on the step. The gulls in the bay circled and soared and
called loudly. But nobody stirred in Kirrin Cottage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
car came up to the front gate, and another one followed. Out of the first
stepped Uncle Quentin, Aunt Fanny, Mr Elbur Wright - and Berta! Out of the
second car stepped the sergeant and his constable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Berta
flew to the front door, but it was shut. She raced round to the garden door.
That was locked too - and so was the kitchen door!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Pops!
We’ll have to ring - all the doors are locked!’ she called. And then, from up
above came a sound of excited barking, and Sally’s head appeared at a bedroom
window. When she saw it really was Berta down below, she tore down the stairs
and scraped at the front door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
happened? Where is everyone?’ said Aunt Fanny in amazement. ‘All the doors
locked? But it’s ten o’clock in the morning. Where are the children?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
got my key,’ said Uncle Quentin, and he put it into the front door lock. He
opened the door and Sally leapt straight into Berta’s arms, licking her face
from forehead to chin!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Aunt
Fanny went into the hall and called, ‘Anyone at home?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>No
answer. Timmy heard her call, but as George did not stir, he didn’t either. He
was not going to leave George for a minute, not even to go downstairs!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Aunt
Fanny walked into all the rooms on the ground floor. Nobody there! She
marvelled at the remains of the meal spread all over the dining-room table, and
even more at the dirty pans and dishes in the kitchen. What was Joan thinking
of? WHERE was everybody? She did not expect George to be there, because she
knew George had been kidnapped - but where in the world were all the others?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
went upstairs and her husband followed with Berta and her father. They were all
feeling most astonished now. They went into Julian’s room - good gracious he
was there, then! And Dick too - lying choppily on their beds, absolutely sound
asleep! Aunt Fanny couldn’t understand it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then she went into the girls’ room - and there was Anne fast asleep too - and
GOOD GRACIOUS, could that be George? But surely George was kidnapped - then how
- why - where...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Her
mother suddenly put her arms round the sleeping George and kissed her and
hugged her. She had worried so much about her - and now here she was, safe and
sound after all!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
awoke at once. She sat up and gazed at her mother and father in astonishment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
- you’re back! Oh, how lovely! When did you come?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Just
now,’ said her mother. ‘But George - why is everyone asleep - and how did you
get here - we thought you were...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
Mother - yes, of course you don’t know half the story, do you?’ said George.
‘Gosh, there’s Berta here too - and your Pops, Berta! Hallo, everyone.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
was still so sleepy that she was not quite sure whether this was a dream or
not. But then Anne woke up and squealed, and that woke Julian and Dick. They
came into the very crowded bedroom, and soon there was such a noise that Joan
and Jo, in the room above, awoke too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Down
they came, looking very dishevelled, Joan full of apologies. She rushed
downstairs to put some coffee on and bumped into the two policemen in the hall.
She screamed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Excuse
me, Miss,’ said the sergeant to Joan. ‘Isn’t anyone ever coming down again?
We’re supposed to be guarding Miss Berta.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
my - you don’t need to do that now!’ said Joan. ‘Didn’t Master Julian telephone
you last night - this morning, I mean - I thought he was going to.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
about?’ said the sergeant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘About
the kidnappers. Everything’s all right,’ explained Joan to the two astonished
policemen. ‘We’ve got Miss George back - and oh, bless us all, there’s those
kidnappers - you haven’t been told they’re all locked up and waiting for you,
have you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
here, Miss, what are you talking about?’ said the sergeant bewildered. ‘This is
too bad - what do you mean - kidnappers locked up and waiting!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Master
Julian!’ called Joan, ‘the police are here - and you forgot to telephone and
tell them what happened last night. They’d better go to that house and get the
men, hadn’t they?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
knew there was something I’d forgotten,’ said Julian, running down the stairs.
‘I did mean to telephone, but I was so tired that I forgot.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
then came downstairs and went into the sitting-room. Jo was shy with so many
people there, and wouldn’t sit anywhere near the two policemen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
just been told, Mr Wright, sir, that there’s no need to guard your daughter
now,’ said the sergeant, rather stiffly. ‘Seems as if the police are the last
to hear about anything!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
the fact of the matter is that we found out that Gringo, who owns the Fair
called Gringo’s Fair, was paid to kidnap Berta,’ said Julian. ‘He kidnapped
George instead, by mistake. We found out where Gringo had taken her and went to
rescue her last night. You go on, Dick.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
we left Gringo and somebody else locked up in a room on the ground floor, and
two other people locked up in a top-floor room - and we’ve left the front door
open for you and the drive gates open too,’ said Dick. ‘So don’t be too annoyed
about it, Sergeant, because we really have tried to make things easy for you!
We’ve rescued George, as you see - and now you can get the men.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sergeant looked as if he found it difficult to believe a single word! Uncle
Quentin tapped him sharply on the shoulder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
look alive, man - they’ll escape before you can get them if you don’t hurry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
the address?’ said the sergeant, stolidly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know the name of the house, or the lane it’s in,’ said Julian. ‘But you
go through the village of Twining, turn to the left, and it’s the house up on
the hill.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
did you find out all this?’ said the sergeant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
too long to tell you now!’ said Dick. ‘We’ll write it all down in a book, and
send you a copy. We’ll call it - er - we’ll call it - what shall we call it,
you others? It’s a peculiar adventure really - it ended with everyone fast
asleep in bed!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
want some coffee,’ announced Uncle Quentin. ‘I<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>
think we’ve talked enough. Do go and catch your kidnappers, my good men.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
policemen disappeared. Mr Elbur Wright beamed round happily, Berta on his knee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
this is a very happy ending!’ he said. ‘And I can take my little Berta back
with me after all!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no!’ wailed Berta, much to her father’s surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
do you mean?’ he asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gee,
Pops, be a honey and let me stay on here,’ begged Berta. ‘These kids sure are
wunnerful.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘WonDERful,
wonDERful, wonDERful!’ chanted the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course let her stay on if she’d like to,’ said Aunt Fanny. ‘But as a girl this
time, not a boy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
heaved a sigh of relief. That was all right then. She wouldn’t mind Berta as a
girl, even though she was a silly girl!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof!’
said Timmy suddenly, and made everyone jump.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
says he’s jolly pleased you’re staying, Berta, because now Sally-dog will have
to stay too,’ said Dick. ‘So he’ll have someone to play with as well!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shall
we really send the sergeant a book about this adventure?’ said Anne. ‘Did you
really mean it, Dick?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Rather!’
said Dick. ‘Our fourteenth adventure - and may we have many more! What shall we
call the book?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
know!’ said George, at once. ‘I know! Let’s call it “FIVE HAVE PLENTY OF FUN”.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Well,
they did - and they hope you like it!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
