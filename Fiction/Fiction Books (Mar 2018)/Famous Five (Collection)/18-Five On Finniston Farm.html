FIVE ARE ALL TOGETHER AGAIN<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Phew!’
said Julian, mopping his wet forehead; ‘What a day! Let’s go and live at the
Equator - it would be cool compared to this!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
stood leaning on his bicycle, out of breath with a long steep ride up a hill.
Dick grinned at him. ‘You’re out of training, Ju!’ he said. ‘Let’s sit down for
a bit and look at the view. We’re pretty high up!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
leaned their bicycles against a nearby gate and sat down, their backs against
the lower bars. Below them spread the <st1:place w:st="on">Dorset</st1:place>
countryside, shimmering in the heat of the day, the distance almost lost in a
blue haze. A small breeze came wandering round, and Julian sighed in relief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’d
never have come on this biking trip if I’d guessed it was going to be as hot as
this!’ he said. ‘Good thing Anne didn’t come - she’d have given up the first
day.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George
wouldn’t have minded,’ said Dick. ‘She’s game enough for anything.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
old <st1:place w:st="on">Georgina</st1:place>,’ said Julian, shutting his eyes.
‘I’ll be glad to see the girls again. Fun to be on our own, of course - but
things always seem to happen when the four of us are together.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Five,
you mean,’ said Dick, tipping his hat over his eyes. ‘Don’t forget old Timmy.
What a dog! Never knew one that had such a wet lick as Tim. I say - won’t it be
fun to meet them all! Don’t let’s forget the time, Julian. Hey, wake up, ass!
If we go to sleep now, we’ll not be in time to meet the girls’ bus.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was almost asleep. Dick looked at him and laughed. Then he looked at his watch,
and did a little calculating. It was half past two.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
see now - Anne and George will be on the bus that stops at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Finniston</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Church</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
at five past three,’ he thought. ‘Finniston is about a mile away, down this
hill. I’ll give Julian fifteen minutes to have a nap - and hope to goodness I
don’t fall asleep myself!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
felt his own eyes closing after a minute, and got up at once to walk about. The
two girls and Tim must be met, because they would have suitcases with them,
which the boys planned to wheel along on their bicycles.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Five were going to stay at a place called Finniston Farm, set on a hill above
the little <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">village</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Finniston</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>. None of
them had been there before, nor even heard of it. It had all come about because
George’s mother had heard from an old school friend, who had told her that she
was taking paying guests at her farm-house - and had asked her to recommend
visitors to her. George had promptly said she would like to go there with her
cousins in the summer holidays.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hope
it’s a decent place!’ thought Dick, gazing down into the valley, where
corn-fields waved in the little breeze. ‘Anyway, we shall only be there for two
weeks - and it will be fun to be together again.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
looked at his watch. Time to go! He gave Julian a push. ‘Hey - wake up!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘’Nother
ten minutes,’ muttered Julian, trying to turn over, as if he were in bed. He
rolled against the gate-bars and fell on to the hard dry earth below. He sat up
in surprise. ‘Gosh - I thought I was in bed!’ he said. ‘My word, I could have
gone on sleeping for hours.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
it’s time to go and meet that bus,’ said Dick. ‘I’ve had to walk about all the
time you were asleep, I was so afraid I’d go off myself. Come on, Julian - we
really must go!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
rode down the hill, going cautiously round the sharp corners, remembering how
many times they had met herds of cows, wide farm-carts, tractors and the like,
on their way through this great farming county. Ah - there was the village, at
the bottom of the hill. It looked old and peaceful and half-asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thank
goodness it sells ginger-beer and ice-creams!’ said Dick, seeing a small shop
with a big sign in the window. ‘I feel as if I want to hang out my tongue, like
Timmy does, I’m so thirsty!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
find the church and the bus-stop,’ said Julian. ‘I saw a spire as we rode down
the hill, but it disappeared when we got near the bottom.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
the bus!’ said Dick, as he heard the noise of wheels rumbling along in the
distance. ‘Look, here it comes. We’ll follow it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
Anne in it - and George, look!’ shouted Julian. ‘We’re here exactly on time!
Whoo-hoo, George!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
bus came to a stop by the old church, and out jumped Anne and George, each with
a suitcase - and out leapt old Timmy too, his tongue hanging down, very glad to
be out of the hot, jerky, smelly bus.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
are the boys!’ shouted George, and waved wildly as the bus went off again.
‘Julian! Dick! I’m so glad you’re here to meet us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two boys rode up, and jumped off their bikes, while Timmy leapt round them,
barhng madly. They thumped the girls on their backs, and grinned at them. ‘Just
the same old couple!’ said Dick. ‘You’ve got a spot on your chin, George, and
why on earth have you tied your hair into a pony-tail, Anne?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
not very polite, Dick,’ said George, bumping him with her suitcase. ‘I can’t
think why Anne and I looked forward so much to seeing you again. Here, take my
suitcase - haven’t you any manners?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Plenty,’
said Dick, and grabbed the case. ‘I just can’t get over Anne’s new hair-do. I
don’t like it, Anne - do you, Ju? Pony-tail! A donkey-tail would suit you
better Anne!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
all right - it’s just because the back of my neck was so hot,’ said Anne,
shaking her hair free in a hurry. She hated her brothers to find fault with
her. Julian gave her arm a squeeze.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nice
to see you both,’ he said. ‘What about some ginger-beer and ice-cream? There’s
a shop over there that sells them. And I’ve a sudden longing for nice juicy
plums!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
haven’t said a word to Timmy yet,’ said George, half-offended. ‘He’s been
trotting round you and licking your hands - and he’s so dreadfully hot and
thirsty!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shake
paws, Tim,’ said Dick, and Timmy politely put up his right paw. He shook hands
with Julian too and then promptly went mad, careering about and almost knocking
over a small boy on a bicycle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on, Tim - want an ice-cream?’ said Dick, laying his hand on the big dog’s head.
‘Hark at him panting, George - I bet he wishes he could unzip his hairy coat
and take it off! Don’t you, Tim?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof!’
said Tim, and slapped his tail against Dick’s bare legs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all trooped into the ice-cream shop. It was half dairy, half baker’s. A small
girl of about ten came to serve them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mum’s
lying down,’ she said. ‘What can I get you? Ice-creams, I suppose? That’s what
everyone wants today.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
supposed right,’ said Julian. ‘A large one each, please - five in all - and
four bottles of ginger pop as well.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Five
ice-creams - do you want one for that dog, then?’ said the girl in surprise,
looking at Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
he said at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
you are,’ said Dick, ‘he said yes!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
the Five were eating their cold ice-creams, Timmy licking his from a saucer.
Before he had had many licks, the ice-cream slid from the saucer, and Timmy
chased it all the way round the shop, as it slid away from his vigorous licks.
The little girl watched him, fascinated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
must apologize for his manners,’ said Julian, solemnly. ‘He hasn’t been very
well brought up.’ He at once had a glare from George, and grinned. He opened
his bottle of ginger-beer. ‘Nice and cold,’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here’s
a happy fortnight to us all!’ He drank half the glass at top speed, and set it
down with a great sigh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
blessings on the person who invented ice-cream, ginger-pop and the rest!’ he
said. ‘I’d rather invent things like that any day than rockets and bombs, Ha -
I feel better now. What about you others? Do you feel like going to find the
farm?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Whose
farm?’ asked the little girl, coming out from behind the counter to pick up
Timmy’s saucer. Timmy gave her a large, wet and loving lick as she bent down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ooooh!’
she said, pushing him away. ‘He licked all down my face!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Probably
thought you were an ice-cream,’ said Dick, giving her his hanky to wipe her
cheek. ‘The farm we want is called Finniston Farm. Do you know it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes,’ said the little girl. ‘You go down the village street, right to the end,
and turn up the lane there - up to the right. The farmhouse is at the top of
the lane. Are you staying with the Philpots?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
Do you know them?’ asked Julian, getting out some money to pay the bill.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
know the twins there,’ said the girl. ‘The two Harries. At least, I don’t know
them well - nobody does. They’re just wrapped up in each other, they never make
any friends. You look out for their old Great-Grand-dad - he’s a one, he is! He
once fought a mad bull and knocked it out! And his voice - you can hear it for
miles! I was real scared of going near the farm when I was little. But Mrs
Philpot, she’s nice. You’ll like her. The twins are very good to her - and to
their Dad, too - work like farm-hands all the holidays. You won’t know t’other
from which, they’re so alike!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
did you call them the two Harries?’ asked Anne, curiously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
because they’ve both...’ began the child, and then broke off as a plump woman
came bustling into the shop.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Janie
- you go and see to the baby for me - I’ll see to the shop now. Run along!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Away
went the small girl, scuttling through the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Little
gasbag she is!’ said her mother. ‘Anything more you want?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
thanks,’ said Julian, getting up. ‘We must go. We’re to stay at Finniston Farm,
so we may be seeing you again soon. We liked the ice-creams!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
- so you’re going there, are you?’ said the plump woman. ‘I wonder how you’ll
get on with the Harries! And keep out of Grand-dad’s way - he’s over eighty,
but he can still give a mighty good thumping to anyone who crosses him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Five went out into the hot sun again. Julian grinned round at the others. ‘Well
- shall we go and find the nice Mrs Philpot - the unfriendly Harries, whoever
they are - and the fearsome Great-Grand-dad? Sounds an interesting household,
doesn’t it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four children, with Timmy trotting beside them, walked down the hot, dusty
village street until they came to the end, and then saw the lane turning off to
the right, just as the little girl had told them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wait
a minute,’ said Anne, stopping at a curious little shop at the end of the
village street. ‘Look - here’s a queer shop - it sells antiques. Look at those
old horse-brasses - I’d like to get one or two of those. And just see those
lovely old prints!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no - not now, Anne,’ said Julian, with a groan. ‘This awful sudden craze of
yours for second-hand shops has been going on too long! Horse-brasses! You’ve
got stacks of them already! If you think we’re going to go into that dark,
smelly little shop and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
I’m not going in now,’ said Anne, hurriedly. ‘But it does look rather exciting.
I’ll come by myself sometime and prowl round.’ She glanced at the name on the
shop front. ‘William Finniston - how funny to have the same name as the
village! I wonder if...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
come on, Anne,’ said George impatiently, and Timmy tugged at her skirt. Anne
gave one backward glance at the fascinating little shop-window, and hurried
after the others, making up her mind to slip down to the shop one day when she
was alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went up the little winding lane, where red poppy-heads jigged about in the
breeze, and after a while they came in sight of the farm-house. It was a big
one, three storey's high, with whitewashed walls, and the rather small windows
belonging to the age in which it was built. Old-fashioned red and white roses
rambled over the porch, and the old wooden door stood wide open.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Five stood on the scrubbed stone entrance, looking into the dim hall. An old
wooden chest stood there, and a carved chair. A rather threadbare rug lay on
the stone floor, and a grandfather clock ticked slowly and loudly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Somewhere
a dog barked, and Timmy at once barked back. WOOF, WOOF!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Be
quiet, Timmy,’ said George sharply, afraid that a horde of farm-dogs might come
rushing out. She looked for a bell or a knocker, but couldn’t see either. Then
Dick spotted a beautiful wrought-iron handle hanging down from the roof of the
porch. Could it be a bell?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
pulled it, and at once a bell jangled very loudly somewhere in the depths of
the farm-house, making them all jump. They stood in silence, waiting for
someone to come. Then they heard footsteps and two children came up the
hallway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were exactly alike! The most twinny twins I’ve ever seen! thought Anne, in
amazement. Julian smiled his friendliest smile. ‘Good afternoon - we’re the
Kirrins - I - er I hope you’re expecting us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
twins stared at him without a smile. They nodded together. ‘Come this way,’
they both said, and marched back down the hall. The four stared at one another
in surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
so stiff and haughty'’ whispered Dick, putting on a face exactly like the
twins. Anne giggled. They all followed the twins, who were dressed exactly
alike in navy shorts and navy shirts. They went right down the long hall,
passed a stairway, round a dark corner, and into an enormous kitchen, which was
obviously used as a sitting-room as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
Kirrins, Mother!’ said the twins, together, and at once disappeared through
another door, shoulder to shoulder. The children found themselves facing a
pleasant-looking woman, standing by a table, her hands white with flour. She
smiled, and then gave a little laugh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
my dears! I didn’t expect you quite so soon! Do forgive my not being able to
shake hands with you - but I was just making scones for your tea. I’m so
pleased to see you. Did you have a good journey here?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was nice to hear her welcoming voice and see her wide smile. The Five warmed to
her at once. Julian put down the suitcase he was carrying and looked round the
room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
a lovely old place!’ he said. ‘You carry on with your scone-making, Mrs Philpot
- we’ll look after ourselves. Just tell us where to go. It’s nice of you to
have us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
glad to,’ said Mrs Philpot. ‘I expect your aunt told you the farm’s not doing
too well, and she kindly said she’d send you here for two weeks. I’ve some
other boarders too - an American and his son - so I’m pretty busy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you don’t need to bother too much about us,’ said Dick. ‘In fact, we’ll camp
out under a haystack, if you like - or in a barn. We’re used to roughing it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- that might be a help,’ said Mrs Philpot, going on with her mixing. ‘I’ve a
bedroom that would do for the girls all right - but I’m afraid you boys would
have to share one with the American boy - and - er - well, you mightn’t like
him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
I expect we’ll get on all right,’ said Julian. ‘But my brother and I would
certainly prefer to be by ourselves, Mrs Philpot. What about putting up
camp-beds or something in a barn? We’d love that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
looked at Mrs Philpot’s kind, tired face, and felt suddenly sorry for her. How
awful to have to have your home invaded by strangers, whether you liked them or
not! She went over to her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
tell Georgina and me anything you’d like us to do to help,’ she said. ‘You know
- making the beds, and dusting and things like that. We’re used to doing things
at home, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
going to enjoy having you!’ said Mrs Philpot, looking round at them all. ‘And
you won’t need to help very much. The twins do a great deal - too much, I
think, bless them - because they help on the farm too. Now, you go up the
stairs to the very top of the house, and you’ll see two bedrooms, one on each
side of the landing - the left-hand one is yours, girls - the other is where
the American boy is sleeping. And as for you two boys, you can slip out to the
barn, and see if you’d like a couple of camp-beds there. I’ll get the twins to
take you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
twins came back at this minute, and stood silently shoulder to shoulder, as
alike as peas. George looked at them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
your name?’ she said to one twin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Harry!’
was the answer. She turned to the other. ‘And what’s yours?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Harry!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
surely you don’t both have the same name?’ exclaimed George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you see,’ explained their mother, ‘we called the boy Henry, and he became
Harry, of course - and we called the girl Harriet, and she calls herself Harry
for short - so they’re known as the Harries.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
thought they were both boys!’ said Dick in amazement. ‘I wouldn’t know which is
which!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
they felt they have to be alike,’ said Mrs Philpot, ‘and as Harry can’t have
long hair like a girl, Harriet has to have short hair to be like Harry! I often
don’t know one from the other myself.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
grinned. ‘Funny how some girls want to be boys!’ he said, with a sly glance at
George, who gave him a furious look.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Twins,
show the Kirrins up to the top bedroom,’ said Mrs Philpot, ‘and then take the
boys out to the big barn. They can have the old camp-beds, if they like the
look of the barn.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
sleep out there,’ said the Harries, both together, and scowled just like
George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you shouldn’t,’ said their mother. ‘I told you to take your mattresses to the
little room off the dairy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
too stuffy,’ said the twins.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say, look here - we don’t want to cause trouble,’ said Julian, feeling that the
twins were too unfriendly for words. ‘Can’t we sleep in the room off the
dairy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Certainly
not,’ said Mrs Philpot, and sent the Harries a warning glance. ‘There’s room
for you all in the big barn. Go on, now, twins, do as I tell you, take the four
up to the top bedroom, with the cases, and then out to the barn.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
twins went to pick up the suitcases, still looking mutinous. Dick interposed
himself between them and the cases. ‘We’ll carry them,’ he said stiffly. ‘We
don’t want to be any more trouble to you than we can help.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
he and Julian picked up a suitcase each, and set off after the Harries, who
looked suddenly surprised. George followed with Timmy, more amused than cross.
Anne went to pick up a spoon that Mrs Philpot had dropped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thank
you, dear,’ said Mrs Philpot. ‘Look - don’t get upset by the twins. They’re a
funny pair - but good at heart. They just don’t like strangers in their home,
that’s all. Promise you won’t mind them? I do want you to be happy here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
looked at the kindly, tired face of the woman beside her, and smiled. ‘We’ll
promise not to worry about the twins - if you’ll promise not to worry about
us!’ she said. ‘We can look after ourselves, you know - honestly, we’re used to
it. And please do tell us when you want anything done!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
went out of the room and up the stairs. The others were already in one of the
two bedrooms at the top of the house. It was a fairly big room, whitewashed,
with rather a small window and boarded floors. Julian looked at the boards he
was standing on. ‘I say! Look at the wood this floor’s made of - solid old oak,
worn white with the years! My word - this farm-house must be very old. And look
at the beams running across the walls and into the roof. Hey, twins, this is a
fine old house of yours!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
twins unbent enough to nod in time together. ‘Seems as if you two go by
clockwork - you speak the same words at the same time, you walk in time, you
nod your heads in time!’ said Dick. ‘But, I say - do you ever smile?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
twins looked at him with dislike. Anne nudged Dick. ‘Stop it, Dick! Don’t tease
them. Perhaps they’d show you the barn now. We’ll unpack some clean things
we’ve brought for you in our case, and come down with them when we’re ready.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Dick, and he and Julian went out of the room. Opposite, with its door
open, was the other room, where the American boy slept. It was so very untidy
that Dick couldn’t help exclaiming, ‘Gosh - how does he get his room into all
that mess?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
and Julian went down the stairs, and Dick turnecl back to see if the Harries
were following. He saw them standing at the top, each shaking a furious fist at
the door of the American boy’s room. And what a furious look on their faces,
too!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Whew!
thought Dick. The Harries have got some sort of hate on there - let’s hope they
don’t get one for us, too. ‘Well - now for the barn,’ he said aloud. ‘Don’t go
so fast, Ju. Wait for the twins - they’re just falling over themselves to look
after us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>OUT

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
twins stalked out of the farm-house and took the two boys round the dairy shed,
and up to an enormous barn. One of them pushed open the great door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say!’ said Julian, gazing into the dark barn. ‘I never saw such a fine barn in
all my life! It’s as old as the hills - look at those beams soaring up into the
roof - it reminds me of a cathedral, somehow. I wonder why they built the roof
so high. What do you store in here, twins?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sacks
of meal,’ said the Harries together, opening and shutting their mouths as one.
The two boys saw a couple of camp-beds in a corner of the barn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
here,’ said Julian, ‘if you really would rather sleep here alone, we’ll sleep
in the little room off the dairy that your mother spoke of.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before
the twins could answer, a shrill barking came from the direction of the
camp-beds, and the boys saw a tiny black poodle there, standing up, quivering
in every hair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
a tiny thing!’ said Julian. ‘Is he yours, twins? What’s his name?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Snippet,’
came the answer from both at once. ‘Come here, Snippet!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
once the tiny black poodle hurled hunself off the camp-bed and raced over to
them. He fawned on them all, barking in delight, licking everyone in turn. Dick
picked him up, but the twins at once clutched Snippet themselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
OUR dog!’ they said, so fiercely that Dick backed away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right, all right - you can have him. But be careful Tim doesn’t eat him!’ he
said. A look of fear came over the faces of the Harries, and they turned to one
another, anxiously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
all right,’ said Julian, hastily. ‘Tim’s gentle with small things. You needn’t
be afraid. I say - why do you have to be so dumb? It really wouldn’t hurt you
to be a bit friendly. And do let us sleep in your old room - we really don’t
mind.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
twins looked at each other again, as if reading one another’s thoughts, and
then they turned gravely to the boys, not looking quite so unfriendly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
will all sleep here,’ they said. ‘We will fetch the other camp-beds.’ And off
they marched, Snippet running excitedly at their heels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
scratched his head. ‘Those twins make me feel peculiar,’ he said. ‘I somehow
don’t feel they are quite real. The way they act and speak together makes me
feel as if they’re puppets or something.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’re
just jolly rude and unfriendly,’ said Dick, bluntly. ‘Oh well - they won’t get
in our way much. I vote we explore the farm tomorrow. It looks quite a big one
- spreading out over the hill-slopes everywhere. I wonder if we could get a
ride on a tractor?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
that moment a bell rang loudly from the direction of the house. ‘What’s that
for?’ said Dick. ‘Tea, I hope!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
twins came back at that moment with two more camp-beds, wkich they proceeded to
set up as far from their own as possible. Dick went to give a hand, but they
waved him off, and put up the beds most efficiently and quickly by themselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Tea
is ready,’ they said, standing up when the beds were finished, and blankets and
pillows set out on them. ‘We will show you where to wash.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thanks,’
said Dick and Julian together, and then grinned at one another. ‘Better be
careful,’ said Julian, ‘or we’ll catch their habit of speaking exactly at the
same moment. I say - isn’t that poodle an amusing little fellow - look at him
stalking that jackdaw!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
black jackdaw, the nape of his neck showing grey as he ran in front of Snippet,
had flown down from somewhere in the roof of the barn. As Snippet danced after
him he ran behind sacks, scurried into corners, and led the little dog such a
dance that the two boys roared. Even the twins smiled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Chack!’
said the jackdaw, and rose into the air. He settled himself neatly on the
middle of the poodle’s back, and Snippet promptly went mad, and tore about the
barn at top speed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Roll
over, Snippet!’ shouted the Harries, and Snippet at once flung himself on his
back - but the jackdaw, with a triumphant ‘chack’ rose at once into the air,
and alighted on one twin’s head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say - is he tame?’ said Dick. ‘What’s his name?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nosey.
He’s ours. He fell down a chimney and broke his wing,’ said the twins. ‘So we
kept him till it was well and now he won’t leave us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh!’
said Dick, starring at them. ‘Did you really say all that - or was it the
jackdaw? You can talk properly, after all.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nosey
pecked at the twin’s ear nearest to him, and the twin gave a yell. ‘Stop it,
Nosey!’ The jackdaw rose into the air, with a ‘chack-chack-chack’ that sounded
very like a laugh, and disappeared somehere in the roof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Just
then the two girls came to find the boys in the barn, sent by Mrs Philpot, who
was sure they hadn’t heard the bell. Timmy was with them, of course, sniffing
into every corner, enjoying the farm-smells everywhere. They came to the barn
and looked in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
there you are!’ called Anne. ‘Mrs Philpot said we...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
began to bark, and she stopped. He had caught sight of Snippet sniffing behind
the sacks, still hunting for the cheeky jackdaw. He stood still and stared.
What in the wide world was that funny little black creature? He gave another
loud bark and shot over towards the poodle, who gave a tenified yelp and leapt
into the arms of one of the twins.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Take
your dog away,’ said both twins, fiercely, glaring at the four.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
all right - he won’t hurt Snippet,’ said George, advancing on Timmy and taking
hold of his collar. ‘He really won’t.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘TAKE
YOUR DOG AWAY!’ shouted the twins, and up in the roof somewhere the jackdaw
said, ‘CHACK, CHACK, CHACK!’ just as fiercely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right, all right,’ said George, glaring as angrily as the twins, ‘Come on, Tim.
That poodle wouldn’t be more than a mouthful for you, anyway!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went back to the farm-house in silence, Snippet having been left behind on
the camp-bed belonging to one of the twins. They cheered up when they came into
the big, cool kitchen. Tea was now laid on the farm-house table, a big solid
affair of old, old oak. Chairs were set round and it all looked very homelike.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hot
scones,’ said George, lifting the lid off a dish. ‘I never thought I’d like hot
scones on a summer’s day, but these look heavenly. Running with butter! Just
how I like them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four looked at the home-made buns and biscuits and the great fruit cake. They
stared at the dishes of home-made jam, and the big plate of ripe plums. Then
they looked at Mrs Philpot, sitting behind a very big teapot, pouring out cups
of tea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
mustn’t spoil us, Mrs Philpot,’ said Julian, thinking that really his hostess
was doing too much. ‘Please don’t let us make too much work for you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
loud, commanding voice suddenly made them all jump. Sitting in a big wooden
armchair near the window was someone they hadn’t seen - a burly old man with a
shock of snowy white hair and a luxurious white beard almost down to his waist.
His eyes were startlingly bright as he looked across at them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>TOO
MUCH WORK! What’s that you say? TOO MUCH WORK? Ha, people nowadays don’t know
what work is, that they don’t! Grumble, grumble, GRUMBLE, asking for this and
expecting that! Pah! PAH, I say!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
now, Grand-dad,’ said Mrs Philpot, gently. ‘You just sup your tea and rest.
You’ve been out on the farm all day, and it’s too much work for you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
set the old man off again. TOO MUCH WORK! Now let me tell you something. When I
was a young lad, I... hallo, who’s this?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was Timmy! He had been startled by the sudden shouting of the old man, and had
stood up, his hackles rising, and a low growl down in his throat. And then a
very curious thing happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
walked slowly over to the fierce old man, stood by him - and laid his head
gently on his knee! Everyone stared in astonishment, and George could hardly
believe her eyes!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
first the old man took no notice. He just let Timmy stay there, and went on
with his shouting. ‘No one knows anything these days. They don’t know a good
sheep or a good bull or a good dog. They...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
moved his head a little, and the old man stopped again. He looked down at
Timmy, and patted him on the head. ‘Now here’s a dog - a REAL dog. A dog that
could be the best friend any man ever had. Ah, he reminds me of my old True, he
does.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was staring in amazement at Timmy. ‘He’s never done a thing like that before,’
she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
dogs are like that with old Grand-dad,’ said Mrs Philpot softly. ‘Don’t mind
his shouting. He’s like that. See - your Timmy is lying down by Grand-dad - now
they’ll both be happy. Grand-dad will have his tea and be nice and quiet. Don’t
take any notice of him now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Still
astonished, the children ate a marvellous tea, and were soon talking eagerly to
Mrs Philpot, asking her questions about the farm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
of course you can go on the tractor. And we’ve an old Land-Rover too - you can
motor round the farm in that, if you like. Wait till my husband comes in -
he’ll tell you what you can do.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
saw a little black shadow come in at the door, and sidle softly over to
Grand-dad - Snippet the poodle! He had left the barn and come to the kitchen he
loved. It was only when Mrs Philpot turned round to ask the old man to have
another cup of tea that she saw a very strange sight indeed. She nudged the
twins, and they turned to look.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
saw Timmy lying peacefully down on Grand-dad’s big feet - and Snippet the
poodle lying between Timmy’s great front paws! Well - what an astonishing
sight, to be sure!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Grand-dad’s
happy now,’ said Mrs Philpot. ‘Two dogs at his feet. And now, look - here’s my
husband! Come along in, Trevor - we’re all here, the dogs as well!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>JUNIOR!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
big man came into the kitchen, very like the twins to look at. He stooped, and
seemed tired. He didn’t smile, but just nodded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Trevor,
here are the visitors I told you about,’ said Mrs. Philpot. ‘Look, this is
Julian and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘More
visitors?’ said Trevor, with a groan. ‘Good heavens - what a crowd of children!
Where’s that American boy? I’ve got a bone to pick with him. He tried to set
the tractor going by himself this morning, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
Trevor - never mind about that now. Just wash and come and have your tea,’ said
Mrs Philpot. ‘I’ve kept some of your favourite scones for you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
want any tea,’ said her husband. ‘Can’t stop - except for just one cup, and
that I’ll take into the dairy. I’ve got to go and see to the milking. Bob’s off
today.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
help, Dad!’ said the twins, speaking together, as usual, and they got up from
the table at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
- you sit down,’ said their mother. ‘You’ve been on the go from seven o’clock
this morning. Sit down and finish your tea in peace.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
could do with your help, twins,’ said their father, as he went through the door
towards the dairies, ‘but now your mother’s got so many on her hands, she’ll
need you more than I do!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mrs
Philpot - let the twins go if they want to,’ said Julian at once. ‘We can help,
you know - we’re used to helping at home.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
what’s more, we like it,’ said Anne. ‘Do let us, Mrs Philpot - we’ll feel much
more at home then. Can’t we clear away and wash up and all that, while the
twins go and help with the milking?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘YOU
LET ’EM HELP!’ shouted old Great-Grand-dad suddenly from his corner, making
Timmy and Snippet leap to their feet, startled. ‘WHAT ARE CHILDREN COMING TO
NOWADAYS, WAITED ON HAND AND FOOT? PAH!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now,
now, Grand-dad,’ said poor Mrs Philpot, ‘Don’t you start worrying. We can
manage fine.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
old man made a loud, explosive noise, and banged his hand down on the arm of
his chair. ‘WHAT I SAY IS THIS...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
he got no further, for the sound of footsteps could be heard in the hall,
coming towards the kitchen, and loud, American voices came nearer and nearer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘See
here, Pop - I wanna come with you! This is a dead-and-alive place. You take me
up to London with you, aw, Pop, go on, do!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
the Americans?’ asked Dick, turning to the twins. Their faces had gone as black
as thunder. They nodded. In came a burly man, looking rather odd in smart town
clothes, and a fat pasty-faced boy of about eleven. The father stood at the
door and looked round, rubbing his hands.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hiya,
folks! We’ve bin over to that swell old town, and picked up some fine souvenirs
- my, my, they were cheap as dirt! We late for tea? Hallo, who’re all these
folks?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
grinned round at Julian and the others. Julian stood up politely. ‘We’re four
cousins,’ he said. ‘We’ve come to stay here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Stay
here? Where you gonna sleep, then?’ demanded the boy, pulling up a chair to the
table. ‘This is a one-eyed place, ain’t it, Pop - no wash-basins, no...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shut
up,’ said the twins together, and gave the boy such a glare that Anne stared in
astonishment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Aw,
go on, I can say what I like, can’t I?’ said the boy. ‘Free country, isn’t it?
Gee, you should just see America! That’s something! Mrs Philpot, I’ll have a
bit of that cake - looks good to me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘CAN’T
YOU SAY PLEASE?’ roared a voice from the corner. That was Great-Grand-dad, of
course! But the boy took no notice, and merely held out his plate, while Mrs
Philpot cut him an enormous slice of cake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
have the same as Junior, Mrs Philpot mam,’ said the American, and sat down at
the table. He held out his plate too. ‘Say, you should see the things we’ve
bought. We’ve had a day, haven’t we, Junior?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sure,
Pop,’ said Junior. ‘Say, can’t I have an iced drink? Look-a-here - who’s going
to drink hot tea on a day like this!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
get you some iced orangeade,’ said Mrs Philpot, rising.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘LET
HIM GET IT HIMSELF! LITTLE VARMINT!’ That was Great-Grand-dad again, of course.
But the twins were already up and on their way to fetch the orangeade
themselves. George caught sight of their faces as they passed her, and had a
shock of surprise. Goodness - how those twins hated that boy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
old Grand-daddy of yours must be a bit of a nuisance to you,’ said the American
in a low voice to Mrs Philpot. ‘Always butting in, isn’t he? Rude old fellow,
too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘NOW
DON’T YOU SET THERE WHISPERING!’ shouted Grand-dad. ‘I CAN HEAR EVERY WORD!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now,
now, Grand-dad, don’t upset yourself,’ said poor Mrs Philpot. ‘You just sit
there and have a nap.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
I’m going out again,’ said Great-Grand-dad, heaving himself up. ‘There’s some
people that fair make me ill!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
out he went, leaning on his stick, a magnificent figure with his head of
snow-white hair and his long beard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Like
someone out of the Old Testament,’ said Anne to Dick. Timmy got up and followed
the old man to the door, with Snippet close behind him. Junior saw Timmy at
once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say! Look at that big dog!’ he said. ‘Who’s he? I’ve not seen him before. Hey,
you, come and have a bun.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
took not the slightest notice. George addressed Junior in an icy voice. ‘That’s
my dog Timmy. I don’t allow anyone to feed him except myself.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shucks!’
said Junior, and threw the cake down on the floor, so that it slid to Tim’s
feet. ‘That’s for you, dog!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
looked down at the cake, and stood perfectly still. Then he looked at George.
‘Come here, Timmy,’ said George, and he walked straight to her. The cake lay on
the floor half-broken into crumbs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘My
dog is not going to eat that,’ said George. ‘Better pick it up, hadn’t you?
It’s made a bit of a mess on the floor.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Pick
it up yourself,’ said Junior, helping himself to another bun. ‘My, my - what a
glare you’ve got! Makes me want my sunglasses, brother!’ He gave George a
sudden sharp dig in the ribs, and she gasped. Timmy was beside her in a moment,
growling so deeply that Junior slid out of his seat in alarm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Say,
Pop - this dog’s fierce!’ he said. ‘He made to bite me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
did not,’ said George. ‘But he might bite if you don’t do what I said, and pick
up that bun!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now,
now,’ said Mrs Philpot, really distressed. ‘Leave it - it can be swept up
afterwards. Will you have another piece of cake, Mr Henning?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
really was an embarrassing meal, and Anne longed for it to be over. Junior
quietened down considerably when he saw Timmy lying down between his chair and
George’s, but his father made up for that by talking non-stop about the
‘wunnerful’ things he had bought that day. Everyone was extremely bored. The
twins came back with a jug of orangeade, which they placed on the table, with
two glasses, in case Mr Henning wanted some. They then disappeared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
have they gone?’ demanded Junior, having poured a glass of orangeade straight
down his throat in a most remarkable manner. ‘Gee, that was good.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
twins have gone to help with the milking, I expect,’ said Mrs Philpot, looking
suddenly very weary. Julian looked at her. She must find these meals very
tiring, he thought, coping with so many people. Junior piped up at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
go and help with the milking,’ he said, and slid off his chair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’d
rather you didn’t, Junior,’ said Mrs Philpot. ‘You upset the cows a bit last
time, you know.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Aw
gee - that was because I was new to it,’ said Junior. Julian looked at Mr
Henning, expecting him to forbid Junior to go, but he said nothing. He lighted
a cigarette and threw the match down on the floor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
scowled when she saw Junior heading for the door. How dare he go out to the
milking against the wishes of his hostess? She murmured a few words to Timmy,
and he got up at once and ran to the door, barring it against Junior.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Get
outa my way, you,’ said Junior, stopping. Timmy growled. ‘Say, call him back,
will you?’ said Junior, turning round. No one said anything. Mrs Philpot rose
and began to gather things together. It seemed to George as if she had tears in
her eyes. No wonder, if this kind of thing happened every day!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
Timmy stood like a statue in the doorway, giving small threatening growls every
now and again, Junior decided to give up. He dearly longed to give the dog a
kick, but didn’t dare to. He walked back to his father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Say,
Pop - coming for a walk?’ he said. ‘Let’s get out of here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Without
a word father and son walked out of the other door. Everyone heaved a sigh of
relief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
go and sit down and have a rest, Mrs Philpot,’ said Anne. ‘We’ll do the
washing-up. We’d love to!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- it’s really kind of you,’ said Mrs Philpot. ‘I’ve been on the go all day, and
twenty minutes’ rest will do me good. I’m afraid Junior gets on my nerves. I do
hope Timmy won’t bite him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’ll
probably give him a nip before long,’ said George cheerfully, collecting cups
and saucers with Anne. ‘What are you boys going to do? Go to the milking-shed?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
We’ve milked cows plenty of times,’ said Dick. ‘Nice job! I like the smell of
cows. See you later, girls - and if that little Pest tries any tricks, just
give us a call! I’d love to rub his face into that crumby mess on the floor!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
just going to sweep it up,’ said Anne. ‘See you at supper-time!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys went out, whistling. Mrs Philpot had disappeared. Only George, Anne and
Timmy were left, for Snippet had gone out with the Harries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
rather wish we hadn’t come,’ said George, carrying out a tray to the scullery.
‘It’s an AWFUL lot for Mrs Philpot to do. Still - if she needs the money...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
well - we can help - and we’ll be out most of the day,’ said Anne. ‘We shan’t
see much of Junior - little beast!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>You’re
wrong, Anne. You’ll see far too much of him! It’s a good thing Timmy’s there -
he’s the only one that can manage people like Junior!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
and Anne went out to find the others in the milking-shed. There were plenty of
cows there, swishing their tails. The milking was almost finished, and the
twins were driving some of the cows back to their field.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo
- how did you get on?’ asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Fine
- it was fun,’ said Dick. ‘My cows did better than Julian’s, though - I sang to
them all the time, and they loved it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ass!’
said George. ‘Did you have a talk with the farmer?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- he says he’s got an old Land-Rover and he’ll take us all over the farm
tomorrow,’ said Dick, pleased. ‘And we can ride on that tractor, if Bill -
that’s one of his farm-hands - will let us. He says Bill won’t have Junior on
the tractor at any price - so maybe there’ll be ructions if he sees us on it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I’m all ready for a ruction, and so is Timmy,’ said George grimly. ‘Sooner or
later I’m going to tell Junior a few home-truths.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’d
all like to do that,’ said Julian. ‘But let’s hold our horses till a good
moment comes - I don’t want that nice Mrs Phitpot upset - and you know, if we
caused her to lose the two Americans she might suffer badly - in her pocket! I
bet they pay well.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- I understand all that too, Ju,’ said George. ‘But Timmy doesn’t. He’s longing
to have a go at Junior!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
how I share that feeling!’ said Dick, rubbing Timmy’s big head. ‘What’s the
time? Shall we go for a walk.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said Julian. ‘My legs feel stiff with cycling up so many Dorset hills today. I
vote we just stroll around a bit, not go for miles.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Five set off together, wandering round the farm buildings, They were all very
old, some of them falling to pieces. The roofs had great Dorset tiles, made of
stone, uneven and roughly shaped. They were a lovely grey, and were brilliant
with lichen and moss.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Aren’t
they gorgeous?’ said George, stopping to look at the tiles on a small
out-house. ‘Look at that lichen, did you ever see such a brilliant orange? But
what a pity - half of them have gone from this roof, and someone has replaced
them with horrid cheap tiles!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Maybe
the Philpots sold them,’ said Julian. ‘Old tiles like that, brilliant with
lichen, can fetch quite a bit of money - especially from Americans. There’s
many a barn out in America covered with old tiles from this country, moss and
all. A bit of old England!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
I had a lovely old place like this I wouldn’t sell one single tile, or one
single bit of moss!’ said George, quite fiercely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Maybe
you wouldn’t,’ said Dick. ‘But some would - if they loved their farm enough and
didn’t want to see it go to pieces for lack of money. Their fields would be
worth more than old tiles to them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
bet old Grand-dad wouldn’t sell them if he could help it!’ said Anne. ‘I wonder
if the American has tried to buy any of these tiles? I guess he has.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had an interesting time wandering round. They found one old barn-like shed
stacked with ancient cast-away junk, and Julian rummaged in it with great
interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
at this giant cart-wheel!’ he said, peering into a dark corner. ‘It’s almost as
tall as I am! My word - they must have made all their own wheels here in the old
days - in this very shed, perhaps. And maybe their own tools too. Look at this
old tool - what in the world is it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
gazed at the curious curved tool, still as strong and as good as it had been
two or three centuries before. It was heavy, and Julian thought that he
wouldn’t have liked to use it for more than ten minutes at a time!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
I bet old Grand-dad could use it for a whole day and never get tired,’ he said.
‘When he was a young man, I mean. He must have been as strong as an ox, then.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you remember what the girl at the dairy said,’ put in Anne. ‘She said he had
once fought a bull and knocked it out. We must ask him about that. I bet he’d
love to tell us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
a real old character!’ said Julian. ‘I like him, shouts and temper and all.
Come on - it’s getting latish. We didn’t ask about the evening meal. I wonder
what time we ought to get back for it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Half
past seven,’ said George. ‘I asked. We’d better go back now, because we’ll have
to get ourselves clean - and Anne and I want to help lay the table.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right.
Back we go,’ said Julian. ‘Come on, Tim. Stop sniffing about that old rubbish.
Surely you can’t smell anything exciting there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went back to the farm-house, and the girls went to wash at the kitchen sink,
seeing Mrs Philpot already preparing for supper. ‘Won’t be a minute!’ called
Anne. ‘We’ll do those potatoes for you, Mrs Philpot. I say, what a lovely farm
this is. We’ve been exploring those old sheds.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- they need clearing out,’ said Mrs Philpot, who looked better for the rest she
had had. ‘But old Great-Grand-dad, he won’t have them touched. Says he promised
his Grand-dad not to let them go to anyone! But we did sell some of those
lovely old grey tiles once - to an American, of course, a friend of Mr
Benning’s - and Grand-dad almost went out of his mind. Shouted day and night,
poor old chap, and went about with a pitch-fork in his hand all the time,
daring any stranger even so much as to walk over the fields! We had such a time
with him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
gracious!’ said Anne, having a sudden vision of the grand old man stalking
about his fields, shouting, and waving a great pitch-fork.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Supper
was really a very pleasant meal, for Mr Henning and Junior didn’t come in.
There was much talk and laughter at the table, though the twins, as usual, said
hardly anything. They puzzled Anne. Why should they be so unfriendly? She
smiled at them once or twice, but each time they turned their eyes away.
Snippet lay at their feet, and Timmy lay under the table. Great-Grand-dad was
not there, nor was Mr Philpot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’re
both making the best of the daylight,’ said Mrs Philpot. ‘There’s a lot to do
on the farm just now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children enjoyed the meat-pie that Mrs Philpot had baked, and the stewed plums
and rich cream that followed. Anne suddenly yawned a very large yawn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sorry!’
she said. ‘It just came all of a sudden. I don’t know why I feel so sleepy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’ve
set me off now,’ said Dick, and put his hand in front of an even larger yawn.
‘Well, I don’t wonder we feel sleepy. Ju and I set off at dawn this morning -
and I know you girls had a jolly long bus-ride!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you go to bed, all of you, as early as you like,’ said Mrs Philpot. ‘I expect
you’ll want to be up bright and early in the morning. The Harries are always up
about six o’clock - they just will not stay in bed!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
what time does Junior get up?’ asked George, with a grin. ‘Six o’clock too?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
not before nine o’clock usually,’ said Mrs Philpot. ‘Mr Henning comes down
about eleven - he likes his breakfast in bed. So does Junior.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘WHAT?
You don’t mean to say you take breakfast up to that lazy little pest?’ said
Dick, astounded. ‘Why don’t you go and drag him out by the ankles?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- they are guests and pay well for being here,’ said Mrs Philpot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
take Junior his breakfast,’ said George, much to everyone’s astonishment.
‘Timmy and I together. We’d like to. Wouldn’t we, Timmy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
made a most peculiar noise from under the table. ‘That sounded like a laugh to
me,’ said Dick. ‘And I’m not surprised! I’d just like to see Junior’s face if
you and Tim walked in on him with his breakfast!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
you bet me I won’t do it?’ demanded George, really on her mettle now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I do bet you,’ said Dick at once. ‘I bet you my new pocket-knife you won’t!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Taken!’
said George. Mrs Philpot looked puzzled. ‘No, no, my dears,’ she said. ‘I can’t
have one guest waiting on another. Though I must say those stairs are a trial
to my legs, when I’m carrying up trays!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
take up Junior’s tray and Mr Henning’s too, if you like,’ said George, in a
half-kind, half-fierce voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘NOT
Mr Henning’s,’ said Julian, giving George a warning look. ‘Don’t go too far,
old thing. Just Junior’s tray will be enough.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right, all right,’ said George, rather sulkily. ‘Aren’t Junior and Mr Henning
coming in to supper?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
tonight,’ said Mrs Philpot, in a thankful voice. ‘They’re dining at some hotel
in Dorchester, I think. I expect they get a bit tired of our simple farm-house
meals. I only hope they won’t be too late back. Great-Grand-dad likes to lock
up early.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children were really glad when the evening meal was cleared away and washed up,
for they all felt heavy with sleep. The good strong air, the exciting day and
the many jobs they had done had really tired them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
night, Mrs Philpot,’ they said, when everything was done. ‘We’re off to bed.
Are the twins coming too?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
twins actually condescended to nod. They looked tired out. Julian wondered
where Mr Philpot and old Great-Grand-dad were - still out working, he supposed.
He yawned. Well, he was for bed - and even if he had had to sleep on the bare
ground that night, he knew he would sleep well! He thought longingly of his
camp-bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went their various ways - the twins and Julian and Dick to the big barn - the
girls upstairs to the room opposite Junior’s. George peeped into it. It was
even untidier than before, and obviously Junior must have been eating nuts up
there, for the floor was strewn with shells.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were soon in bed - the girls cuddled together in the big, rather hard, old bed,
the boys in their separate camp-beds. Timmy was on George’s feet, and Snippet
slept first on one twin’s feet, and then on the other’s. He was always
perfectly fair in his favours!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
crashing noise awoke the girls about two hours later, and they sat upright in
bed, alarmed. Timmy began to bark. George crept to the top of the stairs,
hearing Grand-dad’s loud voice below, and then crept back to Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
Mr Henning and Junior come back,’ she said. ‘Apparently old Grand-dad had
locked up, and they crashed and banged on the knocker. My, what a to-do! Here
comes Junior!’ And indeed, here Junior did come, stamping up the stairs, and
singing loudly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Little
pest!’ said George. ‘Wait till I take him his breakfast tomorrow!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was fun to sleep in the barn. Dick tried to keep awake for a while, and enjoy
the barn-smell, and the sight of the stars in the sky seen through the open
door, where a cool little night-breeze came wandering in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
fell asleep at once, and did not even hear the crashing of the knocker at the
front door of the farmhouse when the Hennings came in, or the loud voices. He
awoke with a start at about one o’clock in the morning, and sat straight up in
bed, his heart beating fast. What on earth was that noise he had heard?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
heard it again and laughed. ‘What an ass I am! It’s only an owl. Or maybe more
than one. And gosh, what was that high little scream? A mouse - or a rat?
Perhaps the owls are hunting in here?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
lay still and listened. He suddenly felt a rush of cool air over his face, and
stiffened. That must have been an owl’s soft-feathered wings! Owls’ wings made
no noise, he knew. The feathers were so soft that not even a quick-eared mouse
could hear an owl swooping silently down!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
came another little high-pitched squeak. ‘The owl’s doing his job well,’
thought Julian. ‘What a fine hunting-place for him - a barn where food-stuffs
are stored - over-run with mice and rats, of course. I bet this owl is worth his
weight in gold to the farmer. Well, owl, do your job - but for goodness’ sake
don’t mistake my nose for a mouse! Ah - there you go again - just over my head.
I saw you then - a shadow passing by!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
fell asleep once more and didn’t wake until the sun streamed into the barn,
lighting up hundreds of tiny motes floating in the air. Julian looked at his
watch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Half
past seven! And I meant to be up at seven. Dick! Wake up!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
was so sound asleep that he didn’t wake even when Julian shook him. He merely
rolled over and settled down again. Julian glanced across the barn, and saw
that the twins’ camp-beds were empty. They had stacked their pillows and
bed-clothes in neat piles, and disappeared silently out of the door. Without
waking us! thought Julian, pulling on his socks. I wonder if I can wash at the
big kitchen-sink. ‘Dick - will you wake up?’ he said loudly. ‘It might be TEN
O’CLOCK for all you care!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
heard the two shouted words and sat up at once, looking aghast. ‘Ten o’clock?
Oh no! Gosh, I must have slept all round the clock, Oh, I say - I didn’t mean
to be late for breakfast. I...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Calm
down,’ grinned Julian, brushing his hair. ‘I only said, “It might be ten
o’clock for all you care!” Actually, it’s just gone half past seven.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thank
goodness for that,’ said Dick, lying back in bed. ‘Oh for ten minutes more!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
twins have gone already,’ said Julian. ‘I wonder if the girls are up. Oh my
goodness, what’s that?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Something
had jabbed him sharply in the back, making him jump violently. Julian swung
round, expecting it to be Junior or one of the twins playing a silly joke.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
- it’s you - Nosey the jackdaw!’ he said, looking at the cheeky bird, now
perched on his pillow. ‘You’ve got a jolly sharp beak!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Chack!’
said the jackdaw, and flew to his shoulder. Julian felt flattered - until the
jackdaw pecked his ear! ‘Here - you take the bird,’ he said to the unwary Dick
and handed Nosey to him. Nosey promptly pounced on the watch lying beside
Dick’s pillow and flew off with it. Dick gave an angry yell.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Bring
that back, you ass of a bird! Don’t you know a watch when you see one? He’s
taken my watch, Ju - goodness knows where he’ll hide it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
gone into the roof,’ said Julian. ‘We’d better tell the twins. Perhaps they can
deal with him. Now WHY doesn’t he take Junior’s watch - that would be a trick I
should really applaud!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘CHACK,
CHACK, CHACK,’ said Nosey, exactly as if he agreed. He had to open his beak to
say ‘chack’ and the watch promptly fell out. It bounced on to a sack far below,
and the bird swooped down to get it. Dick also swooped, and as the watch had
now slipped between two sacks, he managed to get it before the jackdaw.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nosey
flew up into the roof, and chacked angrily. ‘Don’t use such bad language,’ said
Dick severely, strapping on his watch. ‘You ought to be ashamed of yourself!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went out of the barn and round to the farmhouse. There were sounds of people
about, and the two boys felt quite ashamed of being so late! Breakfast was on
the table, but already quite a number of people seemed to have had it!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
girls haven’t had theirs,’ said Dick, looking at the places set in front of the
chairs where George and Anne had sat the night before. ‘But the twins have. It
looks as if everyone has, except us four, apparently! Ah - here’s Mrs Philpot.
Sorry we’re late. We overslept, I’m afraid.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
all right!’ said Mrs Philpot, smiling. ‘I don’t expect my visitors to be up
early. Anyone can sleep late on a holiday!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
held a tray in her hands, and set it down on the table. ‘That’s for Mr Henning
- he’ll ring when he wants his breakfast. That’s Junior’s tray over there. I
make the coffee when they ring,’ she said, and went out again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was cold ham for breakfast, boiled eggs and fruit. The two boys tucked in, and
looked round reprovingly when the two girls came, with Timmy behind them, still
sleepy-eyed. ‘Overslept, I suppose?’ said Dick, pretending to be shocked. ‘Sit
down. I’ll pour you some coffee.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
Junior - not down yet, I hope?’ said George anxiously. ‘I’ve not forgotten my
bet about taking up his breakfast!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say - do you think it’s all right to let George take up Junior’s breakfasts
said Julian, after a pause. ‘George, don’t throw the tray at him or anything,
will you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
might,’ said George, eating a boiled egg. ‘Anything to get your new
pocket-knife from you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
don’t go too far in teasing Junior,’ said Julian warningly. ‘You don’t want to
make the Henning family walk out and leave Mrs Philpot high and dry!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right, all right,’ said George. ‘Don’t nag. I think I’ll have another egg,
Dick. Pass one over, please. I don’t know why I’m so hungry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Leave
a bit of room for this ham,’ said Dick, who had cut himself two good slices.
‘It’s out of this world! Simply too good to be true! I could eat it all day.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two girls tucked into their breakfast, and just as they were finishing, a bell
rang very loudly in the kitchen, jangling just above their heads. They jumped
violently. Mm Philpot came into the room at once. ‘That’s Mr Henning’s bell,’
she said. ‘I must make his coffee.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
take up his tray,’ said Anne. ‘George is going to take up Junior’s.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no - I really don’t like you to do that,’ said Mrs Philpot, distressed. Just
then another bell rang. It jangled to and fro for a very long time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
Junior’s bell,’ said Mrs Philpot. ‘He always seems to think I’m quite deaf!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Bad-mannered
little beast!’ said Dick, and was pleased to find that Mrs Philpot didn’t
disagree!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
waited till Mr Henning’s tray was ready, and then firmly put her hands to the
sides. ‘I’m going to take it to Mr Henning,’ she said in a most determined
voice, and Mrs Philpot smiled gratefully and let her lift it. ‘Bedroom on the
left of the stairs, first floor!’ she said. ‘And he likes his curtains pulled,
too, when his breakfast is brought.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
does Junior like his pulled as well?’ inquired George, in such a sugary voice
that the two boys looked round at her suspiciously. What was she up to now?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- I do pull them for him,’ said Mrs Philpot, ‘but don’t you pull them if you
don’t feel like it! Thank you very much, dear!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
had already gone upstairs with Mr Henning’s tray, and now George set off with
Junior’s. She winked at Dick. ‘Get that pocket-knife ready for me!’ she said,
and disappeared through the door, grinning wickedly. She went carefully
upstairs with Timmy close at her heels, wondering whatever George was doing
with a tray!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
came to Junior’s door. It was shut. She gave it a violent kick and it flew
open. She entered, clattering with her feet, and set the tray down on a table
with a jolt that upset the coffee. She went whistling to the windows, and
pulled the curtains back across the poles so that they made a loud clattering
noise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Junior
had apparently fallen asleep again, his head under the clothes. George upset a
chair with a crash. That made Junior sit up, half scared. ‘What’s going on
here?’ he began. ‘Can’t you bring my breakfast without ...’ Then he saw that it
was George in the room, not the kindly Mrs Philpot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Get
out!’ he said angrily. ‘Crashing about like that! Pull the curtains across
again. The sun’s too strong. And look how you’ve spilt the coffee! Why didn’t
Mrs Philpot bring my breakfast? She usually does. Here - put the tray on my
knees, like she does!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
whipped the bed-clothes off him, took up the tray and set it down violently on
his pyjama’d knees. The hot coffee got a violent jerk and some drops fell on to
his bare arm. They were hot, and he yelled loudly. He lashed out at George, and
hit her hard on the shoulder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
was a very great mistake. Timmy, who was at the door watching, leapt on to the
bed at once, growling. He pulled the terrified boy on to the floor, and kept
him lying there, standing over him, deep growls coming from the depths of his
great body.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
took absolutely no notice. She went round the room, humming a little tune,
putting this and that straight, tidying the dressing-table, not seeming to
notice what Timmy was doing. She shut the door so that no one would hear
Junior’s howls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George
- take this dog off me!’ begged Junior. ‘He’ll kill me! GEORGE! I’ll tell my
Pop of you. I’m sorry I hit you. Oh, no take this dog off me, PLEASE do!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
began to weep, and George looked scornfully down at him. ‘You nasty spoilt
little pest,’ she said. ‘I’ve a good mind to leave you here all morning, with
Timmy on guard! But this time I’ll be generous to you. Come here, Tim. Leave
that funny little worm there on the floor!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Junior
was still weeping. He crept into bed and wrapped the blankets round him. ‘I don’t
want any breakfast,’ he wept. ‘I’ll tell Pop about you. He’ll lam you all
right.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
you tell him,’ said George, tucking him in so tightly that he couldn’t move.
‘You tell him - and I’ll whisper into Timmy’s ear that you’ve told tales of me
- and honestly, I simply don’t know what he’ll do!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
are the most horrible boy I’ve ever met,’ said Junior, knowing when he was
beaten. George grinned. So he thought she was a boy, did he? Good!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mrs
Philpot isn’t going to bring up your breakfast any more,’ she said. ‘I’m going
to - with Timmy. See? And if you dare to ring that bell more than once each
morning, you’ll be sorry!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t want my breakfast brought up,’ said Junior, in a small voice. ‘I’d rather
get up and go downstairs for it. I don’t want you to bring it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right.
I’ll tell Mrs Philpot,’ said George. ‘But if you change your mind, just tell
me. I’ll bring it up any morning - with Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
went out and banged the door, Timmy trotting down the stairs in front of her,
puzzled but pleased. He didn’t like Junior any more than George did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
went into the kitchen. Dick and Julian were still there. ‘You’ve lost your bet,
Dick,’ said George. ‘Pocket-knife, please. I not only took up his breakfast,
and accidentally spilt hot coffee on him, but Timmy here pulled him out of bed
and stood over him, growling. What a sight that was! Poor Junior doesn’t want
his breakfast in bed any more! He’s coming down for it each morning.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
for you, George!’ said Dick, and slid his pocket-knife across the table. ‘You
deserve to win. Now - sit down and finish your breakfast and mind - I’m not
betting anything else for a long, long time!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
twins, Harry and Harriet, had had their breakfast some while ago. They now came
into the big kitchen, Snippet at their heels, and scowled to see the Five still
having breakfast there. Anne was in fits of laughter over George’s account of
the way she had dealt with Junior.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
should have seen his face when I planked the breakfast tray on his knees, and
the hot coffee splashed him!’ said George. ‘He let out a yell that startled
even old Timmy. And when he hit me, and Timmy leapt on the bed and dragged him
out on to the floor, his eyes nearly fell out of his head!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
wonder he’s decided to come down to breakfast each morning, then,’ said Julian.
‘He’ll be scared stiff of you appearing with a breakfast tray again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
twins listened to this in amazement. They looked at one another, and nodded.
Then they walked up to the breakfast table, and for once in a way, only one
twin spoke. Whether it was Harry or Harriet, nobody knew, for they both looked
so much alike.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
happened?’ said the twin to George. ‘Why did you take up Junior’s breakfast
tray.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Because
we were all so fed up with the way Junior - and his Pop - impose on your
mother,’ said George. ‘Fancy a boy having breakfast in bed!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
old George took it into her head to take up his breakfast herself, and said
she’d teach him such a lesson he’d be a bit more considerate of your mother in
future,’ said Dick. ‘What’s more, I was idiotic enough to bet George she
wouldn’t do it - and now she’s won my best pocket-knife off me - look!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
proudly displayed the knife. The twins each gave a sudden loud laugh, which
surprised the others very much. ‘Well, I’m blessed!’ said Dick. ‘Fancy you
being able to laugh! You always look so fierce and unfriendly. Well, now that
you’ve condescended to talk to us, let me tell you this - we think your mother
is absolutely tops, and far from giving her more trouble, we’re all going to
help as much as we can. Got that?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Both
twins were smiling broadly now. They took it in turns to speak, which was
really much more friendly than their usual stiff way of talking in unison.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
hate Junior!’ said one twin. ‘He thinks our mother is a kind of slave, to come
when he rings for her, or shouts for her.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘His
father’s the same,’ said the other twin. ‘Wanting this and that, and sending
our mother all over the place to fetch and carry for him. Why doesn’t he go and
stay at a hotel?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
doesn’t because he’s so set on snooping out our old things and buying them,’
said the other twin. ‘I know for a fact that Mother has sold him some of her
own things - but she just had to have some money; things are so expensive, and
we grow out of our clothes so quickly.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say - it is nice to hear you talking properly,’ said Julian, clapping the twin
on the back. ‘And now would you mind letting us know how to tell which of you
is which? I know one’s a boy and one’s a girl, but you both look exactly alike
to me - you might be two<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>boys!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
twins gave sudden, mischievous grins. ‘Well - don’t you tell Junior, then,’
said one. ‘You can always tell me by this scar on my hand, see? Harriet hasn’t
any scar. I’m Harry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four looked at the long thin scar on the boy’s hand. ‘I got that by tearing the
back of my hand on barbed wire,’ said Harry. ‘Now you’ll know us from each
other! I say - tell us all about George and the breakfast tray, from beginning
to end. Good old George. She looks just as much a boy as Harriet does.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was very pleasant to find the twins so friendly, after their stiff, sullen
dislike. The four warmed to them - and when Mrs Philpot suddenly appeared in
the kitchen to clear away breakfast, she was astounded to see her twins talking
and laughing gaily with the others. She stood and stared, a delighted smile on
her face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mother!
Junior’s not going to have breakfast in bed any more!’ said Harry, ‘Listen
why!’ And the story had to be told all over again. George went red. She was
half afraid that Mrs Philpot would be really displeased. But no, she threw back
her head and Iaughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
that really does me good,’ she said. ‘But I hope Junior doesn’t tell his
father, and they don’t both go off in a hurry! We do need their money, you
know, much as I hate having them here. Now I must clear away breakfast!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
you mustn’t. That’s our job,’ said Anne. ‘Isn’t it, twins?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘YES!’
said both twins together. ‘We’re all friends now, Mother - let them belong to
the family.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I’ll go and see to the chickens, then, if you’re going to clear away,’ said Mrs
Philpot. ‘You can wash up, too, bless you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
- how would you like to go round the farm in our old Land-Rover today?’ said
Harry to the others. ‘It’s the best way to see over the farm. I think Bill’s
got to go round this morning, and check on the fields and the stock. He’ll take
you, if I ask him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Fine!’
said Julian. ‘What time?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘In
about half an hour,’ said Harry. I’ll find Bill - and when you hear a horn
hooting, come on out. By the way, Bill isn’t much of a talker, but if he takes
to you, he’ll be quite pally.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Julian. ‘Can Dick and I do something while the girls are clearing away?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh
yes, there’s ALWAYS something to do on a farm,’ said Harry, ‘Come on up to the
chicken-houses - Harriet and I are patching them up to stop the rain leaking
in.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and Dick, with Timmy behind them, immediately went off with the twins, now as
merry and friendly as before they had been dour and sullen! What a change!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
thank goodness I took Junior’s breakfast up to him, and put him in his place,’
said George, folding up the table-cloth. ‘It was apparently just the one thing
that would make the twins friendly! Hark, Anne, I believe that’s Junior
coming.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
slipped behind the dresser, while Anne set the chairs straight round the table.
Junior came creeping in very quietly indeed, and looked round fearfully. He
seemed very relieved to find only Anne there. He considered that she was quite
harmless!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
that dog?’ he asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
dog?’ said Anne innocently. ‘Snippets?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
- that great ugly mongrel - and that awful boy he belongs to,’ said Junior,
still fearful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
you mean George, I suppose,’ said Anne, amused that Junior thought George was a
boy. ‘Well, look over there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Junior
saw George advancing on him from behind the dresser, gave one agonized yell and
fled, fearing that she had Timmy somewhere behind her. George laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
shan’t have much trouble with him in future,’ she said, ‘I just hope he doesn’t
say too much to his Pop!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
a while they heard the sound of a hooter outside. ‘That’s the Land-Rover,’ said
George, excited. ‘Well, we’ve just finished the washing-up. Hang up the
tea-cloths to dry, Anne. I’ll pop these dishes into the cupboard...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
they were out of the great kitchen door and down the passage that led to the
yard. Not far off was a van-like car, the Land-Rover. It was an old one, very
dirty, and a bit lop-sided. Dick and Julian yelled to the girls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Buck
up! Didn’t you hear us hooting?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls ran to the Land-Rover. Bill, the farmhand, was at the wheel. He grinned
at them and nodded. Timmy greeted George as if he hadn’t seen her for a year
and almost knocked her down in his playfulness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Tim!
Don’t be such an ass!’ said George, ‘planting your great muddy paws all over
me! Where are the twins? Aren’t they coming?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Naw,’
said Bill. ‘They be busy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all got in, and were just about to set off when someone else appeared. ‘Wait!
I’m coming! Wait, I say!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
up ran Junior, full of himself as usual. ‘Jump down, Tim - go to him,’ said
George, in a low voice. And very willingly indeed Timmy leapt down and ran
full-tilt towards the unsuspecting Junior. He gave one loud yell, turned, and
fled for his life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
that’s got rid of him!’ said Dick, with much satisfaction. ‘Look at, Timmy -
he’s laughing all over his hairy old face! You love a joke, don’t you, Tim?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
did indeed look as if Tim was laughing, for he had his mouth wide open, showing
all his teeth, and his tongue was hanging out happily. He leapt back into the
car.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sensible
dog, that,’ said Bill, and then relapsed into his usual silence as he started
up the Land-Rover with a really shattering noise. It moved off towards the
fields.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>How
it jolted! The four clung to the sides of the van, ahnost bumped off their
seats as the Land-Rover jerked its way over field-paths, up hill and down hill,
jolting in and out of deep ruts, appearing to be on the point of overturning at
any minute. Anne wasn’t sure that she liked it much, but the others enjoyed
every minute,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
you’ll see the farm-land,’ said Bill, as they came to the top of the hill.
‘Look yonder! Could be the finest farm in the county, if Mester Philpot had the
money!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Eight<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ALL
ROUND THE FARM<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Five thoroughly enjoyed their ride over the big farm. It spread out in all
directions over undulating hills, and the van swung up and down and continually
lurched round corners. It stopped every now and again so that the children
might see the magnificent views.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Bill
told them the names of the great fields as they passed them. ‘That’s Oak-Tree
Field - that’s Hangman’s Copse over there - that’s Tinker’s Wood Field - and
that’s Faraway Field - the furthest from the farm-house.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Name
after name came from his lips, and it seemed as if the sight of the fields he
knew and loved suddenly set his tongue going. He told them about the stock too.
‘Them’s the new cows over there - give good milk they do - helps a farmer no
end to get money every week for milk, you know. And them’s the bulls, down in
that field. Fine creatures, too - cost a mint of money. But Mester Philpot, he
believes in good animals. He’d rather go without a new car than buy poor stock.
Them’s the sheep right away over there - see, dotted about on those slopes.
Can’t take you to see ’em today, though. You’d like Shepherd. He’s been here so
long and is so old, he knows every inch of the farm!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
relapsed into silence after this unusual spate of talk, and turned down a path
that took the children back towards the farm-house, using a different route, to
show them even more fields.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
were glorious fields of corn, golden in the sun, waving in the breeze with a
wonderful rustling noise. ‘I could sit here for hours and look at that, and
listen,’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Then
don’t you marry a farmer, if so be you wants to do that, for a farmer’s wife
has no time to sit!’ said Bill dryly, and was silent again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
jolted along, shaken to the bones, but loving every minute. ‘Cows, calves,
sheep, lambs, bulls, dogs, ducks, chickens,’ chanted Anne. ‘Corn, kale, beet,
cauliflower - ooh, Bill, look out!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
van had gone at such speed into a deep rut that Anne was nearly flung out.
Timmy shot through the back entrance of the van, and landed on the ground,
rolling over and over. He got slowly to his feet, looking most amazed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy!
It’s all right! It was only a bigger hole than usual!’ shouted George. ‘Buck up
- jump in!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
the Land-Rover didn’t stop, Timmy had to gallop after it, and enter with a
flying leap from the back. Bill gave a snort of laughter, which made the wheel
wobble dangerously. ‘This here old car’s almost human,’ he said. ‘Just jigs
about for joy on a day like this!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
he drove headlong over a slanting path and straight down into a hollow, making
poor Anne groan again. ‘All very well for Bill!’ she said, in Julian’s ear.
‘He’s got the wheel to hang on to!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
spite of the jolting and bumping the Five immensely enjoyed their ride round
the farm. ‘Now we really know what it’s like!’ said Julian, as the Land-Rover
came to a very sudden stop near the farm-house, throwing them all on top of one
another. ‘My word - no wonder old Great-Grand-dad, and Mr and Mrs Philpot love
the place. It’s GRAND! Thanks awfully, Bill. We’ve enjoyed it tremendously!
Wish my people had a farm like this!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Farm
like this? Ay. It’s taken centuries to grow,’ said Bill. ‘All them names I told
you - they’m centuries old too. Nobody knows now who was hanged down in
Hangman’s Copse - or what Tinkers came to Tinkers Wood. But they’m not forgot
as long as they fields are there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
stared at Bill in wonder. Why, that was almost poetry, she thought. He turned
and saw her gazing at him. He nodded at her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
unnerstand all right, miss, don’t you?’ he said. ‘There’s some that don’t,
though. That Mr Henning, he raves about it all - but he don’t unnerstand a
thing. As fer that boy of his!’ And to Anne’s surprise he turned and spat into
the ditch, ‘That’s what I thinks of him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
- it’s just the way he’s been brought up, I expect,’ said Anne. ‘I’ve met heaps
of fine American children, and ...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
that one wants a hiding!’ said Bill, grimly. ‘And if it wasn’t that Mrs Philpot
begged me to keep my hands offen him, he’d be black and blue, that boy! And so
I tell you! Trying to ride on them scarey calves and chasing the hens till
they’re scared off egg-laying - and stoning the ducks, poor critturs - and
slitting sacks of seed just for the fun of seeing it dribble out and waste!
Hoo, wouldn’t I like to shake him till his bones rattled!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four listened in silence, horrified. Junior was much worse than they had
thought, then. George felt very very pleased that she had taught him a lesson
that morning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
you worry any more about Junior,’ said Julian grimly. ‘We’ll keep him in order
while we’re here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
said good-bye and walked back to the farmhouse, stiff and sore from the bumpy,
bone-shaking ride, but with their minds full of the lovely sloping hills, the
blue distance, the waving corn, and the feel of a farmland in good heart.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
was good,’ said Julian, voicing the feelings of the others. ‘Very good. I
somehow feel more English for having seen those Dorset fields, set about by
hedges, basking in the sun.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
liked Bill,’ said Anne. ‘He’s so - so solid and real. He belongs to the land,
just as the land belongs to him. They’re one!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah
- Anne has discovered what farming really means!’ said Dick. ‘I say, I’m most
awfully hungry, but I really don’t like to go and ask for anything at the
farm-house. Let’s go down to the village and get buns and milk at the dairy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes!’ said Anne and George, and Timmy gave a few sharp, short barks as if he
thoroughly agreed. They set off down the lane that led to the village, and soon
came to the little ice-cream shop, half baker’s half dairy. Janie, the small
talkative girl, was there again. She smiled at them in delight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
here again!’ she said, in pleasure. ‘Mum’s made some macaroons this morning.
See - all gooey and fresh!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
how did you guess that we are all very partial to macaroons?’ said Dick,
sitting down at one of the two little tables there. ‘We’ll have a plateful,
please.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What,
a whole plateful?’ exclaimed Janie. ‘But there’s about twenty on a plate!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Just
about right,’ said Dick. ‘And an ice-cream each, please. Large. And don’t
forget our dog, will you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no, I won’t,’ said Janie. ‘He’s a very nice dog, isn’t he? Have you noticed
what lovely smiley eyes he has?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
yes, we have. We know him quite well, you see,’ said Dick, amused. George
looked pleased. She did so like Timmy to be praised. Timmy liked it too. He
actually went up to Janie and licked her hand!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
they had a plateful of delicious macaroons in front of them - and they were
indeed nice, and very ‘gooey’ inside, as Janie had so rightly said. George gave
Timmy one, but it was really wasted on him, because he gave one crunch, and
then swallowed it! He also chased his ice-cream all over the floor again, much
to Janie’s delight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
do you like it at Mrs Philpot’s?’ she asked. ‘Kind, isn’t she?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Very!’
said everyone together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
love being at the farm,’ said Anne. ‘We’ve been all over it this morning, in
the Land-Rover.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Did
Bill take you?’ asked Janie. ‘He’s my uncle. But he don’t usually say much to
strangers.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
he said plenty to us,’ said Julian. ‘He was most interesting. Does he like
macaroons?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oooh
yes,’ said Janie, rather astonished. ‘Everyone likes Mum’s macaroons.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Could
he eat six, do you think?’ asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ooooh
yes,’ said Janie, still astonished, her blue eyes opened wide.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right.
Put six in a bag for me,’ said Julian. ‘I’ll give them to him in return for a
jolly fine ride.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
right down nice of you,’ said Janie, pleased. ‘My uncle’s been on Finniston
Farm all his life. You ought to get him to show you where Finniston Castle used
to stand, before it was burnt down, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Finniston
Castle!’ exclaimed George, in surprise. ‘We went all over the farm this
morning, and saw every field - but we didn’t see any ruined castle.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no, you wouldn’t see anything!’ said Janie. ‘I told you - it was burnt down.
Right to the ground, ages ago. Finniston Farm belonged to it, you know. There’s
some pictures of it in a shop down the road. I saw them, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
Janie, Janie, how many times have I told you not to chatter to customers?’ said
Janie’s mother, bustling in, frowning. ‘That tongue of yours! Can’t you learn
that people don’t want to hear your chatter, chatter, chatter?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
like talking to Janie,’ said Julian, politely. ‘She’s most interesting. Please
don’t send her away.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Janie had fled, red-cheeked and scared. Her mother began to arrange the goods
on the counter. ‘Let’s see now - what did you have?’ she said. ‘Good gracious,
where are all those macaroons gone? There were at least two dozen there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Er
- well - we had almost twenty - and the dog helped, of course - and Janie put
six in a bag for us - let’s see now...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
were twenty-four on that plate,’ said Janie’s mother, still amazed.
‘Twenty-four! I counted them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
five ice-creams,’ said Julian. ‘How much is that altogether? Most delicious
macaroons they were!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Janie’s
mother couldn’t help smiling. She totted up the bill, and Julian paid. ‘Come
again,’ she said, ‘and don’t you let that little gas-bag of mine bore you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
set off down the street, feeling very pleased with life. Timmy kept licking his
lips as if he could still taste macaroon and ice-cream! They walked to the end
of the street, and came to the little lane that led up to the farm. Anne
stopped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’d
like to go and look at the horse-brasses in this little antique shop,’ she
said. ‘You go on. I’ll come later.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
come in with you,’ said George, and she turned to the little shop-window. The
boys walked on by themselves. ‘We’ll probably be helping on the farm
somewhere!’ shouted back Dick. ‘So long!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Just
as Anne and George were going into the shop, two people came out and almost
bumped into them. One was Mr Henning the American, the other was a man they
hadn’t seen before. ‘Good morning,’ Mr Henning said to them, and went into the
street with his friend. Anne and George walked into the dark little shop.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was an old man there, drumming on the counter, looking quite angry. He gave the
two girls such a glare that they felt quite frightened!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
man!’ said the old man, and frowned so fiercely that his glasses fell off. Anne
helped him to find them among the clutter of quaint old trinkets on his
counter. He fixed them on his nose again and looked sternly at the two girls
and Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
you’ve come to waste my time, please go,’ he said. ‘I’m a busy man. Children
are no good to me. Just want to nose round and touch this and that, and never
buy anything! That American boy now - he’s... ah, but you don’t know what I’m
talking about, do you? I’m upset. I’m always upset when people want to buy our
beautiful old things and take them away to a country they don’t belong to.
Now...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
all right, Mr Finniston,’ said Anne, in her gentle voice; ‘You are Mr
Finniston, aren’t you? I just wanted to look at those lovely old horse-brasses,
please. I won’t bother you for long. We’re staying at Finniston Farm, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah
- at Finniston Farm, did you say?’ said the old man, his face brightening.
‘Then you’ve met my great friend, dear old Jonathan Philpot. My very great

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
that Mr Philpot, the twins’ father?’ asked George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
no, no - it’s old Great-Grand-dad! We went to school together,’ said the old
man, excited. ‘Ah - I could tell you some tales of the Finnistons and the
castle they once owned. Yes, yes - I’m a descendant of the owners of that
castle, you know - the one that was burnt down. Oh, the tales I could tell
you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
it was just at that moment that the Adventure began - the Finniston Farm

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
and George looked at the quaint old man, fascinated, as he talked to them. He
stood there behind the counter of his little dark antique shop, surrounded by
things even older than himself, a little bent old man with only a few hairs on
his head. He had a kindly wrinkled face with eyes so hooded with drooping lids
that they seemed to look out through slits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two girls were thrilled to hear that old Mr Finniston was actually descended
from the long-ago Finnistons, who lived in Finniston Castle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
that why your name’s Finniston?’ asked Anne. ‘Tell us about the castle. We only
heard about it for the first time today. But we don’t even know exactly
whereabouts it stood. I didn’t see a single stone when we went round the farm
this morning!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
no, you wouldn’t,’ said Mr Finniston. ‘It was burnt right down to the ground,
you see - and through the centuries people have taken the old stones for
building walls. Ah well - it was a long, long time ago!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
long?’ asked George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
see now - it was burnt down in 1192 - the twelfth century,’ said Mr Finniston.
‘Norman times, you know. Ever heard of the Normans? Schooling isn’t what it
was, I know, so maybe...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course we’ve heard of the Normans!’ said George, indignantly. ‘Every child
knows them! They conquered England, and the first Norman king was William the
First, 1066!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hmm
- that’s right. You’ve had some schooling, then,’ said Mr Finniston. ‘Well, it
was a Norman castle - look, like that one in this picture, see?’ And he showed
them a copy of an old print. They gazed at the stone castle pictured there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
It’s a Norman castle,’ said George. ‘Was Finniston Castle just like that?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
got a copy of an old drawing of it somewhere,’ said the old fellow. ‘I’ll find
it and show it to you sometime. A small castle, of course - but a very fine
specimen. Well, well, you won’t be interested in such details, I know. How it
was burnt down, I don’t know. Can’t find out for certain. The story goes that
it was attacked at night by the enemy, and there were traitors in the castle
itself, who set fire to it - and while the castle folk were fighting the fire,
the enemy walked in and slew nearly all of them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
the castle was no use for living in after that, I suppose,’ said Anne. ‘But
it’s strange there isn’t even a stone to be seen anywhere.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
but that’s where you’re wrong!’ said Mr Finniston, triumphantly. ‘There are
stones from the castle - all over the farm. But only I and old Great-Grand-dad
know where they are now! There’s an old wall with some of the castle stones at
the bottom - and there’s a well - but no, I mustn’t tell you these secrets. You
might tell them to the Americans who come here and buy up all our old
treasures!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
won’t! We promise!’ said both girls at once, and Timmy thumped his tail on the
floor, as if he too agreed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
maybe Great-Grand-dad will show you one or two of the old castle stones,’ said
Mr Finniston. ‘But I doubt it - I doubt it! I’ll tell you one thing you can see
at the farm-house, though - everybody knows about it, so it’s no secret. Have
you seen the old kitchen door, that leads out into the yard?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
That oak door, studded with iron knobs, do you mean?’ said Anne at once.
‘They’re quite fashionable now as front doors in ordinary houses, you know.
Surely that farmhouse door isn’t a real old one?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr
Finniston put his head into his hands and groaned as if he were in pain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Fashionable!
FASHIONABLE! What will they do next? Surely you can’t mix up that fine old door
with the trashy copies you’ve seen in modern houses? What’s the world coming
to? Couldn’t you feel that that door was real - was as old as the centuries -
and once hung on great hinges in a castle? Don’t you know when things are grand
with the weight of years?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,’
said Anne, rather out of her depth, ‘I did notice the door - but, you see, it’s
very dark just there, and we really can’t see it very clearly.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah
well - most people go about with their eyes shut half the time!’ said Mr
Finniston. ‘You have a look at that door - feel it - look at the great knocker
on it. Think of the old Norman folk who hammered on the door with it, all those
ages ago!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
sighed. This kind of thing didn’t interest her as much as it interested Anne. A
thought suddenly struck her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
Mr Finniston - if the castle was built of stone - how was it burnt to the
ground?’ she said. ‘What happened?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can’t find out,’ said Mr Finniston sadly. ‘I’ve been into every old library in
the county, and looked up every old book of that period - and I’ve delved into
the old records in Finniston church. As far as I can make out, the castle was
stormed by enemies - and, as I said, a traitor inside set fire to it at the
same time. The floors fell in, and the castle was left blazing from top to
bottom. The great walls fell inwards and covered the base - and the Finniston
family fled. Lord Finniston was killed - but his Lady took the children and hid
them - it’s said she hid them in the old chapel, near the barns of the farm.
Maybe she took them down a secret underground passage, leading from the
dungeons to the old chapel itself.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘An
old chapel - is it still there?’ asked Anne. ‘Or was it burnt too?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
- it wasn’t burnt. It’s still standing,’ said Mr Finniston. ‘Old
Great-Grand-dad will show you.’ He shook his head sorrowfully. ‘It’s a
store-house for grain now. Sad, sad. But, mind you - it’s still full of
prayer!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls stared at him, wondering what he meant. They began to think he must be a
little mad. He stood with his head bent, saying nothing for a while. Then he
looked up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
that’s the story, my dears - and it’s not only a story, it’s history! It
happened over seven hundred years ago. And I’ll tell you something else...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What?’
asked the two girls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
castle had cellars - and dungeons!’ said the old man. ‘The fire only burnt down
to the ground floor, which was made of earth flattened down, not wood, so it
wouldn’t burn. The cellars and dungeons can’t have been destroyed - are they
still there, undamaged? That’s what’s been in my mind all these long years.
What was down in those cellars - and is it still there?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
spoke in such a hollow voice that the girls felt quite scared. George recovered
herself first. ‘But why were the dungeons never uncovered?’ she asked. ‘I mean,
surely someone must have thought of them and wondered about them?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
when the castle fell, and the walls collapsed, any underground entrances must
have been completely covered with enormously heavy stones,’ said Mr Finniston,
peering at them earnestly. ‘The peasants and farm-hands living around couldn’t
possibly move them, and maybe they were too scared to, anyhow. They probably
lay there for years, till the wind and weather broke them up. Then they were
taken to build walls and line wells. But by that time everyone had forgotten
about dungeons. Might have been centuries later, you see.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
stood and brooded for a while, and the girls waited politely for him to go on.
‘Yes - everyone forgot ... and everyone still forgets,’ he said. ‘Sometimes I
wake up in the night and wonder what’s underground there. Bones of prisoners?
Chests of money? Things stored away by the Lady of the castle? I wake up and
wonder!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
felt uncomfortable. Poor old man! He lived absolutely in the past! His mind had
weaved for him a living fantasy, a story that had no certain foundation, no
real truth. She was sorry for him. She wished she could go and see the place
where the old castle had once stood! It would be overgrown with grass and
weeds, nettles would wave there, and poppies dance in the summer. There would
probably be nothing at all to show where once a proud castle had stood, its
towers high against the sky, flags flying along the battlements. She could
almost hear the cries of the enemy, galloping up on horseback, and the fearful
clash of swords! She shook herself and stood up straight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
as bad as this old man!’ she thought. ‘Imagining things! But what a tale! The
others will love to hear it. I wonder if the American knows it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Does
that American, Mr Henning, know the old story?’ she asked, and the old man
straightened up at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
the whole of it - only what he has heard in the village!’ he said. ‘He comes
here and pesters me. He’d like to bring in men and dig up the whole thing! I know
him! He’d buy up all the farm, just for the sake of getting that castle site -
if he really knew there was something worth having, deep under the ground where
it once stood. You won’t tell him what I’ve told you, will you? I’ve talked too
much. I always do when someone’s upset me. Ah - to think my ancestors once
lived in Finniston Castle - and here I am now - a poor old man in a little
antique shop that nobody comes to!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we’ve come to it,’ said Anne. ‘I did want to buy some horse-brasses, but I’ll
come another time. You’re upset now. You go and have a rest!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went out of the little shop, almost on tiptoe! ‘My word!’ said George,
thrilled. ‘I just can’t wait to tell the boys! What a story - and it really
sounded true, Anne, didn’t it? I vote we find out where that old castle really
stood, and then go and have a look round. Who knows what we might find! Come
along - let’s get back to the farm as quickly as we can!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
and George, with Timmy running in front, went back to the farm to find the
boys, but they couldn’t see them anywhere and gave it up. Then they went
indoors and found Mrs Philpot shelling peas. They took over the job at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
boys are still helping to mend the henhouse,’ said Mrs Philpot. “The Harries
are pleased to have two more pairs of hands to help them! Something always
seems to need repairing! If only we could get a few things we need so badly - a
new tractor, for instance. But they cost so much! The barns want mending too,
and the hen-houses are almost falling down!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hope the harvest will be good for you,’ said Anne. ‘That will help, won’t it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes - we’ll keep our fingers crossed for fine weather from now on!’ said Mrs
Philpot. ‘Thank goodness the cows are such good milkers! What we should do
without our milk-money, I really don’t know! But there - why should I bother
you with my troubles when you’re here for a nice holiday!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
don’t bother us - and we think it’s awfully nice of you to let us help,’ said
Anne. ‘We shouldn’t like it if you didn’t!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls had no chance of telling the boys what old Mr Finniston had told them,
until the afternoon came. They were up at the henhouses with the two Harries
and Snippet, happily hammering and sawing. Snippet was delighted to have so
many people whistling cheerily round him, and busily took bits of wood from one
boy to another, under the mistaken impression that he was a great help!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nosey
the jackdaw was there too, but he wasn’t nearly so popular as Snippet! He
pounced on any bright nail or screw he saw, and flew off with it, heedless of
the exasperated shouts that followed him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Blow
that jackdaw!’ said Julian, looking up crossly. ‘He’s just taken the very nail
I wanted! Nosey by name and nosey by nature!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
twins laughed. They seemed entirely different children now that they were
friendly - amusing, helpful and most responsible. Julian and Dick admired them
- no work was too hard, no hours were too long if they could help their mother
or father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
hated you coming here because we knew it would give Mother so much more work,’
said Harry. ‘We thought if we were beastly to you, you’d go. But you don’t make
more work! You help an awful lot. It’s fun to have you here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hope the girls are back,’ said Dick. ‘I know your mother wants help with the
peas - such a lot of people to shell for - let me see - counting in your
Great-Grand-dad, there will be about a dozen people in to dinner. Whew! I
certainly do hope the girls are in. Ah - here comes that nosey jackdaw again.
Look out, Dick, he’s after those screws. Snippet, chase him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Away
went the tiny poodle after the cheeky jackdaw, barking in his high little
voice, thoroughly enjoying having so many children round him. Nosey flew up on
to the top of the hen-house, and flapped his wings, chacking rude things in a
very loud voice indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dinner
was rather a crowded meal, for everyone was there. Great-Grand-dad frowned when
he saw Mr Henning come in with Junior. Junior strutted to his place at table,
giving George his best scowl. However, she was just as good at scowling as
Junior, and Mr Henning, who happened to catch sight of her giant-size scowl,
had quite a shock.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now,
now, my boy,’ he said to her. ‘Why pull such an ugly face?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
told him that George was a girl. Mrs Philpot was really very much amused. She
liked George, and couldn’t help thinking she would have made a very good boy
indeed!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Er
- Mrs Philpot - would it be all right if I bring a friend to lunch here
tomorrow?’ asked Mr Henning. ‘He’s called Durleston - Mr Durleston - and he’s a
great authority on antiques. He’s going to give me some advice. You’ll remember
that you told me you had a quaint old hole in the wall in one of the bedrooms -
where in the old days people used to heat embers for warming-pans, and bricks
to put in between the bed-sheets. I thought I...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
thought you could buy ’em, I suppose!’ suddenly shouted old Great-Grand-dad
from his place at the head of the table. He thumped on the cloth with the
handle of his knife. ‘Well, you ask my permission first, see? This place is
still mine. I’m an old man, I’m nearly ninety, but I’ve still got all my wits
about me. I don’t like this selling of things that have been in our family for
donkeys’ years! That I don’t! And...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now,
now, Grand-dad, don’t excite yourself,’ said Mrs Philpot, in her gentle voice.
‘Surely it’s better to sell old things that we shall never use, in order to buy
a new set of tools, or wood to mend the barns?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
can t we sell ’em to our own folks, then?’ shouted Great-Grand-dad, banging
with his fork as well. ‘Taking them out of the country! Part of our history,
they are! Selling our birthright, that’s what we’re doing - for a mess of
pottage! That’s out of the Bible, let me tell you, Mr Henning, in case you
don’t know.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘SHURE
I KNOW,’ said Mr Henning, getting up and shouting back at Great-Grand-dad. ‘I’m
not as ignorant as you seem to think. You ought to be glad that a poor,
run-down, back-dated country like Britain has got anything to sell to a fine
upstanding one like America! You...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
enough, Mr Henning,’ said Mrs Philpot, with such dignity that Mr Henning
blushed red, and sat down in a great hurry. ‘Sorry, mam,’ he said. ‘But that
old man, he gets under my skin. Sure he does! What’s gotten into him? All I want
is to buy things you want to sell. You want new tractors - I want old junk and
I’m willing to pay for it. That’s all there is to it - buying and selling!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>OLD
JUNK!’ shouted Great-Grand-dad again, banging with his glass now. ‘Do you call
that great old cart-wheel you bought OLD JUNK? Why, that’s more than two
hundred years old! My Great-Grand-dad made it - he told me so, when I was a
mite of a boy. You won’t find another wheel like it in England. HOO - that
wheel was made before the first American was born! I tell you...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now,
now, Grand-dad, you know you’ll feel ill if you go on like this,’ said Mrs
Philpot, and she got up and went to the old man, who was shaking with fury.
‘You belong to old times, and you don’t like the new times, and I don’t blame
you. But things change, you know. Calm yourself, and come with me and have a
lie-down.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Surprisingly,
the old fellow allowed Mrs Philpot to lead him out of the room. The seven
children had all sat silent while the shouting had been going on. Mr Philpot,
looking worried, broke his habitual silence and addressed a few words to the
equally worried-looking Mr Henning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Storm
in a tea-cup,’ he said. ‘Soon blow over.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hmmmm,’
said Mr Henning. ‘Spoilt my dinner! Selfish, ignorant, rude old man.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
not,’ said one of the twins, in a voice trembling with anger. ‘He’s...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Enough,
Harry!’ said his father, in such a stern voice, that Harry subsided at once,
but began to grind his teeth, to show that he was still angry, making a most
remarkable noise at the now silent table. Junior had sat as still as a mouse
all the time, scared of the angry old man. Timmy had given a few small growls,
and Snippet had shot straight out of the kitchen as soon as Great-Grand-dad had
begun to shout!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs
Philpot came back, and sat down, looking sad and tired. Julian began to talk to
her about Janie and the macaroons, and soon succeeded in making her smile. She
even laughed out loud when George told her that they had six macaroons to give
Bill for taking them out in the Land-Rover.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
know those macaroons,’ announced Junior. ‘I buy about thirty a week. They’re
just wunnerful!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thirty!
No wonder you’re so pasty-faced, then,’ said George, before she could stop
herself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Aw
shucks! Pasty-face yourself!’ retorted Junior, feeling safe with his father
near him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
heard a sudden ominous growl under the table, felt hot breath on his bare leg,
and decided to say no more. He had forgotten all about the watchful Timmy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
thought it was about time to have some bright conversation, and began to tell
Mrs Philpot about the hen-houses and what a good job they were making of
patching them to make them rain-proof. Mr Philpot listened too, nodded, and
actually joined in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- you’re good with your hands, you boys. I had a look when I came by. Fine
work!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Harriet’s
good, too,’ said Harry at once. ‘She did that corner where the rats get in.
Didn’t you, Harry?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wanted to help, Pop, but they shooed me off, like I was a hen!’ said Junior in
an aggrieved tone. ‘Seems as if they don’t want me around. That makes it pretty
lonely, Pop. Can’t I come out with you this afternoon?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said Pop, shortly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Aw,
c’mon, Pop,’ said Junior, in a whiny voice. ‘Aw shucks, Pop, lemme come!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘NO!’
said Pop, exasperated. Timmy gave a growl again. He didn’t like cross voices.
He couldn’t imagine why there was so much quarrelling here, and sat up, tense
and still, until George gave him a gentle push with her toe. Then he lay down
again, his head across her feet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
was glad when the meal was over, delicious though the food had been. The girls
and Harriet insisted that Mrs Philpot should go and have a rest while they did
all the clearing-away and washing-up. ‘Now try not to be unkind to Junior this
afternoon,’ she said, as she went. ‘He’ll be all alone when his father’s gone.
Do let him be with you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
answered. They hadn’t the least intention of allowing Junior to be with them.
‘Spoilt, bad-mannered little idiot!’ thought George, clearing away with such
vigour that she almost knocked Anne over.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian,’
she said in a low voice, catching him at the door as he went out, ‘Anne and I
have something interesting to tell you. Where will you be this afternoon?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Up
in the hen-houses, I expect,’ said Julian. ‘We’ll watch out for you and Anne.
See you in about half an hour.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Junior
had sharp ears. He heard exactly what George had said, and he was full of
curiosity at once. What was this interesting thing George wanted to tell the
boys? Was it a secret? All right - he’d be on hand somewhere to hear it!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
so, when the girls had finished their work, and set off to the hen-houses,
Junior followed discreetly behind! He kept well out of sight until he saw
George and Anne disappear into a henhouse, where the others were working - and
then he crept to a corner outside and put his ear to a knot-hole in the wood.
I’ll get my own back now! he thought. I’ll make them smart for leaving me out
of things! Just see if I don’t!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys were busy hammering and sawing and the girls sat and waited till the noise
died down. Snippet was there, leaping about ridiculously with little bits of
wood in his mouth, and Nosey the jackdaw had suddenly taken a fancy to the
shavings that now covered the floor, and ran about chacking, and picking them
up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Outside
the hens clucked and squawked, and not far off the ducks quacked loudly. ‘Those
are the kind of noises I like to hear,’ said Anne, settling herself on a sack
in a corner. She raised her voice and shouted above the hammering to Dick.
‘WANT ANY HELP, DICK?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
thanks,’ said Dick. ‘We’ll just finish this job, then sit down and have a rest,
and listen to what you have to say. You sit and watch our wonderful
carpentering! Honestly, I’d make pounds a week if I took it up!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
out - Nosey has got your nails again!’ shouted George. Timmy leapt up as if he
was going to chase Nosey, and the jackdaw promptly flew up to a crossbeam, and
sat there chacking with laughter. Timmy thought him a very exasperating bird
indeed. He lay down again with a thump.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
last the boys had finished the job they were on, and sat down, rubbing their
hands over their wet foreheads. ‘Well, now you can tell us your news,’ said
Dick. ‘Good thing we got rid of that little pest of a Junior - I might have
hammered a few nails into him by mistake if he’d come worrying us this
afternoon.’ He imitated Junior’s whining drawl. ‘Aw, shucks, Pop, lemme come
with yew!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Outside,
his ear to the hole, Junior clenched his fists. He would willingly have stuck a
few nails into Dick at that moment!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
and Anne began to tell the four listening children what old Mr Finniston had
told them that morning. ‘It’s about Finniston Castle,’ said Anne. ‘The old
castle that gave the village its name - and the farm as well. The old fellow
who told us about it is called Finniston, too - and will you believe it, he’s a
descendant of the Finnistons who lived in the castle centuries ago!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
seems to have spent most of his life trying to discover everything possible
about the old castle,’ said George. ‘He said he’d delved into old libraries -
and into the church records here - anywhere that might help him to piece
together the castle’s history!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Outside
the hen-house, Junior held his breath so as not to miss a single word. Why -
his Pop had told him that he couldn’t get anything out of that old Mr Finniston
at the antique shop - not a word about the castle, and its history, or even
where the site was. Then why had he told Anne, and that horrible boy George?
Junior felt angry, and listened even more keenly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
story goes that in the twelfth century enemies came to attack the castle one
night - and there were traitors already inside it, who set it on fire, so that
the castle-folk would be busy trying to put out the fire, and wouldn’t be prepared
for a fight,’ said George. ‘The inside of it was burnt right down to the ground
- and then the great stone walls outside collapsed inwards, and lay in enormous
heaps there, covering the place where the castle had stood.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Whew!’
said Dick, visualizing it all. ‘What a night that must have been! Everybody
killed or burnt, I suppose?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
the Lady of the castle wasn’t killed and it is said that she took her children
to the little chapel near the farm-house - we really must go and see that,
twins - and they stayed there in safety. Anyway, some of the family must have
escaped, because it is one of their descendants who keeps that little antique
shop - old Mr Finniston!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
is tremendously interesting,’ said Julian. ‘Where’s the site of the castle? It should
easily be known, because of the great mass of stones that fell there when the
walls collapsed.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
they’re not there now,’ said George. ‘Mr Finniston said he thought that when
the wind and weather had broken them up small enough to be lugged away by the
farmers and peasants living near by, they were taken to build field walls, or
to line wells. He said there were some on this farm. He didn’t know himself
where the castle once stood, because the site would be all grown over, and with
no stones left to mark it, it wouldn’t be easy to find.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
oh, Julian, I wish we could find it!’ cried Anne, her voice rising in
excitement. ‘Because, so Mr Finniston says, the cellars and dungeons are
probably still there, quite untouched. You see, no one could uncover them for
years, because of the heavy stones there - and when the stones were taken away,
people had forgotten about the castle and the dungeons!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh!
So they may still be there - with whatever was stored in them hundreds of years
ago,’ said Dick, thrilled. ‘My word - there might be priceless things there, as
old as the hills! I mean, even an old broken sword would be worth its weight in
gold, because it would be so very very old. I say - don’t say a word of all
this in front of that American, or he’d dig up the whole farm!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
shouldnt DREAM of it,’ said George. ‘He shan’t get to hear a word of this.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Alas!
George little knew that every single word had been overheard by Junior, whose
left ear was still pinned to the knot-hole in the wood! His face was red with
surprise and delight. WHAT a secret! Whatever would his Pop say? Dungeons!
Perhaps full of gold and jewels and all kinds of things! He rubbed his hands
together in delight, thinking that he would soon get even with these annoying
children now - as soon as his Pop came home, he’d spill everything to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>GEE!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
heard the small sound of Junior rubbing his hands together, and sat up,
growling, his ears pricked. Snippet growled too, a miniature little sound that
nobody took seriously. Timmy then heard Junior creeping away, afraid because he
had heard the big dog growling. Timmy growled again, and then barked sharply,
running to the shut door of the hen-house, scraping at it with his foot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Somebody’s
outside - quick! If it’s Junior, I’ll throw him on to the muck-heap!’ yelled
Dick, and flung open the door. They all trooped out and looked round - but
there was nobody there! Junior had shot off at top speed, and was now safely
behind the nearest hedge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
was it, Tim?’ said George. She turned to the others. ‘He may have heard those
hens scratching near the door,’ she said. ‘There’s no one about. Gosh, I was so
afraid that it was that little sneak of a Junior! He’d tell his Pop every
single thing!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Twins,
listen - Mr Finniston told us that one of the things that was saved from the
castle - or found afterwards, perhaps - was a great old oak door,
iron-studded,’ said Anne, suddenly remembering. ‘Is that one of your kitchen
doors?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- that must be the door leading into the dark little passage,’ said Harry. ‘You
wouldn’t have noticed it particularly, because it’s usually kept open, and it’s
very dark just there. Gosh, I suppose it could have come from the castle. It’s
enormously thick and strong. I wonder if Dad knows.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
tell him,’ said Harriet. ‘I say - shall we go and look for the site of the
castle sometime? If only we could find it! Do you suppose that if we found the
cellars and dungeons, full of chests and things, they’d belong to us? The farm
belongs to our family, of course, and all the land round.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Does
it? Well then, of course anything found on this land would be yours!’ said
Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
might be able to buy a new tractor!’ said the twins, both together, in the same
excited voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
go and look for the castle-site now,’ said George, her voice sounding so
excited that Timmy sat up and barked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
We must finish this job,’ said Julian. ‘We promised we would. There’s plenty of
time to hunt around, because nobody knows about this except us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was wrong, of course. Junior knew - and Junior meant to tell the whole secret
to his father as soon as ever he could! He could hardly wait for him to come
home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we’d better be getting back to the house,’ said George. ‘We told Mrs Philpot
we’d pick some raspberries for supper tonight, so we’d better fetch baskets,
and begin. Oh, I do HOPE we find that castle-site. I shall dream about it
tonight, I know I shall.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
try and dream where it is,’ said Julian, with a laugh. ‘Then you can lead us
straight to it tomorrow morning. I suppose you haven’t any idea where it might
be, have you, twins?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
they said together, frowning. ‘No idea at all!’ And Harriet added, ‘You see,
the farm’s so big - and I suppose it might have been built anywhere on our
land.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- but probably near the top of a hill,’ said Julian. ‘Castles used to overlook
surrounding land, you know, so that approaching enemies could easily be seen.
And then again, George said Mr Finniston told them that the Lady of the castle
escaped with her children and took them in safety to the chapel, which wouldn’t
be very far away. I should guess that the castle-site must be not further than
a quarter of a mile from the chapel, so that narrows the search down a bit. By
the way, we really must look at that chapel - it sounds interesting, even
though it has been used as a store-house for years!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls picked raspberries for the rest of the afternoon, and the boys finished
their jobs. They went back to the farm-house for tea, feeling pleasantly tired.
The girls were already there, laying the table. They pounced on the twins, and
George spoke excitedly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Twins!
We’ve been looking at the old studded door. It’s MAGNIFICENT! Come and see it,
Julian and Dick. If it isn’t from the old castle, I’ll eat my hat - and my shoes
as well!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
took them to the great door that opened from the kitchen into the passage that
led to the yard. With much difficulty she swung it shut. They all gazed at it.
It had been almost too heavy for George to move! It was very stout and strong,
made of old, old oak. Great iron studs had been driven into it so deeply and
firmly that only by destroying the door itself could they ever be removed.
There was a curious iron handle in the middle of the outer side, and George
raised it and brought it down smartly. A loud bang resounded through the
kitchen, and made the others jump.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
knocker that visitors used when they came to the castle, I suppose!’ said
George, laughing at their surprised faces. ‘Noise enough to rouse everyone, and
alert any guard at once. Do you suppose it was the front door of the castle -
it’s big enough! It must be worth hundreds of pounds!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
out - there’s Junior!’ said Anne, in a low voice. ‘He’s grinning all over his
face. What do you suppose he’s been up to? I wish I knew!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

teatime Julian spoke to Mrs Philpot about the old kitchen door. ‘That’s a fine
old door,’ he said. ‘Did it come from the castle, do you suppose?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- so it’s said,’ answered Mrs Philpot. ‘Great-Grand-dad here knows more about
it than I do, though.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Great-Grand-dad
was not at the table. He was sitting in his enormous old chair in the window
with Snippet at his feet. He was pulling contentedly at his pipe, a cup of tea
on the window-sill beside him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
that?’ called the old man. ‘Speak up!’ Julian repeated what Mrs Philpot had
said, and the old fellow nodded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
ay! That door’s from the castle all right. Made of the same oak as the beams in
the barns, and the floors of the bedrooms above! Ay, and that American fellow’s
been at me about it, too! Ho! Offered me fifty pounds for it. FIFTY POUNDS! I
wouldn’t take a thousand. What - have that old door hanging in some newfangled
house out in that American country, wherever it is? NO. I say NO, and I’ll say
it till I’m blue in the face!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right, Grand-dad - don’t upset yourself,’ said Mrs Philpot. She spoke to Julian
in a low voice. ‘Change the subject, quickly, or Grand-dad will go on and on,
poor old fellow!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
racked his brain for a change of subject, and fortunately remembered the
hen-houses. He at once began to tell Great-Grand-dad all they had done that
afternoon, and the old fellow calmed down at once, and listened with pleasure.
Snippet, who had run in fright to the twins as soon as Great-Grand-dad had
begun to shout, ran back to him, and settled on his feet. Timmy also decided to
join them, and soon Great-Grand-dad was completely happy again, drawing on his
old pipe, with one dog at his feet, the other resting a great head on his knee.
Timmy certainly did love Great-Grand-dad!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr
Henning did not come back that night, much to everyone’s relief, but arrived
next day just before lunch, bringing with him a dried-up little fellow wearing
thick glasses, whom he introduced as Mr Richard Durleston.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
great Mr Durleston!’ he said proudly. ‘Knows more about old houses in England
than anyone else in the country. I’d like him to see that old door after lunch,
Mrs Philpot - and that queer opening in the wall of the bedroom upstairs, which
was used to heat embers and bricks for warming beds years ago.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Fortunately
Great-Grand-dad was not there to object, and after they had had dinner, Mrs
Philpot took Mr Durleston to the old studded door. ‘Ah yes,’ he said. ‘Quite
genuine. Very fine specimen. I should offer two hundred pounds, Mr Henning.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>How
Mrs Philpot longed to accept such an offer! What a difference it would make to
her housekeeping! She shook her head. ‘You’d have to talk to old
Great-Grand-dad,’ she said. ‘But I’m afraid he’ll say no. Now I’ll take you to
see the queer old opening up in one of the bedrooms.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
took Mr Henning and Mr Durleston upstairs, and the four followed, with Timmy.
It was indeed a strange opening in the wall! It had a wrought-iron door rather
like an old oven door. Mrs Philpot opened it. Inside was a big cavity, which
had obviously been used as a kind of oven to heat bricks for placing into cold
beds; some of the old bricks were actually still there, blackened with long-ago
heating! Mrs Philpot took out what looked like a heavy iron tray with an
ornamented raised edge. On it were old, old embers!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
tray was used for heating and holding the embers before they were put into
warming-pans,’ she said. ‘We still have one old warming-pan left - there on the
wall, look.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four, just as interested as the two men, looked at the copper warming-pan,
glowing red-gold on the wall. ‘The red-hot embers were emptied into that,’ Mrs
Phil-pot told the children, ‘and then the pan was carried by its long handle
into all the bedrooms, and thrust into each bed for a few minutes to warm it.
And that funny little opening in the wall is, as I said, where people years and
years ago heated the embers - and the bricks too, which were wrapped in flannel
and left in each bed.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hmmmmm.
Very interesting. Quite rare to see one in such a well-preserved state,’ said
Mr Durleston, peering into the opening through thick glasses. ‘You could make
an offer for this too, Mr Henning. Interesting old place. We’ll have a look at
the barns too, I think, and the outbuildings. Might be a few things there you
could pick up with advantage.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
thought it was a good thing the twins were not with them to hear all this. They
seemed to share with their Great-Grand-dad a hatred of parting with any of the
treasures belonging to the old farm-house!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs
Philpot took the two men downstairs again, and the four followed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
just take Mr Durleston to the old chapel, mam,’ said Mr Henning, and Mrs
Philpot nodded. She left them and hurried back into the kitchen, where she had
a cake baking. The four looked at one another, and Julian nodded his head
towards the two men, now making their way out of doors. ‘Shall we go too?’ he
said. ‘We haven’t seen this chapel yet, either!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
they followed the two men, and soon came to a tall, quaint old building with
small and beautiful arched windows set high up in the walls. They went in at
the door, a few paces behind the two men, and stared in wonder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- you can see it was once a chapel!’ said Julian, speaking instinctively in a
low voice. ‘Those lovely old windows - that arch there...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
the feel of it!’ said Anne. ‘I know now what old Mr Finniston down at that
little shop meant, when he said that though it was now a store-house, it was
still full of prayer! You can feel that people have been here to pray, can’t
you? What a lovely little chapel. Oh, I do wish it wasn’t used as a
store-house!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
was told by an old fellow down in the village antique shop that a Lady
Phillippa, who was once the Lady of the castle, brought each of her fifteen
children here to learn their prayers,’ said Mr Durleston, surprisingly. ‘Hmm,
hmm - nice old story. Probably true. Chapels were often built near to castles.
Wonder which path they took from the castle to the chapel. All gone now, no
castle, nothing! Hmm, hmm.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’d
like to buy this chapel, knock it down, and take it stone by stone to my place
in the States,’ said the American enthusiastically. ‘Fine specimen, isn’t it?
It would look wunnerful in my place.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Can’t
advise that,’ said Mr Durleston, shaking his head. ‘Not in good taste. Let’s go
to those out-buildings yonder. Might see something in the old junk there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went off, and the children stayed behind, entranced with the little chapel.
Sacks upon sacks of grain and what looked like fertilizer were arranged in rows
all over the floor. A cat had three kittens cuddled together on one sack, and a
dove cooed somewhere high up in the arched roof. It was a very peaceful sound,
somehow just right for the silent little place. The children trooped out
quietly, not feeling inclined to follow the brash Mr Henning round any more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘At
least the other man stopped him from his mad idea of removing the chapel stone
by stone,’ said Anne. ‘I couldn’t bear that beautiful old place to be torn up
by its roots and replanted somewhere else.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
sound quite angry, Anne - almost as fierce as old Great-Grand-dad!’ said
Julian, slipping his arm through his sister’s. ‘I don’t somehow think the old
chapel will be sold to Mr Henning - even if he offered a million dollars for
it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I like most Americans very much,’ said Anne. ‘But not Mr Henning. He - he wants
to buy history just as if it were chocolate or toffee!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
made the others laugh. ‘I say!’ said Julian, ‘what about having a snoop round,
now we’re out, and just see if we can decide where to hunt for the site of the
castle? I presume we all agree that it can’t be very far away from the chapel?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- that’s agreed,’ said Dick. ‘And it’s also agreed that the site is probably on
a hill. The snag is that there are rather a lot of hills on this undulating
farmland!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
make our way over there - up the nearest slope,’ said George. ‘Hallo, here are
the twins. We’ll call them. They might like to come.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
twins soon joined them, and said yes, they would certainly like to hunt for the
castle-site. ‘But it might take years!’ said Harry. ‘It might be anywhere on
the farm!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we plan to examine this first slope,’ said Julian. ‘Heel, Tim, heel, Snippet.
Oh gosh, here’s Nosey the jackdaw too. NOT on my shoulder, if you don’t mind,
Nosey. I rather value my ears!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Chack!’
said the jackdaw, and flew to the twins.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
made their way up the slope. There was, however, absolutely nothing to be seen
except grass, grass, grass! They came to a big mound and stood looking at it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
very large mole must have made that!’ said Dick, which made them all laugh, for
the mound was as high as their shoulders. Rabbit-holes could be seen at the
bottom, though it was probable that very few burrowed there now - the great
rabbit-disease, myxomatosis had wiped them practically out of existence on
Finniston Farm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
couldn’t see a rabbit-hole without scraping at it, and soon he and Snippet were
scattering earth over everyone. Snippet was small enough to disappear into one
hole, and came out carrying - of all things - an oyster shell! Julian took it
out of his mouth in amazement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
here - an oyster shell - and we’re miles from the sea. How did it get there? Go
in again, Snippet. Scrape hard, Timmy. Buck up! An idea is glimmering in my
brain!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before
long, what with Timmy’s excited scraping and Snippet’s explorations deep into
the burrow, quite a collection of oyster shells, and small and large bones, lay
on the grass!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Bones!’
said Anne. ‘Not bones of people surely! Don’t tell me this is a mound covering
an old grave or something, Ju.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
But it is something rather exciting!’ said Julian, ‘I’m pretty sure it’s an old
kitchen-midden.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
kitchen-midden? What on earth’s that?’ said George. ‘Oh look - Timmy’s got
another mouthful of oyster shells!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
kitchen-midden is what you might call the rubbish-heap of the old days,’
explained Julian, picking up some oyster shells, ‘It was often very big, when
it comprised the rubbish thrown out from large houses - or castles! Things like
bones and shells wouldn’t rot away like other rubbish - and I do believe we’ve
found the kitchen-midden of the old castle. My word - what a find! Now we know
something very important!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What?
asked everyone, in excitement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- we know now that the site of the castle must be somewhere on this slope!’
said Julian. ‘The kitchen-midden was probably not far from its walls. We’re on
the scent, scouts, we’re on the scent! Come on - let’s go further on. Spread
out. Examine every inch of the ground!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>JUNIOR
SPRINGS A SURPRISE!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
six children felt a sudden upsurge of excitement, and Timmy felt it too and
barked loudly. Snippet joined in, and the jackdaw danced up and down on Harry’s
shoulder, chacking hoarsely. Junior, who had seen them start out and was
tracking them, stared in surprise from behind a bush in a nearby hedge. NOW
what was all the excitement about? What had Timmy and Snippet found?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
saw the six children spread out and begin to go slowly up the great slope of
the hill. Timmy followed them, rather puzzled. He wished he knew what they were
looking for - then he could hunt too! Junior kept safely behind the bush. He
knew that if he followed too closely after the children, Timmy would hear him,
and bark.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly
the Harries gave a shout. ‘Hey!’ The others looked up from their search, and
saw them beckoning in excitement. ‘What about THIS? Come and look!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
hurried over to the twins, who were standing on a little ridge about two
hundred yards below the top of the gently sloping hill. ‘Look!’ said Harry,
sweeping his arm in a circle. ‘Would this be a likely place for the
castle-site?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four looked at the great shallow depression that the twins pointed to. In shape
it was like a very shallow soup-plate, certainly big enough for a castle to
have been built there! It was covered with thick, closely-growing grass, which
was a little darker in colour than the grass around.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
clapped Harry on the shoulder. ‘Yes! I bet this is where the castle once stood!
Why should the ground here suddenly have this great depression in it, as if it
had sunk down, for some reason? The only reason could be that some enormously
heavy building once stood here - and it must have been the castle!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
not too far from the kitchen-midden, where they threw their rubbish, is it?’
asked Anne, anxiously, looking back to see how far away that was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
- just about right,’ said Julian. ‘They would be sure to have it some distance
away, because it would smell, especially in the hot weather. Yes, twins - I
think you really have hit on the castle-site - and I bet if we had the
machinery to excavate here, we’d come across dungeons, cellars, underground
passages - and all they contain!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
twins went red with excitement, and stared solemnly at the great basin-like
circle, green with grass. ‘What will our mother say?’ they said, both together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Plenty!’
said Dick. ‘This might be the saving of your farm! But look - let’s not say a
word about it yet, in case it gets round to Mr Henning. Let’s get Bill and ask
him if he’ll lend us spades and things. We’ll tell him we’ve found some
interesting old shells and bones on the hill and want to do a little digging.
We’ll soon know if this really is the site of the castle.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
idea,’ said Julian, excited at the thought of being one of the first to dig
down into the old dungeons! ‘Let’s pace round this old site and see how big it
is.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
walked round and round it and decided it was more than big enough for even a
large castle. They thought it was strange that the grass should be a different
colour there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
it does sometimes happen that grass marks out where old buildings once stood,’
said Julian. ‘I say - this is just about the most exciting thing that ever
happened to us - and I’m so glad it was the twins who first recognized the
site! After all, it’s on their farm!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Isn’t
that Junior, running over there?’ said George suddenly, as she saw Timmy prick
up his ears, and turn his nose to the wind. ‘Yes, it is. He’s been spying on
us, the little beast! There he goes, look!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
he can’t know much,’ said Julian, gazing after the running figure. ‘I don’t
expect he even knows that a castle was once built here, at the top of this hill
- and he certainly wouldn’t know we were looking for the site. He’s just
snooping, that’s all.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Junior did know all about the old castle, for he had overheard the children
talking in the hen-house! And he did know what they had been looking for! He
had followed them as closely as he dared, listening to their shouts - and now
he felt that he must get back to his father and tell him what he knew!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
found his father still with Mr Durleston, examining an old fireplace. ‘Now
that’s worth buying,’ Mr Durleston was saying. ‘You could rip that out, and use
it in your own house - a beautiful thing! Very old! And...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Pop!
I say, Pop! Listen!’ cried Junior, bursting in. Mr Durleston looked annoyed.
That boy again! But Junior took no notice of the old man’s annoyance, and
pulled urgently at his father’s arm. ‘Dad! I know where the place is that the
castle once stood on! And there’s dungeons and cellars underneath, full of
treasure, I know there are. Pop, those kids found the place, but they don’t
know I saw them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
is all this, Junior?’ said his father, half-annoyed too. ‘Silly talk! You don’t
know anything about castle-sites and dungeons and the rest!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
do, I do! I heard them all talking in the henhouse - I told you I did!’ cried
Junior, tugging at his father’s sleeve again.‘Pop, they’ve found an old
rubbish-heap too, that belonged to the castle - they called it a - a - let me
see now - a...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
midden?’ asked Mr Durleston, suddenly taking an interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes!
That’s it. A kitchen-midden!’ said Junior triumphantly. ‘With bones and shells.
And then they looked for where the old castle might have been built - they said
it couldn’t have been far away, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
they were right,’ said Mr Durleston. ‘A kitchen-midden would certainly
pin-point the castle area! Mr Henning, this is extremely interesting. If you
could get permission to excavate, it would be a...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
BOY!’ said Mr Henning, interrupting, his eyes almost starting out of his head.
‘Can’t you see the papers - “American discovers old castle-site - unknown for
centuries! Excavates dungeons - find bones of long-ago prisoners - chests of
gold coins...” ’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
so fast, not so fast,’ said Mr Durleston, disapprovingly. ‘There may be nothing
at all there. Let us not count our chickens before they’re hatched. And mind -
not a word to the newspapers, Henning. We don’t want a crowd of people rushing
to pry over the farm, sending up its price!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
didn’t think of that,’ said Mr Henning, a little cast-down. ‘All right - we’ll
go carefully. What do you advise?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
should advise you to approach Mr Philpot - not the old Great-Grand-dad, but the
farmer himself - and offer to put down, say, £250 for the right to excavate up
on the hill there,’ said Mr Durleston. ‘Then if you strike anything
interesting, you can offer a further sum for whatever’s down there - say
another £250. If there is anything there, it will be extremely valuable - so
very, very old. Hmmm. Hmmm. Yes, that is my advice to you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
it sounds pretty good to me,’ said Mr Henning, excitement flooding him again.
‘You’ll stay here and advise me, won’t you, Durleston?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Certainly,
certainly, if you are prepared to pay my fee,’ said Mr Durleston. ‘I think it
would perhaps be advisable if I approached Mr Philpot, Mr Henning, not you. You
might - er - well - give something away in your excitement. You will come with
me, of course - but let me do the talking.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,
old man, you do everything!’ said Mr Henning, feeling friendly with the whole
world. He clapped the listening Junior on the back. ‘Well done, son! You may
have let us into something good. Now don’t you breathe a word to ANYONE, see?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Aw
shucks!’ said Junior. ‘What do you think I am? My mouth’s sewn up from now on!
Think I’d split, Pop, when there’s a chance of getting even with those snooty
kids? You go on up that hill when they’ve gone, and have a look yourself. Mr
Durleston will know if it’s the real thing or not!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So,
when the six children and dogs were safely out of sight, gone to help with
various jobs of work on the farm, Mr Henning and Mr Durleston went with Junior
to see the kitchen-midden and the supposed site of the old castle. Mr Henning
became very excited indeed, and even the weary-looking Mr Durleston brightened
up and nodded his head several times.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Looks
the real thing!’ he said. ‘Yes, we’ll get going this evening - after that
fierce old fellow - the old Great-Grand-dad - has gone to bed. He might put a
spoke in our wheels. He’s as old as the hills, but as cute as a jackdaw!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
so, that evening, when Great-Grand-dad was safely in bed, Mr Henning and Mr
Durleston had a private, very private talk with Mr and Mrs Philpot together.
The farmer and his wife listened, amazed. When they heard that Mr Henning
proposed to hand them a cheque for £250 merely for the right to do a little
digging, Mrs Philpot almost cried!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
I have advised Mr Henning that he should offer you further sums, if he finds
anything he would like to take back to the States with him, as - er - as
mementos of a very pleasant stay here,’ finished Mr Durleston.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
sounds too good to to be true,’ said Mrs Philpot. ‘We could certainly do with
the money, couldn’t we, Trevor?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr
Henning took out his cheque book and produced his fountain-pen, before Mr
Philpot could say anything else. He wrote out the sum of £250, and signed the
cheque with a flourish. He then presented it to Mr Philpot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
I hope there’ll be more cheques to come,’ he said. ‘Thank you, sir - I’ll get
men along tomorrow to start digging.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
have a formal agreement drawn up,’ put in Mr Durleston, thinking that he saw a
rather doubtful look coming over Mr Philpot’s face, as he took the cheque. ‘But
you can cash the cheque straight away. Well, we’ll leave you to talk over it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
the twins and the four heard of this, the next morning, they were astounded.
Mrs Philpot told the twins first, and Harry and Harriet ran at once to find the
others. They listened, amazed and angry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
did they know all that? How did they guess where to find the castle-site?’ said
Dick, fiercely. ‘I bet it’s that snoopy little Junior who put them on to this!
I bet he spied on us! I thought I saw two people up on that hill after tea
yesterday. It must have been Mr Henning and that friend of his - with Junior.
Gosh, I could pull that kid’s hair out!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I suppose there’s absolutely nothing we can do now!’ said George, angrily. ‘The
next thing we’ll see is lorries rolling up with men inside, and spades and
drills and goodness knows what!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
was quite right! That very morning the hill became quite a busy place! Four men
had already been hired by Mr Henning, and they all went up the hill in their
lorry, bumping slowly along, past the kitchenmidden mound, and on up to the
shallow basin-like depression near the summit of the hill. Spades, forks and
drills rattled in the lorry. Junior was mad with joy, and danced about at a
safe distance, yelling defiance at the six children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
thought I didn’t know anything, didn’t you! I heard everything! Serves you
right! Yah!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy
- chase him!’ ordered George, in a furious voice. ‘But don’t hurt him, mind. Go
on!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
off went Timmy at a gallop, and if Junior hadn’t leapt into the lorry and
picked up a spade, Timmy would certainly have rolled him over and over on the
ground!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
what was to be done? The children almost gave up - but not quite! There might
be something they could do - there might! Why was Julian suddenly looking so
excited?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>SNIPPET
AND NOSEY ARE VERY HELPFUL!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘LISTEN!’
said Julian, lowering his voice, and looking all about to make sure that no one
was near. ‘Do you remember what you told us, George, about a secret passage
from the castle to the old chapel?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes!
Yes! I do!’ said George, and Anne nodded, her eyes bright. ‘You mean the story
that old Mr Finniston told us, down at the little antique shop, about the Lady
of the castle taking her children in safety from the burning castle, by way of
an underground passage to the old chapel? Gosh, I’d forgotten that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
Julian! Yes, George is right!’ said Anne. ‘Are you thinking that the passage
might still be there, hidden underground?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
I think is this,’ said Julian. ‘If the Lady and her children escaped
underground, they must first have fled down into the cellars of the castle -
and so the passage or tunnel must have started from there. They couldn’t have
escaped in any other way because the castle was itself surrounded by enemies.
So she must have gone with her children to hide in the cellars - and then, when
the castle fell, she took them safely down the secret passage that led to the
old chapel. So that means...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
means that if we can find the secret passage, we can get into the cellars
ourselves - perhaps before the workmen do!’ cried George, almost shouting with
excitement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Exactly,’
said Julian, his eyes shining. ‘Now don’t let’s lose our heads and get too
excited. Let’s talk about it quietly - and for GOODNESS’ sake keep a watch for
Junior.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy
- on guard!’ said George, and Timmy at once went some paces away, and stood up
straight, looking now in this direction, and now in that. Nobody could come within
sight now, without Timmy giving a warning bark!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children settled down beside a hedge. ‘What’s the plan?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
vote we go to the old chapel, take a line from there to the castle-site, and
walk slowly up that line,’ said Julian. ‘We might possibly see something that
would guide us as to where the secret passage is. I don’t know what - maybe the
grass might be slightly different in colour - a bit darker than the surrounding
grass, just as it was on the castle-site. Anyway, it’s worth trying. If we do
see a line of darker grass, or something like that, we’ll dig down underground
ourselves, hoping the secret passage is underneath!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
Ju! What a wonderful idea!’ said Anne. ‘Come on, let’s go down to the chapel
straight away!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
off they all went, Timmy, Snippet and Nosey the jackdaw too. He loved being
with Snippet, though he teased him unmercifully. They arrived quickly at the
chapel door and went in. ‘I always feel as if there ought to be an organ
playing when I’m inside,’ said Anne, looking round the stacked sacks of grain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Never
mind about organs,’ said Julian, standing at the open door, and pointing up the
hill. ‘Now see - there’s the place where the old castle stood - where the men
are already at work - and if we take a fairly straight line to it, we should be
more or less walking over the old passage. I should think the men who made it
would drive as straight a tunnel as they could, to save themselves work. A
grinding one would take a long time.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can’t see that the grass is any different in colour, along the line I’m
looking,’ said Dick, squinting, and everyone agreed, very disappointed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
there’s nothing to help us!’ said George, mournfully. ‘All we can do is to walk
in a straight line up the hill, and hope to find something that will tell us if
we’re over a tunnel. Hollow-sounding footsteps, perhaps!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
very doubtful, I’m afraid,’ said Julian. ‘Still, I can’t see that we can do
anything else. Come on, then. All right, Tim, you can come back to us. Look at
Nosey, on Snippet’s back again! That’s right, Snippet, roll over and get him
off!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Chack!’
said Nosey, crossly, as he flew up in the air. ‘Chack!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
six children walked up the slope in as straight a line as they could. They came
right up to where the men were digging, without having seen or heard anything
of any help at all. It was most disappomting. Junior saw them, and yelled
loudly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Children
not allowed here! Keep off! My Dad’s bought this place!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Fibber!’
shouted back the two Harries at once. ‘You’ve got the right to dig and that’s
all!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yah!’
yelled Junior. ‘You wait! Now don’t you set that great dog on me again! I’ll
tell my Pop, see?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
barked loudly, and Junior disappeared in a hurry. George laughed. ‘Silly little
fathead! Why doesn’t somebody box his ears? I bet one of the men will before
he’s many hours older. Look at him trying to use that drill!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Junior
was certainly not at all popular. He made himself a great nuisance, and in the
end his father put him roughly into a lorry and told him to stay there. He
howled dismally, but as no one paid any attention, he soon stopped!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
six children went slowly back down the gentle slope of the hill, taking a
slightly different line, still hopeful. The jackdaw flew down to Harry’s
shoulder, chacking loudly, bored with all this walking! He suddenly saw Snippet
sitting down to scratch his neck, and at once launched himself at him. He knew
that the poodle always shut his eyes when he scratched himself, and that that
was a very good time to give him a well-placed peck!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
unfortunately for Nosey the poodle opened his eyes too soon, and saw the
jackdaw just about to perch on him! He snapped at him - and got him by the
wing! ‘Chack-chack-CHACK!’ cried the jackdaw, urgently calling for help.
‘CHACK!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Harry
ran to Snippet, shouting, ‘Drop him, Snippet, drop him! You’ll break his wing!’
Before he could reach the pair, the jackdaw managed to free himself by giving
Snippet a sudden peck on his nose, which made him bark in pain. As soon as he
opened his mouth to bark, the jackdaw dropped on the ground, and scuttled away,
his wing drooping, unable to fly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
poodle was after him in a second! The twins yelled in vain. He meant to catch
that exasperating jackdaw if it was the last thing he did! The squawking bird
looked anxiously for a hiding-place - and saw one! A rabbit-hole - just the
thing to hop down in a trice! In he went with another loud squawk, and
disappeared from sight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
gone down that rabbit-hole!’ said Dick, with a shout of laughter. ‘Clever old
bird. You’re outwitted, Snippet!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
no - Snippet wasn’t! He disappeared down the hole too! He was as small as a
rabbit, and could easily run down a burrow. He had never done more than sniff
at one before, being rather scared of dark tunnels - but if Nosey had gone
down, well, he would too!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children stared in surprise. First the jackdaw - now Snippet! The twins bent
down by the hole and yelled. ‘Come back, Snippet, you idiot! The hill’s
honeycombed with old warrens - you’ll get lost for ever. Come back! Snippet.
Snip-Snip-Snippet, can you<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>hear
us? COME HERE!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was silence down the rabbit-hole. No chack, no bark. ‘They must have gone deep
down,’ said Harry, anxiously. ‘There’s a perfect maze of burrows in this hill.
Dad said there used to be thousands of rabbits here at one time. Hey, Snippet -
COME HERE!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we’d better sit down till they come back,’ said Anne, feeling suddenly tired
with excitement and with climbing up hill and down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Julian. ‘Anyone got any sweets?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
have,’ said George, as usual, and took out a rather grimy packet of
peppermints. ‘Here you are; have one, twins?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thanks,’
they said. ‘We really ought to be getting back - we’ve plenty of work to do!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
sat sucking their peppermints, wondering what in the world the jackdaw and
Snippet were up to. At last Timmy pricked up his ears and gave a small bark,
looking at the entrance of the burrow as he did so. ‘They’re coming,’ said
George. ‘Timmy knows!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sure
enough, Timmy was right. Out came first Snippet, and then Nosey, apparently
quite good friends again. Snippet rushed to the twins and flung himself on them
as if he hadn’t seen them for days. He put something down at their feet.
‘What’s this you’ve found?’ said Harry, picking it up. ‘Some dirty old bone?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
suddenly took it from him, almost snatching it. ‘Bone? No - that’s not a bone.
It’s a small carved dagger with a broken handle - old as the hills! SNIPPET!
Where did you find it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
jackdaw’s got something too!’ cried Anne, pointing to him. ‘Look - in his
beak!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Harriet
caught the jackdaw easily, for he still could not fly. ‘It’s a ring!’ she said.
‘With a red stone in it - look!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
six children gazed at the two strange articles. An old carved knife, black with
age - and an old ring, with a stone still set in it! They could have come from
only one place! George said what everyone was thinking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Snippet
and the jackdaw have been to the cellars of the castle! They must have! That
burrow must have led straight into the tunnel that goes to the dungeons and the
cellars - and they’ve been there! Oh, Snippet - you clever, clever dog - you’ve
told us JUST what we want to know!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George
is right!’ said Dick, jubilantly. ‘We know quite a lot of things now, because
of Snippet and Nosey. We know there must be plenty of things still in those
castle cellars - and we know that somewhere near the end of this burrow is the
secret passage - because that’s the only way they could have got into the
cellars - by using the passage! The burrow led into the passage! Don’t you
agree, Julian?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Rather!’
said Julian, flushed with excitement. ‘My word, this is a bit of good luck!
Hurrah for Snippet and Nosey. Look, the jackdaw’s trying to fly - his wing
isn’t badly hurt - just bruised, I expect. Good old Nosey - little did he know
what his bit of mischief would lead to!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
happens now?’ said George, her eyes shining. ‘Do we dig, too - now that we know
where the passage is? It can’t be very far - and once we’ve got down to it, we
can easily get into the cellars before that American does!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>WHAT

what shall we say then, if he asks why we’re digging?’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Say
silly things - joke about it!’ said Dick. ‘Twins, have you work to do this
morning? Can you find us spades, do you think?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- you can have our spades, and Dad’s old ones, too!’ said Harry. ‘We wish we
could help - but we’ve tons to do, and we’re late already.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
dear - and I promised that George and I woulcl help in the kitchen!’ said Anne.
‘And pick peas for dinner and pod them - and get more raspberries! Can you and
Dick dig all on your own, Ju?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
heavens, yes!’ said Julian. ‘It’ll be slower with just two of us digging, but
we’ll soon get deep down, you’ll see! Anyway, we could all take turns this
afternoon, perhaps, if the twins finish their work.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
will! We’ll do it at top speed!’ said Harry and Harriet together. ‘Now we’ll
get some spades for you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
raced off, with Snippet beside them, and the two girls went down the hill more
slowly, feeling very thrilled. If only, only they could dig down and find the
secret passage from the chapel to the cellars of the old castle! Timmy felt the
excitement and wagged his tail happily. He was always happy when George was
thrilled about anything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Harriet
soon brought two big spades and two smaller ones to the boys. They were heavy,
and she panted as she carried them up the hill.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
girl - or is it good boy?’ asked Dick, as he took the spades. ‘Wait - it’s
Harriet, isn’t it? You’ve no scar on your hand!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Harriet
grinned and ran off swiftly to join her brother in the farm-work that was their
task. Julian gazed after her. ‘They’re good kids,’ he said, as he turned to
drive his spade into the earth. ‘Worth a hundred Juniors! Funny how some
children are made of such good stuff, and other’s aren’t worth a penny. Well,
Dick - go to it! This earth is pretty hard. I wish we could borrow one of those
machines the men are using up there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
dug hard, and were soon very hot indeed. They stripped themselves to their
shorts, but were still far too hot. They greeted Anne with joy when she
laboured up the slope, carrying a jug of cool lemonade and some buns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say! You’ve made quite a hole already!’ she said. ‘How far down do you think
the tunnel will be?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
not too far down, really,’ said Dick, taking a long drink of the lemonade.
‘This is super, Anne. Thanks awfully. We’ve dug into the burrow, and we’re
following it at the moment - hoping it will enter the secret tunnel before
we’re too tired to dig any more!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say - here comes Junior!’ said Anne suddenly, looking up the slope. Sure
enough, it was the American boy, feeling quite brave now that neither Timmy nor
Snippet were about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
stopped a little way away and shouted: ‘What do you think you’re doing, digging
in our hill?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Go
away and lose yourself!’ shouted back Dick. ‘This isn’t your hill! If you can
dig, so can we!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Copy-cats!’
shouted Junior. ‘My Pop’s laughing his head off about you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
tell him to pick it up before it rolls down the hill!’ yelled Dick. ‘Clear
off!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Junior
watched them for a little while, puzzled, and then went off up the hill,
presumably to report to his father. Anne laughed and went back to the
farmhouse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘As
his Pop doesn’t know a thing about the secret passage, he must think we’re off
our heads, digging here,’ said Julian, with a chuckle. ‘Well, let him think so.
He’ll be off his head with rage when he finds out what we’re really doing - and
he won’t know that till we’re in the cellars!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
laughed, and wiped his forehead again. ‘I wish this burrow would come to an
end. And I hope to goodness it does lead into the side of the tunnel. I don’t
want to have to dig up half the hillside. The ground’s so hard and dry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
thank goodness it’s getting sandy here,’ said Julian, driving his spade deeper
down. He suddenly gave a cry. ‘I say! My spade went right down by itself, then!
I believe I’ve come to the secret passage! The burrow must go right through one
side of it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was right! The rabbit-hole ran sideways and down - and into a passage! The boys
dug feverishly now, panting, their hair falling over their foreheads,
perspiration dripping off their faces.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
they had a deep hole, fairly wide - and at the bottom of it a way into the
tunnel beneath! They lay down and peered into it. ‘It’s only about four feet
below the surface,’ said Dick. ‘We might have had to do much more digging than
this! Whew, I’m hot!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
must be dinner-time,’ said Julian. ‘I don’t really like to leave our hole, now
that we’ve got down to the tunnel. And yet we simply MUST have something to
eat. I’m ravenous!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
am I. But if we leave the hole unguarded, that pest of a Junior might come
along and climb down and find the passage!’ said Dick. ‘Look - here comes
George - with old Tim. I wonder if she’d leave him here to guard the hole.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was delighted to hear their news. She gazed down the hole in great excitement.
‘How deeply you’ve dug!’ she said. ‘No wonder you’re hot. My word! - if Mr
Benning knew what you’ve found, he’d be down here in two shakes of a duck’s
tail!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
certainly would,’ said Julian, soberly. ‘That’s what we’re afraid of. Or that
snoopy Junior might climb down into the hole, if he came along. He’s been here
already to see what we’re doing.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’re
scared of going in to dinner, in case one of them comes along and investigates
the hole while it’s unguarded,’ said Dick. ‘And we wondered if...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
George interrupted him, almost as if she knew what he was going to say. ‘I’ll
leave Timmy here on guard, while you come down to dinner,’ she said. ‘He won’t
let anyone come within yards of it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thanks,
old thing,’ said the boys, gratefully, and went off down the hill with George,
leaving Timmy behind. ‘On guard, Timmy,’ said George. ‘On guard. Don’t let
anyone come near that hole.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, understanding at once, and looking fiercely all round and about
him. He lay down with a small growl. Let anyone come near the boys’ hole, if
they dare!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
did dare - but when they saw Timmy leaping to his feet, the hackles on his neck
thick and upright, and heard his deep, continuous growl, Junior and his father
thought better of it, and went on down the hill to have dinner at the
farm-house. Poor Mr Durleston trailed behind them, almost knocked out by the
heat of the sun.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Silly
kids,’ said Mr Henning to Junior. ‘Thinking it’s clever to dig just because
we’re digging! What do they suppose they’ll find down there? Another
kitchenmidden?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Junior
sent a stone scudding along towards Timmy - and then fled for his life as the
dog came bounding angrily down the slope. Even Mr Henning hurried. He didn’t
like Timmy either!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
afternoon the twins, Julian, Dick, George, Anne and Snippet all climbed the
hill to the hole where Tim still lay watching for intruders. They brought him
two fine bones, and a jug of water. He was very pleased indeed. Snippet danced
round, hoping for a bite at a bone, and the jackdaw, his wing apparently quite
recovered now, dared to go and peck at the bigger bone, even though Timmy
growled warningly!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
twins were thrilled to see the deep hole. ‘Can’t we go down now?’ they said,
eagerly, both together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- it would be a jolly good time to let ourselves slide into the tunnel,’ said
Julian. ‘All the men working on the castle-site have gone off to have dinner at
the little village pub, and haven’t yet come back - and the Hennings and Mr
Durleston are safely at the farmhouse.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
go first,’ said Dick, and lowered himself into the hole. He held on to the
grassy edges, and poked hard with his feet, to widen the opening into the
tunnel. Then he let himself slide down until his legs were out of the rabbit
hole, and dangled through the wall of the tunnel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here
we go!’ he said, and let himself drop. Whoooooosh! He slid right into a dark,
musty tunnel, and landed on soft earth. ‘Chuck me down a torch,’ he shouted.
‘It’s pitch-dark in here. Did you remember to bring our torches, George?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yes,
George had four! ‘Look out!’ she said. ‘Here comes one!’ And she dropped it
down the hole. She had already switched it on, so Dick saw it coming and caught
it neatly. He shone it into the dark place around him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes!
It is a tunnel!’ he shouted. ‘The secret passage, no doubt about it! I say -
isn’t this great? Come on down, all of you, let’s share in the find together.
Let’s walk right up to the castle cellars. Come on, everybody! Come on!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>UP

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
held up his torch to the hole, so that the others might see their way. One by
one they slid into the dark tunnel, too excited for words. Timmy came too, and
so did Snippet, but the jackdaw thought better of it, and remained at the
enlarged opening of the burrow, chacking loudly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children swung their torches to and fro. ‘That must be the way down to the old
chapel,’ said Julian, his torch shining down the dark tunnel. No one could
stand upright just there except Timmy, for the roof was low. He sniffed
suspiciously here and there, and kept close to George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- come on!’ said Julian, his voice shaking a little with excitement. ‘We’ll go
straight up, and see where the passage ends. My word - I can hardly wait to see
what’s at the top!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
made their way slowly up the passage. There had been roof-falls here and there,
but not enough to matter. Tree-roots, withered and twining, sometimes caught
their feet. ‘Funny!’ said Harry, in astonishment, ‘there aren’t any trees
growing on the hillside here - why the roots, then?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
may be the remains of the roots of long-ago trees that did once grow on the
hill,’ said Julian, shining his torch up the passage, hoping against hope that
there would be no serious obstacle to their journey. ‘Hallo - what’s this at my
feet? Two feathers! Now how in the world did they get here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was a puzzle! The children examined them earnestly by the light of their
torches. Feathers - looking quite new too - how did they get there? Was there
any other way into the passage - and had the birds found it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
gave a shout of laughter that made everyone jump. ‘We’re idiots! They’re two of
the jackdale’s feathers - they must have dropped out of his bitten wing when he
went down the burrow and up this passage with Snippet after him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course! Why on earth didn’t I think of that?’ said Julian. They went on upwards
once more, and then Julian suddenly stopped again. A curious humming noise had
come down the dark, low tunnel, a throbbing that seemed to get right inside
their heads.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
that?’ said Anne, in great alarm. ‘I don’t like it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all stood there, and felt, like Anne, that the noise was indeed inside their
heads. They shook them, put their fingers into their ears - but it was no good.
The strange throbbing went on and on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
is a bit too mysterious for me,’ said Anne, scared, ‘I don’t think I want to go
on.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
noise stopped, and they all felt better at once - but almost immediately it
started again. To everyone’s surprise, George began to laugh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
all right! It’s only those men at work on the castle-site. It’s their drills we
can hear - throbbing through the hillside, and down this passage right into our
ears. They must be back from lunch. Cheer up, everybody!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all smiled in relief, though Anne’s hands were still shaking a little, as she
held up her torch to shine through the black darkness. ‘There’s not an awful
lot of air here,’ she said. ‘I hope we soon get into the cellars!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
can’t be far,’ said Julian. ‘This tunnel goes in a pretty straight line, just
as we thought it would. Where it curves it’s probable that the long-ago men who
made it were forced to burrow round tree-roots that blocked their way. Anyway,
as we can hear the drills so loudly now, we can’t be far from the castle-site.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were nearer than they thought! Julian’s torch suddenly shone on the remains of
a great door, lying on the ground before him - the door that once shut off the
cellars from the passage! The tunnel ceased just there, and the torches shone
on a vast underground place, silent, full of shadows.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’re
there!’ said Julian, in a whisper that went scurrying round in the darkness and
came back as a strange echo that said ‘there-there-there-there-there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
fallen door must have been the one made all those years gone by!’ said Anne, in
awe. She touched a corner of it with her foot, and the wood crumpled into dust
with a queer little sigh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Snippet
pushed in front of them and ran into the cellars. He gave a short bark as if to
say, ‘Come on - don’t be afraid. I’ve been here before.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
Snippet, be careful!’ said Anne, half afraid that everything would crumble away
at the sound of Snippet’s pattering feet!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
go on - but carefully,’ said Julian. ‘Everything will be ready to crumble into
dust - unless it’s made of metal! It’s a marvel that door was preserved like
that - it looks good enough - but I’m sure if any of us sneezed it would be
gone.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
make me laugh, please, Ju,’ said Dick, stepping carefully round the fallen
door. ‘Even a laugh might do damage down here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
they were all in the blackness of the underground cellars. They flashed their
torches around. ‘What a vast place!’ said Julian. ‘Can’t see any dungeons,
though!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thank
goodness!’ said Harriet and Anne together. They had both dreaded coming across
old bones of long-forgotten prisoners!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
- there’s an archway,’ said George, shining her torch to the right. ‘A fine,
semi-circular arch it is, too, made of stone - and there’s another, look. They
must lead into a main underground chamber, I should think. There’s nothing much
to see just here, except heaps of dirt. It all smells so musty, too!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
follow me carefully,’ said Julian, and led the way towards the stone archways,
his torch shining brightly. They came to one of the beautiful rounded arches
and stood there, all four torches shining brightly into a large underground
room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
cellars here - but just one great underground store-room,’ said Julian. ‘The
roof was shored up with great beams - see, some of them have fallen. And those
stone arches must have borne much of the weight, too. Not one of those has
fallen! They must have stood there for centuries - what wonderful workmanship!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
and the twins were more interested in the great mass of jumble scattered about
round the walls. It was covered with dust that rose lightly into the air when
Timmy brushed against anything. Snippet ran round happily, sniffing everywhere,
and sneezing every now and again as the fine dust went up his nose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Any
treasures, do you think?’ whispered Anne, and the echo came back weirdly,
whispering too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Whispers
seem to echo back more than our ordinary voices!’ said Julian. ‘Hallo - what’s
this?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
shone their torches on to the floor where lay what looked like a heap of
blackened metal. Julian bent down and then gave a loud exclamation. ‘Do you see
what this is? A suit of armour! Almost perfect still. Look, though, it must be
ages old - and here’s<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>another
- and another! Were they old ones, thrown out - or spare ones? Look at this
helmet - grand!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
kicked it gently with his foot, and it gave out a metallic sound and rolled
away a little. ‘Would that be valuable now?’ asked Harry, anxiously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Valuable!
Worth its weight in gold, I should think!’ said Julian, such excitement in his
voice that everyone felt even more thrilled. Harriet called to him urgently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian
- here’s a chest of some sort. Quick!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went slowly over to where she stood, for they had already learnt that any quick
movement raised clouds of fine, choking dust. She pointed to a great dark
chest, its corners bound with iron, and with iron strapping all round it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was made of wood, as black with age as the iron itself. ‘What’s inside, do you
think?’ whispered Harriet, and at once her whisper echoed from every corner. ‘You
think, you think, you think...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
went to sniff at the chest - and to his amazement it disintegrated at once!
Slowly, softly, the sides and the great lid fell into dust that settled gently
on the ground around. Only the iron corners and strapping were left. It was
strange to watch something crumble away before their eyes. Like magic! thought
Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
the wooden sides of the chest crumbled, something shone out brightly in the
light of the torches - something that moved and slid out of the chest, as the
sides fell away - fell with a jingling, clinking, sound, curious to hear in
that silent darkness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children stared in astonishment, hardly believing their eyes. Anne clutched
Julian and made him jump. ‘Ju! What is it? Is it gold?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
bent to pick up one of the rolling pieces. ‘Yes! It’s gold. No doubt about it.
Gold never tarnishes, it keeps bright for ever. These are gold coins of some
sort, treasured and hidden away. There couldn’t have been time to take them,
when the Lady fled with her children - and no one else would be able to get
them, for the castle was burnt down and buried by the falling walls! This hoard
of gold must have lain here untouched all these long years.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Waiting
for us to come!’ said George. ‘Twins - your mother and father needn’t worry
about their farm any more! There’s enough gold there to buy them all the
tractors they want! And that may be only the beginning of the treasures down
here! Julian, there’s another chest, look - like this one, but smaller, and
beginning to fall to pieces. Let’s see what’s inside that! More gold, I hope.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the second chest did not hold gold pieces - it held a different kind of
treasure! One side had burst open, and its contents had dribbled out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Rings!’
said Anne, picking up two from the dust in which they lay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
golden belt!’ said George. ‘And look - these tarnished chains must be
necklaces, because they’re set with blue stones. This must be where the jackdaw
found that ring!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ve
found something else, too!’ called Harry, his excited voice making everyone
jump. ‘Look - racks of swords and daggers! Some are beautifully carved, too!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Clamped
to the wall were iron racks, held in place by great iron rods driven deep into
the hard earth of the wall. Some had loosened and the racks hung crooked, their
knives and swords askew, or lay on the floor. Snippet ran to pick one up - just
as he had done before when he and Nosey first went into the cellars by
themselves!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
wonderful swords!’ said Julian, picking one up. ‘My word, this one’s heavy! I
can hardly hold it! Good gracious - what’s that?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Something
had fallen from the roof of the cellar in which they were standing - a great
piece of old wood, that had originally been placed there as part of the
roofing. At the same time the continual hum of the drilling above rose to a
roar that made the children jump.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
gave a shout. ‘Out of here, quickly!’ he yelled. ‘Those men will soon be
through the roof, and it may suddenly fall and bury us! We’ll have to go at
once!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
snatched a dagger from the rack, and, still with the sword in his hand, ran
back to the entrance of the secret passage, pulling Anne with him, The twins
were last of all, for they had run to get a handful of the gold, and two of the
necklaces and rings. They must show their mother a few of the treasures, they
must!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Just
as they reached the entrance, more of the roof fell. ‘We’ll have to stop this
excavating,’ panted Julian, looking back. ‘If the roof falls in, it may destroy
many of the old treasures there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
hurried into the dark, low tunnel, feeling more excited than they had ever felt
in their lives! Timmy led the way, glad to think they were going out into the
open air once more!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
will Mother say?’ the twins kept saying to one another. ‘WhatEVER will she say!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
six children stumbled down the tunnel, still hearing the far-off sound of the
drills, and fearing that at any moment the cellars would be discovered by Mr
Henning, who, no doubt, would be anxiously watching from above!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came to where they thought the burrow must be, that Dick had dug through - but
instead, there was nothing but a great mass of earth, some of it seeping into
the tunnel! Julian gazed at it by the light of his torch, dismayed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
burrow’s fallen in!’ he said, his voice shaking, ‘What are we to do? We’ve no
spades to dig ourselves out!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
can use our hands,’ said Dick, and began to scrabble at the fallen earth,
sweeping it into the tunnel. But as he scrabbled, more and more earth fell into
the widened burrow, and Julian stopped Dick at once. ‘No more of that, Dick -
you might start an earth-fall, and we’d all be buried alive. Oh gosh - this is
awful! We’ll have to go back up the passage and try to make the men hear us
shouting. BLOW! That means Mr Henning will know what we’re up to.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t believe the men will be there much longer,’ said Dick, looking at his
watch. ‘They pack up at five, and it’s almost that now. My word, we’ve been
ages - Mrs Philpot will wonder where we all are.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
drilling has just stopped,’ said Anne. ‘I haven’t got that awful noise inside
my ears any longer.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘In
that case, it’s certainly no good going back up the tunnel,’ said Julian.
‘They’d be gone before we got there. I say, you know - this is serious. I ought
to have thought of this - any idiot knows that ground entrances to passages
should be strengthened, if they’re newly-dug!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we can always go back to the cellars and wait for the men to come tomorrow,’
said George, sounding more cheerful than she felt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
do we know they’ll be there tomorrow?’ said Dick. ‘Henning may have paid them
off today, if he’s disappointed in his hopes!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
be such a dismal Jimmy!’ said George, sensing that the twins were getting
panicky. They certainly were worried - but more because they were certain that
their mother would be scared to death if they didn’t come home, than for their
own safety.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
had been standing patiently beside George, waiting to get out of the hole. At
last, tired of waiting, he trotted away - but down the tunnel - not up!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy!
Where are you going?’ cried George, and shone her torch on him. He turned his
head and looked at her, showing quite clearly by his manner that he was tired
of standing about, and intended to find out where the tunnel led!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ju,
Look at Timmy! He wants us to go down the tunnel!’ cried George. ‘Why didn’t we
think of that?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know! I’m afraid I thought it would be a sort of blind alley!’ said
Julian. ‘I fear it will, too. Nobody knows where the chapel entrance to the
tunnel is, do they, twins?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
they said, both together. ‘It’s never been discovered, as far as we know.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Anyway,
it’s worth trying,’ said George, her voice sounding muffled as she went down
the passage after the impatient Timmy. ‘I’m getting suffocated in here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others followed, Snippet dancing along behind, thinking the whole thing was a
huge joke. The tunnel, as the children had imagined, went downwards in more or
less a straight line. It had fallen in slightly here and there, but by bending
their heads and crouching low, they managed to get through. Finally they came
to a bad fall of earth from the roof, and had to crawl through on hands and
knees. Anne didn’t like that part at all!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came at last into a strange little place, where the tunnel ended abruptly. It
was like a stone vault - a little chamber about five feet high and seven feet
square. Julian looked up fearfully at its low roof. Was it of stone? If so,
they were trapped. They would never be able to lift a heavy stone slab!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>No
- not all the roof was made of stone. A piece in the middle about three feet
square was made of strong stout wood, which rested on ledges cut in the stone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
looks like a trap-door,’ said Julian, examining it by the light of his torch.
‘I wonder if we are just below the floor of the old chapel? Dick, if you and I
and Harry all heave at the same time, we might be able to move this trap-door.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
they all heaved, George, too - but although the door did lift a little at one
corner, it simply could not be moved upwards.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
know why we can’t move it,’ said Harry, red in the face with heaving. ‘There
are sacks of grain and fertilizer and all kinds of stuff spread over the floor
of the old chapel! They’re heavy as lead! We’d never be able to move that trap-door
if two or three sacks are on it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh
- I didn’t think of that,’ said Julian, his heart sinking. ‘Didn’t you know of
this entrance into the tunnel, twins?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course not!’ said Harry. ‘Nobody did. I can’t think why it wasn’t known,
though. Except, of course, that a store-house like this has its floor always
covered with sacks of something, and with the spillings out of those sacks! It
may not have been cleaned out or swept for hundreds of years!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
what are we to do now?’ demanded Dick. ‘We can’t stay here in this stuffy
little place!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Listen
- I can hear something!’ said George suddenly. ‘Noises overhead.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
listened intently, and, through the tightly-fitting oak trap-door above them,
they heard a loud voice shouting. ‘GIVE US A HAND, BILL, WILL YOU?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
Jamie - the men are working overtime this week!’ said Harry. ‘He’s come to get
something out of the chapel. Quick, let’s all yell and hammer on the trap-door
with whatever we’ve got that’ll make a noise!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
once there was a perfect babel of sound from the little vault - yells, shouts,
barks, and the hammering of sword-handles and fists on the wooden slab
overhead. Then the children ceased their hammering, and fell silent, listening.
They heard Jamie’s voice, lifted in wonder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Bill!
What in the name of goodness was that? A rat-fight, do you suppose?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
heard us,’ said Julian, excited. ‘Come on - once again. And bark the place
down, Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was only too ready to oblige, for he was very tired of tunnels and dark, echoing
places by now! He barked long and fiercely, frightening Snippet so much that
the little poodle actually ran back up the tunnel! What with Tim’s barking, and
everyone’s yelling, and the constant hammering, the noise was even louder than
before, and Bill and Jamie listened in amazement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Comes
from over yonder,’ said Bill. ‘Summat’s going on there. Beats me what it is
though. If ’twere night-time, I’d think it were ghosties having a game! Come on
- we’ll get over yonder.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
place was so full of sacks that the two men had to clamber over the rows,
disturbing the cat and her kittens. She had curled herself round them, scared
of the unexpected noise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
corner, Bill,’ said Jamie, standing on top of two layers of sacks. He put his
hand to his mouth and bellowed like a bull.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘ANYONE
ABOUT?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
six below answered frantically at the tops of their voices, Timmy barking too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
a dog barking down there,’ said Bill, scratching his head, puzzled, looking
down at the sacks as if he thought there might be a dog in one of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
dog! There’s folks as well,’ said Jamie, astounded. ‘Where are they? Can’t be
under these sacks!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Maybe
they’re in that little old store-place we found one day, in the floor,’
suggested Bill. ‘Remember? Under an old trap-door, it were, that were covered
by a great slab of stone. You remember, man!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
ay,’ said Jamie, and then the clamour began again, for the children were now
getting near despair. ‘Gome on, Bill,’ said Jamie, hearing the note of urgency,
though he couldn’t make out a word from below. ‘Heave over these here sacks.
We’ve got to get to the bottom of this!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
heaved a dozen sacks away, and then at last the trap-door was uncovered. The
stone slab that had once hidden it had been taken up some years ago by the two
men and now stood against the wall. They had not bothered to replace it, not
guessing that the ‘little old storeplace’ as they had thought it, was really an
entrance to a secret, long-forgotten passage. It was fortunate indeed for the
children that only the old wooden trap-door was between them and the men, for
if the stone slab had been there too, no sound of their shouting would have
been heard in the old chapel above!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
for this here trap-door,’ said Bill. He tapped on it with his great boot. ‘Who’s
down here?’ he demanded, wondering what the answer would be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘US!’
shrieked the twins, and the others joined in, with Timmy barking frantically
again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Bless
us all - them’s the twins’ voices I heard!’ said Jamie, ‘How did they climb
into that store-room without moving these here sacks?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
a great heave the two men pulled up the heavy wooden slab, and looked down in
the greatest astonishment at the little crowd below! They couldn’t believe
their eyes! Timmy was the first out. He leapt upwards and landed beside the
men, wagging his great tail and licking them lavishly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
thanks, Bill, thanks, Jamie,’ cried the twins as the two men pulled them up.
‘Gosh, I’m thankful you were working overtime - and happened to come in here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Your
ma’s been hollering for you,’ said Bill, disapprovingly. ‘And didn’t you say
you was going to help me with them poles?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
did you get down there?’ demanded Jamie, pulling up the others one by one.
Julian was the last, and he handed up poor scared little Snippet, who really
felt he had had quite enough adventures for one day!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
- it’s too long a story to tell you just now,’ said Harry. ‘But thanks again
most awfully, Bill and Jamie. Can you put that slab back? Don’t tell anyone we
were down there till we tell you how it happened, see? Now we’ll have to rush
and tell Mother we’re all right!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
away they all went, longing for tea, tired out, full of thankfulness at their
escape from the little stone room under the chapel floor! What would everyone
say when they displayed the treasures they had brought back with them?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mother!
We’re ravenous, so let’s have tea and we’ll tell you some Great News,’ said the
twins, both together. ‘Mother, you will be astonished. Where’s Dad - and
Great-Grand-dad too?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’re
still at the tea-table - they were late too,’ said Mrs Philpot. ‘They’ve been
out looking for you all! Great-Grand-dad isn’t very pleased. What in the world
have you brought with you? Surely those are not swords?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mother,
let’s have tea first and we’ll tell you EVERYTHING!’ said the twins. ‘Must we
wash? Oh blow - all right, come on, everyone, let’s wash. And we’ll put our
treasures down in the darkest corner, so that Dad and Great-Grand-dad won’t see
them till we’re ready to show them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
they were all sitting down at the tea-table, glad to see a wonderful spread!
Great slices of thickly buttered bread, home-made jam, home-made cheese, a fat
ginger cake, a fruit cake, a dish of ripe plums, and even a home-cooked ham if
anyone wanted something more substantial!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr
Philpot and old Great-Grand-dad were still at the table, drinking a last cup of
tea. Mrs Philpot had told them that the children had to wash, but would tell
all that had happened when they came to their tea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ho!’
said Great-Grand-dad, frowning till his great bushy eyebrows almost covered his
nose. ‘When I was a boy I dursent come in one minute late for my meals! You
twins have worried your mother - that’s bad!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’re
awfully sorry, Great-Grand-dad,’ said the twins, in unison. ‘But just wait till
you hear our story. Julian - you tell it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
so, between great munches of bread and butter, ham sandwiches, and slices of
cake, the story was told, all the children joining in now and again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Great-Grand-dad
already knew that Mr Benning had been given permission to excavate, and that a
cheque for £250 had been given to Mr Philpot. He had flown into a terrible
temper, and only when Mrs Philpot had sobbed and said that she would give it
back, though she could hardly bear to part with it, had Great-Grand-dad given
in. Now ready to fly into another rage, he listened to the children’s story. He
forgot to drink his cooling tea. He forgot to fill his pipe. He even forgot to
ask a single question! Never had he heard such a wonderful, glorious tale in
his life!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
told the story well, and the others filled in any bits he left out. Mrs
Philpot’s eyes almost fell out of her head when she heard how Snippet and Nosey
had gone into the rabbit-burrow and come out with a broken sword and a ring!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
- but where did ...’ she began, and listened again, to hear how Dick and Julian
had enlarged the burrow, crawled right through it, and slid down into the
long-lost secret tunnel!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘HA!’
said Great-Grand-dad, getting out his great red handkerchief, and dabbing his
forehead with it. ‘HA! Wish I’d been there. Go on, go on!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
had stopped to drink his tea. He laughed and went on, describing how they had
all gone up the tunnel with their torches, the dogs with them. ‘It was dark and
smelly, and suddenly we heard a terrific noise!’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
got right inside our heads!’ put in Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
was it, what was it?’ said Great-Grand-dad, his eyes almost as big as the
saucer in front of him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
noise of the men drilling up on the old castle-site,’ said Julian, and
Great-Grand-dad exploded in wrath. He pointed his pipe at his grandson, the
farmer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Didn’t
I tell you I wouldn’t have those men on my farm?’ he began, and then calmed
down as Mrs Philpot patted his arm, shushing him. ‘Go on, Julian,’ she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then came the really exciting part, the story of how they came into the actual
cellars of the castle - the stone archways - the age-old dust...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
the echoes!’ said Anne. ‘When we whispered, a hundred other whispers came
back!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
Julian described their finds - the old armour, still good, but black with age -
the rack of swords and knives and daggers - the chest of gold...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>GOLD!
I don’t believe you!’ shouted Great-Grand-dad. ‘You’re making that up, young
man. Don’t you pile up your tale too much, now. Stick to the truth.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
twins promptly took some of the gold coins out of their pockets, still
brilliant and shining. They laid them on the table in front of the three amazed
grown-ups.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
you are! They will tell you if we are making up all this or not - these gold
coins! They will speak more loudly than words!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
awe Mr Philpot picked them up, and passed them one by one to the old man, and
to his wife. Great-Grand-dad was dumbfounded and dumbstruck. He simply could
not say a single word. He could only grunt and puff as he turned the coins over
in his great horny hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Are
they really gold?’ said Mrs Philpot, quite overcome at the sudden appearance of
the shining coins. ‘Trevor - will they belong to us? Does it mean - does it
mean that we’ll be well enough off to buy a new tractor for you - and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Depends
how much of this stuff there is, up in those old cellars,’ said Mr Philpot,
trying to keep calm. ‘And depends on how much we’re allowed to keep, of course.
Might belong to the Crown by now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘THE
CROWN!’ roared Great-Grand-dad, standing up suddenly. ‘The CROWN! NO, SIR! It’s
mine! Ours! Found on my land, put there by our ancestors. Yes - and I’ll give
old Mr Finniston down in the village a share, so I will. He’s been a good
friend of mine for years!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children thought that was quite a good idea! They then showed the jewellery
they had brought, and Mrs Philpot marvelled at it, tarnished though it was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the swords and daggers brought the greatest excitement to old Great-Grand-dad
and his grandson, Mr Philpot! As soon as they heard that the children had
actually brought back some of the old weapons, the two men got up and went to
get them. Great-Grand-dad picked up the biggest and heaviest of the swords, and
swung it dangerously round his head, looking like a reincarnation of some
fearsome old warrior, with his great beard and blazing eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
no, Grand-dad!’ said Mrs Philpot in fright. ‘Oh, you’ll knock down the things
on the dresser - there, I knew you would! Bang goes my meat-dish!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
down it went, CRASH! Timmy and Snippet almost jumped out of their skins, and
began to bark frantically.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sit
DOWN, all of you!’ cried Mrs Philpot to the excited dogs and the men. ‘Let
Julian finish his story! Great-Grand-dad, SIT DOWN!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ha,’
said Great-Grand-dad, a broad smile on his face, sitting down in his chair.
‘HA! Did me good to swing that sword. Where’s that American? I might try it out
on him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children roared with delight. It was great to see the old man so delighted. ‘Go
on with that tale of yours,’ he said to Julian. ‘You tell it well, boy. Go on!
Now, Ma, don’t you take my sword away. I’m keeping it here, between my legs, in
case I want to use it. HA!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
quickly finished his tale, and told how they had walked back down the passage
and found their burrow entrance fallen in - and then gone right down the rest
of the tunnel and come at last into the little stone-walled room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
we couldn’t get out,’ said Julian. ‘There was a great wooden trap-door over our
heads, and on it lay a dozen or so sacks - heavy as lead! We couldn’t lift it.
So we yelled!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
that’s where the secret passage led to!’ said Mr Philpot. ‘How did you get
out?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
yelled and hammered, and Bill and Jamie heard us, and pulled off the sacks, and
lifted up the old trap-door,’ said Julian. ‘Gosh, we were glad to see them! We
thought we might be lost for ever! Jamie knew about the little stone vault down
under the chapel floor - but he thought it was just an old storeroom!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
never heard of it before,’ said Mrs Philpot, and old Great-Grand-dad nodded his
head in agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
more have I,’ he said. ‘For as long as I can remember the floor of that old
chapel has been piled with sacks, and what bits I could see of the floor were
covered with thick dust. Yes, even when I was a boy, playing hide and seek in
the old place, it was full of sacks - and that’s every bit of eighty-five years
ago now! Well, well - seems like yesterday I was playing in there with a cat
and her kittens!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
a cat and her kittens there now,’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ay,
little lass - and there’ll be a cat and her kittens there when you’re an old,
old woman!’ said Great-Grand-dad. ‘There’s some things never change, thanks be
to the Lord. Well, well - I can sleep easy of nights now - I reckon you and the
farm will be all right Trevor, with the money you’ll make out of those old
finds - and I’ll live to see the twins growing up and handling the finest farm
in Dorset, so I shall - with everything new-fangled they want, bless their
bonny faces! And now I’ll just have one more swing with that sword!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children fled! Great-Grand-dad looked years younger already - and goodness
knows what damage he would do with that great sword! What an afternoon it had
been - one they would never forget!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Nineteen<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘THE
MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE WE’VE EVER HAD!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
all the excitement of the afternoon the children felt lazy. The twins went off
to feed the chickens. ‘Better late than never!’ they said, together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
are Mr Henning and Mr Durleston and that awful Junior, Mrs Philpot?’ asked
George, getting up to help with the washing of the tea-things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
Mr Henning came in to say he and Mr Durleston were going to a meal at a hotel,
and taking Junior too,’ said Mrs Philpot. ‘He seemed very pleased with himself
indeed. He said that they had broken through to the cellars of the old castle,
and expected great things - and that maybe a second cheque of £250 would be
coming soon!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
won’t take it, though, will you, Mrs Philpot?’ said Julian quickly, overhearing
what was being said. ‘The things down in that cellar will be worth much more
than any money Mr Henning is likely to offer you. He’d only take them to America
and sell them for vast sums and make a huge profit. Why should you let him do
that?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
nice old man, Mr Finniston, down in the little antique shop, would know what
everything was worth,’ said George. ‘And he’s a descendant of the long-ago
Finnistons of Finniston Castle, isn’t he - he’ll be thrilled to bits, when he
hears what’s been happening!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
send word for him to come up tomorrow,’ decided Mrs Philpot. ‘After all, Mr
Henning has his adviser - that surly Mr Durleston. We’ll have Mr Finniston for
ours. Great-Grand-dad would be pleased about that - they’re great friends,
those two.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was however, no need to send for Mr Finniston, for Great-Grand-dad had himself
gone down straight away to tell the great news to his old crony. What a talk they
had together!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gold
coins - jewellery - suits of armour - swords - and goodness knows what else!’
said Great-Grand-dad for the twentieth time, and old Mr Finniston listened
gravely, nodding his head. ‘That splendid big sword!’ went on Grand-dad, remembering.
‘Just right for me, William! Look, if ever I’ve lived before, that old sword
once belonged to me! I feel it! That’s one thing I won’t sell, mind! I’ll keep
it just for the sake of swinging it round my head, when I lose my temper!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
yes - but I hope you’ll be sure to stand in the middle of an empty room if you
do that,’ said Mr Finniston, a little alarmed at the fierce look in the old
man’s eye. ‘You won’t be allowed to keep all the money, I’m afraid - there’s
such a thing as “Treasure Trove”, you know - some finds go to the Crown, and I
fear that will be one of them. But the jewellery’s different - and the suits of
armour - and the swords! You’ll be able to make a mint of money on those!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Enough
for two new tractors?’ said Great-Grand-dad. ‘Enough for a new Land-Rover? That
one my grandson has, it jolts every bone in my body! Look now, William - we’ve
got to get men digging on that site - uncovering all those cellars. What say we
keep on the men that fellow Henning’s got? We shan’t let him excavicate, or
whatever it’s called, any more. HA! That fellow gets under my skin, and sets me
itching all over. Now I can scratch him out! And see here, William, you’ll shut
up this shop of yours and be my adviser, won’t you? I won’t have that American
talking me down - or that fellow Durleston!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’d
better stop talking for a bit, Grand-dad you’re getting too red in the face,’
said Mr Finniston. ‘You’ll go pop if you excite yourself much more! Go home
now, and I’ll be up tomorrow morning. I’ll arrange about the workmen too. And
don’t you play about with that old sword too much - you might cut off
somebody’s head by mistake!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
I might, so I might,’ said Great-Grand-dad, with a sly look in his eye. ‘Now,
if that Junior got in the way when I was swinging my sword... it’s all right,
William, it’s all right! Just my joke, you know, just my joke!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
chuckling deep down in his long beard, Great-Grand-dad strode off, turned up
the little lane and walked back to the farm-house feeling very pleased indeed
with life!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr
Henning, Mr Durleston and Junior did not come back that night. Apparently they
were all so excited over the excavations they had made in the drilling down
through the cellar roof, that they stayed too long at the hotel and decided to
spend the night there, much to Mrs Philpot’s relief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Most
farm-people like to go to bed about nine o’clock,’ said Mr Henning, ‘and it’s
already gone that now. We’ll go over tomorrow morning and we’ll get them to
sign that agreement you’ve drawn up, Durleston. They’re so short of money
they’d sign anything. And mind you cry down what we think we’ve found, so that
they won’t expect any more than £250. We’re going to make our fortunes over
this!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So,
next morning the two men, with an excited Junior, whom Mr Durleston found most
annoying, arrived at the farm-house at about ten o’clock. They had telephoned
to say they would be there then, and would bring the agreement with them, ‘...
and the cheque, Mrs Philpot, the cheque!’ purred Mr Henning down the phone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
they arrived there was quite a company there to greet them! There was old
Great-Grand-dad, his grandson Mr Philpot and his wife, the twins, of course,
and old Mr Finniston, sniffing a fight, his dull eyes bright this morning, for
the first time in years! He sat at the back, wondering what was going to
happen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
the Five were there too, Timmy wondering what the excitement was. He kept as
close to George as he could, and growled at Snippet every time the excited
little poodle came near. Snippet didn’t mind! He could always growl back!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
car purred up the drive, and in came Mr Henning, Mr Durleston and Junior, whose
face was one big grin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo,
folks!’ said Junior, in his usual jaunty manner. ‘How’s tricks?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
answered except Timmy, and he gave a small growl, which made Junior skip out of
the way quickly. ‘You shut up,’ he said to Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Did
you have your breakfast in bed at the hotel, little boy?’ suddenly said George.
‘Do you remember the last time you had it in bed here, and Timmy pulled...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Aw
shucks!’ said Junior, sulkily. ‘Skip it, sister!’ He subsided after that, and
sat down by his father. Then began a short, sharp and satisfactory meeting -
from Mr Philpot’s point of view!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Er
- Mr Philpot - it’s my very great pleasure to say that I have been advised by
Mr Durleston to offer you a further cheque for £250,’ said Mr Henning smoothly.
‘While we are rather disappointed in what appears to be in the cellars of the
castle, we feel it would only be fair to offer you the sum we suggested before.
Is that right, Mr Durleston?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Absolutely,’
said Mr Durleston in a business-like voice, and glared round through his
horn-rimmed glasses. ‘I’ve the agreement here. Mr Henning is being very
generous. Very. The cellars are most disappointing.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
sorry about that,’ said Mr Philpot. ‘I hold a different opinion - and my
adviser, Mr Finniston, upholds me in this. We are going to excavate the site
ourselves, Mr Henning - and then, if any disappointment lies in wait, we shall
be the ones to suffer, not you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
all this?’ said Mr Henning, glaring round. ‘Durleston, what do you say to that?
Bit of double-crossing, isn’t it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Offer
him £500,’ said Mr Durleston, looking startled at this unexpected set-back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
can offer me five thousand if you like, but I tell you, I prefer to do the
excavation myself on my own land,’ said Mr Philpot. ‘What is more, I will
return you the cheque you gave me yesterday - and as I intend to keep on the
men you engaged, I will pay them myself for their work. So do not trouble to dismiss
them. They will now be working for me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
this is MONSTROUS!’ shouted Mr Henning, losing his temper, and jumping to his
feet. He banged on the table, and glared at Mr and Mrs Philpot. ‘What do you
expect to find in those derelict old cellars? We drilled right through
yesterday, and there’s practically nothing there! I made you a very generous
offer. I’ll raise it to a thousand pounds!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said Mr Philpot, quietly. But Great-Grand-dad had had enough of Mr Henning’s
shouting and raging. He stood up too, and bellowed so loudly that everyone
jumped, and Timmy began to bark. Snippet at once fled to the kitchen cupboard
and hid there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘HA!
NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME!’ bellowed Greaat-Grand-dad. ‘This farm belongs to ME, and
my GRANDSON, and it’ll go to my GREAT GRANDSON, sitting yonder. A finer farm
there never was, and my family’s had it for hundreds of years - and sad it’s
been for me to see it go down hill for lack of money! But now I see money, much
money - down in those cellars! HA! All the money we want for tractors and
binders and combines and the Lord knows what! We don’t want your money. No,
SIR! You keep your dollars, you keep them. Offer me five thousand if you like,
and see what I’ll say!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr
Henning turned swiftly and looked at Mr Durleston, who at once nodded. ‘Right!’
said the American to Great-Grand-dad. ‘Five thousand! Done?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No!’
bawled Great-Grand-dad, enjoying himself more than he had done for years.
‘There’s gold down in those cellars - jewels - suits of armour - swords,
daggers, knives - all of them centuries old... and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
hand me stories like that,’ said Mr Henning, sneeringly. ‘You old fibber!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Great-Grand-dad
banged his clenched fist down on the table and made everyone almost fall off
their chairs. ‘TWINS!’ he roared. ‘Fetch those things you got yesterday - go
on, fetch them here. I’ll show this American I’m no fibber!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then, before the astounded eyes of Mr Henning and Mr Durleston, and of Junior,
too, the twins laid the gold coins, the jewellery, and the swords and knives on
the table. Mr Durleston stared as if he couldn’t believe his eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- what do you say to that?’ demanded Great-Grand-dad, banging on the table
again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr
Durleston sat back and said one word. ‘Junk!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
it was old Mr Finniston’s turn to stand up and say a few words! Mr Durleston,
who hadn’t noticed the quiet old man sitting at the back, was horrified to see
him there. He knew he was learned and knowledgeable, for he himself had tried
to pick his brains about the old castle-site.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ladies
and gentlemen,’ said Mr Finniston, just as if he were addressing a
well-conducted meeting, ‘I regret to say that, speaking as a well-known
antiquarian, I do not consider that Mr Durleston knows what he is talking about
if he calls these articles junk! The things on the table are worth a small
fortune to any genuine collector. I could myself sell them in London tomorrow
for far more than any sum Mr Durleston has advised Mr Henning to offer. Thank
you, ladies and gentlemen!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
he sat down, bowing courteously to the assembled company. Anne felt as if she
wanted to clap him!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I don’t think there’s any more to say,’ said Mr Philpot, getting up. ‘If you’ll
tell me what hotel you’ll be staying at, Mr Henning, I’ll have your things sent
there. You will certainly not wish to stay here any longer!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Pop,
I don’t wanna go, I wanna stay here!’ howled Junior, most surprisingly. ‘I
wanna see the cellars exca-exculpated! I wanna dig down! I wanna STAY!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we don’t want you!’ said Harry, fiercely. ‘You and your peeping and prying and
listening and boasting and tale-bearing. Cissy-boy! Breakfast in bed! Can’t
clean his shoes! Howls when he can’t get his own way! Screams when...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
enough, Harry,’ said his mother sternly, looking quite shocked. ‘I don’t mind
Junior staying on if he’ll behave himself. It’s not his fault that all this has
happened.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wanna stay!’ wept Junior, and kicked out peevishly under the table. He
unfortunately caught Timmy on the nose, and the dog rose in anger, growling and
showing his teeth. Junior fled for his life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
you wanna stay now?’ shouted George, as he went, and the answer came back at
once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘NO!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
thanks, Timmy, for helping him to make up his mind,’ said George, and patted
the big dog.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr
Henning looked as if he were about to burst. ‘If that dog bites my boy, I’ll
have him put to sleep,’ he said. ‘I’ll sue you, I’ll...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Please
go,’ said Mrs Philpot, suddenly looking tired out. ‘I have a lot of baking to
do.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
shall take my time,’ said Mr Henning, pompously. ‘I will not be turned out
suddenly, as if I hadn’t paid my bills.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Seen
this sword, Henning?’ said old Great-Grand-dad, suddenly, and snatched from the
table the big sword that he so much liked. ‘Beauty, isn’t it? The men of old
knew how to deal with their enemies, didn’t they? They swung at them like this
- and like THIS - and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here,
stop! You’re dangerous! That sword nearly cut me!’ cried Mr Henning in a sudden
panic. ‘WILL you put it down?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
It’s mine. I’m not selling this,’ said Great-Grand-dad, swinging the sword
again. It hit the light-bulb above his head, and the glass fell with a clatter.
Mr Durleston deserted Mr Henning and fled out of the kitchen at top speed,
colliding violently with Bill, who was just coming in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
out - he’s mad - that old man’s mad!’ shouted Mr Durleston. ‘Henning, come
along before he cuts off your head!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr
Henning fled too. Great-Grand-dad pursued him to the door, breathing blood and
thunder, and the two dogs barked in delight. Everyone began to laugh helplessly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Grand-dad
- what’s got into you?’ said Mr Philpot, as the old fellow swung the sword
again, his eyes bright, a broad grin on his wrinkled old face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nothing!
I just thought that only this sword would get rid of those fellows. Do you know
what I call them? JUNK! Ha - wish I’d thought of that when they were here!
JUNK! William Finniston, did you hear that?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
you put that sword down before you damage it,’ said Mr Finniston, who knew how
to manage Great-Grand-dad, ‘and you and I will go down to the old inn and talk
over what we’re going to do about all this treasure trove. You just put that
sword down first - NO, Grand-dad, I am NOT going to take you into the inn
carrying that sword!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs
Philpot heaved a sigh of relief when the two old fellows went off down the
lane, leaving the sword safely behind. She sat down, and, to the children’s
horror, began to cry!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now,
now - don’t take any notice of me!’ she said, when the twins ran to her in
dismay. ‘I’m crying for joy - to have got rid of them - and to know I’ve not
got to pinch and scrape any more - or to take in visitors. To think that your
Dad can buy the farm machinery he wants - and... oh dear, what a baby I am,
acting like this!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say, Mrs Philpot - would you like us to leave too?’ asked Anne, suddenly
realizing that she and the others were ranked as ‘visitors’, and must have been
an added burden for poor Mrs Philpot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no, my dear, no - you’re not really visitors, you’re friends!’ said Mrs
Philpot, smiling through her tears. ‘And what’s more I shan’t charge your
mothers a single penny for having you here - see what good fortune you’ve
brought us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right - we’ll stay. We’d love to,’ said Anne. ‘We wouldn’t miss seeing what
else is down in those castle cellars for anything. Would we, George?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh
no!’ said George. ‘We want to be in on everything. This is just about the most
exciting adventure we’ve ever had!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
always say that!’ said Anne. ‘But the nice part about this one is - it isn’t
finished yet! We’ll be able to go and watch the workmen and their drills. We’ll
be able to help in moving all the exciting old things out of their hiding
places - we’ll hear what prices you get for them - and see the new tractor!
Honestly, I really do believe the second part of this adventure will be better
than the first! Don’t you think so, Timmy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘WOOF!’
said Timmy, and wagged his tail so hard that he knocked Snippet right over.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Well,
good-bye, Five! Enjoy the rest of your adventures, and have a good time - and
do make sure that Grand-dad is careful with that great old sword!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
