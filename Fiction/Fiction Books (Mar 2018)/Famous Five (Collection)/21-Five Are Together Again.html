<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George,
can’t you sit still for even a minute!’ said Julian. ‘It’s bad enough to have
the train rocking about all over the place, without you falling over my feet
all the time, going to look out of first one window and then the other.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we’re nearly at Kirrin - almost home!’ said George. ‘I can’t help feeling
excited. I’ve missed old Timmy so much this term, and I just can’t wait to see
him! I love to look out of the window and see how much nearer we are to Kirrin.
Do you think Timmy will be on the station to meet us, barking madly?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
be an ass,’ said Dick. ‘He’s a clever dog, but not clever enough to read
railway time-tables.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
doesn’t need to,’ said George. ‘He always knows when I’m coming home.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
really believe he does,’ said Anne, seriously. ‘Your mother always says how
excited he is on the day you are arriving home from school - can’t keep still -
keeps going to the front gate and looking down the road.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dear,
dear Timmy!’ said George, falling over Julian’s feet again, as she scrambled
once more to the window. ‘We’re nearly there. Look, there’s the signal-box, and
the signal is down. HURRAH!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Her
three cousins looked at her in amusement. George was always like this on the
way home from school. Her thoughts were full of very little else but her
beloved Timmy all the way home. Julian thought how much she looked like a
restless boy just then, with her short, curly hair, and her determined
expression. George had always longed to be a boy, but as she wasn’t, she made
up for it by trying to speak and act like one, and would never answer to her
full name of <st1:place w:st="on">Georgina</st1:place>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’re
coming into Kirrin station!’ yelled George, almost falling out of the window.
‘I can see our porter. Hey, Peters - we’re back again. WE’RE BACK AGAIN!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
train slid into Kirrin station, and Peters waved and grinned. He had known
George since she was a baby. George opened the door and leapt out of the
carriage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Home
again! Back at Kirrin! Oh, I do hope Timmy will be at the station!’ she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
there was no Timmy there. ‘He must have forgotten you were coming,’ said Dick,
with a grin, and at once got a scowl from George. Peters came up, smiling all
over his face, and gave them his usual welcome. Everyone in Kirrin Village knew
the Five - which, of course, included Timmy the dog.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Peters
soon had the children’s luggage out, and wheeled it down the platform on his
trolley. ‘I’ll send it along to Kirrin Cottage as soon as the van comes,’ he
said. ‘Had a good term?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Smashing!’
said Dick. ‘But it seemed very long, as Easter is so late this year. My word -
look at the primroses on the railway banks.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
George had no eyes for anything just then. She was still looking out for Timmy.
Where was he? WHY hadn’t he come to the station to meet them? He came last time
and the time before! She turned a troubled face to Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
you think he’s ill?’ she asked. ‘Or has he forgotten me? Or...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
don’t be an ass, George,’ said Dick. ‘He is probably in the house somewhere and
can’t get out. Look out - the trolley nearly ran you over then.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
skipped out of the way, glaring. WHERE was Timmy? She was sure he was ill - or
had had an accident - or was tied up and couldn’t get away. Perhaps Joan, the
cook, had forgotten to let him loose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
going to take a taxi home, if I’ve enough money,’ she said, taking out her
purse. ‘You others can walk. I must see if anything’s happened to Timmy - he’s
never missed meeting our train before.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
George, it’s such a lovely walk to Kirrin Cottage!’ said Anne. ‘You know how
you love to see your island - dear old Kirrin Island - as we walk to your
mother’s house - and the bay - and hear the waves crashing on the rocks.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
taking the station taxi,’ said George, obstinately, counting the money in her
purse. ‘If you’d like to come with me, you can. It’s Timmy I want to see, not
islands and waves and things! I’m sure he’s ill or has had an accident or
something!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right, George, do as you please,’ said Julian. ‘Hope you find dear old Timmy is
perfectly well - and has only forgotten the time of the train. See you later.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two brothers, and their sister Anne, set off together, looking forward to the
walk to Kirrin Cottage. How lovely to see Kirrin Bay again, and George’s
island!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Isn’t
she lucky to have a real island of her very own!’ said Anne. ‘Fancy it
belonging to her family for years and years - and then one day her mother
suddenly gives it to George! I bet she worried and worried dear Aunt Fanny
until she gave in to old George. I do so hope Timmy is all right; we shan’t
enjoy our holidays with George’s mother if there’s anything wrong with Timmy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
George will probably go and live in Timmy’s kennel with him,’ said Dick, with a
chuckle. ‘Ha - look! The sea - and Kirrin Bay - AND the little old island as
lovely as ever!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘With
its gulls circling round, and mewing like cats,’ said Julian. ‘And the old
ruined castle there, just exactly the same as usual. Not a single stone fallen
out of it, as far as I can see.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
can’t possibly see that at this distance,’ said Anne, screwing up her eyes.
‘Oh, isn’t the first day of the hols heavenly? We seem to have all the time in
the world in front of us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
And then, alas, after a few days, the holidays rush by,’ said Julian. ‘I wonder
if George is home by now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
her taxi passed us going at a tremendous pace!’ said Dick. ‘I bet old George
was shouting at the driver to go as fast as possible!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
- there’s Kirrin Cottage - I can just see the chimneys in the distance,’ said
Dick. ‘Smoke is coming from one of them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Funny
- why only one?’ said Julian. ‘They usually have the kitchen fire going, and a
fire in Uncle Quentin’s study. He’s such a cold mortal when he’s working out
all his wonderful figures for his inventions.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Perhaps
he’s away,’ said Anne, hopefully. She was rather afraid of George’s
hasty-tempered father. ‘I should think Uncle Quentin could do with a holiday at
times - he’s always buried in rows and rows of figures.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
let’s hope we don’t disturb him too much,’ said Julian. ‘It’s hard on Aunt
Fanny if he keeps yelling at everyone. We’ll try and be out of doors most of
the time.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were nearly at Kirrin Cottage now. As they came near to the front gate, they
saw George come running down the garden-path. To Julian’s horror, she was
crying bitterly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say - it does look as if something has happened to old Timmy,’ he said, scared.
‘It’s not like George to cry - she never cries! What can have happened?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
great alarm they began to run, and Anne shouted as she ran, ‘George! George,
what’s the matter? Is something wrong with Timmy? What’s happened?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
can’t stay at home,’ wept George. ‘We’ve got to go away somewhere. Something
awful’s happened!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
is it? Tell us, you idiot!’ said Dick, in alarm. ‘For goodness’ sake, what’s
happened? Is Timmy run over, or something?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
- it isn’t Timmy,’ said George, wiping her eyes with her hand, because, as
usual, she had no handkerchief. ‘It’s Joan - Joan, our dear, darling cook!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
the matter with her?’ asked Julian, thinking of all kinds of dreadful things.
‘GEORGE, will you please TELL US!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Joan’s
got scarlet fever,’ said George, sniffing dolefully. ‘So we can’t be at Kirrin
Cottage.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
not?’ demanded Dick. ‘Joan will have to go to a fever hospital - and we can all
stay at Kirrin Cottage and help your mother. Poor old Joan! But cheer up,
George, scarlet fever isn’t much of a thing to have nowadays. Come on - let’s
go in and see if we can comfort your mother. Poor old Aunt Fanny, she will be
in a stew - with all of us four cousins at Kirrin Cottage too! Never mind, we
can...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Stop
jabbering, Dick,’ said George, exasperated. ‘We can’t stay at Kirrin Cottage.
Mother wouldn’t even let me go in at the front door! She shooed me away, and
said I was to wait in the garden, the doctor was coming in a minute or two.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Someone
called to them from a window of Kirrin Cottage. ‘Are you all there, children?
Julian, come here, will you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went into the garden, and saw their Aunt Fanny, George’s mother, leaning
out of a bedroom window.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Listen,
dears,’ she said. ‘Joan has scarlet fever, and is waiting for an ambulance to
take her to the hospital, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Aunt
Fanny - don’t worry. We’ll all turn to and help,’ called back Julian,
cheerfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dear
Julian - you still don’t understand,’ said his aunt. ‘You see, neither your
uncle nor I have had scarlet fever - so we are in quarantine, and mustn’t have
anyone near us, in case we get it, and give it to them - and that might mean
we’d give it to all you four.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Would
Timmy get it?’ asked George, still sniffing dolefully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
of course not. Don’t be silly, George,’ said her mother. ‘Did you ever hear of
dogs getting measles or whooping-cough or any of our illnesses? Timmy isn’t in
quarantine. You can get him out of his kennel as soon as you like.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George’s
face lighted up immediately, and she shot round the back of the house, yelling
Timmy’s name. At once there came a volley of barks!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Aunt
Fanny - what do you want us to do?’ asked Julian. ‘We can’t go to my home, because
my people are still in Germany. Should we go to a hotel?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
dear, I’ll think of somewhere you can all go,’ said his aunt. ‘Good gracious,
what a row Timmy is making! Poor Joan - she has such a splitting headache.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here’s
the ambulance,’ cried Anne, as a big hospital van drew up outside the gate. Mrs
Kirrin disappeared from the window at once to tell Joan. The ambulance man went
up to the front door, his mate behind him carrying a stretcher. The four
children watched in surprise. ‘He’s gone to fetch dear old Joan,’ said Julian.
And sure enough the stretcher was soon carried out with Joan lying on it,
wrapped round in blankets. She waved to the children as the men carried her
out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Soon
be back!’ she said, in rather a croaky voice. ‘Help Mrs Kirrin if you can. So
sorry about this!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Poor
Joan,’ said Anne, with tears in her eyes. ‘Get better quickly, Joan. We shall
miss you so!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
ambulance door closed and the van went off very smoothly and quietly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Whatever
shall we do?’ said Dick, turning to Julian. ‘Can’t go home - can’t stay here!
Oh, here’s TIMMY! How are you, Tim, old thing? Thank goodness you can’t get
scarlet fever. Don’t knock me over, old boy. Down! Gosh, what a licky dog you
are!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was the only one in high spirits. The others felt really down in the dumps. Oh
dear - what was to be done? Where could they go? What a horrid beginning to a
holiday! Down, Timmy, DOWN! What a dog! Anyone would think he had never even
heard of scarlet fever! WILL you get down, Timmy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

FOR THE FIVE<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was still looking upset. What with her fears that Timmy might be ill or hurt,
and now her distress at Joan being carried off in the ambulance, she wasn’t
much help to anyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
stop. sniffing, George,’ said Anne. ‘We’ve just got to be sensible and think of
some way out of this.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
going to find Mother,’ said George. ‘I don’t care if she’s in quarantine or
not.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no you’re not,’ said Julian, taking her firmly by the arm. ‘You jolly well know
what quarantine means. When you had whooping-cough you weren’t allowed to come
near any of us, in case we caught it too. You were infectious, and that meant
that you didn’t have close contact with anybody for at least a few weeks. I
think it’s only two weeks for scarlet fever, so it won’t be too bad.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
went on sniffing, trying to pull away from Julian’s hand. Julian winked at
Dick, and said something that made George pull herself together at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
REALLY, George!’ he said. ‘You’re acting just like a weepy girl. Poor Georgina!
Poor little old Georgina!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
stopped sniffing immediately and glared at Julian in fury. If there was one
thing she really hated it was to be told she was acting like a silly girl! And
how awful to be called by her real name, Georgina! She gave Julian a hefty
punch, and he grinned at her, warding her off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
better,’ he said. ‘Cheer up! Just look at Timmy staring at you in amazement.
He’s hardly ever heard you crying before.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
NOT crying!’ said George. ‘I’m - well, I’m upset about Joan. And it’s awful to
have nowhere to go.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can hear Aunt Fanny telephoning,’ said Anne, who had very sharp ears. She
fondled Timmy’s head, and he licked her hand. He had already given everyone a
wonderful welcome, whining with pleasure, and licking lavishly. He had been mad
with joy to see George again, and was surprised and sad to find her looking so
miserable now. Dear Timmy - he certainly belonged to the Five!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
sit down and wait for Aunt Fanny,’ said Julian, settling himself on the grass.
‘We look a bit silly standing staring at Kirrin Cottage like this. Aunt Fanny
will come to the window in a minute. She is sure to have thought of a good idea
for us. TIMMY! I shan’t stay sitting down for long if you keep licking my neck
like that. I shall send you for a towel in a minute, so that I can wipe it
dry!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
little joke made everyone feel better. They were all sitting on the grass now,
and Timmy went lovingly from one to the other. All his family back again - it
was too good to be true! He settled down at last, his head on George’s knee,
George’s hand caressing his ears.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Aunt
Fanny’s put down the telephone,’ said Anne. ‘Now she’ll come to the window.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’ve
got ears like a dog - just as good as Timmy’s,’ said Dick. ‘I couldn’t hear a
thing!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here’s
Mother!’ said George, and leapt to her feet as Mrs Kirrin came to the window
and leaned out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
all right, dears,’ she called. ‘I’ve been able to arrange something for you. I
have been telephoning the scientist that your father has been working with,
George - Professor Hayling. He was coming here for a day or two, and when I
told him he couldn’t because we’re in quarantine, he at once said that you must
all go there - and that Tinker, his son - you remember him, don’t you - would
be delighted to have your company!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Tinker!
Goodness, yes, I shall never forget him - or his monkey either!’ said Julian.
‘He’s the boy who owns that old lighthouse at Demon’s Rocks, isn’t he? We went
to stay there with him, and had a marvellous time.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- you’re not staying at the lighthouse, I’m afraid,’ said his aunt, from the
window. ‘Apparently a storm blew up one night and damaged it, and it’s not safe
to live in any more.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Groans
from all the Five, of course, Timmy joining in as usual! ‘Where are we to go then?
To Tinker’s home?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
You can get a bus from here, at Little Hollow, that will take you almost to Big
Hollow, where Professor Hayling lives,’ said Aunt Fanny. ‘You’re to go today.
I’m so very sorry about this, dears, but it’s just one of those things we have
to put up with. I’m sure you’ll have a good time with Tinker, and that monkey
of his. What was it called now?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mischief,’
said everyone together, and Anne smiled in delight to think of being with the
naughty little creature, and watching its wicked ways.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
bus will pass in ten minutes,’ said her aunt. ‘Julian, if you can’t manage to
get your things on the bus, ask the gardener over the way to help you. And have
a good time, dears, and send me a card or two. I’ll let you know how we get on
- but I really don’t think that either your uncle or I will catch scarlet
fever, so don’t worry. And I’ll send you some money to spend. You’d better run
for the bus now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,
Aunt Fanny, and thank you!’ called Julian. ‘I’ll look after everyone and keep
them in order - especially old George. Don’t worry at all - and I DO hope you
or uncle don’t go down with the fever. Good-bye.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went to the front gate where the luggage still stood. ‘Anne, go out into
the road and stop the bus when it comes,’ ordered Julian. ‘Then Dick and I will
heave our bags aboard. Gosh, I wonder what it will be like with old Tinker at
Big Hollow. I’ve a feeling it might be rather exciting!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t think so,’ said George, mournfully. ‘I like Tinker all right - he’s funny
- and that little monkey is a darling - such a naughty little thing too. But oh
dear, don’t you remember what it was like when Tinker’s father came to stay
with us? It was awful! He never remembered to come to meals, and was always
losing his coat or his hanky or his money, and losing his temper too. I got
very tired of him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
he’ll probably get very tired of us!’ said Julian. ‘He won’t find it very funny
to have four kids parked on him, especially if he’s in the middle of difficult
work - to say nothing of a rather large, licky dog leaping round the house as
well.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy
isn’t likely to lick him,’ said George, at once, and put on one of her scowls.
‘I didn’t like Tinker’s father at all.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
don’t look like a thunderstorm,’ said Julian. ‘I don’t expect he’ll like any of
us either. But it’s decent of him to give us an invitation to stay at Big
Hollow, and we’re jolly well going to behave ourselves, see? There’s to be no
back-chat from you, George - even if he dares to disapprove of Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’d
better not,’ said George. ‘In fact, I’ve a good mind not to go. I think I’ll
live in the summer-house with Timmy, at the bottom of the garden!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
will NOT!’ said Julian, taking firm hold of her arm. ‘You’ll play fair, come
with us, and behave properly! Listen, there’s the bus. Come on, we’ll all wave,
and hope the driver has a few empty seats.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
had already stopped the bus, and run round to the back of it to ask the
conductor if he could help with the bags. He knew the children very well, and
leapt down at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
going back to school pretty quick!’ he said. ‘I thought the schools had only
just broken up.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
have,’ said Julian, ‘but we’re off to stay at Big Hollow. The bus goes there,
doesn’t it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
we go right through the village of Big Hollow,’ said the conductor, carrying
three bags at once, much to Julian’s envy. ‘Whereabouts are you staying there?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘At
Professor Hayling’s house,’ said Julian. ‘I think that’s called Big Hollow too,
like the village.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah,
we pass it,’ said the conductor, ‘I’ll stop the bus just outside and give you a
hand with your things again. My word - you’ll have to mind your p’s and q’s
there - old Professor Hayling’s a bit peculiar, you know. Goes off the handle
properly if things don’t go his way! Once a horse got into his garden and
believe it or not he chased that horse for two miles, shouting at it all the
way. And bless me, when he got back home, tired out, there was that horse,
chewing up his garden again. The horse was cute - he’d taken a short cut back.
Yes - you be careful how you behave at Big Hollow. The old man might get cross
and pop you into one of his queer machines and grind you up into little
pieces!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four children laughed. ‘Oh, the old Professor is all right,’ said Julian. ‘A
bit forgetful, like most people who work with their brains all the time. My
brain goes fairly slowly - but my Uncle Quentin’s goes about a hundred miles an
hour, and I bet the Professor’s does too! We’ll be all right!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Away
went the bus, bumping over the road from Kirrin and Little Hollow, and on to
Big Hollow. The four children gazed out of the windows as they passed alongside
the shore, where the sea shone as blue as cornflowers, and once more saw Kirrin
Island out in the big bay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wish
we were going there!’ sighed George. ‘We’ll have to take a picnic meal there
sometime, and enjoy ourselves. I’d like old Tinker to visit my island. He may
have a lighthouse of his own, but having an island is MUCH better!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think I agree with you,’ said Julian. ‘Tinker’s lighthouse is certainly lovely
and all on its own, and the view from it is amazing - but there’s something
about Kirrin Island that I love. Islands are quite different from anything
else!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
They are,’ said Anne. ‘I’d like one too. A very little one, so that I could see
all round it at one glance. And I’d like one little cave to sleep in - just big
enough for me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’d
soon be lonely, Anne,’ said Dick, giving his sister a friendly pat. ‘You love
to have people round you, you like to be friendly!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
does Timmy!’ said Julian, as Timmy left his place by George’s knee and went to
sniff at a net-bag held by an old man, who at once fondled the big dog, and
fumbled for a biscuit out of a paper bag. ‘Timmy doesn’t mind how many people
there are around, so long as one or two of them has a biscuit or a bone to hand
out!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
to heel, Timmy,’ said George. ‘You’re not to go round begging, telling people
you are half-starved! I should think you eat more than any other dog in Kirrin.
Who eats the cat’s dinner whenever he can, I should like to know?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
gave George a loving lick and settled down beside her, his head on her shoes.
He got up politely every time someone entered or left the bus. The conductor
was most impressed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wish all dogs were as good on my bus as yours,’ he told George. ‘You’d better
get ready to jump out. Our next stop is supposed to be a little way beyond Big
Hollow, but I’ll ring my bell, and the driver will stop for a moment, and you
can get out.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thanks
awfully,’ said Julian, gratefully, and when the bus stopped with a jerk a
minute later, all the Five were ready to jump out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
bus went on, and left them standing outside a large wooden gate. The drive from
it led steeply downwards, and a large house could just be seen hidden in a
hollow by great trees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Big
Hollow!’ said Julian. ‘Well - here we are. What a queer place - sort of
mysterious and brooding. Now to find old Tinker! I bet he’ll be pleased to see
us all, especially Timmy! Help me with the bags, Dick!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four children and Timmy went through the big, heavy gate, which groaned loudly.
Timmy was very startled to hear the mournful creak, and barked sharply.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sh!’
said George. ‘You’ll get into trouble with the Professor, Timmy, if you raise
your voice like that. I expect we’ll have to talk in whispers, so as not to
disturb the Professor - so just see if you can whisper too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
gave a small whine. He knew he couldn’t whisper! He trotted at George’s heel as
they all went down the steep drive to the house. It was a queer house, built
sideways to the drive, and had astonishingly few windows.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
expect Professor Hayling is afraid of people peering in at his work,’ said
Anne. ‘It’s very, very secret, isn’t it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
know he uses miles and miles of figures,’ said Dick. ‘Tinker told me one day
that his monkey Mischief once chewed up a page of figures when he was very
small - and Professor Hayling chased him for a whole hour, hoping to catch him
and find even a few bits of paper still in his mouth, so that he could rescue
at least part of his figures. But Mischief fled down a rabbit-hole and didn’t
come up for two days, so it wasn’t any good.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
smiled at the thought of poor Mischief hiding down a rabbit-hole. ‘You couldn’t
do that, Timmy old thing!’ said Julian. ‘So just be careful of any paper you
eat.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
wouldn’t be so silly,’ said George, at once. ‘He knows perfectly well what’s
eatable and what’s not.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ha!
Does he!’ said Anne. ‘Well, I’d just like to know what kind of food he thought
my blue slipper was that he chewed up last hols!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
tell tales of him,’ said George. ‘He only chewed it because someone shut him in
your bedroom and he hadn’t anything else to do.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, quite agreeing. He gave Anne’s hand a little lick, as if to say,
‘Very sorry, Anne - but I was so bored!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dear
Timmy! I wouldn’t mind if you chewed up all my slippers!’ said Anne. ‘But it
would be nice if you chose the very oldest ones!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
suddenly stopped and looked into the bushes. He gave a low growl! George put
her hand on his collar at once. She was always afraid of snakes in the spring
time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
might be an adder!’ she said. ‘The dog next door trod on one last year, so I
heard, and his leg swelled up terribly, and he was in great pain. Come away
now, Timmy - it’s an adder, with poison in its fangs!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timmy went on growling. Then he suddenly stood still and sniffed hard. He gave
an excited whimper and pulled away from George, jumping into the bushes - and
out came, not a snake, but Mischief, Tinker’s bright-eyed little monkey!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
at once leapt on to the dog’s broad back, put his little monkey fingers under
Timmy’s collar, and chattered in delight. Timmy nearly dislocated his neck
trying to twist his head round to lick him!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mischief!’
cried everyone at once, in real delight. ‘You’ve come to welcome us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
the little monkey, jabbering away excitedly in monkey-language, leapt first on
to George’s shoulder, and then on to Julian’s. He pulled Julian’s hair, twisted
his right ear round, and then leapt from him to Dick, and on to Anne’s
shoulder. He cuddled into her neck, his eyes bright and brown, looking very
happy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh!
Isn’t he pleased to see us again!’ said Anne, delighted. ‘Mischief, where’s
Tinker?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mischief
jumped off Anne’s shoulder and scampered down the drive as if he quite
understood all that Anne had said. The children raced after him - and then a
stentorian voice suddenly roared at them from one side of the drive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
are you doing here? Clear out! This is private ground. I’ll fetch the police.
Clear OUT!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Five stopped still in fright - and then Julian saw who it was - Professor
Hayling! He stepped forward at once. ‘Good afternoon, sir,’ he said. ‘I hope we
didn’t disturb you, but you did tell my aunt we could come here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Your
aunt? Who’s your aunt? I don’t know any aunt!’ roared the Professor. ‘You’re
sight-seers, that’s what you are! Come to pry into my work, just because there
was a piece about it in some silly paper! You’re the third lot today. Clear
out, I tell you - and take that dog too. How DARE you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
sir - don’t you really know us?’ said Julian, very startled. ‘You came to stay
at our house, you know, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Stuff
and nonsense! I haven’t been away for years!’ shouted the Professor. Mischief,
the monkey, was so frightened that he leapt away into the bushes, making a
funny little crying noise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hope he fetches Tinker,’ said Julian, in a low voice to Dick. ‘The Professor
has forgotten who we are, and why we’ve come. Let’s retreat a bit.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
as they went cautiously back up the steep path, followed by the angry
Professor, a loud voice hailed them, and Tinker came racing up with Mischief on
his shoulder, clinging to his hair. So the little monkey had gone to fetch him.
‘Good for him!’ thought Julian, pleased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dad!
Don’t yell at our friends like that!’ cried Tinker, dancing about in front of
his angry father. ‘You asked them here yourself, you know you did!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
DID NOT!’ said the Professor. ‘Who are they?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
George, that girl, is the daughter of Mr Kirrin, and the others are his niece
and nephews. And that’s their dog, Timmy. And you asked them all here because
Mr and Mrs Kirrin are in quarantine for scarlet fever,’ shouted Tinker, still
dancing about in front of his father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Stop
jigging about like that,’ said the Professor, crossly. ‘I don’t remember asking
them. I would have told Jenny the maid, if I had.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
did tell her!’ shouted Tinker, still jigging about, with Mischief the monkey
jigging too in delight. ‘She’s already made up the beds. I helped her. She’s
angry because you left your breakfast and now it’s almost dinner-time. She’s
cleared it away.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Bless
us all - so that’s why I feel so hungry and cross!’ said Professor Hayling, and
he began to laugh. He had a tremendous laugh, and the children couldn’t help
laughing too. What an odd fellow - so brainy, such a fine scientist - with the
most enormous amount of knowledge in his head - and yet no memory for such
ordinary things as breakfast and visitors and telephone calls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
was just a misunderstanding, sir,’ said Julian, politely. ‘It was very, very
kind of you to invite us here when we can’t be at home because of the scarlet
fever. We’ll try not to be a nuisance, and if there’s anything we can do to
help you, please ask us. We’ll make as little noise as possible, and keep out
of your way, of course.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
hear that, Tinker?’ said Professor Hayling, suddenly swinging round on the
startled Tinker. ‘Why can’t you do the same - make a very little noise, and
keep out of my way? You know I’m very busy now - on a MOST IMPORTANT project.’
He turned to Julian. ‘You’ll be very welcome if you keep Tinker out of my way.
And NOBODY - absolutely NOBODY - is to go up into that tower. Understand?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all looked up to where he was pointing, and saw a tall, slender tower rising up
amid the trees. It had curious tentacle-like rods sticking out at the top, and
these shook slightly in the breeze.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
don’t ask me questions about it,’ went on the Professor, looking fiercely at
George. ‘Your father’s the only other man who knows what it’s for, and he knows
how to keep his mouth shut.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘None
of us would dream of prying, sir,’ said Julian. ‘It’s very, very kind of you to
offer to have us here, and do believe me when I say we shan’t be any trouble to
you at all - but a help if you’ll allow us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah
well, you sound a sensible fellow, I must say,’ said the Professor, who had now
calmed down, and looked quite peaceable. ‘Well, I’ll say good-bye for now and
go and have my breakfast. I hope it’s fried eggs and bacon. I’m very hungry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dad
- Jenny’s cleared your breakfast AWAY! I told you that before!’ said Tinker in
despair. ‘It’s almost dinner-time, now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah
good - good!’ said the Professor. ‘I’ll come at once.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
he led the way indoors, followed by the five children, with Timmy and Mischief,
all looking rather worried. Really, nobody ever knew what the Professor was
going to do or say next!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jenny
certainly had a good dinner for them all. There was a large and delicious stew
with carrots, onions and peas swimming in the gravy, and plenty of potatoes.
Everyone tucked in well, and Mischief, who loved the peas, took quite a few
from Tinker’s plate, his little paw creeping up, and neatly snatching a pea
from the gravy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls went out to help bring in the next course, which was a big steamed
pudding with plenty of raisins in it. Mischief at once jigged up and down in
delight, for he loved raisins. He leapt on to the table, and received a sharp
smack from the Professor, who unfortunately smacked the pudding dish at the
same time, making the pudding jump in the air.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
gracious, Dad - we nearly lost the pudding!’ cried Tinker. ‘And it’s my
favourite. Oh, don’t give us such small pieces! Mischief, get off the table.
You are NOT to put your paw into the white sauce!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
Mischief disappeared under the table, where he received quite a lot of raisins
from various kindly hands, unseen by the Professor. Timmy felt rather left out.
He was under the table too, having been rather scared by the Professor’s angry
voice, but as he didn’t very much like raisins, he wasn’t as lucky as Mischief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ha
- I enjoyed that!’ said the Professor, having cleaned his plate thoroughly.
‘Nothing like a good breakfast!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
was midday dinner, Dad!’ said Tinker. ‘You don’t have pudding at breakfast.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dear
me, of course - that was pudding!’ said his father, and laughed his great
laugh. ‘Now you can all do exactly what you like, so long as you do NOT go into
my study, OR my workroom OR that tower. AND DON’T MEDDLE WITH ANYTHING!
Mischief, get off the water-jug, you’ll upset it. Can’t you teach that monkey
some table-manners, Tinker?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
with that he marched out of the room, and disappeared into some mysterious
passage that apparently led to his study or workroom. Everyone heaved a sigh of
relief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
clear away and then I’ll show you your rooms,’ said Tinker. ‘I do hope you
won’t be too dull here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dull,
Tinker! You needn’t worry! There is far too much excitement waiting for the
Five - and you too! Just wait a bit, and see!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Four<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>JENNY
HAS A VERY GOOD IDEA<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tinker
raced out to the kitchen to fetch a tray or two. He made a most peculiar noise
as he went, and for a moment Timmy looked extremely startled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Goodness
- don’t say that Tinker still has that awful habit of pretending to be some
kind of car!’ groaned Julian. ‘How on earth does his father put up with it?
What’s he think he is now? A motor-bicycle, by the sound of it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a sudden crash and a loud yell. The Five raced down the kitchen passage to
find out what had happened, Timmy at the front.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Accident!’
bellowed Tinker, scrambling up from the floor. ‘I took the bend too quickly,
and my front wheel skidded, and I went bang into a wall! I’ve bent my
mudguard.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Tinker
- do you mean to say you’re still being fatheaded enough to pretend to be cars
and bicycles and tractors and lorries,’ demanded Julian. ‘You nearly drove us
all mad, driving about all over the house, when you stayed with us. Have you
got to be a machine of some sort?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Tinker, rubbing one of his arms. ‘It sort of comes over me, and away I go.
You should have heard me being a lorry absolutely loaded with new cars for
delivery yesterday. Dad really thought it was a great lorry and he rushed out
into the drive to send it away. But it was only me. I hooted too - like this!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
the sound of a loud and deep hooter immediately filled the passage! Julian
shoved Tinker into the kitchen and shut the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
should have thought that your father would have been driven completely mad by
now!’ he said. ‘Now you just shut up. Can’t you grow up a bit?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said Tinker, sullenly. ‘I don’t want to grow up. I might be like my father and
forget to eat my meals, and go out with one sock on and one off. And I’d hate
to forget my meals. Just think how awful it would be! I’d always be hungry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
couldn’t help laughing. ‘Pick up your tray, and help to clear away!’ he said.
‘And if you simply can’t HELP being a car sometimes, for goodness sake go
outside! It sounds frightful in the house. You’re much too good at awful
noises.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
am I really good?’ said Tinker, pleased. ‘I suppose you wouldn’t like to hear
me being one of those new planes that go over here sometimes, making a queer,
droning noise?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
I WOULD NOT!’ said Julian, firmly. ‘Now will you PLEASE get that tray, Tinker.
And tell Mischief to get off my right foot. He seems to think it’s a chair.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Mischief clung to Julian’s ankle and refused to move. ‘All right, all right,’
said Julian. ‘I shall just have to walk about all day with you riding on my
foot.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
you stamp as you walk, he soon gets off,’ remarked Tinker.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
didn’t you tell me that just now?’ asked Julian, and stamped a few steps round
the room. Mischief leapt off his foot at once, and sat on a table, making an
angry noise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
sits on Dad’s foot for ages, even when he walks about,’ said Tinker. ‘But Dad
doesn’t even notice him there! He even sat on Dad’s head once, and Dad thought
he was wearing his hat indoors and tried to take it off. But it was only
Mischief there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
made everyone laugh. ‘Now come on,’ said Julian, briskly. ‘We really must clear
away the dinner things. We three boys will carry out the loaded trays and you
girls can wash up. And DON’T let Mischief think he can carry teapots or
milk-jugs.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jenny
was very pleased with their help. She was short and fat, and waddled rather
than walked, but managed to get here and there remarkably quickly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
show your visitors their bedrooms after we’ve cleared,’ she said. ‘But, you
know, Tinker, those mattresses we sent to be remade haven’t come back yet. I’ve
told your father a dozen times to telephone about them, but I’m sure he hasn’t
remembered.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
JENNY!’ said Tinker, in dismay. ‘That means that the two beds for visitors
can’t be slept in! What ever are we to do?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
your Dad will have to ring up for new mattresses to be sent today,’ said Jenny.
‘Maybe they would send them out by van.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tinker
immediately became a furniture van and rushed down the passage, into the
dining-room and back again, Mischief following him in delight. He made a noise
exactly like a slow-moving van, and the children couldn’t help laughing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Professor shot out of his study, his hands to his ears. ‘TINKER! COME HERE!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
thanks,’ said Tinker, warily. ‘Sorry, Father. I was a van bringing the
mattresses you forgot to order for the beds for visitors.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the Professor didn’t seem to hear. He advanced on Tinker, who fled upstairs
with Mischief leaping after him. Professor Hayling turned on Jenny.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Can’t
you keep the children quiet? What do I pay you for?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Cleaning,
cooking and washing,’ she said, briskly. ‘But I’m not a nurse for children,
sir. That Tinker of yours could do with half a dozen nurses, and he’d still be
a nuisance to you while he was in the house. Why don’t you let him take his
tent and camp out in the field with his friends? It’s hot weather and those new
mattresses haven’t come, and they’d all love it. I can cook for the children
and take them out meals - or they could come and fetch them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Professor looked as if he could give Jenny a big hug. The children waited
eagerly to see what he would say. Camping out - that would be fun in this
weather - and honestly, living in the same house as the Professor wasn’t going
to be much fun. Timmy gave a little whine as if to say, ‘Fine idea! Let’s go at
once!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
idea, Jenny. VERY good idea!’ said Professor Hayling. ‘But that monkey’s to
camp out too. Then perhaps he won’t jump in at my workroom window and fiddle
about with my models!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
marched back into his study and slammed the door so hard that the whole house
shook. Timmy was startled and gave a yelp. Mischief the monkey leapt up the
stairs, howling in fright. Tinker began to dance round in joy, and very firmly
Jenny took hold of him and propelled him into her big, clean kitchen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wait,
Jenny, I’ve remembered something. We’ve only one tent, and that’s mine, a small
one. I’ll have to ask Dad if I can get two big ones!’ And before anyone could
stop him he was banging at the Professor’s door, then flung it open, and
shouted out his request.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘WE
WANT TWO MORE TENTS, DAD. CAN I BUY THEM?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘For
goodness sake, Tinker, clear out and leave me alone!’ shouted his father. ‘Buy
six tents if you want them, but GET OUT!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ooh,
thanks, Dad!’ said Tinker, and was just slipping out of the door when his
father yelled again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
what on earth do you want TENTS for?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tinker
slammed the door and grinned at the others. ‘I’d better buy Dad a new memory.
He’s only just told us we can camp out, and he knows there’s only my very small
tent - almost a toy one.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
glad we shan’t be in the house,’ said Anne. ‘I know what a nuisance it is to
George’s father to have us around, playing about. We’ll be better out of the
way.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Camping
out again!’ said George, very pleased. ‘Let’s catch the bus back home and get
our own tents. I’ve got them all stored away in the garden shed. We can ask Jim
the Carrier to fetch them, when we’ve found them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
calling here today - I’ll give him the message for you, if you like,’ said
Jenny. ‘The sooner you get the tents, the better. It was a kind thought of the
master’s to ask you all here, but I just knew it wouldn’t work! You’ll be all
right out in the fields at the back of the house - he won’t hear a thing, not
even if you all yell together! So you get your tents and put them up, and I’ll
see what I can find in the way of ground-sheets and rugs.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
bother, Jenny,’ said Julian. ‘We’ve got all those things - we’ve often camped
out before.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
only hope there aren’t any cows in the fields,’ said Anne. ‘Last time we
camped, a cow put its head into my tent opening, and mooed. I woke up with such
a jump, and I was too scared to move.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t think, there are any cows,’ said Jenny, laughing. ‘Now I am to get on
with the washing-up, so will you bring out the dinner things please - but don’t
let that monkey carry anything breakable, for goodness sake! He tried to
balance the teapot on his head last week - and that was the end of the teapot!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
everyone was cleaning away with a will, and the two girls helped Jenny with the
washing-up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
shall like camping out,’ Anne told her. ‘I’d be scared of staying here in the
house. Professor Hayling is a bit like my Uncle Quentin, you know - forgetful,
and quick-tempered and a bit shouty.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
you don’t want to be scared of him,’ said Jenny, handing Anne a dish to dry.
‘He’s kind, for all his crossness, when he’s upset. Why, when my mother was
ill, he paid for her to go into a really good nursing-home - and believe it or
not, he gave me money to buy her fruit and flowers!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
goodness - that reminds me - we MUST send our cook, Joan, some flowers,’ said
George. ‘She has scarlet fever, you know. That’s why we’re here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you go and telephone the florist,’ said Jenny. ‘I’ll finish this job.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
George was rather afraid that Professor Hayling might rush out to see who was
using the telephone!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
sure we can buy flowers in Kirrin Village, and have them sent,’ she said.
‘We’ve got to go and get our things ready for the carrier, and I can order the
flowers then. We might as well come back on our bicycles - they’d be useful
here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you’d better go now,’ said Jenny, ‘or you won’t be back in time for tea, and
then there’d be trouble.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
bring back Anne’s bicycle,’ said Julian. ‘I can easily manage it beside mine,
as I ride back.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
George,’ said Dick, ‘you needn’t come. I’ll order the flowers and I can bring
your bike back too. So you stay with Anne.’ Reluctantly George agreed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Off
went Julian and Dick, leaving Tinker and the girls to help Jenny. But Jenny
soon sent Tinker off afraid that he would drop things and break them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
go and be a nice, quiet, purring Rolls Royce at the bottom of the garden,’ she
said.‘And when you think you’ve done thirty miles or so, come back for petrol.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Lemonade,
you mean!’ said Tinker, with a grin. ‘All right. I haven’t been a Rolls Royce
for a long time. Dad won’t hear me right at the bottom of the garden!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Off
he went, and Jenny and the girls finished the washing-up. Mischief was a
nuisance and went off with the teaspoons. He leapt to the top of a high
cupboard, and dropped them there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tinker
suddenly put his head in at the window. ‘Come on out in the field, where we’re
going to put up our tents,’ he called to Anne and George. ‘We’ll choose a nice
sheltered spot. Buck up! You must have finished washing-up by now. I’m tired of
being a Rolls Royce!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
go with him, Anne,’ said George. ‘I don’t feel like it just now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
down the garden went the two children and out through a gate at the bottom into
a big field.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
gracious!’ said Tinker, staring. ‘Look at all those caravans coming in at the
gate the other end of the field. I’ll soon send them off. It’s OUR field!’ And
away he marched to the gate in the distance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
BACK, Tinker,’ shouted Anne. ‘You’ll get into trouble if you interfere. COME
BACK!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Tinker marched on, his head held high. Ha - he’d soon tell the caravan-folk it
was HIS field!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
watched anxiously as Tinker went on and on over the field. There were now four
caravans trundling in, at the far gate, and behind them, in the lane, were vans
- enormous vans - all with enormously large words painted on them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hoo!
I’ll tell Mr Tapper what I think of him, coming into my field!’ said Tinker to
himself. Mischief the monkey was on his shoulder, jogging up and down as Tinker
marched along, muttering furiously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Four
or five children from the caravans looked at him curiously as he marched along.
One small boy rushed up to him, shouting in delight to see the monkey.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
monkey, look, a monkey!’ he cried. ‘Much smaller than our chimp. What’s he
called, boy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mind
your own business,’ said Tinker. ‘Where’s Mr Tapper?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mr
Tapper? Oh, you mean our Grandad!’ said the boy. ‘He’s over there, look, beside
that big van. Better not talk to him now, boy. He’s that busy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tinker
walked over to the van and addressed the man there. He was rather
fierce-looking and had a long, bushy beard, enormous eye-brows that hung down
over his eyes, a rather small nose, and only one ear. He looked inquiringly
down at Tinker, and put out his hand to Mischief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘My
monkey might bite you,’ said Tinker, at once. ‘He doesn’t like strangers.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
no stranger to any monkey,’ said the man in a deep-down voice. ‘There isn’t a
monkey in the world, nor a chimp either that wouldn’t come to me if I called
it. Nor a gorilla, see?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
my monkey won’t come to you,’ said Tinker, angrily. ‘But what I’ve come to say
is...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before
he could finish his sentence, the man made a curious noise in his throat -
rather like Mischief did when he was pleased about anything. Mischief looked at
the man in surprised delight - and then leapt straight from Tinker’s shoulder
to his, nuzzling against his neck, making little crooning noises. Tinker was so
amazed that he stared without saying a word.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘See?’
said the man. ‘He’s my little friend already. Don’t gawp so, little fellow.
I’ve trained the monkey family all my life. You lend me this little chap and
I’ll teach him to ride a small tricycle in two days!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
here, Mischief!’ said Tinker, amazed and angry at the monkey’s behaviour. But
Mischief cuddled down still farther into the big man’s neck. The man hauled him
out and handed him to Tinker.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
you are,’ he said. ‘Nice little fellow he is. What is it you wanted to say to
me?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
come to say that this field belongs to my father, Professor Hayling,’ said
Tinker. ‘And you’ve no right to bring your caravans here. So please take them
all out. I and my friends are planning to camp out here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I’ve no objection to that,’ said the big man, good-temperedly. ‘You choose your
own corner, young sir. If you don’t interfere with us, we shan’t interfere with
you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
boy of about Tinker’s age came sidling up, and looked at Tinker and Mischief
with interest. ‘Is he selling you that monkey, Grandad?’ he asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
I’M NOT!’ almost shouted Tinker. ‘I came to tell you and your caravans to clear
out. This field belongs to my family.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah,
but we’ve an old licence to come here every ten years, and show our circus,’
said the bearded man. ‘And believe it or not, there’s been a Tapper’s circus in
this field every ten years since the year 1648. So you just run home and make
no silly fuss, young man.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
a fibber!’ cried Tinker, losing his temper. ‘I’ll tell the police! I’ll tell my
father! I’ll...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
you talk to my old Grandad like that!’ shouted the boy, standing beside the old
man. ‘I’ll hit you if you do!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
say what I like!’ shouted Tinker, his temper now quite lost. ‘And just you shut
up!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
very next moment Tinker found himself flat on his back on the grass. The boy
had shot out his fist and hit Tinker hard in the chest! He struggled to his
feet, red in the face, quite furious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
old man fended him away. ‘Don’t you be silly now, boy,’ he said. ‘This
youngster is a Tapper, like me, and he’ll never give in. You go home and be
sensible. We ain’t going to take notice of a hot-headed little kid like you.
Our circus is coming in this here field, just like it has for years and years!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
turned and walked to the nearest caravan. It was drawn by horses, and he
clicked to them. They strained forward and the caravan followed. Others behind
began to move too. The circus boy put his tongue out at Tinker. ‘Sucks to you!’
he said. ‘Nobody gets the better of my Grandad - or of me either! Still - it
was plucky of you to go for him. I enjoyed it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shut
up!’ said Tinker, alarmed to find himself very near to tears. ‘You just wait
till my Dad tells the police! You’ll all go out much quicker than you came in -
and one of these days I’ll knock you down!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
turned and ran back to the gate. He wondered what to do. He had so often heard
his father say that the field behind their house belonged to him, and that he
had let this or that farmer have the grazing rights for his horses or cattle.
How DARE the Travelling Circus come into his father’s field?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
tell Dad,’ he said to Anne, who was waiting at the gate. ‘He ought to turn them
out! It’s our field and I love it, especially just now when it’s so green and
beautiful, and the hedges are just going to be covered in white may. I’ll tell
Dad that boy knocked me down - shot out his fist just like that - and down I
went. I’d like to do the same to him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went into the house, followed by a puzzled Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
looked into the sitting-room and saw George there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Tinker!
That boy knocked you down!’ said Anne, in a horrified voice. ‘Why did he do
that?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
- just because I told his Grandad to take his caravans away,’ said Tinker,
feeling rather grand. ‘He didn’t hurt me at all - just punched me on the chest.
Still - I said what I had gone to say.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
will they take the caravans away out of the field?’ asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
told them I’d tell the police,’ said Tinker. ‘So I bet they’ll skedaddle. They
haven’t any right to be there. It’s our field!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Are
you going to the police?’ asked George, disbelievingly. ‘I really don’t see why
you have to make such a fuss about it all, Tinker. They might make it difficult
for us to go camping there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
I tell you it’s my field - Dad’s always said so!’ said Tinker. ‘He said it
wasn’t any use to him, so I could consider it my own. And I do. AND we’re going
to camp in it, whatever anyone says! It’s a travelling circus that’s coming
there, so the old man said.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
TINKER! How marvellous to have a circus at the bottom of the garden!’ said
George, her eyes shining, and Anne nodded too. Tinker glared at them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘JUST
like girls to say a thing like that!’ he said. ‘Would you want people
trespassing all over a field that belonged to you, with horses neighing and
tigers and lions roaring, and bears grunting, and chimpanzees stealing things -
and nasty little circus boys being rude all the time, ready to knock you down.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
Tinker! You do make it sound so exciting!’ said George. ‘Will there really be
lions and tigers? Suppose one escaped - what a thrill!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- I shouldn’t like that,’ said Anne, at once. ‘I don’t particularly want a lion
peering in at my window, or a bear clomping round my bedroom!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Neither
do I,’ said Tinker, in a most decided voice. ‘That’s why I’m going to tell Dad
about it. He’s got the old documents that set out our rights to that field. He
showed me them one day. I’ll ask him about them, and if he’ll let me see them,
I’ll take them straight to the police and let them turn out that rude old man
and his horrible circus.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
do you know it’s horrible?’ asked George. ‘It might be awfully good. I’m sure
they’d let us camp in the corner nearest the garden, and we’d get an awfully
good view of what’s going on all the time. Look - there’s your father strolling
down the path, smoking a pipe. He never does that if he’s busy. It would be a
good time to go and ask him about the document. He might even show it to us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right,’ said Tinker, rather sulkily. ‘But you’ll see I’m right. Come on.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>However,
Tinker proved to be quite, quite wrong! His father went to fetch the old,
yellowed piece of parchment at once. ‘Ha! Here it is!’ he said. ‘It’s pretty
valuable too, because it’s so old. It dates back quite a few centuries.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
undid the rather dirty piece of ribbon round it and unrolled it. Neither the
girls nor Tinker could read the old-fashioned lettering.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
does it all say?’ asked Anne, with great interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
says that the field known as “Cromwell’s Corner” is to be held by the Hayling
Family for always,’ said Professor Hayling. ‘It was given to them by Cromwell
because our family allowed them to camp in that field when they sorely needed a
rest after battle. It’s been ours ever since.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
NOBODY else is allowed to camp in it, or use it for grazing or anything, unless
we say so!’ said Tinker, triumphantly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Quite
right,’ said his father. ‘But wait a minute - I seem to remember an odd clause
that said something about a travelling show - a show that had rights to camp in
the field since about 1066. Not even Cromwell could alter that - it was in the
original deeds, long before Cromwell battled in that district. Now let’s see -
that piece would come about the end, I expect.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two girls and Tinker waited while the Professor pored over the old and
beautiful lettering. He jabbed his finger on to three lines towards the end.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
There it is. I’ll quote it. Listen! “And let it be known that Ye Travelling
Show so-named ‘Tapper’s Travelling Show’, which has always had camping rights,
shall still have the right to claim these once every ten years so long as the
show travels the country ways - Given under my hand...” and so on and so on.
Well - I don’t expect that Tapper’s Travelling Show is going now, all these
years and years after the document was drawn up and signed in the year 1648.
See - here’s the date - if you can read the old figures!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children stared at the date, and then glanced up at Tinker. He looked angry and
very red in the face. ‘You might have told me all that before, Dad,’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why?’
asked his father, astonished. ‘What possible interest can it have for you
children?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Only
that there’s a circus called Tapper’s Travelling Circus in that field this very
minute,’ said Anne. ‘And the old man with it is called Tapper - and he said it
was his right to be there, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
was rude to me and I want you to turn out this circus this very day!’ said
Tinker. ‘We want to camp there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
sure Mr Tapper would have no objection to you camping there,’ said his father.
‘Aren’t you being rather silly, Tinker? You weren’t rude to any of the circus
folk, were you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tinker
went very red, turned his back and stalked out of the room, Mischief clinging
to his neck. He rubbed his chest where the circus boy had punched him. ‘Just
you wait!’ he said in a whisper. ‘I’ll punch you one day!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Anne,
if you and the others want to camp in the field, I’ll go and speak to Mr
Tapper,’ said the Professor, puzzled by Tinker’s behaviour.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no - it’s all right,’ said Anne, hastily. ‘He has already said that it didn’t
matter if we camped there. Oh - there are the boys back again. I’ll just go and
see if they have brought back all our bicycles safely. Thank you for showing us
that marvellous old document, Professor!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
and Julian were most interested to hear about Tinker and the Travelling Circus
- and the old, old document.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
made a bit of a fool of yourself,’ said Julian, looking at Tinker. ‘Still,
there’s no harm done, apparently. I vote we go and see where we can put up our
tents. Personally, I shall be thrilled to see a bit of circus life so close to
me! I wonder how they’ll manage to put on a show. I suppose they’ve everything
with them, and can put up a circus ring and a marquee and anything else
necessary.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
are a lot of big vans,’ said Anne. ‘I went down to have a look about half an
hour ago. The field is almost full now, except for one corner near our hedge
that I suppose they have left for our tents.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
saw the posters about the circus as we cycled back,’ said Dick. ‘Dead-Shot Dick
- Chimpanzee that plays Cricket - the Boneless Man - Madelon and her Beautiful
Horses - Monty and Winks the clowns - the Dancing Donkey - Mr Wooh, the Wonder
Wizard - gosh, it sounded quite a circus. I’m glad we can camp in the same
field - we shall really see behind the scenes, then.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
forget there was Charlie the Chimp, and the Bonzo Band,’ said Julian. ‘What fun
if the chimp got loose and peeped in at the kitchen window!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
wouldn’t be at all funny,’ said Anne. ‘Jenny would run for miles! So would
Tinker’s monkey!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
about putting up our own tents after tea?’ said Dick. ‘The carrier said he’d
have them here by tea-time. It’s hotter than ever today. I don’t feel I can do
much at the moment. I just want to laze.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, who was lying down with his head on his paws, panting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
feel the same, old chap, don’t you?’ said Julian, poking him with his toe.
‘You’re tired out with your long run to Kirrin and back again, aren’t you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
roads were so dusty!’ said Dick. ‘He kept sneezing whenever a car passed us, because
the dust got up his nose. Poor old Tim. You really are tired out with that
long, long run!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof!’
said Tim, suddenly sitting up straight and pawing vigorously at George.
Everyone laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
says he’s not at all tired, he wants a walk,’ chuckled Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
if he’s not tired, I am,’ said Julian. ‘It really was a job sorting out all our
things at Kirrin - and cycling there and back. No, Timmy - I am NOT going to
take you for a walk!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
whined, and at once Mischief the monkey leapt down from Tinker’s shoulder and
went to cuddle against the big dog, making small comforting noises. He even put
his thin little arms round Timmy’s neck!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
just being a little bit soppy, Mischief,’ said Tinker, but Mischief didn’t
care. His big friend was sad about something, or he wouldn’t have whined. Timmy
put out a big red tongue and licked the little creature delicately on his nose.
Then he suddenly pricked up his ears, and sat straight up, He had heard a noise
from somewhere. So had all the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
music of some kind,’ said Anne. ‘Oh - I believe I know what it is!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What?’
said the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
must be Tapper’s Travelling Circus Band practising for opening night,’ said
Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
that’s tomorrow,’ yawned George. ‘Yes - it does sound like a band. Maybe we
shall see the bandsmen after tea, when we put up our tents. I’d like to see the
Boneless Man, wouldn’t you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘NO!’
said Anne. ‘He’d be all limp and wriggly and horrid - like a worm or a
jellyfish! I shan’t go and see him. But I’d love to see the horses and the
Dancing Donkey. Does he dance to the band, do you think?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
find out when we go,’ said Dick, ‘as it opens tomorrow. If Mr Tapper isn’t
annoyed about Tinker trying to turn them out, he might let us wander round.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t think I want to come,’ said Tinker. ‘Mr Tapper was rude - and that boy
knocked me flat.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I expect I’d do the same if I thought you were being rude to my Grandad,’ said
Julian, lazily ‘Now - it’s settled, is it, that we go down with our things to
the field after tea, and see if we can put up our tents in some sheltered
corner?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said everyone. Dick idly tickled Mischief’s nose with a thin blade of grass.
The monkey sneezed at once, and then again. He rubbed his little paw across his
nose and stared disapprovingly at Dick. Then he sneezed once more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Borrow
a hanky, old thing,’ said Julian. And, to everyone’s intense amusement,
Mischief leapt across to Dick and neatly pulled his handkerchief out of his
pocket! Then he pretended to blow his nose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
roared with laughter, and Mischief was delighted. ‘You’ll be stolen to act in a
circus one day, if you behave like that!’ said Dick, snatching back his hanky.
‘The Pick-pocket Monkey!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’d
be very good in a circus,’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’d
never let him join a circus!’ said Tinker at once. ‘He might have a dreadful
life.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
I don’t think he would,’ said Julian. ‘Circus-folk love their animals and are
proud of them. And after all, if they treated them unkindly, the animals
wouldn’t be happy or healthy, and couldn’t enjoy their acts. Most circus people
treat their animals like one of the family.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What!
Even a chimpanzee!’ said Anne, in horror.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’re
nice creatures - and very clever,’ said Julian. ‘Mischief, do not remove my
handkerchief, please. It was funny the first time, but not a second time. Look
at him now, trying to undo Timmy’s collar.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
and sit quietly by me, Mischief,’ ordered Tinker, and the little creature
obediently went to him and cuddled on to his knee, making a soft, crooning noise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
a humbug,’ said Tinker, fondling him. ‘You be careful I don’t give you away to
the circus, and get an elephant in exchange!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Idiot!’
said Dick, and everyone laughed at the thought of Tinker and an elephant. What
in the world would he do with it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
voice called from the house. ‘Tinker! The carrier’s come with all the camping
things. He’s put them in the hall, just where your father will fall over them.
You’d better come and see to them now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘In
a few minutes, Jenny!’ called back Tinker. ‘We’re busy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
a real fibber, Tinker,’ said Dick. ‘We are not busy. You could easily go to
find out where the things are, and see if they’re all there. There are quite a
lot.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
go in twenty minutes or so,’ said Anne, yawning. ‘I bet Tinker’s father is
asleep this hot afternoon. He won’t stir out of his study.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
she was wrong. Professor Hayling was wide awake, and when he had finished his
work, he wanted a drink of very cold water. He threw open his study door,
strode out towards the kitchen - and fell over a pile of all kinds of camping
gear, bringing them down with a tremendous noise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jenny
rushed out of the kitchen with loud screams of fright, and the Professor
bellowed in anger as he took a ground-sheet off his head, and a tent-pole off his
back. ‘WHAT ARE THESE THINGS? I WILL NOT HAVE THEM IN THE HALL! JENNY! JENNY!
Take them down to the bonfire and burn the lot!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Our
camping things!’ cried George, listening in horror. ‘Quick! We must get them!
Oh, I do hope Tinker’s father hasn’t hurt himself. Blow, blow, blow!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While
Julian and Dick deftly removed everything that had fallen on to the angry
Professor and took them down the garden, Anne and George comforted him, and
made such a fuss of him that he began to feel decidedly less angry. He sat down
in a chair and wiped his forehead. ‘I hope you’ve taken all those things down
to the bottom of the garden?’ he asked, after a while.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Tinker, truthfully. ‘Er - they’re all by the bonfire, but it’s not lighted
yet.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
light it myself tomorrow,’ said his father, and Tinker heaved a sigh of relief.
His father would forget, of course - and anyhow, everything was going to be
taken into the camping field after tea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Have
a cup of nice hot tea, sir,’ said Jenny, appearing with a tray of tea-things.
‘Sit you down and drink this. It’s newly made. Best thing to have after a fall
and a shock.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
turned and whispered crossly to Tinker. ‘Didn’t I call to you and tell you the
Professor would trip over those things, the poor man? Now you just get your own
tea, while I take him into the dining-room and comfort him with a nice hot
scone, and a cup of tea!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
get our tea,’ said Anne. ‘Then we’ll set up the tents down in the field, and
enjoy ourselves. And Tinker, don’t you get into any more trouble with the
circus folk.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
see he doesn’t,’ said George, firmly. ‘Come on - let’s go down to the field
while Anne gets the tea. I could do with a bun or two!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Between
them, Dick and Julian had lugged all the things down the garden - two tents, ground-sheets,
blankets, tent-pegs and all the rest. Timmy ran with them in excitement,
wondering what all the fuss was about. Mischief, of course, leapt to the top of
whatever was being carried, and chattered excitedly all the way down the
garden.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
got into trouble when he ran off with a tentpeg, but Timmy managed to catch him
and make him drop it. Then, very solemnly, Timmy carried the tent-peg to
Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
dog!’ said Julian. ‘Just keep an eye on that wicked little monkey, Tim, will
you? There are all sorts of things he might run off with!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
Timmy kept an eye on Mischief, nosing him away whenever he thought the monkey
was going to pick up something he shouldn’t. Finally Mischief became tired of
Timmy’s nose and leapt on his back, where, clinging to the dog’s collar, he
rode just as if he were on horseback. ‘Only it’s dogback, not horseback,’ said
Anne, with a laugh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
would make quite a good pair for the circus,’ said Dick. ‘I bet Mischief could
hold on to reins, if Timmy had any!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
he’s not going to have any,’ said George. ‘The next thing would be a whip!
Whew! What a lot of things we’ve got - is that the lot?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was, thank goodness. A bell rang out from the house at that moment, and
everyone heaved a sigh of relief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Tea
at last!’ said Dick. ‘I could drink a whole potful. Come on - we’ve finished
piling up all the things. We’ll get busy after tea with them, I can’t do a
thing more. Don’t you agree, Timmy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘WOOF!’
said Timmy, heartily, and galloped up the garden path at top speed, with
Mischief scampering after him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Talk
about a circus!’ said Dick. ‘We’ve a ready-made one here! All right, Anne -
we’re coming! We’re coming!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>IN
THE CIRCUS FIELD<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
wanted to spend a long time over tea. They all longed to go down to the field
and set up their little camp.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
shall have a wonderful look-in at what goes on in a circus camp,’ said Dick.
‘We shall be living so near the circus folk! I do hope Mischief won’t get too
friendly with the people there. They might take him away with them when they
leave.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Indeed
they won’t!’ said Tinker, fiercely. ‘What a thing to say! As if Mischief would
go with them, anyhow! I don’t expect he’ll mix with the circus crowd at all.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
wait and see!’ grinned Dick. ‘Now buck up with your tea - I’m longing to go and
set our camp in the field, and see what’s going on there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
wasn’t long before they were ready. They were soon down by the fence, and gazed
over it in amazement. Great vans were in the field, all with Mr Tapper’s name
on and all painted in gay colours. There were caravans too, much smaller than
the great vans, and these had windows, each with neat lace curtains. The circus
folk lived in the caravans, of course, and George found herself wishing that
she herself could go about in one, instead of living in a house that couldn’t
move anywhere!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
at the horses!’ cried Dick, as a bunch of them appeared with tossing heads and
beautiful long thick tails. The boy who had knocked Tinker down was with them,
whistling. They were all coming from a big horse-van, and were delighted to be
in a field with lush green grass.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
that field gate properly shut?’ yelled an enormous voice, and the boy yelled
back, ‘Yes, Grandad. I shut it. There’s nowhere the horses can get out. My word
- don’t they like this grass!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
he saw Julian and the others all looking over the fence, and waved to them.
‘See our horses? Aren’t they a grand lot?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And,
just to show off a little, he leapt on to the back of the nearest one, and went
all round the edge of the field with it. George watched him enviously. If only
she could have a horse like that!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
let’s take our camp things into the field,’ said Tinker. ‘The nearer we are to
the circus the better. We ought to have some fun.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
climbed over the fence and Dick followed. ‘I’ll hand everything over,’ said
Julian. ‘George can help me - she’s as good as a boy any day!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
grinned. She loved to hear anyone say that! It was quite a job getting some of
the things over the fence. The tents, neatly wrapped though they were, were
heavy, awkward things to handle, but at last everything was safely over, lying
on the grass.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
Julian, Anne and George climbed over the fence too, and stood in the field,
looking round for a good corner to set up their things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
about near those bushes over there?’ said Julian. ‘There’s that big tree behind
as well to protect us from the wind - and we aren’t too near the circus folk -
they might not like us right on top of them - and yet we’re near enough to see
what’s going on.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
it’s going to be FUN!’ said Anne, her eyes shining.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think I’d better go and find the old Grandad - Mr Tapper,’ said Julian. ‘Just
to tell him we’re here, in case he thinks we’re intruders and have no right to
be here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
haven’t got to ask his permission for us to be in MY field!’ said Tinker, at
once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
don’t keep flying off the handle like that, Tinker,’ said Julian. ‘This is
merely a question of good manners - something you don’t seem to know much
about! How do we know that the circus folk won’t resent us camping so near
them? Much better to show ourselves friendly from the start.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right, all right,’ said Tinker, sulkily. ‘But it is my field, after all! You’ll
be telling me to be friends with that nasty little circus-boy next!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you’d better be - else he might knock you flat again!’ said George. ‘Anyway, be
sensible, Tinker - it’s not often people have a circus just at the bottom of
their garden, and can pop over the fence, and mix with the circus folk.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
walked over to the nearest caravan. It was empty, and no one answered his
knock.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
you want, mister?’ called a high little voice, and a small girl with tangled,
untidy hair came running up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
Mr Tapper?’ asked Julian, smiling at the untidy, bright-eyed little thing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
with one of the horses,’ said the small girl. ‘Who are you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’re
your neighbours,’ said Julian. ‘Will you take us to Mr Tapper?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Old
Grandad’s this way,’ said the child, and slipped a dirty little hand into
Julian’s. ‘I’ll show you. I like you, mister.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
led the children to the middle of the camp. A mournful howl came from somewhere
behind them and George stopped suddenly. ‘That’s Timmy! He must have found out
that we’ve got out of the garden. I’ll go back for him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Better
not,’ said Julian. ‘There might be ructions if he met the chimpanzee. A big
chimp would make mincemeat of him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
wouldn’t!’ said George, but all the same she didn’t go back to fetch Timmy.
Julian hoped that the dog wouldn’t jump over the fence, and come to find them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
old Granddad Tapper on them steps,’ said the little girl, smiling up at Julian,
whose hand she still held. ‘I like you, mister. Your hand smells nice.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
that’s because I wash it with soap and water four or five times a day,’ said
Julian. ‘Yours would smell nice too, if you did the same.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
little girl sniffed at Julian’s hand. Then she shouted loudly to the old fellow
sitting on the steps of a nearby caravan. ‘Grandad! Here’s folks to see you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Grandad
was looking at a beautiful chestnut-brown horse, tethered close to him. He had
one of the horse’s hooves in his hand. The children stood and gazed at him -
black beard, frowning eye-brows - and, oh dear! thought Anne, only one ear,
poor man. What could have happened to the missing one?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘GRANDAD!’
called the girl again. FOLKS TO SEE YOU!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr
Tapper looked round, his eyes very bright under his black eye-brows. He set the
horse’s hoof down, and gave the lovely creature a pat. ‘You don’t need to limp
any more, my beauty,’ he said. ‘I’ve taken out the stone that was in your hoof.
You can dance again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
horse lifted up its magnificent head and neighed as if it were saying thank
you. Tinker almost jumped out of his skin, and Mischief slipped from his
shoulder and cuddled under his arm in terror.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now,
now, little monkey, don’t you know a horse’s voice when you hear one?’ said
Grandad, and Mischief poked his head out from under Tinker’s arm to listen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Does
that horse really dance?’ said Anne, longing to stroke its long, smooth nose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dance!
It’s one of the finest horse-dancers in the world!’ said Grandad, and began to
whistle a gay little tune. The horse pricked up its ears, gazed at Grandad, and
then began to dance! The children watched in astonishment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
it went, round and round, nodding its head to the tune, its feet tapping the
grass in perfect time to Grandad’s whistling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
the lovely thing!’ said George. ‘Do all your horses dance as well as this one?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
Some a good deal better,’ said Grandad. ‘This one has a fair ear for music, but
not as good an ear as some. You wait till you see them dressed up with feathery
plumes nodding on their heads. Horses - there’s nothing in the world as
beautiful as a good horse.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mr
Tapper - we come from the house over the fence there,’ said Julian, feeling
that it was time to explain their visit. ‘As you probably know, Tinker’s father
owns this field, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
yes - but we have an old right to come every so often,’ said the old man,
raising his voice. ‘Now don’t you start arg...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
haven’t come to argue with you,’ said Julian, politely. ‘I’ve only just come to
say that we - that is my friends here and I - would like to come and camp in
this field, but we shouldn’t annoy you in any way, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
well - if that’s what you want, you’re more than welcome!’ said the old man.
‘More than welcome! I thought maybe you’d think you could turn us out - like
that youngster there would like to do!’ And he nodded at Tinker.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tinker
went red and said nothing. The old man laughed. ‘Ha! My grandson didn’t think
much of that idea, did he, youngster? He hit out, and down you went on your
back. He’s got a temper, he has, young Jeremy. But another time maybe he’ll
find himself on his back, eh?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
He will,’ said Tinker, at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right.
Well, you’ll be even with one another then, and you can shake hands like
gentlemen,’ said the old man, his eyes twinkling. ‘Now - what about you
bringing your gear right into the field, and setting up your tents? I’ll get
old Charlie the Chimp to help you. He’s as strong as ten men!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
chimpanzee! Is he tame enough to help us to put up our tents?’ said Anne,
disbelievingly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Old
Charlie is cleverer than all of you put together, and as tame as you are!’ said
Grandad. ‘And he could beat you three boys at cricket any day! You bring your
bat along one morning, and watch him. I’ll call him to help you. CHARLIE!
CHARLIE! Where are you? Snoozing I suppose!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
no Charlie came. ‘You go and fetch him,’ said the old man, pointing to a corner
of the field where stood a big, strong cage, with a tarpaulin roof to keep out
the rain. ‘He’ll do anything you want him to do, so long as you give him a word
of praise now and again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
get him, Ju,’ said Dick, eagerly. ‘My word - fancy having a chimpanzee to help
us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
off they all went to the great cage. CHARLIE! CHARLIE! Wake up, you’re wanted!
CHARLIE!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

Eight<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>CHARLIE
THE CHIMP IS A HELP!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tinker
came to the big cage first. He peered inside. Charlie the Chimp was there all
right, sitting at the back of his cage, his brown eyes looking at the children
with curiosity. He got up and went over to where Tinker was peering in, and
pressed his nose against the strong wire, almost against Tinker’s. Then he blew
hard, and Tinker backed away, surprised and cross.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
blew at me!’ he said to the others, who were laughing at Tinker’s disgust. The
chimp made a funny noise that Mischief the monkey immediately tried to imitate.
The chimpanzee stared at Mischief, then he grew very excited. He rattled his
cage, jumped up and down, and made some very queer noises indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
boy came running up at once. It was the boy who had knocked Tinker down. ‘Hey -
what are you doing to the chimp?’ he called. ‘Oh - aren’t you the boy who
shouted at my Grandad - the one I knocked down?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
And don’t you dare try that on again, or you’ll be sorry!’ said Tinker, in a
fierce voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shut
up, Tinker,’ said Julian. He turned to the boy. ‘Your name’s Jeremy, isn’t it?’
he said. ‘Well, we’ve just been talking to your Grandad over there, and he said
we could get the chimpanzee to help us with our camping gear. It’s all right
for him to come out of his cage, isn’t it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes - I take him out two or three times a day,’ said Jeremy. ‘He gets bored in
his cage. He’d love to help put up your tents - he’s always helping us circus
folk with things like that. He’s as strong as a lion.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
he - er - is he safe?’ asked Dick, eyeing the big animal doubtfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Safe?
What do you mean - safe?’ asked Jeremy, surprised. ‘He’s as safe as I am!
Charlie, come on out! Go on, you can undo your cage perfectly well, you know
you can!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
chimpanzee made a funny little chuckling noise, put his hand through the wire,
reached the bolt, pulled it, took his hand back - and pushed open the cage
door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘See?
Easy, isn’t it?’ said Jeremy, grinning. ‘Charlie boy, come along. Your help’s
wanted!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Charlie
lumbered out of his cage, and went with the children to where they had left
their tents and ground-sheets and the rest. He walked with his fists on the
ground in a most inelegant manner, making a funny little groaning noise all the
time. Mischief was rather afraid of him, and kept well to the back - but the
chimpanzee suddenly turned round, caught hold of Mischief, and sat him up on
his shoulder! Mischief held on, not knowing whether to be scared or jubilant!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wish I had my camera here,’ said Anne to George. ‘Just look at them - Mischief
is as pleased as can be!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
arrived at the pile of camping gear. ‘Carry this, Charlie, and follow us,’ ordered
Jeremy. The chimp grabbed at this, that and the other, and, with his great arms
full, followed the children to where they thought they could camp, with the
great hedge to shelter them from the wind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Drop
those things, Charlie,’ said Jeremy, ‘and go back for the rest. Buck up. Don’t
stand there staring! You’ve got work to do!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Charlie still crouched there, staring straight at Mischief. ‘Oh! He wants
Mischief the monkey to go with him!’ cried George. ‘Go on, Mischief, have a
ride again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mischief
leapt up on to the chimpanzee’s shoulders. Charlie put up a great paw to steady
him and then lumbered off to fetch the rest of the things. One of the
ground-sheets came undone, and slithered over his head like a tent, so that he
couldn’t see where he was going. In a rage he leapt on it and began to jump up
and down, up and down, growling most terrifyingly. The children felt rather
scared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Charlie,
don’t be an ass!’ said Jeremy, and pulled it away from him, rolling it up
swiftly. The chimpanzee could manage it then, and his good temper immediately
came back again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everything
was soon piled up in one place, and Julian and Dick began to put up the tents.
Charlie watched them with the greatest interest, and helped most intelligently
when he saw that he could.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
a good sort, isn’t he?’ said Jeremy, proud that his friend the chimpanzee could
show off like this. ‘Did you see him put that tent-pole in exactly the right
place? And you ought to see him fetch the pails of water for the horses each
day. He carries a full pail in each hand!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
ought to get wages,’ said Tinker.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
does!’ said Jeremy. ‘He gets eight bananas a day and as many oranges as he
likes. And he LOVES sweets!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh!
I think I’ve got some!’ said Tinker and delved into one of his pockets. He
brought up a peculiar mixture of things, among which was a screwed-up sweet
bag. Inside was a mess of half-melted boiled sweets.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
can’t give him those!’ said Anne. ‘They’re old and sticky and messy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Charlie thought differently. He took the paper bag straight out of Tinker’s
hand, sniffed it - and then put the whole thing into his mouth at once!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’ll
choke!’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
Charlie!’ said Jeremy. ‘Let him be. He’ll go straight back to his cage, get in,
shoot the bolt and sit there sucking sweets till they’re gone. He’ll be as
happy as can be.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- he certainly deserved a reward,’ said George. ‘He did all the heavy work!
Come on, let’s finish putting everything straight. I say - won’t it be fun
sleeping out in tents tonight! We’d better have supper first.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
can come and join us, if you like,’ said Jeremy. ‘We don’t have posh food like
you, of course - but it’s good food, all the same. Old Grandma cooks it in her
pot. She’s two hundred years old.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children laughed in disbelief. ‘Two hundred! Nobody lives as long as that!’
said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
that’s what she tells everyone,’ said Jeremy. ‘And she looks it, too! But her
eyes are as sharp as needles still! Shall I tell her you’ll be here to supper?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- would there be enough for so many extra?’ said Julian. ‘We meant to bring our
own meal. Should we bring that and share everything with you? We’ve more than
enough. Our cook Jenny said she would have it all ready for us to bring down
tonight - a meat-pie - cold sausages - and apples and bananas.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sh!
Don’t say bananas in front of Charlie,’ said Jeremy. ‘He’ll worry you for them
all the time. All right - you bring your food and we’ll share with you round
our camp-fire. I’ll tell old Grandma. We’re having a sing-song tonight, and
Fred the Fiddler’s playing his fiddle. Ah, that fiddle! Its tunes get into your
feet and away you go!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
all sounded very exciting. Julian thought they ought to go back home before
anyone began to be worried about their complete disappearance, and pack up the
food for supper that night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
be back as soon as we can,’ said he. ‘And thanks awfully for all your help.
Come on, Mischief. Say good-bye to Charlie for the moment, and don’t look so
gloomy. We’re coming back here tonight!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went back over the fence, feeling a little tired now, but full of their
plans for the evening. ‘It’s almost like belonging to the circus, going back to
sit round a camp-fire and eat supper from that old black stewpot on the fire,’
said Tinker. ‘I bet the supper will taste delicious. I say - I hope Dad won’t
mind us popping off to the circus camp.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t expect he’ll even notice that we’ve gone,’ said George. ‘My father never
notices things like that. Sometimes he doesn’t even notice when people are
there, in front of his nose!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
that must be useful at times if they’re people he doesn’t like,’ said Tinker.
‘Now - let’s see what Jenny’s got that we can take back with us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jenny
listened wide-eyed to all they had to say. ‘Well, well, well!’ she said. ‘Camping
out with the circus-folk! Whatever next? I’d like to know what your parents
would think of that, Master Julian!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
ask them, next time we see them,’ said Julian, with a grin. ‘What do you have
for our supper? We’re taking it down to our camp.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
thought maybe you’d do that,’ said Jenny. ‘It’s all cold. A meat pie - cold
sausages - a cucumber and lettuce hearts and tomatoes, rolls - and apples and
bananas. Will that be enough?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh,
yes,’ said Tinker, thrilled. ‘What about something to drink?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
can take lemonade or orangeade with you, whichever you please,’ said Jenny.
‘But listen now - don’t go bursting into your father’s workroom. He’s worked
hard all day, and he’s tired.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
cross, I expect,’ said Tinker. ‘People are always cross when they’re tired.
Except you, dear, dear Jenny.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ha!
You want something else out of my cupboard, calling me your dear, dear Jenny,’
she said with a twinkle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Could
we have some sugar-lumps?’ asked Tinker. ‘Oh, Jenny, there are the loveliest
horses you ever saw down in the circus field. I want to give them a sugar lump
each.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
yourself a few as well!’ said Jenny. ‘All right. I’ll pack up everything for
you, and give you a few enamel plates and mugs and knives. What about Timmy?
Doesn’t he want a meal too?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wuff!’
said Timmy, glad that someone had remembered him. Jenny patted his big head.
‘It’s all ready in the larder for you,’ she said. ‘George, you go and get it.
He must be hungry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
fetched a plate of meat and biscuits from the larder and Timmy fell on it with
happy little barks. Yes - he was very, VERY hungry!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
last all the food was ready-packed to take down the garden to the field. What a
lot there seemed! Well, they would certainly have plenty to spare for their
circus friends. They said good night to Jenny, and set off down the garden
again. They thought they had better not disturb Professor Hayling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
might be cross and forbid us to go and feed with the circus-folk,’ said Tinker.
‘Mischief, come off that basket, and don’t pretend you weren’t fishing in it
for a banana. And please put on your best table-manners tonight, or Charlie the
Chimp will be ashamed of you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was fun going back down the garden and over the fence into the field again. The
sun was sinking fast and soon the shadows would fall. How lovely to sit round a
fire and eat supper with the kindly circus-folk - and perhaps to sing old songs
with them - and hear Fred the Fiddler fiddle his old, old tunes! What fun to
creep into a tent, and sleep with the cries of owls around, and stars shining
in at the tent opening!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
they go, over the fence, handing the food one to another. Take your paw out of
that basket, Mischief! That’s right, Timmy, nibble his ear if he’s as
mischievous as his name! You’re all going to have some fun tonight!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
soon as Jeremy saw the visitors climbing over the fence, he ran to help them.
He was very excited at the thought of having guests. He took them over to old
Grandad first, to be welcomed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
I expect your friends will like to see round a bit,’ said Grandad. ‘Charlie the
Chimp can go with you. We’ve a rehearsal on tonight, so the ring has been set
up. You can watch some of the show.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
was grand news. The children saw that curved pieces of painted wood had been
set together to make a great ring in the field, and as they went across the
grass, the Musical Horses began to troop into the ring, the leading one ridden
by Madelon, a lovely girl, dressed in shimmering gold.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
beautiful they are!’ thought Anne, as she watched. ‘Look at their great
feathery plumes, nodding on their magnificent heads.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Bonzo Band struck up just then, and the horses at once trotted in perfect time
to the music. The band looked a little peculiar as the bandsmen had not put on
their smart uniforms. They were saving those for the opening night!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
horses trotted prettily out of the ring after two or three rounds, the
beautiful Madelon on the leading horse. Then in came Fred the Fiddler and
played his violin for a few minutes. First the music was slow and solemn, then
Fred began to play quickly, and the children found themselves jiggling about,
up and down and round about. ‘I can’t keep still!’ panted Anne. ‘The tune’s got
into my feet.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Charlie
the Chimp came up just then, walking on hind legs, and looking unexpectedly
tall. He usually walked on all fours. He began to jig about too, looking very
funny. He ran right into the ring and put his arms round Fred the Fiddler’s
legs. ‘He loves Fred,’ said Jeremy. ‘Now he’s going to rehearse his cricket
act. I must go and bowl to him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
off went Jeremy into the ring. The chimpanzee rushed over to him and hugged
him. A bat was thrown into the ring, and Charlie picked it up, and made a few
swipes into the air with it, making delighted noises all the time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
a cricket ball was thrown to Jeremy, who caught it deftly. A small girl
appeared from somewhere and set up three stumps for a wicket. ‘Can’t find the
bails, jeremy!’ she called. ‘Have you got them in your pocket?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said Jeremy. ‘Never mind, I’ll knock the stumps right over!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
that wasn’t so easy with Charlie the Chimp at the wicket! He took a terrific
swipe at the ball, and it went right over Jeremy’s head, too high to catch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
chimp lost his balance and sat down on the wicket, knocking the stumps out of
the ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘OUT!’
yelled Jeremy, but the chimp wasn’t having that. He carefully put up the stumps
again, and then set himself in front once more, waggling the bat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was the funniest cricket that the children had ever seen! The chimpanzee was
very, very clever with the bat, and sent poor Jeremy running all over the
place. Then finally he chased the boy all round the ring with the bat making
curious chortling noises. The children didn’t know if he was amused or angry!
Finally he threw the bat at Jeremy and walked off, scratching himself under one
arm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children roared with laughter at him. ‘He’s as good as any clown!’ said Dick.
‘Jeremy, does he do this cricket act every night when the circus is open?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes - and sometimes he hits the ball into the audience,’ said Jeremy. ‘There’s
great excitement then. Sometimes, for a treat, we let one of the boys in the
audience come down and bowl to Charlie. One bowled him right out once, and
Charlie was so cross that he chased him all round the ring three times - just
as he chased me just now. The boy didn’t like it much!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Charlie
came up to Jeremy, and put his great arms round him, trying to swing him off
the ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Stop
that, Charlie,’ said Jeremy, wriggling free. ‘Look out - here comes the Dancing
Donkey! Better get out of the ring - goodness knows what antics he’ll be up
to!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
came the Dancing Donkey. He was dark grey, and tossed his head as he came
galloping in. He stood and looked round at everyone. Then he sat down, lifted
up a leg and scratched his nose. The children stared in astonishment. They had
never in their lives seen a donkey do that before! Then, when the band suddenly
began to play, the donkey stood up and listened, flapping his ears first one
way and then another, and nodding his head in time to the music.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
band changed its tune to a march. The donkey listened again, and then began to
march round the ring in perfect time - clip-clop-clip-clop-clip-clop. Then it
apparently felt tired, and sat down heavily on its back legs. The children
couldn’t help laughing. The donkey got up, and somehow its back legs became
entangled with its front ones, and it fell down, looking most ridiculous.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Has
it hurt itself?’ asked Anne, anxiously. ‘Oh dear - it will break one of its
legs if it goes on like this. Look, it can’t untangle them, Jeremy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
donkey gave a mournful bray, tried to get up, and flopped down again. The band
changed its tune, and the donkey leapt up at once, and began to do a kind of
tap-dance - clickety-click, clickety-click, clickety-click - it was marvellous!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
shouldn’t have thought that a donkey could possibly have been taught to
tap-dance,’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
the donkey seemed to feel tired again. It stopped dancing, but the band still
went on playing. The donkey ran towards it and stamped its foot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
weird voice suddenly came from it. ‘Too fast! TOO FAST!’ But the band took no
notice and went on playing. The donkey bent down, wriggled hard - and its head
fell off on to the grass in the ring! Anne gave a shriek of fright.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
be an ass, Anne,’ said Dick. ‘You didn’t think the donkey was a real one, did
you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Isn’t
it?’ said Anne, relieved. ‘It looks just like that donkey that used to give
rides to children on Kirrin beach.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
donkey now split in half, and a small man climbed out of each half, taking
their legs carefully out of the donkey’s legs. The donkey-skin fell to the
ground, and lay there, flat and collapsed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wish
I had a donkey-skin like that,’ said Tinker. ‘I’ve got a friend at school who
could be the back legs and I’d be the front legs. The things we’d do!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I must say you’d make a first-class donkey, the way you behave sometimes,’ said
George. ‘Look, this must be Dead-Shot Dick coming on.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
before Dead-Shot Dick could do any of his shooting tricks, the two donkey-men
had run to the band and begun a loud argument with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
play so fast? You know we can’t do our tricks at top speed. Are you trying to
mess up our turn?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
band leader shouted something back. It must have been rude, because one of the
donkey-men shook his fist and began to run towards the band.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
loud voice crashed in on the argument, and made everyone jump. It was Mr
Tapper, old Grandad, giving his orders in an enormous voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘ENOUGH!
You, Pat, and you, Jim, get out of the ring. I give the orders, not you.
ENOUGH, I SAY!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two donkey-men glared at him, but did not dare to say a word more. They stalked
out of the ring, taking the donkey-skin with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dead-Shot
Dick looked very ordinary, dressed in a rather untidy flannel suit. ‘He’s not
going to go all through his act,’ said Jeremy. ‘You’ll see him another night,
when the show’s on for the public - he shoots at all kinds of things - even a
sixpenny bit dangling on a long string from the roof - and never misses! He’s
got a smashing rig-out too - sequins sewn all over his trousers and jersey -
and his little horse is a wonder - goes round and round the ring and never
turns a hair when Dead-Shot Dick fires his gun! Look - there he is, peeping in
to see if Dick’s coming back to him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
small white horse was looking anxiously at the ring, its eyes fixed on
Dead-Shot Dick. It pawed the ground as if to say, ‘Buck up! I’m waiting for
you! Am I to come on or not?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right, Dick - you can go off now,’ shouted Grandad. ‘I hear your horse has hurt
a foot - give him a good rest tonight. We’ll want him on tomorrow.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,
sir!’ said Dead-Shot Dick. He saluted smartly, and ran off to his little horse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
next, Jeremy?’ asked George, who was enjoying everything very much.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
know. Let’s see - there’s the acrobats - but the trapeze-swings aren’t put up
yet, so they won’t come on tonight. And there’s the Boneless Man - look, there
he is. Good old Boney! I like him. He’s free with his money, he is, not like
some of the other folk!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Boneless Man looked very peculiar. He was remarkably thin, and remarkably tall.
He walked in, looking quite extraordinary. ‘He can’t be boneless!’ said Dick.
‘He couldn’t walk if he was!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the Boneless Man soon began to seem absolutely boneless. His legs gave way at
the knees, and his ankles turned over so that he sank down to the ground,
unable to walk. He could bend his arms all kinds of different ways, and turned
his head almost completely round on his neck. He did a few peculiar things with
his apparently boneless body, and finally wriggled along the ground exactly
like a snake!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’ll
be dressed in a sort of snake-skin when he does his act properly,’ said Jeremy.
‘Queer, isn’t he?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
on earth does he do it?’ wondered Julian, amazed. ‘He bends his arms and legs
all the wrong ways! Mine would break if I did that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
it’s easy for him!’ said Jeremy. ‘It’s just that he’s completely double-jointed
- he can bend his arms both ways, and his legs both ways, and make them seem so
loose that it looks as if he really is boneless. He’s a nice chap. You’d like
him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
felt a bit doubtful. What queer people made up a circus! It was a world of its
own. She jumped suddenly as there came the sound of a trumpet blowing loudly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
for supper,’ said Jeremy gleefully. ‘Come on - let’s go to old Grandma and her
pot! Buck up, all of you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jeremy
led the way out of the circus-ring. It had been well-lighted, and the night
seemed very dark outside the ring. They went over the field to where a large
fire was burning, cleverly set about with stones. An enormous cooking-pot was
hung over it, and a very, very nice smell came to their noses as they went near.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Old
Grandma was there, of course, and she began stirring the pot when she saw them.
‘You’ve been a long time in the ring,’ she grumbled to Grandad. ‘Anything gone
wrong?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said Grandad, and sniffed the air. ‘I’m hungry. That smells good. Jeremy, help
your Grandma.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
Grandad,’ said Jeremy, and took a pile of plates to the old lady, who at once
began ladling out pieces of meat and potatoes and vegetables from the steaming
pot. Old Grandad turned to Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- did you like our little rehearsal?’ he asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes!’ said Julian. ‘I’m only sorry you didn’t rehearse all the turns. I badly
wanted to see the acrobats and the clowns. Are they here? I can’t see them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes - there’s one clown over there - look - with Madelon, who had the horses,’
said Grandad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children looked - and were very disappointed. ‘Is he a clown?’ said Dick,
disbelievingly. ‘He doesn’t look a bit funny. He looks miserable.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
Monty all right,’ said Grandad. ‘He always looks like that out of the ring.
He’ll make you double up with laughter when the circus is on, he’s a born clown
- but a lot of clowns are like Monty when they’re not performing - not much to
say for themselves, and looking miserable. Winks is a bit livelier - that’s
him, pulling Madelon’s hair. He’ll get a smacked face in a minute, he’s a real
tease. There - I knew he’d get a clip on the ear!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Winks
went howling over to the children, boo-hooing most realistically. ‘She smacked
me!’ he said. ‘And she’s got such p-p-p-pretty hair!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children couldn’t help laughing. Mischief ran to the clown, jumped up on his
shoulder and chattered comforting monkey-words into his ear. Charlie the Chimp
let himself out of his cage, and came to put his great paw into Winks’s hand.
They both thought that Winks really was hurt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
enough, Winks,’ said Grandad. ‘You’ll have the horses comforting you next! You
do that in the ring tomorrow when we open, and you’ll bring the house down. Sit
down, and have your supper.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mr
Tapper,’ said Julian. ‘There’s one member of your circus we didn’t see at the
rehearsal - and that’s Mr Wooh, the Wonder Magician. Why wasn’t he there?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
he never rehearses,’ said Mr Tapper. ‘He keeps himself to himself, does Mr
Wooh. He may come and join us for supper, and he may not. As we’re opening the
circus tomorrow night, maybe he’ll turn up tonight. I’m a bit scared of him, to
tell you the truth.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
he’s not a real wizard, is he?’ asked Tinker.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
when I talk to Mr Wooh I feel as if he is,’ said Mr Tapper. ‘There isn’t a thing
he doesn’t know about figures, there isn’t a thing he can’t do with them. Ask
him to multiply any number by any other number, running into dozens of figures,
and he’ll tell you in a second. He shouldn’t be in a circus. He should be an
inventor of some sort - an inventor whose invention needs pages and pages of
figures. He’d be happy then.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
sounds a bit like my father,’ said Tinker. ‘He’s an inventor, you know, and
sometimes when I creep into his study I see papers FULL of millions of tiny
figures and plans and diagrams with tiny figures all over them too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Very
interesting,’ said Grandad. ‘Your father and Mr Wooh ought to meet. They would
probably talk figures all day long! My word - what’s that you’re handing round,
young lady?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Some
of the food we brought,’ said Anne. ‘Have a sausage or two, Mr Tapper - and a
roll - and a tomato.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
thanks,’ said Mr Tapper, pleased. ‘Very kind of you. Nice to have met you all.
You might be able to teach Jeremy a few manners!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Grandad
- here’s Mr Wooh!’ said Jeremy, suddenly, and got up. Everyone turned round. So
this was Mr Wooh the Wonder Magician. Well, he certainly looked the part.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
stood there, with a half-smile on his face, tall, commanding and handsome. His
hair was thick, and black as soot, his eyes gleamed in the fire-light, half
hidden by great eye-brows, and he wore a thin, pointed beard. He had a
curiously deep voice, and spoke like a foreigner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
we have visitors this night?’ he said, and showed a row of gleaming white teeth
in a quick smile. ‘May I join you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
do, Mr Wooh,’ said Anne, delighted to have the chance of talking to a Wonder
Magician. ‘We’ve brought plenty of food. Do you like cold sausage - and tomato
- and a roll?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Most
deelicious!’ said the magician, and sat down cross-legged to join the group.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
were disappointed not to see you at the rehearsal,’ said Dick. ‘I’d have liked
to hear you doing all kinds of wizard sums in your head, as quick as
lightning!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘My
father can do that too,’ said Tinker proudly. ‘He’s a wizard at figures as
well. He’s an inventor.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ha!
An inventor? And what does he invent?’ asked Mr Wooh, eating his roll.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
was enough to set Tinker describing at once how wonderful his father was. ‘He
can invent anything he’s asked for,’ said the boy, proudly. ‘He invented a
wonderful thing for keeping aeroplanes dead straight in the right direction -
better than any idea before. He invented the sko-wheel, if you know what that
is - and the electric trosymon, if you’ve ever heard of that. I don’t suppose you
have, though. They’re too...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wait,
boy!’ said Mr Wooh, sounding most interested. ‘These things I have heard of,
yes. I do not know them, but I have certainly heard of them. Your father must
be a very, very clever man, with a most unusual brain.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tinker
swelled with pride. ‘Something got into the papers about his inventions a
little while ago,’ he said, ‘and reporters came down to see Dad, and his name
was in the papers - but Dad was awfully cross about it. You see, he’s in the
middle of the biggest idea he’s ever thought of and it messed up his work to
have people coming to interview him - some of them even peered through the
window, and went to see his wonderful tower, with its...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Tower?
He has a tower?’ said Mr Wooh, full of surprise. Before Tinker could answer, he
received a hard poke from Julian’s finger. He turned crossly, to see Julian
frowning fiercely at him. So was George. He went suddenly red in the face. Of
course - he had been told never to talk about his father’s work. It was secret work,
very secret.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
pretended to choke over a piece of meat, hoping that Julian would take the
chance of changing the subject - and Julian did, of' course!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mr
Wooh, could you do a bit of magic reckoning with figures?’ he asked. ‘I’ve
heard that you can give the answers to any sum as quick as lightning.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
is true,’ said Mr Wooh. ‘There is nothing that I cannot do with figures. Ask me
anything you like, and I will give you the answer at once!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
Mr Wooh, answer this then,’ cried Tinker. ‘Multiply sixty-three thousand, three
hundred and forty-two by eighty thousand, nine hundred and fifty-three! Ha -
you can’t do that in a hurry!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
answer is, in figures, 5127724926,’ said Mr Wooh at once, with a slight bow.
‘That is an easy question, my boy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Crumbs!’
said Tinker, astounded. He turned to Julian. ‘Is that right, Ju?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
worked out the sum on paper. ‘Yes. Absolutely correct. Whew!’ he said. ‘You
said that as quick as lightning!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let
me give him a sum to do!’ cried George. ‘What do you get if you multiply 602491
by 352, Mr Magician?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
get the figures 2-1-2-0-7-6-8-3-2,’ said Mr Wooh, immediately. And once more
Julian worked out the sum on paper. He raised his head and grinned. ‘Yes -
correct. How do you do it so quickly?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Magic
- just a little elementary magic!’ answered Mr Wooh. ‘Try it sometime yourself.
I am sure that this boy’s father would be as quick as I am!’ He looked at
Tinker. ‘I should much like to meet your clever father, my boy,’ he said in his
deep, foreign-sounding voice. ‘We would have much, so much to talk about. I
have heard about his wonderful tower. A monument to his genius! Ah, you see,
even we foreigners know of your father’s great work. Surely he is afraid of
having his secrets stolen?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
I don’t think so,’ said Tinker. ‘The tower is a pretty good hiding-place,
and...’ He stopped suddenly, and went red again as he received an even harder
kick from Julian. How could he be such an ass as to give away the fact that his
father’s secret plans and models were hidden in the tower?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
thought it was time to take Tinker firmly away from Mr Wooh and give him a good
lecture on keeping his mouth shut. He looked at his watch, and pretended to be
horrified at the time. ‘Good gracious-do you know what the time is? Jenny will
be ringing up the police if we don’t get back straight away. Come on, Tinker,
and you others, we must go. Thanks most awfully, Grandad, for letting us share
your supper.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
we haven’t yet finished!’ said Grandad. ‘You haven’t had enough to eat.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
really couldn’t eat any more,’ said Dick, following Julian’s determined lead.
‘See you tomorrow, Grandad. Good night, Grandma. Thanks very much indeed.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ve
still got bananas and apples to eat,’ said Tinker, feeling obstinate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
we brought those for Charlie the Chimp,’ said Dick, not quite truthfully. He
could have boxed Tinker’s ears! Silly little fathead, couldn’t he realize that
Julian wanted to get him away from this cunning Mr Wooh? Wait till he got
Tinker by himself!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tinker
found himself hustled on all sides, and felt a bit scared. Julian sounded
rather fierce, he thought. Old Grandad was most astonished at the sudden
departure of his guests - but Charlie the Chimp didn’t mind! The guests had
left behind a most generous supply of fruit!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Over
the fence they all went, with Julian hustling Tinker in front of him. Once over
the fence and out of Mr Wooh’s hearing, Julian and George rounded on the boy
angrily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Are
you mad, Tinker?’ demanded Julian. ‘Didn’t you guess that that foreign fellow was
trying to pump you about your father’s hush-hush job?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
wasn’t,’ said Tinker, almost in tears. ‘You’re just exaggerating!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I hope I never try to give away my father’s secret work!’ said George, in a
tone of such disgust that Tinker could have howled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wasn’t trying to!’ he said. ‘Mr Wooh’s all right. Why should you think he
isn’t?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t like him and I don’t trust him,’ said Julian, sounding suddenly very
grown up. ‘But there you sat lapping up everything he said, ready to pour out
all he wanted to know. I’m ashamed of you. You’d get a jolly good thrashing if
your father had heard you. I only hope you haven’t already said too much. You
know how angry your father was when a report of his latest ideas got into the
papers, and swarms of people came prying round the house...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tinker
could stand it no longer. He gave a forlorn howl that made Mischief jump, and
fled up the garden to the house, the little monkey running swiftly behind him.
He wanted to comfort Tinker. What was the matter? Poor little Mischief felt
bewildered, and tried his best to catch up the sobbing Tinker. He caught him up
at last, leapt to the boy’s shoulder and put his little furry arms round
Tinker’s neck, making a queer comforting noise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
Mischief,’ said Tinker. ‘I’m glad you’re still my friend. The others won’t be
now, I know. Aren’t I an idiot, Mischief? But I was only being proud of my
father, I was, really!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mischief
clung to Tinker, puzzled and upset. Tinker stopped outside the tall tower.
There was a light at the top. His father must still be working there. A faint
humming noise came to his ears. He wondered if it was those queer, spindly
tentacles right at the very top of the tower, that made the noise. Suddenly the
light at the top of the tower went out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dad
must have finished his work for tonight,’ thought Tinker. ‘He’ll be coming to
the house. I’d better go. He might wonder why I’m all upset. Gosh, I never
heard Julian be so angry before. He sounded as if he absolutely despised me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
crept up the path that led to the house, and in at the garden door. Better not
go and see Jenny. She might worm everything out of him, and be as disgusted
with him as Julian was. She would wonder why he wasn’t camping out with them.
He’d go upstairs and sleep in his own bed tonight!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on, Mischief,’ he said, in a mournful voice. ‘We’ll go to bed, and you can
cuddle down with me. You’d never be mean to me, would you? You’d always be my
friend.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mischief
jabbered away, and the funny little monkey voice comforted Tinker all the time
he undressed. He flung himself into bed, and Mischief lay at the bottom, on his
feet. ‘I shall never be able to get to sleep tonight,’ said Tinker, still
miserable. ‘Never!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
he fell asleep at once - which was a great pity, really. He might have shared
in quite a bit of excitement, if he hadn’t slept so soundly! Poor Tinker!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and the others made no attempt to follow Tinker. ‘Let him go, the little ass!’
said Julian. ‘Come into one of the tents and have a low pow-wow before we get
undressed and go to sleep.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
sorry poor old Tinker isn’t going to camp out with us, our first night in the
field,’ said Anne. ‘I don’t think he meant to give anything away.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
no excuse, Anne,’ said George. ‘He can be an awful little fathead at times, and
he’s got to learn not to be. Let’s go to our tent. I feel quite tired. Come
along, Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
yawned and Dick yawned too. Then Julian found himself yawning. ‘Awfully
catching, this yawning business!’ he said. ‘Well, it’s turned out to be a
lovely night as regards weather - warm and dry - and there’s a nice little
half-moon to look at. Good night, girls, sleep tight! And don’t scream if a
spider wakes you, because I warn you, I am NOT going to get up to deal with a
harmless spider!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
wait till one runs all over your face!’ said Anne, ‘and starts making a web
from your nose to your chin and catches flies in it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t,
Anne,’ said George. ‘I’m not a bit scared of spiders, but that’s a horrible idea
of yours! Timmy, please watch out for spiders, and give me warning of them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
laughed. ‘Well, good night, girls,’ said Dick. ‘Pity about young Tinker. Still,
he’s got to learn a few things, and keeping his mouth shut is one of them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were all quite tired, and it wasn’t long before everyone’s torch was out, and
peace and quiet descended on the little camp. Much farther up the field the
circus was also peaceful and quiet, though there were still lights here and
there in the tents. Someone belonging to the circus band was strumming a banjo,
but not loudly, and the sound was pleasant to hear - strum-a-strum -
strum-a-strum - strummmm...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
few clouds blew up and slid across the moon. One by one the lights went out in
the circus tents. The wind blew softly through the trees, and an owl hooted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
was still awake. She lay listening to the wind, and to the owl’s
‘Too-whoo-too-whit’, and then she too fell asleep. Nobody heard someone
stirring in the circus camp. Nobody saw a shadowy figure creep out when the
moon was safely behind a cloud. It was late, very late, and the two camps were
lost in dreams.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was fast asleep too - but in his sleep he heard a faint sound, and at once he
was awake. He didn’t move, except for his ears, which switched themselves up to
listen. He gave a little growl, but not enough to wake George. So long as the
person who was moving about in the circus camp did not come near to George’s
tent, or the boys’ tent, Timmy did not mean to bark. He heard a tiny grunt, and
recognized it at once. Charlie the Chimp! Well, that was all right! Timmy fell
asleep again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tinker,
too, was fast asleep in his bed up at the house, Mischief at his feet. He had
thought he would be too miserable to sleep, but found himself half-dreaming in no
time. He didn’t hear a small noise outside, a very small noise indeed - a
little scrape, as if someone’s foot had caught against a stone. Then there came
other very small noises - and a whisper of a voice - and more noises again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
heard anything at all until Jenny woke up thirsty, and stretched out her hand
to get a glass of water from her bed-table. She didn’t switch her light on, and
was about to lie down again when her quick ears caught a little sound.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
sat up. ‘That can’t be the children,’ she thought. ‘They’re camping down in the
field. Oh my goodness me, I hope it’s not a burglar - or someone trying to
steal the Professor’s secrets. He’s got papers all over the place. Thank
goodness he keeps most of them in that tower of his!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
listened and then lay down again. But soon she heard another little noise, and
sat up, scared. ‘It sounds as if it comes from the tower,’ she thought, and got
out of bed. No - there was no light in the tower - no light anywhere, that she
could see. The moon was behind a cloud. She’d just wait till it slid out and
lighted up the courtyard below, and the tower. There! That was another little
noise. Could it be the wind? No, it couldn’t. And now, what was that? It
sounded just like someone whispering down there in the courtyard. Jenny felt
really frightened, and began to shake. She must go and wake the Professor!
Suppose it was someone after his precious papers? Or his wonderful new
invention!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
moon swung out from behind the cloud and Jenny peered cautiously out of the
window again. She gave a loud scream, and staggered back into her room, still
screaming. ‘There’s a man! Help! Help! He’s climbing up the wall of the tower!
Professor! PROFESSOR HAYLING! Come quickly! Thieves, robbers, help, help! Get
the police!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
came a long slithering sound, and before Jenny dared to look out again, the
moon had gone behind another cloud, and she could not see a thing in the sudden
darkness. There was a deep silence after the slithering noise, and Jenny
couldn’t bear it. She rushed out of her bedroom, yelling at the top of her
voice. ‘THIEVES! ROBBERS! SIR, COME QUICKLY!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Professor woke with a jump, threw off his bedclothes and rushed out into the
passage, almost colliding with Jenny. He clutched at her, thinking she was the
thief, and she screamed again, sure that one of the intruders had got hold of
her. They struggled together, and then the Professor realized that he wasn’t
holding a thief, he was holding poor, plump Jenny!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘JENNY!
What on earth are you doing, waking up the whole household!’ said the
Professor, switching on the passage light. ‘Have you had a bad dream - a
nightmare?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
sir, no sir,’ panted Jenny, out of breath with her struggle. ‘Sir, there’s
robbers about. I saw one climbing up the tower wall - and there must have been
others below. I heard them whispering, sir. Oh, I’m that scared! What shall we
do? Can you telephone for the police, sir?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,’
said the Professor, doubtfully. ‘Are you quite sure, Jenny, that you didn’t
have a nightmare? I mean - if there really are robbers, I’ll certainly
telephone - but it’s rather a long way for the police to come out here, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
sir - then won’t you just take a torch and look round the place?’ begged Jenny.
‘You know there’s your precious papers in that tower, sir. And isn’t there that
new invention of yours? Oh yes, I know I’m not supposed to know anything about
it, sir, but I do dust your rooms thoroughly, you know, and I see quite a lot,
though I keep my mouth shut, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
yes, Jenny, I know,’ said poor Professor Hayling, trying to stop Jenny’s stream
of talk. ‘But honestly, everything seems quiet now. I’ve looked out into the
courtyard. There’s no one there. And you know as well as I do that nobody can
get into my tower. It has three different keys - one to unlock the bottom door
- one for the middle door, half-way up - and one for the top door. Jenny, be
sensible. Nobody could have used my three keys. Look, there they are on my
dressing-table.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jenny
began to calm down, but she still wasn’t satisfied. ‘I did hear whispering, and
I did see someone half-way up the wall of the tower, sir. Please do come down
with me, sir, and let’s look around. I daren’t go on my own. But I shan’t sleep
again tonight till I know nobody’s forced the tower door, or taken a ladder to
go up the tower.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right, Jenny,’ said the Professor, with a sigh. ‘Put on your dressing-gown, and
I’ll put mine on too - we’ll try the doors, and we’ll look for a ladder -
though, mind you, it would have to be an absolutely colossal one to reach the
top of that tower. Nobody could possibly bring one that size and length into
our small courtyard! All right, all right - we’ll go.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
so, a few minutes later, Jenny and the Professor were down in the courtyard.
There was no sign of any ladder at all - no sign of anyone climbing up the
wall-and the downstairs tower door was safely locked! ‘You unlock the door,
sir, and go up to the top room and see if that door’s locked too,’ begged
Jenny.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think you’re being rather silly now, Jenny,’ said the Professor impatiently.
‘Here, take the keys yourself. This one’s locked, of course - and if the middle
door is still locked, you’ll know nobody could have got into my top room.
Hurry, Jenny.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
Jenny, still trembling, slid a key into the bottom lock, opened the door, and
began to climb the spiral stair that led upwards. Half-way was another door,
also safely locked. She unlocked this too. She began to feel rather silly.
Nobody could have gone through locked doors. And there now - the top one was
well and truly locked also! She gave a sigh of relief and ran down the spiral
stairway, locking the middle door, and then the bottom one. She gave the keys
to the Professor, who by now was feeling rather chilly!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
locked, sir,’ said Jenny. ‘But I’m still sure someone was about. I could have
sworn I saw someone up that tower-wall, and heard somebody else whispering
below.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
expect you were so scared that you imagined things, Jenny,’ said the Professor,
yawning. ‘I think you’ll agree with me that the wall is far too steep for
anyone to climb - and I’m pretty certain I’d have heard it if a ladder had been
dragged about the courtyard!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I’m sure I’m very sorry, sir,’ said poor Jenny. ‘It’s a good thing we didn’t
wake Tinker - though I’m surprised Mischief didn’t hear something and come
running down the stairs.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
Mischief is surely with Tinker, camping out in the field!’ said the Professor
in surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
- Tinker and Mischief are back, sir. I found them asleep in bed - but not the
others!’ said Jenny. ‘Maybe Tinker has quarrelled with them. Funny that
Mischief didn’t come running out to see what was up - he must have heard us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mischief
is clever - but not clever enough to open Tinker’s bedroom door,’ said the
Professor, yawning again. ‘Good night, Jenny. Don’t worry. You’ll feel all
right in the morning, and that will be that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Professor went sleepily to his room. He looked out of the window down into the
courtyard and then across at the tower, and smiled. Dear Jenny! She did rather
let her imagination run away with her! As if anyone in the world could get up
into that tower room without a ladder! And now could a long, long ladder be
brought into that small courtyard without either being seen or heard? The
Professor yawned once more and climbed into bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
someone had been in the tower room! Someone very clever, someone very
light-fingered! What a shock for poor Professor Hayling next morning, when he
crossed the courtyard, unlocked the bottom door of the tower - walked up the
spiral stairway - unlocked the middle door, and went on up the stairway again -
and finally unlocked the top door and opened it wide.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
stood and stared in horror. The place was upside down! All his papers were
scattered everywhere. He crouched down at once to see if any were missing. Yes
- quite a lot! But they seemed to have been taken quite haphazardly - a few
pages from this note-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>book
- a few pages from that - some letters he had written and left on his desk to
post - and good gracious, the ink was spilt all over the place - and the little
clock was gone from the mantelpiece. So Jenny was right - a thief had been
about last night. A thief that could apparently get through three locked doors
- or else could climb up a long, long ladder that he had put outside without
being seen - and taken away again!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
have to ring the police,’ he thought. ‘But I must say it’s a mystery! I wonder
if Tinker heard anything in the night? No, he couldn’t have, or he would have
run to fetch me. It’s a mystery - a real puzzle of a MYSTERY!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tinker
was horrified when Jenny told him the next morning what had happened. ‘Your
father’s in a rare old state,’ she said. ‘He came down early this morning,
because he wanted to finish some work up in the tower - and as soon as he
unlocked the top door into the tower room, he saw the whole room upside down
and some of his precious papers gone, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘JENNY!
How awful!’ said Tinker. ‘Dad kept his most precious papers there - with all
the figures for that new electric thing of his. It’s a wonderful thing, too
marvellous for words, Jenny, it’s for...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
don’t you give away any of your father’s plans, not even to me,’ said Jenny.
‘You’ve been told that before. Maybe you’ve been talking too much already, and
somebody’s ears took it all in!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tinker
suddenly felt quite sick. Was it because of something he had been silly enough
to say in public? In the bus, perhaps? Or in the circus-field? What would the
others say - especially Julian - when they heard that someone had come in the
night and stolen precious papers, containing figures and diagrams for some of
his father’s inventions? Julian would be sure to say that it was his fault for
not keeping his mouth shut! Oh dear - would this be in the papers - and would
hordes of people come visiting the place again, staring and whispering and
exclaiming in awe at his father’s curious tower, with its waving tentacles?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
dressed quickly and ran downstairs. Jenny had told him that she was sure she
had heard whispering down in the courtyard the night before, and had seen
someone climbing up the tower. ‘Your father says nobody could have brought a
long ladder into that courtyard,’ she said. ‘Not without us seeing it, anyway,
or hearing some kind of noise when it was dragged in. But it might have been a
sliding ladder, mightn’t it? That would be a smallish thing, with ropes to pull
out the sliding part.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
Like the window-cleaner uses,’ said Tinker. ‘I say - could it have been the
window-cleaner, do you think?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
He’s a real decent fellow,’ said Jenny. ‘I’ve known him for twenty years. So
put that out of your head. But the ladder could certainly have been the sort
that window-cleaners use. We’ll go out into the courtyard as soon as I’ve
finished washing-up, and see if we can find the marks where the ladder was
dragged over the courtyard. Though I must say I didn’t hear any dragging
noises. I heard whispering - and a kind of slithery noise - but that’s all.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
slithery noise might have been made by the ladder when it was dragged along!’
said Tinker. ‘I say - look at old Mischief. He’s listening as if he understood
every word. Mischief, why didn’t you wake me up last night when all this was
going on? You usually wake if anything unusual happens, or you hear a strange
noise.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mischief
leapt into Tinker’s arms and cuddled there. He didn’t like it when Tinker was
upset about anything; he knew by the boy’s voice that he was worried. He made
small comforting noises, and rubbed his monkey nose against the boy’s chin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’d
better go to your father,’ said Jenny. ‘You might be able to comfort him a
little. He’s very upset indeed. He’s up in the tower room, trying to sort out
his papers. My word, they were left in a state - scattered all over the room!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tinker
stood up to go, and was astonished to find that he was shaky at the knees.
Would his father ask him if he had been talking about the work he was doing? Oh
dear - he had even boasted about it just the day before, and talked about his
father’s sko-wheel, and the wonderful new machine, the electric trosymon!
Tinker’s knees became shakier than ever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
fortunately his father was far too upset about his muddled room and missing
papers to worry about anything Tinker had said or done. He was up in the tower
room, trying to discover which of his papers were missing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah,
Tinker,’ he said, when the boy came into the tower room. ‘Just give me a hand,
will you? The thief who came last night must have knocked the whole bunch of
papers off the table, down on the floor - and fortunately he seems not to have
seen some that went under the table. So I doubt very much if the papers he did
take away with him will be of any use. He’d need to be quite a scientist to
understand them, without having the ones he left behind.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Will
he come back for the others, then?’ asked Tinker.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Probably,’
said his father. ‘But I shall hide them somewhere. Can you think of a good
hiding-place, Tinker?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dad
- don’t you hide them,’ begged Tinker. ‘Not unless you tell me where they are!
You know how you forget things! You might forget where you’d put this bunch of
papers, and then you wouldn’t be able to go on with your inventions. Have you
copies of the stolen sheets of figures and diagrams?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
But they’re all in my head as well as on paper,’ said his father. ‘It will take
me a bit of time to work them all out again, but it can be done. It’s a
nuisance-especially as I’m working to a date. Now run along, Tinker, please.
I’ve work to do.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tinker
went down the spiral staircase of the tower. He’d have to make sure that his
father did hide away those papers very carefully indeed - in some really good
place. ‘Oh dear - I hope he won’t do what he did with the last lot of papers he
wanted to hide,’ he thought. ‘He stuffed them up the chimney - and they nearly
went up in flames because Jenny thought she’d light the fire the next night, it
was unexpectedly so cold. Good thing they fell down when she laid the fire, and
she rescued them before they got burnt! Why are brainy people like Dad so silly
about ordinary things? I say he’ll either forget where he puts them - or go and
hide them in some easy place where anyone could find them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went to talk to Jenny. ‘Jenny - Dad says that the thief only took some of his
papers - and that he can’t make much use of the ones he took, unless he has the
whole lot. And Dad says he thinks that when the thief finds this out, he’ll try
to steal the rest of the papers.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
let him try!’ said Jenny. ‘I could hide them in a place where no thief would
find them - if your Dad would let me have them. I shan’t tell you where!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
afraid he might hide them up a chimney again, or some silly place like that,’
said Tinker, looking so worried that Jenny felt really worried too! ‘They’ve
got to be hidden somewhere NOBODY would think of looking. And if Dad finds a
place like that he’ll promptly forget all about it, and never be able to find
them again! But a thief might find them - he’d know ALL the places to look in.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Let’s
go up to the tower room, and clear up the mess that the spilt ink made, and see
if your father has taken his precious papers, and hidden them somewhere there,’
said Jenny. ‘It would be just like him to hide them in the very room that the
thief went to last night! Up the ladder, in at the window - left wide open,
I’ve no doubt - snatched up every paper he could see, the rogue, and then raced
down the ladder again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on up to the tower, then,’ said Tinker. ‘I only hope Dad isn’t there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
just crossing the courtyard, look,’ said Jenny, leaning out of the window.
‘See, there he is - carrying something under his arm.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘His
morning newspapers,’ said Tinker. ‘It looks as if he’s going to have a jolly
good read, doesn’t it? Oh dear, I do hope all this won’t be printed in the
newspapers - it would bring hordes of people down here again. Do you remember
how awful it was last time, Jenny - people even walked over the flower-beds!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hoo
- some people like to poke their noses into everything!’ said Jenny. ‘I don’t
mind telling you that I emptied my dirty washing-water out of the window on to
a few of them - quite by mistake, of course - how was I to know they were out
there, staring up and down?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tinker
gave a shout of laughter. ‘I wish I’d seen that!’ he said. ‘Oh Jenny - if
people come poking their noses into Dad’s business again, DO let’s empty water
on their silly heads! Come on, Jenny - let’s go up to the tower room now Dad’s
out of the way. Quick!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were soon out in the courtyard, and as they crossed it, Jenny stopped and
looked hard at the ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
are you looking for?’ asked Tinker.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Just
to see if there are any marks that might have been made by someone dragging a
ladder across,’ said Jenny. ‘I heard a funny slithering sound, you know - but
it didn’t sound like a ladder being dragged across.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two of them looked all over the courtyard, but could see no marks there that
could possibly have been made by a ladder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Funny,’
said Jenny. ‘It worries me, that slithery sound.’ She looked up at the tall,
steep wall of the tower. It was made of flint-stones of all shapes and sizes,
the kind found in the country-side round about Kirrin and Big Hollow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I suppose a cat might climb up,’ said Jenny, doubtfully. ‘But not a man. He’d
slip sooner or later. It would be far too dangerous. I doubt if even a cat
would get far.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
yet you say you thought you saw someone up the tower-wall!’ said Tinker. ‘Go
on, Jenny - it must have been the shadow of a passing cloud that you saw! Look
up this wall - now can you imagine ANYONE climbing up it at night, when it was
dark?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jenny
stared up. ‘No - you’re right. Only a madman would even try. Well, my eyes must
have played me up, then, when I looked out last night - but I really did think
I saw a dark shadow climbing up the tower-wall. Still, it’s easy to be mistaken
at night. And I don’t believe there was a ladder, either! There would be marks
on the paving-stones of the courtyard if there had been a ladder. Oh well -
let’s hurry on up to the tower room before your Dad decides to go back to it
again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went up the spiral stairway. All the doors were unlocked, so it was plain that
the Professor was going to come back again after he had read his papers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
the same - he shouldn’t leave the doors unlocked, even for a minute!’ said
Jenny. ‘Well, here we are - just look at the ink-splashes everywhere - and that
dear little clock that kept such good time is gone. Now what would the thief
want with a clock, I’d like to know?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
would be small and neat enough to pop into his pocket,’ said Tinker. ‘If he was
dishonest enough to steal Dad’s papers, he would certainly not say no to a nice
little clock like that! He’s probably taken other things too!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went right into the room, and Jenny at once gave a loud exclamation. LOOK!
Aren’t those some of the papers your father was working on - on the table
there? All covered with tiny figures?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tinker
looked closely at them. ‘Yes - they’re his very latest papers. He showed me
them the other day. I remember this diagram. Jenny - how COULD he leave them on
the table with the door unlocked this morning - when only last night the thief
was here! How could he? He said he was going to hide them away so carefully,
because, if the thief found them, he could use them with the other papers that
were stolen - but as long as the thief only had half of them, they wouldn’t be
much use - and now he’s forgotten all about hiding them, after all!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
now, Tinker - let’s hide them away ourselves,’ said Jenny, ‘and not tell him
where they are. These thieves will have another try for them, no doubt about
that. Let’s think of some place where they’d be absolutely safe.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
know!’ said Tinker. ‘We could hide them on Kirrin Island! Somewhere in the old
ruined castle! NOBODY would guess they were there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
that’s a fine idea!’ said Jenny. ‘I’d be glad to think they were out of the
house.’ She gathered up the papers quickly. ‘Here you are. You’d better tell
Julian and the others, and go across to the island with them as soon as you
can. My, what a relief to think they’ll be well away from here. I’ll be able to
sleep soundly in my bed at nights then!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tinker
stuffed the precious papers under his coat, and he and Jenny ran at top speed
down the spiral stairway. They saw the Professor not far off, and he turned and
hailed them. ‘Tinker! Jenny! I know what you’re going to ask me! You want to
know where I’ve hidden those papers of mine. Come here and I’ll whisper!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Not
knowing quite what to say, the two went rather guiltily over to Tinker’s
father. He whispered loudly, ‘I’ve wrapped them up, and put them under the coal
at the back of the coal-cellar - right at the very back!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
a fine mess you’ve made of your trousers, sir,’ said Jenny, disgusted. ‘And
good gracious - you must have sat down in the coal yourself! You look a right
mess. Come along and let me brush you down. Not indoors though, or the place
will be thick with coal-dust!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
you think it was a good hiding-place, Jenny?’ asked the Professor. ‘Ha - you
thought I’d forget to hide them, didn’t you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went off, looking very pleased with himself. Jenny chuckled in delight. ‘Dear
old Professor! He’s hidden all his newspapers there, but not a single one of
his own precious papers. And now whatever shall we tell him when he wants the
morning papers? Tinker, you cycle out to the paper-shop and get another lot.
Land-snakes - what it is to have a brainy man in the house? Whatever will he do
next!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Thirteen<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>QUITE
A LOT OF PLANS!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
Tinker had fetched a new supply of morning papers, he decided to go down to the
camp in the field and tell the others all that had happened that morning. He
still felt angry about being ticked off by Julian the night before - but he
simply couldn’t wait to tell the others about the robbery - and about the grand
idea he, Tinker, had of hiding the rest of his father’s papers on Kirrin
Island.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
off he went, with Mischief happily on his shoulder, holding tightly to his
hair. The others were all there in the field. They had just come back from a
shopping expedition, and Tinker’s eyes gleamed when he saw the various tinned
meats and tinned fruits, fresh rolls, tomatoes and apples and bananas that had
been brought back from the shops at Big Hollow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was glad to see that Tinker looked bright and cheerful. He was afraid that the
boy might have sulked, and that would have spoilt things for the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hi!’
said Tinker. ‘I’ve got news!’ And he proceeded to tell the others all about the
happenings of the night before, ending up with his father solemnly going off to
hide his morning newspapers under the coal at the back of the coal-cellar,
under the impression that he was hiding the rest of his precious papers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
why on earth didn’t you tell him he had left his valuable papers behind and
hidden his newspapers?’ asked George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Because
if he knew that, he’d go and hide the precious papers somewhere, and forget
where he’d put them - and they might be lost for ever!’ said Tinker.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
what are you going to do with them?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
had rather a brain-wave,’ said Tinker, as modestly as he could. ‘Er - I thought
that we’d hide them away ourselves, where nobody could possibly find them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
where is this wonderful hiding-place?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘On
Kirrin Island!’ said Tinker, triumphantly. ‘Who’d think of looking there? And
as we shall all know the hiding-place, we can’t possibly forget it. The papers
will be absolutely safe. Dad can get on with the rest of his ideas without
worrying about anything.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Have
you told him all this?’ asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
no,’ said Tinker. ‘Jenny thought we’d better just keep it to ourselves. She’s
pretty certain the thieves will try their hand at breaking in to get the rest
of the papers, though.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ha!
Well, I vote we scribble some papers ourselves,’ said Dick. ‘Complete with
wonderful diagrams, and all kinds of peculiar figurings and numberings. I feel
I could do that very well! And we’d leave them up in the tower room for the
thieves to take - they’d think they were the ones they’d missed!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
chuckled. ‘Ass!’ said Julian. ‘Still - it’s not a bad idea to leave something
behind for the thieves that isn’t worth a moment’s look - and hide the genuine
figures where they’d never dream of finding them - on Kirrin Island!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘When
shall we go?’ asked George. ‘It’s ages since I’ve visited my island - and will
you believe it, last time I rowed over, trippers had been there and left their
beastly mess everywhere! Paper bags, broken glass, lettuce leaves, orange peel,
ugh!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
DO people do that?’ asked Anne. ‘They’d hate to have to sit in the midst of
other people’s mess - so why in the world can’t they clear up their own?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
they’re probably just like that in their own homes,’ said Dick. ‘All mess and
litter - and yet it takes so little time to clear up a picnic mess, and leave
the place decent for the next comers.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
did you do with all the mess left on Kirrin Island?’ asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
buried it deep in the sand at the back of one of the beaches,’ said George.
‘Where the tide can’t turn it all up again. And with every dig of my spade I
said “Blow you, you awful trippers without manners, blow you - and next time
you go anywhere, may you find someone else’s litter to make you feel sick. Blow
you!”’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
looked and sounded so very fierce that everyone burst out laughing. Timmy sat
there with his tongue lolling out, looking as if he were laughing too, and
Mischief made a funny little noise rather like a giggle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
old George. She always says straight out what she thinks!’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
sat and talked over their plans for some time. ‘Dick and Julian had better make
the fake plans and figures,’ said George. ‘They’d be better at that kind of
thing than anyone else. And Tinker can plant them somewhere in his father’s
tower room for the thief to take if he goes there again - and I bet he will. He
found it easy enough last night!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
George could take Tinker’s father’s papers with the correct figures and plans
over to Kirrin Island,’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
till night-time, though,’ said Dick. ‘If anyone were on the watch, and saw
George rowing over there, they might guess she was taking something important
to hide. They might be watching her father too. By the way - where are these
papers? You did not leave them behind at home, did you, Tinker?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
didn’t dare to,’ said Tinker. ‘I felt as if there might be eyes peeping at me,
watching and hoping I’d go out and leave the papers behind. I’ve got them under
my jersey, just here!’ And he patted the top of his stomach.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
- so that’s why you look as if you’ve had too much breakfast!’ said George. ‘Well
- what shall our plans be?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’d
better make out the false papers straight away, with figures and diagrams,’
said Julian. ‘Just in case the thieves come sooner than we think. Tinker, we’d
better go into your house to do those. If we go to George’s, her father might
spot us, and wonder what on earth we were doing. We’d probably be sent off,
anyway, because of the scarlet-fever business.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
what about my father?’ said Tinker. ‘He might spot us too. Anyway, he’s not
keen on my having anyone there this week, because he’s so busy with his new
invention. It’s awfully good, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Tinker
- don’t start spilling beans again!’ said Julian, warningly. ‘I say it would be
best to go to your house.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
about me going indoors and bringing out Dad’s big drawing-board, and some of
his paper, and his mapping pens and ink, and doing the diagrams and things out
here in the tent?’ said Tinker. ‘Honestly, I never know when Dad is going to
come into my room. He’d wonder what on earth we were doing if he found us all
there! We can have a good look at the papers I’ve got under my coat, and do a
whole lot in the same style - not the same figures, naturally - and we could do
some fancy diagrams too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right,’ said Julian, giving way, as he saw that Tinker was genuinely afraid
that his father might see them making the false papers. ‘Go and get the
drawing-board and come back with it, and anything else we’ll need. You go with
him, George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said George, and she and Tinker went up Tinker’s garden to the house. Tinker
scouted round to see if his father was anywhere about, but couldn’t see him. He
found a large drawing-board, some big sheets of paper used by his father for
working out his figures, and a book of odd, but easy-to-copy diagrams. He also
brought mapping pens, Indian ink and blotting paper, and even remembered
drawing-pins to pin the sheets of paper to the board. George carried half the
things, and kept a sharp look-out for Tinker’s father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
all right. He’s asleep somewhere - can’t you hear that noise?’ asked Tinker;
and sure enough George could - a gentle snoring from some room not far off!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went back down the garden and over the fence, handing everything to the others
before they climbed over. ‘Good!’ said Julian. ‘Now we can produce some
beautiful charts of figures that mean absolutely nothing at all - and diagrams
that will look perfect and not mean a thing either!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Better
come into the tent,’ said George. ‘If anyone wanders down from the circus camp,
they might ask us what we’re doing.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
they all went into the boys’ big tent, which was the bigger one, Timmy too, and
Mischief, who was delighted to be with the big dog. Julian soon set to work,
though he found the space rather cramped. They were all watching him in
admiration as he set out rows of beautiful, meaningless figures when Timmy
suddenly gave a deep growl, and all his hackles rose up on his neck.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
turned the drawing-board over at once, and sat on it. The canvas doorway of the
tent was pulled aside and in poked the grinning face of Charlie the Chimp!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
it’s you, Charlie!’ said Julian. ‘Well, well, well, and how are you today?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
chimpanzee grinned even more widely, and held out his hand. Julian shook it
solemnly, and the chimpanzee went carefully all round the tent, shaking hands
with everyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sit
down, Charlie,’ said Dick. ‘I suppose you’ve let yourself out of your cage as
usual, and come to see what we’ve got for our dinner. Well, you’ll be glad to
hear we’ve got enough for you as well as ourselves.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Charlie
squashed himself between Timmy and Tinker, and with much interest watched
Julian at work with his pen and ink. ‘I bet that chimp could draw, if you gave
him a piece of paper and a pencil,’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So,
to keep him quiet, he was given a pencil, and a notebook. He at once began to
scribble in it very earnestly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Goodness
- he’s doing a whole lot of funny figures,’ said Anne. ‘He’s trying to copy
you, Ju!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
he’s not careful, I’ll hand the whole job over to him!’ said Julian, with a
chuckle. ‘George, let’s talk about your plans for tonight. I think if you are
going over to Kirrin Island to hide those papers you’ve planned to hide, you
must take Timmy with you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
I will!’ said George. ‘Not that there will be a single soul on the island, but
I’d like old Tim just for company. I’ll take the papers straight to the island,
land, and hide them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where?’
asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
I’ll decide that when I’m there,’ said George. ‘Somewhere cunning! I know my
own little island from top to bottom. And there those papers will stay until
all danger is past. We’ll let Professor Hayling think he has hidden them
somewhere himself, and forgotten where! It will be fun to row across to my
island, at night, with Timmy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
thieves can make do with my figures and diagrams if they come to the tower room
again,’ said Julian. ‘Don’t they look professional?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
certainly did! Everyone looked at the neat figures and carefully drawn diagrams
with admiration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
suddenly sat up and gave a deep growl again. Charlie the Chimp patted him as if
to say, ‘What’s wrong, old boy?’ but Timmy took no notice and went on growling.
He suddenly shot out of the tent, and there was a shout from someone outside.
‘Get off! Get down! GET DOWN!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
swung back the tent opening. Mr Wooh was there, looking extremely frightened,
as Timmy growled menacingly round his ankles. Charlie the chimp ran up to him
on all fours, and, angry because Timmy was snarling at his friend, showed his
teeth suddenly at the big dog. George was terrified. ‘Don’t let them fight!’
she cried, afraid that Timmy would get decidedly the worst of it. Charlie was
jumping up and down in a most alarming way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Charleee!’
said Mr Wooh in his deep voice. ‘Charleee!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
Charlie stopped jumping up and down and making horrible noises, and leapt
straight on to Mr Wooh’s back, putting his arms round his neck.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr
Wooh bowed courteously to them all. ‘I trust I have not disturbed you, my
friends,’ he said, in his foreign-sounding voice. ‘I now take a little walk
with my friend Charleee. You come again to see our show, I hope. Yes? No?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Probably,’
said Dick, noticing that the magician had taken a quick and interested look at
Julian’s figures and diagrams. Julian covered them up immediately, as if he
didn’t want the magician to see them. He had seen something in the man’s eyes
that puzzled him. Could Mr Wooh possibly have had anything to do with the theft
of the papers the night before? After all, he was a wizard at figures himself -
he might be able to read the Professor’s figures and diagrams and understand
them perfectly. Well - he wouldn’t gather much from the ones Julian was now
doing - they were more or less nonsense made up by Julian himself to deceive
anyone interested in the real ones.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
interrupt you? Pardon me!’ said Mr Wooh, and bowed himself politely away from
the group in the tent. Charlie the Chimp followed him, hoping that Mischief
would too, so that they could have a game. But Mischief didn’t want to. He
didn’t like Mr Wooh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I didn’t realize that anyone from the circus would walk down the field so
quietly, and be able to hear what we were saying inside the tent,’ said Julian,
worried. ‘I didn’t like the look in his eyes. Dick - you don’t suppose he heard
anything we were saying, do you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Would
it matter?’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
might,’ said Julian. ‘Do you think he heard what George said about going over
to Kirrin Island with the other papers - the valuable ones that the thieves
didn’t see in the tower room last night? I wouldn’t let George go if I thought
he had heard. In fact, I think she’d better not go. She might run into danger.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
be silly, Ju,’ said George. ‘I am going. And Timmy will be with me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
heard what I said, George. You are not to go!’ said Julian. ‘I’ll take the
papers and hide them on the island. I’ll get them when it’s dark, fairly late.
I’ll cycle over to Kirrin and untie the boat you keep there, and row over to
the island.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right, Julian,’ said George, astonishingly meekly. ‘Shall we have a meal now?
We’ve only to open the tins, and empty the tomatoes and lettuces out of the
basket there. And the drinks are in that cool corner over there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Julian, glad that George had given way to him so easily. He would go
across in George’s boat and find a good hiding-place. If danger was about, he
could deal with it better than George could. After all, she was only a girl!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yes,
Julian, she is - but, as you’ve often said, she’s just as brave as a boy. Don’t
be too sure about tonight!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children stared after Mr Wooh and the chimpanzee. They saw Charlie pick up two
empty buckets, one in each strong paw, and race off to the right with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
he going?’ said Anne, astonished at the rate he was running along.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
bet he’s going to get some water from the stream in those pails, and take them
to whoever washes down the horses,’ said George. She was right! Charlie soon
came back again, walking this time, holding a heavy pail of water in each hand!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I must say that chimpanzee is jolly useful!’ said Dick. ‘Look - there’s Madelon
who trains those beautiful horses that paraded round the ring last night -
she’s wearing old trousers this morning, she looks quite different. There -
Charlie has set the pails of water down beside her. I bet that as soon as she
wants any more water, he’ll be off again to the stream!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
rather like old Charlie,’ said Anne. ‘I didn’t at first - but now I do. I wish
he didn’t belong to Mr Wooh.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
stood up, looking down at the paper on which he had so carefully written lines
of small figures and drawn many peculiar diagrams. ‘I somehow feel this isn’t
much good now,’ he said. ‘I think Mr Wooh must have guessed it was all a
make-up as soon as he saw it. He gave himself away a bit, though-I saw him looking
at the paper in a rather startled way, as if he’d seen something very like it
very recently indeed!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
he had, the wretch, if he’d sent someone up to get my Dad’s papers out of the
tower room!’ said Tinker. ‘I say - what about having a look round the circus,
to see if we can spot a ladder anywhere - one tall enough to reach the tower
room!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
idea!’ said Dick. ‘Come on - we’ll go now. Chuck that drawing-board and diagram
paper over our fence, Ju. I hardly think it’s worth your while to finish it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Five, with Tinker and Mischief, wandered down the field to where the circus was
encamped. Dick spotted a ladder, lying in the grass, and nudged Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian!
See that? Would it reach the tower?’ Julian walked over to it. It certainly was
very, very long - but would it be long enough? No - he didn’t think it would.
Still - he might as well find out who owned it. At that moment up came the
Boneless Man, walking perfectly. He grinned at the children - and then suddenly
put all his double-joints to work, bent his knees into peculiar positions,
twisted his head round so that he was looking over his own back, and then bent
his double-jointed arms the wrong way, so that he looked very peculiar indeed!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t!
I don’t like it!’ said Anne. ‘You look so queer and strange! Why are you called
the Boneless Wonder? You aren’t boneless - you just make yourself look as if
you were, with all those queer double-joints of yours!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Boneless Man seemed suddenly to lose all his bones, and crumpled up on the grass
in a funny heap. The children couldn’t help laughing. He didn’t look as if he
had any bones at all then!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Er
- can you climb ladders if you’re double-jointed?’ asked Julian, suddenly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course!’ said the Boneless Man. ‘Run up them backwards, forwards, sideways -
any way you like.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
that your ladder, then?’ asked Dick, nodding his head towards the ladder in the
grass.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- I use it, but so does everyone else!’ said the Boneless Man, turning his head
the wrong way round, so that it seemed as if it was put on back to front. It
was odd to speak to someone whose head did that - one minute they were talking
to his face, the next to the back of his head!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wish you wouldn’t do that,’ said Anne. ‘It makes me feel giddy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
you use that ladder to put the flag on the top of the circus tent?’ asked Dick.
‘It doesn’t look long enough for that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
isn’t,’ said the Boneless Man, turning his head the right way round, much to
Anne’s relief. ‘There’s a much longer one over there - it takes three men to carry
it, it’s so heavy - but the centre circus pole is very tall, as you see. One
man couldn’t possibly carry the long ladder.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children looked at one another. That ruled out the very long ladder too, then.
If it needed three men to carry it, Jenny would certainly have heard a lot more
noise last night!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Are
there any more ladders in the circus camp?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
- just the two. Why? Thinking of buying one?’ said the Boneless Man. ‘I must
go. The Boss is beckoning to me.’ Off he went, walking in a most peculiar
fashion, using his double joints for all he was worth!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
about the acrobats?’ said Julian. ‘They must be used to climbing and clambering
everywhere. I wonder if any of them could have climbed the wall?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t think so,’ said Tinker. ‘I had a good look at it this morning - and
although there is a kind of creeper climbing up the wall, it stops half-way -
and above that there’s just the stone wall. Even an acrobat would have to have
some help up the tower wall!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Could
the clowns have found a way?’ said George. ‘No - I suppose they’re not as good
even as the acrobats at climbing. I don’t believe the thief could have been
anyone from the circus after all. Look - what’s that on the ground over there -
outside that tent?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went over to see. It looked like a pile of dark-grey fur. George touched it
with her toe. ‘Oh - I know what it is - the donkey-skin!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Golly
- so it is!’ cried Tinker in delight, and picked it up - or tried to. It was
much too heavy for him to hold up all of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
a trice Dick and George were inside that donkey-skin! Dick had the head, and
found that he could see quite well where he was going, for the donkey-neck had
neat eye-holes in it - the head itself was stuffed with paper. George was the
back legs, and kicked up her feet and made the donkey look extremely lively.
The others roared with laughter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Someone
shouted loudly. ‘Hey - you leave that donkey-skin alone!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was Jeremy. He came running up, looking furious. He had a stick in his hand,
and hit out at the donkey’s hind parts, giving poor George a good old whack,
and making her yell.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hey!
Stop that, it hurt!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tinker
looked furiously at Jeremy. ‘How dare you do that?’ he shouted. ‘Dick and
George are in the donkey-skin. Put down that stick!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Jeremy gave the donkey’s hind legs another whack and George yelled again.
Tinker gave a shout too, and flung himself on Jeremy, trying to get the stick
out of his hand. The boy struggled, holding on to the stick, but Tinker gave
him a straight blow on the chest, and down he went!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ha!
I said I’d knock you down sometime, and I have!’ yelled Tinker. ‘Get up and
fight. I’ll teach you to hit a girl!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
stop it, Tinker,’ said Julian. ‘How could he have known George was inside? Come
out of the skin, you two idiots, before old Grandad comes up. He looks as if
he’s on his way now!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jeremy
was up now, and danced round Tinker with doubled fists. Before either boy could
exchange a blow, Grandad’s great voice came to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘NOW
THEN! STOP IT!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jeremy
swung his fist at Tinker, who dodged, and then in his turn hit out at Jeremy,
who ran back - straight into old Grandad, who at once clutched him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>By
this time George and Dick were out of the donkey-skin, looking rather ashamed
of themselves. Old Grandad grinned at them, still holding on to the furious
Jeremy. ‘Fight’s off,’ said Grandad to Tinker and Jeremy. ‘If you want to go
on, either of you, you can fight me, not each other.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>However,
neither of the boys wanted to take on old Grandad. He might be old, but he
could still give some mighty slaps, as Jeremy very well knew. They stood
staring at one another, looking rather sheepish.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Go
on - shake hands and be friends,’ said Grandad. ‘Quick, now, or I’ll do a
little fighting myself!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tinker
held out his hand just as Jeremy held out his. They shook, grinning at one
another. ‘That’s right!’ said old Grandad. ‘No harm done. No bones broken.
You’re quits now, so no more knocking each other about.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,
Grandad,’ said Jeremy, giving him a friendly punch. The old man turned to Dick
and George. ‘And if you want to borrow that donkey-skin, you’re welcome,’ said
old Grandad. ‘But it’s manners to ask the owner’s permission first.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
sir. Sorry, sir,’ said Dick, grinning. He wondered what Professor Hayling and
Jenny would say if he and George did borrow it, and galloped into Hollow House
at top speed. But no - he decided reluctantly that Jenny might be scared stiff
and give notice, and that would never do. She wouldn’t at all like being chased
by an apparently mad donkey, nor would Professor Hayling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Grandad
went off, and Julian spoke to Jeremy, who wasn’t quite sure whether to go or to
stay. ‘We saw old Charlie carrying pails of water for the horses,’ he said. ‘My
word, isn’t he strong!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jeremy
grinned, glad to be friends again, and to be able to stay with the Five and
Tinker. They wandered all round the field together, looking at the magnificent
horses and at Dead-Shot Dick doing a little practising at shooting and then
watched one small acrobat practising amazing jumps and somersaults.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mischief
the monkey came with them. He was absolutely at home with everyone in the
circus now, man, woman or animal. He leapt on to the horses’ backs, and they
didn’t mind! He pretended to help Charlie the Chimp to carry one of the pails
of water - he ran off with Dead-Shot Dick’s cap. He went into the chimp’s cage
and cuddled up in the straw with him, scrabbling about as if the cage belonged
to him. He even went into Grandad’s tent and came out with a small bottle of
lemonade! He couldn’t get the top off, and took it to Charlie, who was watching
near by! Charlie promptly forced it off with his strong front paws - and then,
to Mischief’s disgust, tipped up the bottle, and drank the lot!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mischief
was very angry indeed. He ran to Charlie’s cage, which was open, and sent the
straw flying everywhere. Charlie sat outside his cage, and enjoyed the fun,
grinning happily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
out, Mischief!’ called Tinker. ‘You’re making a nuisance of yourself!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let
him be,’ said one of the acrobats, who was standing near by. ‘Old Charlie
enjoys a bit of temper - when it’s someone else’s! Look at him sitting grinning
there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
watched for a few seconds more, to make sure that Mischief wasn’t annoying the
big chimpanzee, and then turned to watch Monty and Winks, the clowns, having an
argument, which ended in Monty throwing water over Winks, and Winks emptying a
basket of rubbish over Monty. What a pair!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
they turned to see if Mischief was still annoying Charlie, they saw that the
little monkey had left the cage, and was tearing down the field to the fence.
He leapt up, and over, and disappeared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
must think it’s dinner-time,’ said Tinker, looking at his watch. ‘And golly, so
it is. Buck up everyone, Jenny will be in a fine old fury if we’re really late
- it’s hot dinner today.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Away
they all went in a hurry. Hot dinner! Over the fence, then, and up the garden
at top speed. They mustn’t keep a hot dinner waiting - or Jenny either!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tinker
and the Five were two minutes late for their dinner. Jenny was just taking it
in, looking a little grim, as she had not been able to find the children
anywhere. ‘Ah - here you are at last!’ she said. ‘I looked down the garden but
you were nowhere to be seen. It’s a good thing you came in when you did - five
minutes more, and I’d have taken the dinner back again.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dear
Jenny, you know you wouldn’t,’ said Tinker, giving her a sudden squeeze that
made her squeal. ‘Oh, how good it smells! Mmmmm-Mmmmm!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
and your Mmmmms!’ said Jenny, pushing Tinker away. ‘And I’ve told you before,
that I don’t mind a gentle hug, but those squeezes of yours take all my breath
away. No, Tinker, keep away from me - another squeeze like that and I’ll feel
like a lemon!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
laughed at that. Jenny did say the most amusing things. Anne felt sorry that
she hadn’t offered to stay and help her with the dinner. Oh dear - the time
went so tremendously quickly, once they were all out together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
talk at dinner-time was very lively. So was Mischief the monkey! He took bits
from everyone’s plate and handed some of them down to Timmy, who was lying
under the table as usual. Timmy appreciated these titbits very much!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well!
I didn’t see a single ladder in the circus camp that was tall enough to reach
up to the tower room,’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
If there was one, it was jolly well hidden,’ said Dick. ‘Pass the mustard,
someone!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘In
front of you, ass,’ said Julian. ‘I must say I’m beginning to wonder if Mr Wooh
had anything to do with the stealing of your father’s papers, Tinker. I can’t
somehow see him climbing high ladders - he’s so - so...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Polite
and proper,’ said Anne. ‘Actually, I can’t think of anyone in the circus who
would either want the papers, or is nasty enough to steal them. They’re all so
nice.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
still think Mr Wooh is the most likely one,’ said Julian. ‘He’s interested in
complicated figures and clever inventions. But all the same, I’m beginning to
think I’m wrong. He could NOT have got up to the tower room, as there is no
ladder long enough - and I really doubt if he’d dare to take a ladder into the
courtyard, and risk putting it up to the tower. He might so easily be caught.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right.
We’ll rule him out,’ said Tinker. ‘But if nobody went up the spiral stairway,
because all the doors were locked, and nobody used a ladder, I don’t see how
those papers disappeared.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wind
took them out of the window, perhaps?’ suggested Anne. ‘Would that be
possible?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
For two reasons,’ said Julian. ‘One is that the window wasn’t wide enough open
for the wind to blow in with enough strength to blow papers out. And secondly,
we’d have been sure to have found some of them down in the courtyard if they’d
been blown out. But we didn’t find a single one there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- if nobody got through the three locked doors, and nobody got through the
window, How did those papers get stolen?’ demanded George. ‘It would have been
a miracle for those papers to have hopped away by themselves - and I don’t
believe in that kind of miracle!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a long silence. What a mystery it was! ‘I suppose Tinker’s father couldn’t
possibly have gone walking in his sleep, and taken them, could he?’ asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- I don’t know if a sleep-walker can unlock doors with the right keys, and
steal his own papers, leaving some on the floor, and then walk carefully down
the spiral stairway still fast asleep, locking all the doors behind him, and
then go to his own bedroom, get into bed, and then wake up in the morning
without remembering a single moment of the whole thing!’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
It can’t be possible,’ said Dick. ‘Have you ever known your father to walk in
his sleep, Tinker?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tinker
considered. ‘No, I can’t say I have,’ he said. ‘He’s a very light sleeper,
usually. No. I don’t believe Dad did all that in his sleep. It was somebody
else.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
must have been some sort of miracle man, then,’ said George. ‘No ordinary
person could do it. And whoever planned it wanted those papers very, very
badly, or he would never have risked getting them against so many odds.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
if he wanted them SO VERY badly, he’ll certainly make an effort to get the ones
he left behind under the table,’ said Julian. ‘Good thing we’ve got those! He
will probably try to get up into the tower the same way as he did before - but
goodness knows what it was!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- those papers will be safely out of his way, tonight!’ said George. ‘On my
island!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Julian. ‘I’ll find a most unlikely hiding-place - somewhere about the
ruined castle, I think. By the way - I hope you haven’t still got them under
your jersey, Tinker. No - you don’t look fat any more. What have you done with
them?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George
said I’d better give them to her to keep, in case they slipped out of my
jersey,’ said Tinker. ‘You took them, didn’t you, George?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said George. ‘Don’t let’s talk about it any more.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
not? The thief’s not here. He can’t be listening to us!’ said Tinker. ‘I
believe you’re cross, George, because Julian won’t let you take the papers
yourself!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
do shut up, Tinker,’ said George. ‘I shall be jolly cross with you in a minute,
if you let Mischief upset your glass of lemonade again, all over my bread. Take
him off the table! His manners are getting worse!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
aren’t - but your temper is!’ said Tinker and promptly received a kick under
the table from Julian. He was about to kick back but thought better of it.
Julian could kick very much harder than he could! He decided to take Mischief
off the table in case George smacked him. He put the little monkey under the
table where Timmy was sitting quietly. Mischief immediately cuddled up to him,
putting his little furry arms round the big dog’s neck. Timmy sniffed him all
over, and then gave him two or three licks. He was very fond of the naughty
little monkey.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
shall we do this afternoon?’ asked Dick, when they had all helped Jenny to
clear away and wash-up. ‘What about a bathe in the sea? Is it warm enough?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
really. But that doesn’t matter, we always feel jolly warm when we come out of
the water and run about and then rub ourselves down,’ said Anne. ‘Jenny - do
you feel like a bathe?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
gracious, no!’ said Jenny, shivering at the thought. ‘I’m a cold mortal, I am.
The thought of going into that cold sea makes me shudder. If you want your
towels, they are all in the airing cupboard. And don’t you be late for tea, if
you want any, because I’ve a lot of ironing to do afterwards.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,
Jenny,’ said Tinker, about to give her one of his ‘squeezes’ but thinking
better of it when he saw her warning look. ‘Julian, may I come with you to
Kirrin Island tonight? I’d like a bit of fun.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
may not,’ said Julian. ‘Anyway, there won’t be any fun.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
might be if Mr Wooh did hear George say she was taking those papers over,’ said
Tinker. ‘He’d be waiting on the island - and you might be glad to have me with
you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
should not be glad to have you with me,’ said Julian. ‘You’d just be in the
way. It would be much easier to look after myself than to see what you were up
to all the time. I am going by myself. Please don’t scowl at me like that, George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
got up from the table and went to look out of the window. ‘Wind’s died down a
bit,’ he said. ‘I think I’ll have a bathe in an hour’s time. If any of you
others want to come, we’ll go down together.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went down to the beach after a while and bathed, except Mischief, who put
one small paw into the water, gave a howl and scampered back up the beach as
fast as ever he could, afraid that Tinker might catch him and make him go in!
Timmy went in, of course. He swam marvellously, and even gave Tinker a ride on
his back, diving down when the boy felt heavy, so that Tinker suddenly found
himself sprawling in the water! ‘You wretch, Timmy!’ yelled the boy, ‘the
water’s gone up my nose. Wait till I catch you! I’ll put you under!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
he couldn’t possibly catch old Timmy, who really enjoyed the joke. The big dog
gave a joyful bark, and swam after George. How he loved being with them all!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
rest of the day went quickly. Jenny had a fine tea for them, with slices of
ham, and salad, and fruit to end with, and said afterwards that she had time to
play a game of Scrabble with them if they liked. Mischief sat on the table to
watch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t mind you watching,’ said Anne. ‘But you are NOT to scrabble, Mischief.
You sent all my little ivory discs on the floor last time we played, and I lost
the game.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
watched gravely, sitting on a chair beside George. He simply could NOT
understand what made the children play games like this when they could go for a
nice long walk with him. They took pity on him when the game was over and went
out for a two-mile walk along by the sea. How Timmy loved that!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
shall cycle to Kirrin Village as soon as it’s dark,’ announced Julian. ‘I
suppose your boat is tied up in the usual place, George? I’m sorry I can’t take
you with me, but there might be a bit of danger, as we said. However I won’t
run into any if I can help it. I shan’t feel comfortable until those secret
papers are safely out of the way! You can give them to me just before I go,
George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
suddenly yawned. ‘Don’t start too late or I shall fall asleep!’ she said. ‘It’s
getting dark already. All that swimming has made me feel tired!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
yawned too. ‘I’m jolly sleepy as well,’ he said. ‘I shall bed down in our tent
as soon as you’ve gone, Ju. I’ll see you off safely first, papers and all!
You’d better go to your tent, too, girls - you look tired.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right!’
said Anne. ‘You coming, George?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
all go,’ said George. ‘Come on, Tinker. Bet you I get over the fence and down
to our tents first! Good night, Jenny. We’re off!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
and Anne and Tinker, with Timmy running behind, went off down the darkening
garden. Dick and Julian helped Jenny to tidy up, and to draw all the curtains.
‘Well, good night, Jenny,’ said Dick. ‘All you have to do is to lock the door
behind us and go safely up to bed. We’ll go down to our tents now. Sleep well!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
I always do,’ said Jenny. ‘Look after yourselves now and don’t get into any
mischief! Hide those papers well, where nobody can find them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and Dick went off down the garden, having heard Jenny carefully locking the
door behind them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tinker
and the girls were already over the fence, Mischief on Tinker’s shoulder. Anne
spoke anxiously to George. ‘I do hope Julian will be all right going over to
Kirrin Island,’ she said. ‘I wish he’d take Dick with him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
he took anyone it should be me!’ burst out George. ‘It’s my island!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
don’t be silly, George. The papers would be much safer with Julian,’ said Anne.
‘It would be an awful business for you, cycling by yourself to Kirrin, getting
your boat into the water, and rowing over in the dark!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
would not!’ said George. ‘If Julian can do it, then so could I. You go into our
tent, Anne, and get ready for bed. I’ll come in a minute, after I’ve taken
Timmy for a run.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
waited till Anne had disappeared through the tent opening. Then she went
quietly off by herself in the dark, Timmy trotting beside her, rather
surprised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
there came the sound of voices, as Julian and Dick reached the fence and leapt
over it. They went to their tent, and found Tinker there, yawning and getting
ready for bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
the three boys were all rolled up in their rugs, Mischief cuddled up to Tinker.
After some time Julian sat up and looked at his watch, and then peeped out of
the tent opening. ‘Quite dark!’ he said. ‘But the moon’s coming up, I see. I
think I’ll get the papers from George now, and set off on my bicyde to Kirrin.
I can easily get it out of the shed.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
know where George keeps her boat,’ said Dick. ‘You won’t have any difficulty in
finding it. Got your torch, Ju?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- and a new battery,’ said Julian. ‘Look!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
switched on his torch. It gave a good, powerful beam. ‘Shan’t miss the island
if I put this on!’ he said. ‘Now - I’ll get those papers. Hey, George - I’m
coming to your tent for the papers!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went over to the girls’ tent. Anne was there, only half awake. She blinked as
Julian’s torch shone into her eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George!’
said Julian. ‘Give me those papers now, please - hallo - I say, Anne - where is
George?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
started all round the tent. George’s rugs were there, piled in an untidy heap;
but there was no George - and no Timmy either!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
Ju! Do you know what George has done - she’s slipped out with the precious
papers - and taken Timmy too! She must have gone to fetch her bike, and ridden
off to Kirrin to get her boat - and row over to Kirrin Island! Julian, whatever
will happen if she rows over and finds somebody waiting to grab those papers
from her!’ Poor Anne was very near to tears.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
could shake her!’ said Julian, very angry indeed. ‘Going off alone like that in
the dark - cycling to Kirrin - rowing over to the island - and back! She must
be mad! Suppose Mr Wooh and his friends are waiting there for her! The - silly
- little - idiot!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
Julian, quick! You and Dick get your cycles and try to catch her,’ begged Anne.
‘Oh please do! Anything might happen to her! Dear, silly old George! Thank
goodness Timmy’s gone with her.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
that’s a blessing, anyway,’ said Julian, still angry. ‘He’ll look after her as
much as he can. My word, I could shake George till her teeth rattled! I thought
she was rather quiet tonight. Thinking out this plan, I suppose!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went up to the house with Dick and Tinker to tell Jenny about George, and then
he and Dick at once went to get their bicycles. This was serious. George had no
right to be out alone at night like this - and go rowing over to Kirrin Island
- ESPECIALLY if there was any chance of someone lying in wait for her!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jenny
was very worried indeed. She watched the two boys cycling off in the dark.
Tinker begged her to let him go too, but she wouldn’t. ‘You and Mischief would
just be nuisances,’ she said. ‘Oh my word, won’t I shake that rascal of a
George when she gets back. What a girl! Well, well - thank goodness Timmy’s
with her. That dog’s as good as half a dozen policemen!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>NIGHT
ON KIRRIN ISLAND<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was certainly very dark when the half-moon went behind the clouds. George was
glad that her bicycle lamp shone so brightly. The shadows in the hedges were
deep and mysterious - ‘as if they hid people ready to jump out at us,’ she said
to Timmy. ‘But you’d go for them at once, wouldn’t you, Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was too much out of breath to bark an answer. George was going pretty fast, and
he didn’t mean to let her get out of sight. He was sure she shouldn’t be out by
herself on a dark night like this. He couldn’t imagine why she had suddenly
taken it into her head to go for a long night-ride! He raced along, panting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
met cars with dazzling head-lamps, and George had to keep pulling to the side.
She was terribly afraid that Timmy might be hit by one of the cars. ‘Oh dear -
I’d never, never forgive myself if anything happened to Timmy,’ she thought. ‘I
half wish I hadn’t set out now. But I’m NOT going to let Julian hide anything
on my island. That’s my job, not his. Timmy darling, PLEASE keep on my left
side. You’ll be safe then.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
Timmy kept on her left, still mystified by this sudden journey out into the
night. They came at last to Kirrin Village, where windows were still lighted
here and there. Through the village and on to Kirrin Bay - ah, there was the
bay! The half-moon slid out from behind a cloud and George saw the dark sea,
shining here and there as the moonlight caught the crests of the waves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
my island, look Timmy,’ said George, feeling a swelling of pride as she looked
over the dark heaving sea to a darker stretch, which she knew was Kirrin
Island. ‘My very own island. Waiting for me tonight!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, rather quietly, because he really hadn’t any breath to waste. Now
what was George going to do? Why had she come out on this lonely ride without
the others? Timmy was puzzled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came to the stretch of beach where boats were kept. George rode down a ramp to
the beach, jumped off her bicycle, and put it by a bathing-hut in the deep
shadows. No one would see it there. Then she went to stare over the sea at her
island.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
had only looked for a moment or two when she clutched Timmy’s collar, and gave
an exclamation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>TIMMY!
There’s a light on my island! Look, to the right there. Can you see it? Timmy,
there’s somebody camping there. How DARE they? It’s my island and I don’t allow
anyone on it unless they have my permission.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
looked - and yes, he could see the light too. Was it made by a camp-fire - or a
lantern? He couldn’t tell. All he knew was that he didn’t want George to go
over there now. Suppose there were gypsies camping there, who would resent
George coming to turn them off? Or a crowd of ill-mannered young boys who
hadn’t bothered to find out if they were allowed there? They might make things
very unpleasant for George. He pawed at her, trying to make her understand that
he wanted her to go back home with him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
Timmy. I’m not going back till I’ve found out who’s there!’ she said. ‘It would
be cowardly to turn back now. And if it’s somebody waiting for me to turn up
with the papers, they can think again. Look - I’m hiding them here under the
tarpaulin in this boat. It would be idiotic to try and hide them on the island
if there’s someone there who might rob me of anything I’ve got - it might be
one of the thieves who climbed in to the tower room, and left some of the
papers behind. If he’s waiting for me, he won’t get any papers!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
stuffed the parcel of papers under the tarpaulin as she spoke. ‘It’s Fisherman
Connell’s boat, called Gypsy,’ she said, reading the name on the boat by the
light of her torch. ‘Hc won’t mind me hiding something in it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
covered up the papers with the tarpaulin, and then looked over to the island
again. Yes - that light was still there. Anger welled up in George again, and
she went to look for her own boat, which should be somewhere near where they
were.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here
it is,’ she said to Timmy, who leapt in at once. She ordered him out for she
had to pull the boat down to the water. Fortunately it was a small, light boat
and as the tide was almost fully in, she didn’t have very far to drag it. Timmy
took hold of the rope with his teeth and helped too. At last it was on the water,
bobbing gently about in the dim light of the half-moon. Timmy leapt in, and
soon George was in too, though with very wet feet!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
took the oars and began to pull away from the shore. ‘Tide’s almost on the
turn,’ she told Timmy. ‘It won’t be too hard a row. Now we can find those
campers and tell them what we think of them. You’re to bark your very loudest
and scare them, Timmy - in fact, you can chase them to their boat, if you
like.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
answered with a small bark. He knew quite well that George didn’t want him to
make much noise. He thought it very queer that she was going over to her island
tonight, all by herself. Why hadn’t she taken the others? He was sure that
Julian would be very cross!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
don’t bark or whine, Timmy,’ she said, in a whisper. ‘We’re almost at my
landing-place - but I’m going under those trees there, not landing here. I want
to hide my boat.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
guided the boat towards some trees whose branches. overhung a tiny creek that
ran a little way inland. She leapt out, and flung the mooring rope round the
trunk of the nearest tree, and made it fast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There,
little boat,’ she said. ‘You’ll be safe there. No one will see you. Come on,
Tim - we’ll tackle those campers now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
turned to go, and then stopped. ‘I wonder where their boat is,’ she said.
‘Let’s have a look round, Timmy. It must be here somewhere.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
soon found the boat lying on the sands, its rope thrown round a near-by rock.
The tide was almost up to it. She grinned to herself. ‘Timmy!’ she whispered.
‘I’m going to untie this boat and set it loose on the tide. It will soon be far
away. Ha - what will those awful campers say?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And,
to Timmy’s amazement, she undid the rope from the rock, rolled it up, and threw
the coil inside the boat. Then she gave the boat a push - but it was still
embedded in the wet sand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Never
mind,’ she said. ‘Another ten minutes and the tide will be right under it - and
then it will turn and take the boat with it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
began to make her way up the beach, Timmy close to her side. ‘Now let’s go
after those campers, who-ever they are,’ she said. ‘Where’s their light gone? I
can’t see it now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
in a minute or two she saw it again. ‘It’s not from a camp-fire - it’s from a
lantern of some sort,’ she whispered to Timmy. ‘We’ll have to be careful now.
Let’s see if we can creep up behind them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two of them made their way silently towards the middle of the little island.
Here there was an old ruined castle - and there, in the courtyard of the
castle, sitting in the midst of thick, overgrown weeds, were two men. George
had her hand on Timmy’s collar, and tugged it gently. He knew that meant, ‘No
barking, no growling, Tim,’ and he stood perfectly still, the hackles on his
neck rising fast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two men were playing cards by the light of a fairly powerful lantern, which
they had set on a ruined stone wall. Timmy couldn’t help giving a surprised
growl when he saw one of them, but George hushed him at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr
Wooh, the magician from the circus, was there, dealing out the cards! The other
man she didn’t know. He was well-dressed, and seemed bored. He flung down his
cards as Timmy and George watched from a dark corner of the old castle, and
spoke to his companion in an irritated voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
whoever it is you said was bringing the rest of those papers here to the island
doesn’t seem to be turning up. The papers you’ve given me are good - very good
- but of no use without the others. This scientist fellow you’ve stolen them
from is a genius. If we get the complete set of papers, they will be worth a tremendous
sum of money, which I can get for you - but without the other papers, there
will be no money for you - the first set would be useless!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
tell you, someone will be here with them. I heard them say so,’ said Mr Wooh,
in his stately voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who
stole them - you?’ asked the other man, shuffling the cards quickly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
I did not steal them,’ said Mr Wooh. ‘Me, I keep my hands clean - I do not
steal.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
second man laughed. ‘No. You let other people do your dirty work for you, don’t
you! Mr Wooh, the World’s Most Wonderful Magician, does not soil his hands! He
merely uses the hands of others - and charges enormous prices for the goods
they steal. You’re a cunning one, Mr Wooh. I wouldn’t like you for an enemy!
How did you manage to get the papers?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘By
using my eyes and my ears and my cunning,’ answered Mr Wooh. ‘They are better
than most people’s. So many people are stupid, my good friend.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
not your good friend,’ said the other man. ‘I’ve got to do business with you,
Mr Wooh, but I wouldn’t like to have you for a friend. I’d rather have that
chimpanzee of yours! I don’t even like playing cards with you! WHY doesn’t this
fellow come?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
put her mouth to one of Timmy’s ears. ‘Timmy, I’m going to tell them to clear
off my island,’ she whispered furiously to the listening dog. ‘Fancy fellows
like that daring to set foot here - rascals and rogues! Don’t come with me -
wait till I call you, then if you have to rescue me, come at once!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Leaving
a most unwilling Timmy standing beside part of the old castle wall, she
suddenly appeared before the two astonished men by the light of their lantern.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
leapt to their feet at once. ‘It’s the girl who’s come - I shouldn’t have
thought that the boys would have let her,’ said Mr Wooh, astonished. ‘I am...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘WHAT
ARE YOU DOING ON MY ISLAND?’ demanded George, angrily. ‘It belongs to me. I saw
your light and came over with my dog. Be careful of him - he’s big and strong
and fierce. Clear off at once, or I’ll report you to the police!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Easy,
easy, now!’ said Mr Wooh, standing very straight and looking immensely tall.
‘So the boys sent you to hide the papers instead of daring to come themselves.
How cowardly of them! Where are the papers? Give them to me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
hidden them,’ said George. ‘They’re not very far away. You didn’t think I’d be
silly enough to come along to you with them in my hands when I saw your light
and knew that people were here, did you? No - I’ve hidden them somewhere on the
shore - where you won’t find them. Now you just clear off, both of you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
very brave and determined young lady!’ said Mr Wooh, bowing solemnly to George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
you mean to tell me that’s a girl!’ said the other man, amazed. ‘Well! She’s a
plucky kid, I must say! Look here, kid, if you’ve got those papers, hand them
over, and I’ll give you a whole lot of money which you can give to Professor
Hayling with my best wishes.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
and get them,’ said George, turning as if to go. The two men looked at one
another, eye-brows raised. Mr Wooh nodded, and then winked. If George had seen
his face she would have known what that wink meant. It meant, ‘Let’s humour
this silly kid, follow her - see the hiding-place, snatch the papers and clear
off in our boat without paying a penny! But LOOK OUT for the dog!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
led the way, Timmy walking between her and the two men. He was growling all the
time, deep down in his throat, as if to say, ‘Just you lay a finger on George
and I’ll bite it off!’ The men took care not to go too near him! They shone the
lantern on him all the time, making sure that he was not going to leap at them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
led them to the shore, to the place where they had left their boat. Mr Wooh
gave a cry. ‘Where’s our boat? It was tied to that rock!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
this it over this ridge?’ called George, climbing up a steep bank that overhung
the water, which was now quite deep with the surging tide.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
men went to look - and then George gave them the surprise of their lives! She
ran at Mr Wooh and gave him such a push that he fell right over the high bank
into the sea below, landing with a yell and a terrific splash. George shouted a
command to Timmy, who was now very excited, and the big dog did the same to the
other man, leaping at him and pushing him over. He too shot over the ridge and
fell into the sea with a splash. Timmy stood on the little cliff and barked
madly, as excited as George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’ll
have to swim to the shore of the mainland if you want to escape!’ yelled
George. ‘The tide has taken away your boat - I set it loose! You’d better not
get back on my island yet - Timmy’s on the watch for you - and he’ll fly at
either of you if you try to set a foot on it again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Both
men could swim, though not very well, and both were exceedingly angry and very
frightened. They were sure they could never swim to the mainland - but how to
get on the island to safety, they didn’t know. That great, fierce dog was
there, barking as if he wanted to bite them into small bits. Their boat had
been set loose, there was no way to escape. They swam round in circles, not
knowing what to do!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
going back to the mainland now!’ yelled George, climbing into her boat. ‘I’ll
send the police to rescue you in the morning. You can get on my island now -
but you’re in for a VERY cold night! Goodbye!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
off went George in her boat, with Timmy standing at the back, watching to make
sure those men didn’t swim after them. He gave George an admiring lick. She
wasn’t afraid of ANYTHING! He’d rather belong to her than to anyone else in the
world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>WOOF,

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
couldn’t help singing loudly as she rowed back to the shore in her boat. Timmy
joined in with a bark now and again. He was glad that George was so happy. He
stood in the prow of the boat, wishing it was not night-time, so that he could
see clearly where he was going. The moon clouded over, and the sea looked
endless in the dark. Very few lights showed on the mainland at that time of
night - just one or two from houses where people were still up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wait,
though - what was that bright light suddenly shining out from the mainland? Was
it someone trying to pick out their boat? Timmy barked at the light, and
George, who, of course, was rowing with her back to the shore, shipped her oars
for a moment and looked round.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
someone on the quay,’ she said. ‘Maybe a late fisherman. Good! He’ll be able to
help me drag my boat up out of the way of the tide!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it wasn’t a fisherman. It was Julian and Dick. They had arrived about five
minutes ago, and had looked at once for George’s boat, and hadn’t found it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Blow!
We’re too late to stop her, then. She’s gone over to the island!’ said Julian
and began to examine all the other tied-up boats to see if he could find one
that he could borrow, belonging to a friend. Somehow they must get over to
Kirrin Island, and rescue George. He felt sure she would be in danger of'some
kind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
suddenly the two boys heard the sounds of oars splashing not far out to sea.
Well, if that was a fisherman coming home, maybe Julian could ask him to lend
him his boat to go to Kirrin Island in. He could tell him that he was afraid
his cousin might be in need of help.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy,
in George’s boat, suddenly recognised the two boys when the moon swam out from
a cloud, and gave a delighted volley of barks. George, wondering if it was
Julian and Dick, rowed as quickly as she could. She came into shore, jumped out
and began to drag in her boat. The boys were beside her at once, and the boat
was soon in its usual place, carefully made safe in case the tide was a high
one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George!’
said Julian, so overjoyed to see his cousin safe and sound that he couldn’t
help giving her a bear-hug. ‘You wicked girl! You went to the island - just
what I said you weren’t to do. You might have found the thieves on the island,
and then you would have been in trouble!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
did find them - but it’s they who are in trouble, not me!’ said George. ‘I saw
a light over there, took my boat and went over to the island - and there they
were - Mr Wooh the Magician and another man - ON MY ISLAND! Did you ever hear
such cheek? They asked me for the papers at once!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
George - did you give them to the men?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course not! I’d already hidden them where those men couldn’t possibly find
them. I wasn’t idiotic enough to take them over to hide on the island when I
saw somebody was there - probably waiting for me - and for the papers!’ said
George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But,
George - if you knew somebody was there, why on earth did you risk going over
to Kirrin Island then?’ asked Julian, puzzled. ‘It was a very dangerous thing
to do.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wanted to turn off whoever it was, of course,’ said George. ‘As if I’d allow
just anyone on my island! It’s mine, my very own, and I only allow people on it
that I like. You know that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
just NEVER know what you’ll do next, George,’ said Julian, patting Timmy on the
head. ‘How did you dare to go and tackle those men? Oh, I know Timmy was with
you, but even so... and why in the world didn’t the men row after you, and ram
your boat?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you see, they couldn’t,’ said George. ‘I found their boat, untied it, and set
it adrift on the tide. It’s probably half a mile away by now!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys were so astonished that they couldn’t even laugh at first. But then, when
they thought of the two men marooned on Kirrin Island, their boat gone goodness
knows where, they laughed till tears came into their eyes!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George,
I don’t know how you can think of doing such things!’ said Julian. ‘Weren’t the
men furious?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know,’ said George. ‘I didn’t tell them about their boat. I pretended
that I’d take them to where I’d hidden the papers - and then when we got on to
a nice high ridge overlooking the sea, they looked over it to see if their boat
was all right, and I gave Mr Wooh a jolly good push, and Timmy leapt at the man
with him - and in they went - SPLASH! SPLASH!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
really had to sit down and have another bout of laughing till the stitch in his
side grew so bad that he was forced to get up and walk about. George suddenly
saw the funny side of it all too, and she began to laugh as heartily as Julian.
Dick joined in as well, and Timmy barked madly, enjoying the fun.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
dear!’ said Julian, feeling weak with laughter, ‘And then I suppose you said a
polite farewell and left them to their fate?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
actually I yelled out to tell them I’d send the police to rescue them in the
morning,’ said George. ‘I’m afraid they’ll both spend a very uncomfortable
night - they were soaking wet, you see!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George
- I’m beginning to think it was a good thing you went with the papers to the
island, and not me, after all,’ said Julian. ‘I should never have thought of
doing all the things you did - pushing the men into the sea - really, how could
you and Timmy dare to do such things? And setting their boat loose! What on
earth will the police say when we tell them?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t think we’d better tell them, had we?’ said George. ‘I mean - they might
think I’d gone too far. Anyway, why not let the two men kick their heels on the
island all night, and we’ll decide what to do about the police in the morning.
It’s funny - I suddenly feel awfully tired.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
bet you do!’ said Dick. ‘Come on, let’s get our bikes. Oh, and those precious
papers - where are they?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Under
the tarpaulin in Fisherman Connell’s boat,’ said George, and suddenly gave the
most enormous yawn. ‘I hid them there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
get them,’ said Julian. ‘Then off we go back to Big Hollow House. The others
will be getting awfully worried by now!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
found the papers in the fishing-boat and then the three of them rode off
quickly along the road from Kirrin to Big Hollow, Timmy running behind them,
Julian kept laughing to himself. George should have been a boy not a girl - the
things she did! Fancy tackling those two fellows like that - pushing them into
the water, and setting their boat adrift. Julian was sure he would never have
thought of doing such daring things himself!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
last they were back at the tents, and the others crowded round them to hear
what had happened. Anne looked very white. Jenny was with her, comforting her -
she had just made up her mind to telephone the police, and was most relieved to
see George again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
tell you all the details in the morning,’ said Julian. ‘But all I’ll say now is
that the papers are safe all right, here in my pocket - the thieves were
probably Mr Wooh and another man. They were on the island tonight, waiting for
George. They had overheard what she said in the tent! However, George and Timmy
pushed them both into the water and set their boat adrift, so things are
settling down nicely! They will have to spend the night on the island, cold and
wet through!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George
did all that!’ said Jenny, amazed. ‘Well! I never knew she was so dangerous!
Good gracious! I feel right down scared of her! Settle down to sleep in your
tent, dear - you look tired out!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was glad to flop down on her rugs. Now that the excitement was all over, she
felt too sleepy for words! She fell asleep at once - but Julian and Dick
didn’t. They lay awake for some time, chuckling over George’s deeds of daring.
What a cousin to have!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
they were up at the house at breakfast next morning, Jeremy came up the garden
and put his head in at the dining-room window. ‘I say!’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mr
Wooh’s not in his tent this morning! He’s disappeared! And poor old Charlie the
Chimp is too miserable for words.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah
- we can tell you exactly where Mr Wooh is,’ said Julian. ‘But - wait a bit,
Tinker, where are you going? You haven’t finished your...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Tinker had gone off with Jeremy at top speed! He was very fond of Charlie. Oh
dear, would the chimpanzee weep for his master and refuse to take his food?
Tinker called Mischief and they both ran down to the fence with Jeremy and
climbed over it. Tinker went straight to Charlie’s cage. The chimpanzee sat
with his head in his hands, rocking himself to and fro, making sad, crying
noises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
get into the cage with him,’ said Tinker. ‘He’ll like to be comforted. He must
be missing Mr Wooh very, very much.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
crawled into the cage and sat down in the straw, each putting an arm round the
sad chimpanzee. Old Grandad was very surprised to see them both there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
know what’s happened to Mr Wooh,’ he said. ‘Didn’t come home last night! Here,
Jeremy, you come on out. I can’t spare you to cry over Charlie all morning.
He’ll soon perk up. You can stay with him, Tinker, if you like.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jeremy
crawled out of the cage and went off crossly. Tinker sat with his arm round
Charlie, wishing he didn’t look so terribly sad. As he sat there, he heard a
funny little noise going on all the time. Tick - tick - tick - ticka - ticka -
tick - tick - tick - tick - ticka - ticka - tick. ‘Sounds like a watch or
something,’ said Tinker, and scrabbled about in the straw. Perhaps Mr Wooh’s
big gold watch had fallen into Charlie’s cage?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
hand felt something small and round and smooth at the bottom of the cage. He
rifled away the thick straw, and drew out the object underneath it. He stared
and stared at it in the utmost surprise. Charlie saw him looking at it,
snatched it away and hid it in the straw again. He made a few growly noises as
if he were angry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Charlie,
where did you get that little clock?’ said Tinker. ‘Oh, CHARLIE! Well, as
you’re so sad this morning, I’ll give it to you for your very own. Just to
cheer you up. But oh, Charlie, I am surprised at you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
slid out of the cage and went back over the fence and into his own garden. Up
the path he ran and burst into the dining-room, where the others were still
finishing their breakfast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
up?’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Listen!
I know who the thief was who climbed in at the tower window... I KNOW WHO HE
WAS!’ cried Tinker, almost shouting in his excitement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘WHO?’
said everyone, in amazement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
was CHARLIE the CHIMP!’ said Tinker. ‘Why didn’t we think of him before? He can
climb anything! It would be quite easy for him to swing himself up that
rough-stoned tower wall, hanging on to the bits of creeper here and there - and
to the uneven stones - and climb through the window into the tower room,
collect all the papers he could hold - and climb down again - slither down
again, probably...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘THAT
must have been the slithering sound I heard!’ said Jenny. ‘I told you I heard a
queer slithering noise!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
the whispering you heard must have been Mr Wooh trying to make him go up the
tower wall and into the window!’ said Julian. ‘Gosh - I bet poor old Charlie’s
been taught to get into all sorts of windows and take whatever he sees. Mr Wooh
must have known Tinker’s father worked out all his ideas up in the tower.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wooh
could easily teach him to take papers,’ said Julian. ‘But there were, of
course, too many for old Charlie in the tower room. He wouldn’t be able to
carry them all in his front paws, for he needed all his paws to climb down that
steep wall - so he must have crammed as many as he could into his mouth - and
dropped the rest under the table! CHARLIE the CHIMP - well! Who would have
thought he could be the thief!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wait
a bit - how on earth do you know it was Charlie?’ said Dick. ‘Nobody saw him.
It was at night.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I do know it was Charlie,’ said Tinker. ‘You remember that dear little clock on
the tower room mantelpiece? Well, it disappeared on the night when those papers
were stolen - and I found it hidden in the straw in Charlie’s cage this
morning! He snatched it away from me, and almost cried - so I let him keep it!
It was ticking loudly just like it always did. It was the loud ticking that
told me it was there in the cage!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who
wound it up at nights, to keep it going?’ said Julian, at once, most
astonished.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Charlie,
I suppose,’ said Tinker. ‘He’s very clever with his paws! The clock was quite
safe, hidden in his cage. Nobody would be likely to get into the chimp’s cage
and sit there with him - but I did this morning, and that’s how I found it. I
heard it ticking, you see. I bet old Charlie was clever enough to pop his
precious clock into his mouth when he saw any of the men coming to clean out
his cage!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I’m blessed!’ said Jenny. ‘How was it that Mr Wooh never saw him bringing it
along with the papers that night, when he stole them?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
as Tinker told you - my guess is that old Charlie must have put the little
clock in his mouth then, along with the papers,’ said Dick. ‘He needed all his
four paws, climbing - or rather slithering down that wall - and he’s got a
jolly big mouth! You should see what a lot of food he can stuff into it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
And Mr Wooh would take the papers, of course - Charlie would just take them
from his mouth and hand them to him - but he’d be artful enough to keep his
precious new toy hidden in his mouth! Poor old Charlie! Can’t you see him
listening to the clock, and cuddling it - like a child with a new toy!’ said
George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
sounded exactly as if he were crying this morning,’ said Tinker. ‘I couldn’t
bear it. Poor old Charlie! He couldn’t understand why Mr Wooh didn’t go and see
him today. He was so miserable!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think we’ll have to get the police along now,’ said Julian. ‘Not only to catch
Mr Wooh and his friend, left so conveniently marooned by George on her island -
but also because Mr Wooh should be charged with stealing your father’s
irreplaceable charts and diagrams, Tinker. Goodness knows what else he has
taught poor old Charlie to steal. I bet he’s sent the chimp into a lot of
houses, and up many walls, and into many windows.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
There’s probably been a trail of robberies wherever the circus went,’ said
Jenny. ‘And many innocent people must have been suspected.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
a shame!’ said Anne. ‘But oh dear - if Mr Wooh goes to prison, whatever will
become of poor old Charlie the Chimp?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
bet Jeremy will take him,’ said Tinker. ‘He loves him, and old Charlie adores
Jeremy! He’ll be all right with Jeremy and old Grandad!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
Tinker, I think you’d better go and tell your father all this,’ said Jenny. ‘I
know he’s busy - he always is - but this is a thing he ought to deal with and
nobody else. If you’d like to fetch him, George could tell him the whole story
- and then I rather guess he’ll ring up the police - and Mr Wooh will find
himself in a whole lot of trouble.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
there goes Tinker, with Mischief on his shoulder, to find his father, down the
hall - up the stairs - along the landing - into his father’s bedroom...
r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r! Tinker, you sound like a motor-scooter going up a
steep hill! PARP -PARP! Don’t hoot like that, you’ll make your father so angry
that he won’t listen to a word you say!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the Professor did listen - and soon Jenny heard him telephoning the police.
They’re coming straight away, and that means that Mr Wooh the Magician is in
for a most unpleasant time, and his magic won’t help him at all! He’ll have to
give back the papers that he made Charlie steal - and plenty of other things,
too! There he is, marooned on the island, quite unable to escape, waiting
fearfully with his companion, for the police!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Another
adventure over!’ said George, with a regretful sigh. ‘And a jolly exciting one
too! I’m glad you solved the mystery, Tinker - it was clever of you to find the
little tower room clock. I bet Mr Wooh wouldn’t have let Charlie keep it, if
he’d known he’d taken it from the tower room! Poor old Charlie the Chimp!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
just wondering if Dad would let me keep Charlie here, while Mr Wooh is in
prison,’ began Tinker, and stopped as Jenny gave a horrified shriek.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Tinker!
If you so much as mention that idea to your father, I’ll walk straight out of
this house and NEVER COME BACK!’ said Jenny. ‘That chimp would be in my kitchen
all day long - oh yes, he would - and things would be disappearing out of my
larder, and my cupboards, and my drawers, and he’d dance up and down and scream
at me if I so much as said a word, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right, dear, dear Jenny, I won’t ask for Charlie, honest I won’t,’ said Tinker.
‘I do love you a bit more than I’d love a chimp - but think what a companion he
would be for Mischief!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
not thinking anything of the sort!’ said Jenny. ‘And what about you taking a
bit of notice of that monkey of yours - bless us all if he hasn’t helped
himself to half that jar of jam - just look at his sticky face! Oh, what a week
this has been, what with chimps and monkeys and children and robberies, and
George disappearing, and all!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dear
old Jenny,’ said George, laughing as she went off into the kitchen. ‘What an
exciting time we’ve had! I really did enjoy every minute of it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
did we, George. Hurry up and fall into another adventure. We are longing to
hear what you and the others will be up to next. How we wish we could join you!
Good-bye for now - and take care of yourselves, Five. Good luck!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
