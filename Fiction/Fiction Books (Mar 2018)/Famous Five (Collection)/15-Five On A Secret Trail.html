IS RATHER DIFFICULT<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mother!
Mother, where are you?’ shouted George, rushing into the house. ‘Mother,
quick!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no answer. George’s mother was out in the garden at the back of Kirrin
Cottage, picking flowers. George yelled again, this time at the top of her very
strong voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>MOTHER!
MOTHER! Where are you? IT’S URGENT.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
door was flung open nearby and George’s father stood there, glaring at her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George!
What’s this row about? Here am I in the middle of some very difficult...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
Father! Timmy’s hurt!’ said George. ‘He went...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Her
father looked down at Timmy, standing meekly behind George. He gave a little
snort.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hurt!
He seems all right to me. I suppose he’s got a thorn in his paw again - and you
think it’s the end of the world or something, and come yelling in here and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy
is hurt!’ said George, with tears in her voice. ‘Look!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
her father had gone back into his study again, and the door slammed. George
glared at it, looking exactly like her hot-tempered father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
unkind!’ she shouted, ‘and ... oh there’s Mother. Mother!’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dear
me, George, whatever is the matter?’ said her mother, putting down the flowers.
‘I heard your father shouting, and then you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mother
- Timmy’s hurt!’ said George. ‘Look!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
knelt down by the dog, and gently pulled forward one ear. Behind it was a big
cut. Timmy whined. Tears came into George’s eyes, and she looked up at her
mother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
don’t be silly, George,’ said Mrs Kirrin. ‘It’s only a cut. How did he do it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
tried to jump over a ditch, and he didn’t see some old barbed wire there,’ said
George. ‘And a rusty piece caught his ear, and ripped that awful cut. I can’t
stop it bleeding.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Her
mother looked at it. It certainly was quite deep. ‘Take him to the vet,
George,’ she said. ‘Perhaps it ought to be stitched. It does look rather deep.
Poor old Timmy-boy - well, it’s a good thing it wasn’t his eye, George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
take him to the vet at once,’ said George, getting up. ‘Will he be in, Mother?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes - it’s his surgery hour,’ said her mother. ‘Take him along now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
Timmy was hurried along the country lanes to the pretty little house where the
vet lived. George, very anxious indeed, was most relieved to see that the vet
seemed quite unconcerned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
couple of stitches and that cut will heal well,’ he said. ‘Hold him, will you,
while I do the job? He’ll hardly feel it. There, old boy - stand still - that’s
right.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
five minutes’ time George was thanking the vet wholeheartedly. ‘Thank you! I
was worried! Will he be all right now?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
gracious, yes - but you mustn’t let him scratch that wound,’ said the vet,
washing his hands. ‘If he does, it may go wrong.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh.
But how can I stop him?’ asked George anxiously. ‘Look - he’s trying to scratch
it now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you must make him a big cardboard collar,’ said the vet. ‘One that sticks out
right round his neck, so that his paw can’t get near that cut, however much he
tries to reach it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
- but Timmy won’t like that a bit,’ said George. ‘Dogs look silly wearing
cardboard collars like great ruffs round their neck. I’ve seen them. He’ll hate
one.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
it’s the only way of stopping him from scratching that wound,’ said the vet.
‘Get along now, George - I’ve more patients waiting.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
went home with Timmy. He padded along quietly, pleased at the fuss that George
was making of him. When he was nearly home, he suddenly sat down and put up his
hind leg to scratch his bad ear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
Timmy! NO!’ cried George, in alarm. ‘You must NOT scratch. You’ll get the plaster
off in no time, and break the stitches. NO, Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
looked up in surprise. Very well. If scratching was suddenly upsetting George,
he would wait till he was alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
George could read Timmy’s thoughts as easily as he could read hers! She frowned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Blow!
I’ll have to make him that cardboard collar. Perhaps Mother will help me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Her
mother was quite willing to help. George was not good at things of that sort,
and she watched her mother cutting out a big cardboard collar, fitting it round
the surprised Timmy’s head, and then lacing the edges together with thread so
that he could not get it off. Timmy was most surprised, but he stood very
patiently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
soon as the collar was finished, and safely round his neck, he walked away.
Then he raised his hind leg to scratch at his smarting ear - but, of course, he
couldn’t get it over the collar, and merely scratched the cardboard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Never
mind, Timmy,’ said George. ‘It will only be for a few days.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
study door nearby opened and her father came out. He saw Timmy in his collar
and stopped in surprise. Then he roared with laughter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hey,
Timmy - you look like Queen Elizabeth the First in a fine big ruff!’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
laugh at him, Father,’ said George. ‘You know<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>that dogs can’t bear being laughed at.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
certainly looked offended. He turned his back on George’s father and stalked
off to the kitchen. A little squeal of laughter came from there and then a loud
guffaw from someone at the kitchen door - the milkman.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
Timmy - whatever have you got that collar on for?’ said the cook’s voice. ‘You
do look peculiar!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was angry. She remained angry all that day and made everyone most
uncomfortable. How mean of people to jeer at poor Timmy! Didn’t they realize
how terribly uncomfortable a collar like that was - and Timmy had to wear it
night and day! He couldn’t even lie down comfortably. George mooned about
looking so angry and miserable that her mother felt worried.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George
dear - don’t be silly about this. You will make your father cross. Timmy will
have to wear that collar for at least a week, you know - and he does look a bit
comical when you first see him. He’s getting used to it, he soon won’t notice
it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Everybody
laughs at him,’ said George, in an angry voice. ‘He went into the garden and a
lot of kids hung over the wall and laughed like anything. And the postman told
me it was cruel. And Father thinks it’s funny. And...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
dear, George, don’t get into one of your moods,’ said her mother. ‘Remember,
Anne is coming soon. She won’t enjoy things much if you behave like this.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
bore it for one day more. Then, after two upsets with her father over Timmy,
another with a couple of boys who laughed at him, and one with the paper-boy,
she decided she wouldn’t stay at Kirrin Cottage for one day longer!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
take my little tent, and go off by ourselves somewhere,’ she told Timmy. ‘Some
place where nobody can see you till your ear is better and that hateful collar
is off. Don’t you think that’s a good idea, Timmy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy. He thought that any of George’s ideas were good, though the collar
puzzled him very much.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
know the dogs laugh at you too, Timmy,’ said George, earnestly. ‘Did you see
how that silly little poodle belonging to Mrs Janes up the lane stood and stared
at you? He looked exactly as if he was laughing. I won’t have you laughed at. I
know you hate it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
certainly didn’t like it, but he really was not as upset about the collar as
George seemed to be. He followed her as she went up to her bedroom and watched
her as she began to put a few things into a small bag.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
go to that lonely little spot on the common,’ she said to him. ‘We’ll pitch our
tent near a little stream, and we’ll jolly well stay there till your ear’s
better. We’ll go tonight. I’ll take my bike, and strap everything on to the
back.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So,
in the middle of the night, when Kirrin Cottage was dark and quiet, George
stole downstairs with Timmy. She left a note on the dining-room table, and then
went to get her bicycle. She strapped her little tent on it, and the bag
containing food and other odds and ends.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on!’ she whispered to the surprised Timmy. ‘We’ll go. I’ll ride slowly and you
can run beside me. Don’t bark for goodness’ sake!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
disappeared into the darkness, Timmy running like a black shadow beside the
bicycle. Nobody guessed they were gone. Kirrin Cottage was quiet and
undisturbed - except for the creaking of the kitchen door, which George had
forgotten to shut.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
in the morning, what a disturbance! Joan the cook found George’s note first and
wondered what a letter in George’s writing was doing on the dining-room table.
She ran straight up to George’s room and looked inside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
bed was empty. There was no George and Timmy’s basket was empty. Joan went to
take the note to Mrs Kirrin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
dear! How silly George is!’ she said, when she had read it. ‘Look, Quentin -
such a fuss about Timmy! Now George has gone off with him, goodness knows
where!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Her
husband took the note and read it out loud. ‘Dear Mother, I’m going off for a
few days with Timmy till his ear is better. I’ve taken my tent and a few
things. Don’t worry, please. Tell Anne if she wants to join me, to come to the
end of Carters Lane on the common and I will show her where I’m camping. Tell
her to come at twelve. Love from George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I’m blessed!’ said George’s father. ‘All right - let her stay away if she wants
to - I’m tired of her sulky face and Timmy’s hang-dog looks. Tell Anne to join
George, and maybe I shall have peace for a few days!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George
should be all right,’ said his wife. ‘She’s quite sensible really - and she’s
got Timmy. I’ll tell Anne to join her when she arrives this morning.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
Anne arrived at Kirrin Station, and looked out for George and Timmy, they
weren’t there - only her aunt was there, smiling as usual.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
happened?’ said Anne. ‘Where’s George - and Timmy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
- George has gone off by herself,’ said her Aunt Fanny. ‘Come along, and I’ll
tell you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Aunt Fanny - George is quite crazy about old Tim, isn’t she? I’ll go and meet
her at twelve, and of course I’ll camp with her for a day or two. It’s lovely
weather and I’d like to. I expect Uncle Quentin will be glad to have us out of
the house!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
are Julian and Dick?’ asked her aunt. She was very fond of Anne’s two brothers,
George’s cousins. ‘Will they be coming down here at all these holidays?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know,’ said Anne. ‘They’re still in France, you know, on a school-boys’
tour. I feel funny without them! George will be cross to hear they probably
won’t be coming to Kirrin. She’ll just have to put up with me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
twelve o’clock Anne was standing patiently at the end of Carters Lane. It ran
to the common and then ended in a small, winding path that led to nowhere in
particular. Big gorse bushes grew here and there, and slender birch trees.
Anne, her belongings strapped to her back, and a bag in her hand, looked over
the common to see if she could spy George coming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no sign of her. ‘Blow!’ said Anne. ‘I suppose she’s changed her mind or
something. Perhaps her watch has stopped and she doesn’t know the time. She
ought to, though, by looking at the sun! How long shall I wait?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
sat down by a big gorse-bush, out of the hot sun. She hadn’t been there for
more than a minute when she heard a hissing sound.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Pssssst!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
sat up at once. The sound came from the other side of the bush, and she got up
and walked round it. Half-hidden under a prickly branch were George and Timmy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo!’
said Anne, surprised. ‘Didn’t you see me when I arrived? Hallo, Tim darling!
How’s your poor old ear? Oh, doesn’t he look a quaint old dear in that collar,
George?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
scrambled out of the bush. ‘I hid here just in case Father or Mother should
come with you and try to make me come back,’ she said. ‘I wanted to make quite
sure they weren’t waiting somewhere a little way away. I’m glad you’ve come,
Anne.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course I’ve come,’ said Anne. ‘I wouldn’t stay alone at Kirrin Cottage while
you were camping out. Besides, I understand how you feel about Timmy. The
collar’s a jolly good idea, of course - but it does make him look comical. I
think he looks rather a dear in it, I do really.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was almost relieved that Anne had not laughed at Timmy as most people had. She
smiled at her cousin, and Timmy licked her till Anne really had to push him
away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
go,’ said George, scrambling up. ‘I’ve got a lovely camping-place, Anne. You’ll
like it. It’s near a little spring too, so there’s plenty of water for Timmy to
drink - and us too. Did you bring any more food? I didn’t really bring much.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I’ve brought heaps,’ said Anne. ‘Aunt Fanny made me. She’s not cross with you,
George. I didn’t see your father. He was shut up in his study.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George’s
spirits suddenly rose. She gave Anne a friendly punch. ‘This is going to be
fun! Timmy’s ear will soon be better, and he loves camping out as much as we
do. I’ve really found a good place - about the loneliest on the common! Nobody
near us for miles!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
set off together, Timmy at their heels, darting off every now and again when he
smelt rabbit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘When
are Julian and Dick coming down?’ asked George. ‘In a few days? Timmy’s ear
will be all right then and we can go back to Kirrin Cottage to welcome the
boys, and have some fun there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
may not be coming down at all these hols,’ said Anne, and George’s face fell at
once. She stopped and stared at Anne in dismay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
coming! but they always come in the hols - or we go away somewhere together!’
she said. ‘They must come! I shall be miserable without Ju and Dick.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- they’re still in France, on a tour or something,’ said Anne. ‘We shall hear
if they’re staying on there or coming down to Kirrin, when we get back to the
cottage. Don’t look so woebegone, George!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
George felt woebegone. The holidays stretched before her, suddenly seeming long
and dreary. Her two boy cousins were always such fun - they had had such
wonderful adventures together. And now - now they weren’t coming!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
shan’t have any adventures at all if the boys don’t come,’ she said, in a small
voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
shan’t mind that,’ said Anne. ‘I’m the peaceful one, not always on the look-out
for something to happen, like you and the boys! Perhaps these holidays will be
quite unexciting without even the smell of an adventure! Oh George - cheer up!
Don’t look so mournful. You’d better send a telegram to Julian and Dick if you
feel so badly about it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
a good mind to!’ said George. ‘I can’t imagine hols without the boys. Why - we
shan’t be the Five - the Famous Five - if they don’t come!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof!’
said Timmy, quite agreeing. He sat down and tried to scratch his ear, but the
big collar prevented him. He didn’t seem to mind and ran off after a rabbit
quite happily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think you are more upset about that collar than Timmy,’ said Anne, as they
walked along. ‘Are we getting near this place of yours, George? It’s a jolly
long way.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
go up this hill in front of us - and then drop down to a little copse,’ said
George. ‘There’s a funny old cottage nearby - quite ruined and empty. At first
I thought perhaps people lived there, but when I went nearer I saw that it was
ruined. There’s a big old rose-rambler climbing all over it, even inside. I
suppose the people who used to live there planted it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
walked up the little hill and down again, following curving rabbit-paths.
‘Better look out for adders,’ said Anne. ‘This is just the kind of place for
them. My word, it’s hot, George. Is there anywhere to bathe near here - a pool
or anything?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know. We could explore and see,’ said George. ‘I did bring my swim-suit
just in case. Look - you can see part of the old cottage now. My camp is fairly
near there. I thought I’d better camp near the spring.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were soon at George’s rough little camp. Her tent was up, and she had made a
bed inside of the springy heather. A mug, a bag of dog biscuits, a few tins,
and a loaf of bread were at one end of the tent. It didn’t seem to Anne as if
George had brought very much, and she felt glad that she had managed to pack
such a lot of things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Aunt
Fanny cut dozens and dozens of sandwiches,’ said Anne. ‘She said if we kept
them in this tin they wouldn’t go stale, and would last us a day or two till we
went back. I’m hungry. Shall we have some now?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
sat out in the sun, munching the ham sandwiches. Anne had brought tomatoes too,
and they took a bite at a sandwich and then a bite at a tomato. Timmy had to
make do with a handful of dog biscuits and half a sandwich every now and again.
After a bit he got up and wandered off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
he going?’ asked Anne. ‘To look for a rabbit?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
Probably to get a drink,’ said George. ‘The spring is in the direction he’s
gone. I’m thirsty too - let’s take the mug and get a drink ourselves.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went off with the mug, Anne following George through the thick heather. The
little spring was a lovely one. It had evidently been used by the people who
had once lived in the old cottage, and was built round with big white stones,
so that the spring ran through a little stony channel, as clear as crystal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oooh
- it’s as cold as ice!’ said Anne. ‘Simply delicious! I could drink gallons of
this!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
lay on the heather out in the sun, talking, when they came back from the
spring. Timmy wandered off by himself again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
so peaceful here,’ said Anne. ‘Nobody near us for miles. Just the birds and the
rabbits. This is what I like!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
hardly a sound,’ said George, yawning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then, just as she said that, there came a noise in the distance. A sharp sound,
like metal on stone. It came again and again and then stopped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
that, do you suppose?’ said George, sitting up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can’t imagine,’ said Anne. ‘Anyway, it’s a long way away - everything is so
still that sounds carry from quite a distance.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sharp noises began again in a little while and then stopped. The girls shut
their eyes, and slept. There wasn’t a sound now except the pop-pop-pop of gorse
pads exploding in the sun and sending out their little black seeds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
woke up when Timmy came back. He sat down heavily on her feet and she woke up
with a jump.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy!
Don’t!’ she said. ‘Get off my feet, you made me jump!’ Timmy obligingly removed
himself and then picked up something he had dropped, lay down and began gnawing
it. George looked to see what it was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy!
That’s a bone! Where did you get it?’ she said. ‘Anne, did you bring a bone for
Tim?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What?
What did you say?’ said Anne, half asleep. ‘A bone. No, I didn’t. Why?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Because
Timmy’s found one,’ said George, ‘and it’s a bone that has had cooked meat on
it, so it’s not a rabbit or anything Timmy’s caught. Timmy, where did you get
it.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, offering the bone to George, thinking that she too might like a
gnaw, as she seemed so interested in it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
you suppose anyone else is camping near us?’ asked Anne, sitting up and
yawning. ‘After all, bones don’t grow in the heather. That’s quite a good meaty
one, too. Timmy, have you stolen it from another dog?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
thumped his tail on the ground and went on with his bone. He looked pleased
with himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
rather an old bone,’ said George. ‘It’s smelly. Go away, Tim - take it further
off.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sharp metallic noises suddenly began again and George frowned. ‘I believe there
is someone camping near us, Anne. Come on - let’s do a bit of exploring and
find out. I vote we move our camp if there are other people near. Come on,
Timmy - that’s right, bury that horrible bone! This way Anne!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

OLD COTTAGE - AND A SURPRISE<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two girls, with Timmy at their heels, left their camping-place and set off in
the hot sun. Anne caught sight of the ruined cottage and stopped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
have a look at it,’ she said. ‘It must be awfully old, George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went in at the wide doorway. There was no door left, only the stone archway.
Inside was a big room, whose floor had once been paved with slabs of white
stone. Now grass and other weeds had grown between the cracks, and had actually
lifted up some of the slabs so that the whole floor was uneven.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Here
and there parts of the walls had fallen away, and the daylight came through.
One window was still more or less intact, but the others had fallen out. A
small crooked stairway of stone led upwards in one corner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘To
rooms above, I suppose,’ said Anne. ‘Oh, here’s another doorway, leading into a
second room - a small one. It’s got an old sink in it, look - and this must be
the remains of a pump.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
not much to see, really,’ said George, looking round. ‘The top rooms must be
quite ruined, because half the roof is off. Hallo, here’s another door - a back
door. It’s actually a door too, not just a doorway.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
gave a push at the stout wood - and the old door promptly fell off its hinges
and crashed outwards into an over-grown yard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Goodness!’
said George, startled. ‘I didn’t know it was quite so rotten. It made poor Tim
jump almost out of his skin!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
are out-houses here - or the remains of them,’ said Anne, exploring the
back-yard. ‘They must have kept pigs and hens and ducks. Here’s a dried-up
pond, look.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everything
was falling to pieces. The best preserved corner of the old place was what must
have been a small stable. Rusted mangers were still there and the floor was of
stone. An old, old piece of harness hung on a big nail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
got quite a nice ‘feel’ about it, this old place,’ said Anne. ‘Sometimes I
don’t like the feel of places - they give me an uneasy feeling, a feeling that
horrid things may have happened there. But this is quite different. I think
people have been happy here, and led peaceful lives. I can almost hear hens
clucking and ducks quacking, and pigs gr...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Quack,
quack, quack! Quack!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Cuck-cuk-cuk-cuk-cuk!
Cuck-cuk-cuk-cuk-cuk!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
clutched George and the two girls looked extremely startled to hear the sudden
loud noise of quacking and clucking. They stood and listened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
was it?’ said Anne. ‘It sounded like hens and ducks - though I’m not quite
sure. But there aren’t any here, surely. We shall hear a horse whinnying next!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
didn’t hear a whinny - but they heard the snorting of a horse at once.
‘Hmrr-umph! Hrrrrr-umph!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Both
girls were now quite alarmed. They looked for Timmy. He was nowhere to be seen!
Wherever could he have got to?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Cuck-cuk-cuk-cuk-cuk!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
is silly,’ said George. ‘Are we imagining things? Anne, there must be hens
near. Come round the back of these stables and look. Timmy, where are you?
TIMMY!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
whistled shrilly - and immediately an echo came - or so it seemed!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Phee-phee-phee-phee-phee!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘TIMMY!’
yelled George, beginning to feel as if she was in a dream.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
appeared, looking rather sheepish. He wagged his tail - and to the girls’
enormous amazement, they saw that he had a ribbon tied on it. A ribbon - a
bright blue one at that!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy!
Your tail - the ribbon - Timmy, what’s all this about?’ said George, really
startled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
went to her, still looking sheepish, George tore the ribbon off his tail. ‘Who
tied it there?’ she demanded. ‘Who’s here? Timmy, where have you been?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two girls searched the old buildings thoroughly, and found nothing and nobody.
Not a hen, not a duck, not a pig - and certainly not a horse. Then - what was
the explanation? They stared at one another in bewilderment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
where did Timmy get that silly ribbon?’ said George, exasperated. ‘Someone must
have tied it on.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Perhaps
it was a hiker passing by - perhaps he heard us here and saw Timmy and played a
joke,’ said Anne. ‘But it’s strange that old Tim let him tie on the ribbon. I
mean - Timmy’s not overfriendly with strangers, is he?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls gave up the idea of exploring any further and went back to their little
camp. Timmy went with them. He lay down - and then suddenly got up again,
making for a thick gorse bush. He tried to squirm underneath.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Note
what’s he after?’ said George. ‘Really, I think Timmy’s gone mad. Timmy, you
can’t get under there with that great collar on. TIMMY, do you hear me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
backed out reluctantly, the collar all crooked. After him came a peculiar
little mongrel dog with one blind eye and one exceedingly bright and lively
one. He was half-white and half-black, and had a ridiculously long thin tail,
which he waved about merrily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well!’
said George, amazed. ‘What’s that dog doing there? And how did Timmy get so
friendly with him? Timmy, I can’t make you out.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, and brought the mongrel dog over to Anne and George. He then
proceeded to dig up the smelly bone he had buried, and actually offered it to
the little dog, who looked away and took no interest in it at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
is all very peculiar,’ said Anne. ‘I shall expect to see Timmy bring a cat to
us next!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
once there came a pathetic mewing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mee-ew!
Mee-ew-ee-ew-ee-ew!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Both
dogs pricked up their ears, and rushed to the bush. Timmy was once again kept
back by his big collar and barked furiously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
got up and marched to the bush. ‘If there’s a cat there, it won’t have much
chance against two dogs,’ she called to Anne. Come away, Tim. Hey, you little
dog, come away, too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
backed out, and George pulled out the small dog very firmly indeed. ‘Hold him,
Anne!’ she called. ‘He’s quite friendly. He won’t bite. I’m going to find that
cat.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
held on to the small mongrel, who gazed at her excitedly with his one good eye
and wagged his tail violently. He was a most friendly little fellow. George
began to crawl into the bare hollow space under the big gorse bush.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
looked into it, not able to see anything at first, because it was dark there
after the bright sunlight. Then she got a tremendous shock.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
round, grinning face stared back at her, a face with very bright eyes and
tousled hair falling on to the forehead. The mouth was set in a wide smile,
showing very white teeth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mee-ew-ee-ew-ee-ew!’
said the face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
scrambled back at top speed, her heart thumping. ‘What is it?’ called Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
somebody hiding there,’ said George. ‘Not a cat. A fathead of a boy who is
doing the mewing.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mew-ee-ew-ee-ew!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
out!’ called Anne. ‘Come out and let’s see you. You must be crazy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a scrambling noise and a boy came headforemost from the hollow space under
the bush. He was about twelve or thirteen, short, studily built, and with the
cheekiest face Anne had ever seen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
rushed at him and licked him lovingly. George stared in amazement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
does my dog know you?’ she demanded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
he came growling at me yesterday when I was in my own camp,’ said the boy. ‘And
I offered him a nice meaty bone. Then he saw my little dog Jet - short for
jet-propelled, you know - and made friends with him - and with me too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
see,’ said George, still not at all friendly. ‘Well, I don’t like my dog to
take food from strangers.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
I couldn’t agree more,’ said the boy. ‘But I thought I’d rather he ate the bone
than ate me. He’s a nice dog, yours. He feels a bit of an idiot wearing that
collar, doesn’t he? You should have heard Jet laugh when he first saw it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
frowned. ‘I came here to be alone so that Timmy shouldn’t be jeered at,’ she
said. ‘He’s got a bad ear. I suppose you were the fathead who tied a blue
ribbon on his tail?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Just
for a joke,’ said the boy. ‘You like frowning and glaring, I can see. Well, I
like joking and tricking! Your Timmy didn’t mind a bit. He took to my dog right
away. But everyone likes Jet! I wanted to find out who owned Timmy - because,
like you, I don’t like strangers messing about when I’m camping out. So I came
along.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
see. And you did all the clucking and quacking and hrrr-umphing?’ said Anne.
She liked this idiot of a boy, with his broad friendly grin. ‘What are you
doing - just camping - or hiking - or botanizing?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
digging,’ said the boy. ‘My father’s an archaeologist - he loves old buildings
more than anything else in the world. I take after him, I suppose. There was
once an old Roman camp on this common, you know - and I’ve found a place where
part of it must have been, so I’m digging for anything I can find - pottery,
weapons, anything like that. See, I found this yesterday - look at the date on
it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
suddenly thrust an old coin at them - a queer, uneven one, rather heavy to
hold.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Its
date is 292,’ he said. ‘At least, as far as I can make out. So the camp’s
pretty old, isn’t it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
come and see it,’ said Anne, excited.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
don’t,’ said the boy. ‘I don’t like people messing round me when I’m doing
something serious. Please don’t come. I won’t bother you again. I promise.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right. We won’t come,’ said Anne, quite understanding. ‘But don’t you play any
more silly tricks on us, see?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
promise,’ said the boy. ‘I tell you, I won’t come near you again. I only wanted
to see whose dog this was. Well, I’m off. So long!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And,
whistling to Jet, he set off at a furious pace. George turned to Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
a peculiar boy!’ she said. ‘Actually - I’d rather like to see him again.
Wouldn’t you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

Four<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THAT
NIGHT<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was now tea-time, according to Anne’s watch and also according to everyone’s
feelings, including Timmy’s. Timmy felt the heat very much and was always
wandering off to the little spring to lap the crystal-cold water. Anne wished
that she and George had a big jug that they could fill - it was such a nuisance
to have to keep running to and fro with just a mug.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had tea - biscuits, a sandwich each, and a bar of rather soft chocolate. George
examined Timmy’s ear for the hundredth time that day, and pronounced it very
much better.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
don’t take off that collar yet,’ said Anne. ‘He’ll only open the wound by
scratching if you do.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
not going to take it off!’ said George, touchily. ‘What shall we do now, Anne?
Go for a walk?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Anne. ‘Listen - you can hear those sharp, metallic noises again - that’s
the boy at work again, I expect. Funny boy he must be - coming to dig about all
on his own with his comical little dog. I wish we could see what he’s doing.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
promised we wouldn’t,’ said George. ‘So I don’t feel that we even ought to go
and peep.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course not!’ said Anne. ‘Come on - let’s go in the opposite direction, George -
right away from the boy. I hope we shan’t get lost!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
while Timmy’s with us, silly!’ said George. ‘You’d find your way home from the
moon, wouldn’t you, Tim?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
agreed Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
always says yes to whatever you say, George,’ said Anne. ‘I say - isn’t it a
lovely evening? I wonder what Julian and Dick are doing?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
immediately looked downcast. She felt that her two cousins had no right to go
rushing across France when she wanted them at Kirrin. Didn’t they like Kirrin?
Would they be having magnificent adventures on the Continent, and not want to
spend even a week at Kirrin? She looked so lost in miserable thoughts that Anne
laughed at her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Cheer
up! At least I am here with you - though I agree that compared with Ju and Dick
I’m very poor company, and not at all adventurous!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had a lovely walk, and sat down half-way to watch hordes of rabbits playing
together. Timmy was very unhappy about this. Why sit down to watch silly
rabbits? Rabbits were made to chase, weren’t they? Why did George always put a
restraining hand on his collar when she sat down to watch rabbits? He whined
continually, as he watched with her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shut
up, Timmy, you ass,’ said George. ‘You’d only spoil the entertainment if you
sent them to their holes.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
watched for a long while and then got up to go back to the camp. When they came
near, they heard the sound of low whistling. Someone was about that evening,
quite near their camp. Who was it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came round a big gorse bush, and almost bumped into a boy. He got out of their
way politely, but said nothing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
- it’s you!’ said George, in surprise. ‘I don’t know your name. What are you
doing here? You said you wouldn’t come near us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy stared, looking very surprised. His tousled hair fell right across his
forehead, and he brushed it back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
said nothing of the sort,’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
you did!’ said Anne. ‘You know you did. Well, if you break your promise,
there’s no reason for us to keep ours. We shall come and visit your camp.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
never made you any promise,’ said the boy, looking quite startled. ‘You’re
mad!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
be an idiot,’ said George, getting cross. ‘I suppose you’ll be saying next that
you didn’t act like a hen, and a duck, and a horse this afternoon...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
a cat,’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Balmy!’
said the boy, looking at them pityingly. ‘Quite balmy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Are
you coming here again?’ demanded George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
I want to,’ said the boy. ‘The water in this spring is better than the one over
by my camp.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Then
we shall come and explore your camp,’ said George, firmly. ‘If you don’t keep
your promise, we shan’t keep ours.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘By
all means come if you want to,’ said the boy. ‘You seem quite mad, but I
daresay you’re harmless. But don’t bring your dog. He might eat mine.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
know he wouldn’t eat Jet!’ said Anne. ‘They’re good friends.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know anything of the sort,’ said the boy, and went off, brushing his hair
out of his eyes again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
do you make of that?’ said George, staring after him. ‘Not a bit the same as he
was this afternoon. Do you think he really had forgotten about his promise and
everything?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know,’ said Anne, puzzled. ‘He was so perky and jolly and full of fun
before - grinning all the time - but just now he seemed quite serious - not a
smile in him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
well - perhaps he’s a bit crazy,’ said George. ‘Are you sleepy Anne? I am,
though I can’t think why!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
very - but I’d like to lie down on this springy heather and watch the stars
gradually come sparkling into the sky,’ said Anne. ‘I don’t think I’ll sleep in
the tent, George. You’ll want Timmy with you, and honestly there’s so little
room inside the tent that I’m quite sure Timmy would lie on my legs all night
long.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
sleep in the open air as well,’ said George. ‘I only slept in the tent last
night because it looked a bit like rain. Let’s get some more heather and make a
kind of mattress of it. We can put a rug on top of it, and lie on that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two of them pulled a lot of heather and carried it to their ‘bed’. Soon they
had a fine pile, and Timmy went to lie on it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hey
- it’s not for you!’ cried George. ‘Get off - you’ll flatten it right down.
Where’s the rug, Anne?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
laid the rug on the heather-pile and then went to the spring to wash and clean
their teeth. Timmy immediately got on to the heather-bed again, and shut his
eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
old fraud!’ said George, lugging him off. ‘You’re not asleep. Keep off our bed!
Look - there’s a nice soft patch of grass for you. That’s your bed!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
lay down on the rug, and the heathery-bed sank a little beneath her weight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Very
comfortable!’ said George. ‘Shall we want a rug over us, Anne?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I did bring one,’ said Anne. ‘But I don’t think we’ll want it, the night’s so
hot. Look - there is a star already!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
there were six or seven - and then gradually hundreds more pricked through the
evening sky as the twilight deepened. It was a wonderful night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
the stars look big and bright?’ said Anne, sleepily. ‘They make me feel very
small, they’re such millions of miles away. George, are you asleep?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no answer. George hadn’t heard a word. She was fast asleep. Her hand fell
down the side of the heather and rested on the ground below. Timmy moved a
little nearer and gave it a small lick. Then he too fell asleep, and gave some
small doggy snores.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
night darkened. There was no moon but the stars shone out well from the
midnight sky. It was very quiet out there on the common, far away from streets
and villages and towns. Not even an owl hooted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
didn’t quite know why she awoke. At first she had no idea where she was, and
she lay gazing up at the stars in astonishment, thinking she must still be
asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
suddenly felt very thirsty. She groped about in the nearby tent for the mug,
couldn’t find it and gave it up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
drink from my cupped hands,’ she thought, and set off for the little spring.
Timmy wondered whether to follow her. No - he would stay with George. She
wouldn’t like it if she awoke and found him gone with Anne. So he settled his
head down on his paws again and slept, leaving one ear open for Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
found the little spring. Its tinkling gurgling sound guided her as soon as she
heard it. She sat down on one of the stones nearby, and held out her cupped
hands. How very cold the water was - and how delicious to drink on this hot
night! She sipped thirstily, slopping some of the water down her front.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
got up to go back, and walked a few steps in the starlight. Then she stopped.
Wait - was she going in the right direction? She wasn’t sure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think I am!’ she decided, and went on, carefully and quietly. Surely she must
be near their little camp now?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
all at once she stood still, and felt herself stiffen. She had suddenly seen a
light. It had flashed and disappeared. Ah - there it was again! Whatever could
it be?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then,
as her eyes strained through the starlit darkness, she suddenly saw that she
had taken the wrong way - she had gone in the direction of the old ruined
cottage, and not the camp - and the light had come from there!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
didn’t dare go any nearer. She felt glued to the grass she was standing on! Now
she could hear sounds - whispering sounds - and the noise of a footfall on the
stone floor of the cottage - and then the flash of a light came again! Yes, it
was from the old cottage!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
began to breathe fast. Who was it in the old cottage? She simply dared not go
and see. She must go back to George, and to Timmy’s protection. As fast and as
silently as she could she found her way back to the spring - and then, almost
stumbling now, made her way to where George was still lying peacefully asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, sleepily, and tried to lick her hand. Anne climbed on to the
heathery-bed beside George, her heart still beating fast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George!’
she whispered. ‘George, do wake up. I’ve something queer to tell you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
would not wake up. She grunted when Anne poked her and prodded her, and then
she turned over, almost falling off the small heather-bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
George - please do wake!’ begged Anne, in a whisper. She was afraid of speaking
out loud in case anyone should hear her. Who knew what might happen if she drew
attention to their little camp?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
awoke at last and was cross. ‘Whatever is it, Anne?’ she said, her voice
sounding loud in the night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sh!’
said Anne. ‘Sh!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why?
We’re all alone here! We can make as much noise as we like!’ said George,
surprised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George,
do listen! There’s someone in that old cottage!’ said Anne, and at last George
heard and understood. She sat up at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
told her the whole story - though it didn’t really seem very much of a tale
when she related it. George spoke to Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Tim!’
she said, keeping her voice low. ‘We’ll go and do a little exploring, shall we?
Come on, then - and keep quiet!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
slid off the rug and stood up. ‘You stay here,’ she said to Anne. ‘Timmy and I
will be very quiet and careful, and see what we can find out.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no - I couldn’t stay here alone!’ said Anne in alarm, and got up hurriedly. ‘I
shall have to come too. I don’t mind a bit now Timmy’s with us. I wonder he
didn’t bark at the people in the old cottage, whoever they were.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
probably thought it was you messing about,’ said George, and Anne nodded. Yes,
of course, Timmy must have thought that any noises he heard had been made by
her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
took the path that led to the old cottage. George had Timmy well to heel. He
knew he must not push forward unless told to. His ears were pricked now, and he
was listening hard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came cautiously to the cottage. They could see its dark outline in the
starlight, but little else. There was no light flashing there. Nor did there
seem to be any noises at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
three stood still and quiet for about five minutes. Then Timmy moved
restlessly. This was boring! Why wouldn’t George let him run forward and
explore everywhere if she wanted to know if intruders were about?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t think there’s a soul here!’ whispered George into Anne’s ear. ‘They must
have gone - unless you dreamed it all, Anne!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
didn’t!’ whispered back Anne indignantly. ‘Let’s go forward a bit and send
Timmy into the cottage. He’ll soon bark if there’s anyone there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
gave Timmy a little shove. ‘Go on, then!’ she said. ‘Find, Timmy, find!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
gladly shot forward into the darkness. He trotted into the cottage, though it
was impossible even to see him go to it. The two girls stood and listened,
their heart-beats sounding very loud to them! There was not a sound to be
heard, except occasionally the rattle of Timmy’s strong claws on a stony slab.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
can’t be anyone there,’ said George at last.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Else
Timmy would have sniffed them out. You’re an ass, Anne - you dreamt it all!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
did not!’ said Anne, indignant again. ‘I know there was someone there - in
fact, more than one person, because I’m sure I heard whispering!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
raised her voice. ‘Timmy!’ she called loudly, making Anne jump violently.
‘Timmy! Come along. We’ve sent you on a silly wild goose chase - but now we’ll
go back to bed!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
came trotting out of the cottage and went obediently to George. She heard him
yawn as he stood beside her, and she laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Anne
had a bad dream, that’s all, Timmy,’ she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
felt cross - very cross. She said no more and they left the old cottage and
went back to their heather-bed. Anne climbed on to her side and turned over
with her back to George. All right - let George think it was a dream if she
liked!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
when Anne awoke in the morning and remembered the happenings of the night
before, she too began to wonder uneasily if she had dreamed what she had seen
and heard in the old cottage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘After
all - Timmy would certainly have caught anyone who was there,’ she thought.
‘And he wasn’t at all excited, so there can’t have been anyone in the cottage.
And anyway, why would they come? It’s just silly!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So,
when George talked about Anne’s dreaming in the middle of the night, Anne did
not defend herself. She really could not be sure that it had really happened.
So she held her tongue when George teased her, and said nothing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
go and see that boy and his camp,’ George said when they had eaten a few rather
stale sandwiches and some shortbread biscuits. ‘I’m beginning to feel bored,
aren’t you? I wish Timmy’s ear would quite heal up. I’d go back home like a
shot then.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
set off in the direction of the camp with Timmy. They heard a chip-chipping
noise as they came near, and then something small and hairy shot out from a
bush and rushed up, barking a welcome.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo,
Jet!’ said Anne. ‘Don’t you let Timmy have any more of your bones!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
chipping noise had stopped. The two girls went on and came to a very messy
piece of common. It had been well dug over, in some places very deeply. Surely
that boy couldn’t have done so much excavating by himself?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hey!
Where are you?’ called George. Then she saw the boy below her, examining
something in a trench he had dug out. He jumped and looked upwards.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
he scowled. ‘Look - you promised not to come and disturb me!’ he shouted.
‘You’re mean. Just like girls to break a promise.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well!
I like that!’ said George, amazed. ‘It was you who broke yours! Who came
messing round our camp yesterday evening I’d like to know?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
me!’ said the boy at once. ‘I always keep my promises. Now go away and keep
yours. Girls! Pooh!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I can’t say we think much of you,’ said George, disgusted. ‘We’re going. We
don’t want to see anything of your silly digging. Good-bye!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good-bye
and good riddance!’ called the boy rudely, and turned back to his work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think he must be quite mad,’ said Anne. ‘First he makes a promise - then last
evening he broke his promise and even said he hadn’t made one - and now today
he says he did make a promise and that he’d kept his and we’d broken ours.
Idiotic!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went up a little rabbit path, and into a small copse of birch trees. Someone
was sitting there reading. He looked up as they came.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two girls stopped in amazement. It was that boy again! But how had he got here?
They had just left him behind in a trench! Anne looked at the title of the book
he was reading. Goodness - what a learned title - something about Archaeology.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Another
little trick of yours, I suppose?’ said George, sarcastically, stopping in
front of him. ‘You must be a jolly good runner, I must say, to have got here so
quickly. Funny boy, aren’t you - very very funny!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
gracious - it’s those potty girls again,’ groaned the boy. ‘Can’t you leave me
alone? You talked a lot of rubbish yesterday - and now you’re talking it
again.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
did you get here so quickly,’ said Anne, puzzled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
didn’t get here quickly. I came very slowly, reading my book as I went,’ said
the boy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Fibber!’
said George. ‘You must have run at top speed. Why do you pretend like this?
It’s only a minute or so ago that we saw you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
you’re the fibber!’ said the boy. ‘I do think you two girls are awful. Go away
and leave me alone and never let me see you again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
didn’t like the tone of the boy’s voice and he growled. The boy scowled at him.
‘And just you shut up too,’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
pulled at George’s sleeve. ‘Come on,’ she said, ‘it’s no good staying here
arguing. The boy’s crazy - just mad - we’ll never get any sense out of him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two girls walked off together, Timmy following.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy took absolutely no notice. His face was turned to his book and he was quite
absorbed in it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
never met anyone quite so mad before!’ said Anne, rather puzzled. ‘By the way, George
- you don’t suppose it could have been that idiotic boy last night in the
cottage?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
I tell you I think you dreamed it,’ said George, firmly. ‘Though that boy is
quite idiot enough to explore an old cottage in the middle of the night. He
would probably think it a very good time to do so. Oh Anne, look - there’s a
pool - in that hollow down there. Do you think we could bathe in it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
certainly shone very temptingly. They went down to have a closer look. ‘Yes -
we’ll have a swim this afternoon,’ said George. ‘And then I really think, Anne,
we ought to go back to Kirrin Cottage and get a few more provisions. The
sandwiches we’ve got left are so dry that we really shan’t enjoy eating them -
and as Timmy’s ear isn’t healed, it looks as if we’ll have to stay a bit
longer.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right!’
said Anne, and they went on back to the camp. They changed into their
swim-suits in the afternoon and went off to the little pool. It was fairly
deep, very warm and quite clean. They spent a lovely hour swimming and basking
and swimming again - then they reluctantly dressed and began to think of going
off on the long journey to Kirrin Cottage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George’s
mother was very surprised to see the two girls and Timmy. She said yes, of
course, they could have some more food, and sent them to ask Joan for all she
could spare.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘By
the way, I’ve heard from Julian and Dick,’ she said. ‘They’re back from France
- and may be here in a day or two! Shall I tell them to join you or will you
come back here?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Tell
them to come and fetch us as soon as they get here!’ said George, delighted.
Her face shone. Ah - the Five would be together again. How wonderful!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Leave
me directions to give them so that they can find you,’ said her mother. ‘Then
you can all come back - together. The boys can help to carry everything.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
fun, what fun! Julian and Dick again, now things would be exciting, things
would happen, as they always did. What FUN!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was fun to go back to their little camping-place again. It was growing dark, as
they had stayed to have a good meal at Kirrin Cottage, and Timmy had eaten a
most enormous plate of meat, vegetables and gravy. Then he had sat down and
sighed as if to say ‘That was jolly good! I could do with some more!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>However,
nobody took any notice of this, so he trotted off to have a good look round the
garden to make sure it was just the same as when he had left it a day or two
before. Then it was time to start back to the camping-place, and Timmy heard
George’s whistle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
nobody laughed at Timmy this evening!’ said Anne. ‘Not even your father!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
I expect Mother had told him not to,’ said George. ‘Anyway, I said I would stay
away till Tim’s ear is better, and I mean to.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I’m quite willing,’ said Anne. ‘The only thing I’m a bit worried about is - do
you suppose there will be anyone snooping about in that old cottage again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
dreamed it all!’ said George. ‘You admitted you did!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
yes, I did wonder if I had dreamed it,’ said Anne, as they walked up the long
Carters Lane to the moor. ‘But now that it will soon be dark, I’m beginning to
think I didn’t dream it - and it isn’t a very nice feeling.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
don’t be silly!’ said George impatiently. ‘You can’t chop and change about like
that. Anyway, we’ve got Timmy - no one would dare to upset Timmy! Would they,
Tim?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timmy was ahead, hoping against hope that he might for once in a way catch a
rabbit. There were so many about on the common at this time of the evening,
peeping at him here, making fun of him there, and showing their little white
bobtails as soon as he moved in their direction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two girls got safely back to their camp. The tent was still up, their
heather-bed out in the open, covered with the old rug. They put down their
loads thankfully, and went to the little spring for a drink.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
yawned. ‘I’m tired. Let’s get to bed at once, shall we? Or wait - perhaps it
would be a good idea to have a look in at that cottage to make sure no one is
there to disturb us tonight.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no - I don’t want to look,’ said Anne. ‘It’s getting dark now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right - I’ll go with Timmy,’ said George, and off she went. She came back in
about five minutes, her little torch shining in front of her, for it was now
almost dark.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nothing
to report,’ she said. ‘Nothing whatever - except one bat flying round that big
room. Timmy nearly went mad when it flew down and almost touched his nose.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh.
That’s when he barked, I suppose,’ said Anne, who was now curled up on the
heather-bed. ‘I heard him. Come on, George - I’m sleepy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
must just look at Timmy’s ear once more,’ said George and shone her torch on
it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
buck up, then,’ said Anne. ‘That’s about the thousandth time today you’ve
examined it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
does seem much better,’ said George, and she patted Timmy. ‘I shall be glad
when I can take this awful collar off him. I’m sure he hates it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t believe he even notices it now,’ said Anne. ‘George, are you coming or
not? I really can’t keep awake one minute more.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
coming,’ said George. ‘No, Tim - you are not sleeping on our bed. I told you
that last night. There’s hardly enough room for Anne and me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
climbed carefully on to the heather-bed, and lay looking up at the twinkling
stars. ‘I feel happy tonight,’ she said, ‘because Julian and Dick are coming. I
was down in the dumps when I thought they might not be coming at all these
hols. When do you suppose they’ll be here, Anne?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no answer. Anne was asleep. George sighed. She would have liked to plan
what they were going to do when the boys came. Timmy’s ear would surely be all
right in a day or two - and the boys could carry everything back from this
little camp to Kirrin Cottage - and then long days of swimming and boating and
fishing and all kinds of fun could begin - begin - begin - be...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
now George was asleep too! She didn’t feel a small spider running over her
hand, wondering whether or not to spin a web between her finger and thumb. She
didn’t hear the scramble of a hedgehog not far off - though Timmy did and
pricked one ear. It was a very peaceful night indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Next
day the girls were very cheerful. They made a good breakfast of some of the
food they had brought, and then spent some time getting more heather for their
bed, which, under the weight of their two bodies, was now rather flat and
uncomfortable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
for a swim!’ said George. They put on their swim-suits, threw cardigans over
their shoulders and set off to the little pool. On the way they saw Jet, the
little mongrel dog, in the distance, and the boy with him. Jet tore up to them
and danced round Timmy excitedly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy called to them. ‘It’s all right, don’t worry, I’m not going near your
place! I’m still keeping my promise! Jet - come here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls took no notice of the grinning boy, but couldn’t resist patting the
little one-eyed mongrel. Jet really was like a piece of quicksilver, darting in
and out and round about. He shot back to the boy at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls went on to the pool - and stopped in dismay when they came near. Someone
was already there, swimming vigorously!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who
is it?’ said Anne. ‘Dear me, this lonely common seems absolutely crowded with
people!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was staring at the swimmer in utmost amazement. ‘Anne - it’s that boy!’ she
said. ‘Look - tousled hair and everything! But-but...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
we’ve just met him going in the opposite direction!’ said Anne, also amazed.
‘How extraordinary! No, it can’t be the boy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went a little nearer. Yes - it was the boy. He called out to them. ‘I’m just
going out. I shan’t be a minute!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
did you get here?’ shouted George. ‘We never saw you turn back and run.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
been here for about ten minutes,’ shouted back the boy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Fibber!’
yelled back George at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah
- barmy as usual!’ yelled the boy. ‘Same as yesterday!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
got out and walked off, dripping wet, in the direction of the trenches and pits
which he was digging. George looked about for Jet, but she couldn’t see him.
‘Perhaps he’s in the pool too,’ she said. ‘Come on, Anne - let’s swim. I must
say that that boy is extraordinary! I suppose he thinks it’s funny to meet
people, then double back and appear again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
was nicer the first time of all that we saw him,’ said Anne. ‘I liked him then.
I just don’t understand him now. Ooooh - isn’t this water lovely and warm!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had a long swim, got out and basked in the sun, lying on the heather, and then
swam again. Then they began to feel hungry and went back to their little
camping place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
day passed quickly. They saw no more of the puzzling boy, or of Jet. They
occasionally heard the sharp noise of metal on stone, or of chipping, from the
place where the boy was presumably still digging in the old Roman camp.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Or
what he hopes is an old Roman camp,’ said George. ‘Personally I think he’s so
mad that I don’t suppose he would know the difference between a Roman camp and
a Boy Scout’s camp!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
settled down on their heather-bed that night, but saw no stars twinkling above
them this time. Instead there were rather heavy clouds, and it was not nearly
so warm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh
- I hope it’s not going to rain!’ said George. ‘Our tent wouldn’t be much good
against a real downpour! We could squeeze into it all right, but it’s not a
proper waterproof tent. Do you think it’s going to rain, Anne?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said Anne, sleepily. ‘Anyway, I’m not getting up till I have to! I’m tired.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
went to sleep, and so did George. Timmy didn’t, though. He had heard the
far-off growl of thunder, and he was uneasy. Timmy was not afraid of
thunderstorms, but he didn’t like them. They were things that growled like
enormous dogs in the sky, and flashed angrily - but he never could get at them,
or frighten them!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
closed both eyes, and put down one ear, leaving the other one up, listening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
thunder growl came, and one large and heavy drop of rain fell on Timmy’s black
nose. Then another fell on his cardboard collar and made a very loud noise
indeed, startling him. He sat up, growling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
rain came closer, and soon large drops, the size of half-crowns, peppered the
faces of the two sleeping girls. Then came such a crash of thunder that they
both awoke in a fright.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Blow!
It’s a thunderstorm!’ said George. ‘And thunder rain too. We shall be soaked.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Better
get into the tent,’ said Anne, as a flash of lightning forked down the sky and
lighted up everything with a quick brilliance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
good,’ said George. ‘It’s soaked already. There’s nothing for it but to get
into the cottage, Anne. At least we’ll have a roof over our heads or rather, a
ceiling, for the roof’s gone. Come on.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
didn’t in the least want to shelter in the old cottage, but there was
absolutely nothing else to do. The girls grabbed their rug and ran through the
rain, George flashing her torch to guide them. Timmy ran too, barking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came to the doorway of the cottage and went inside. What a relief to get out of
the rain! The two girls huddled down into a corner, the rug round them - but
soon they were too hot and threw it off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
storm passed overhead with a few terrific crashes and much lightning. Gradually
the rain grew less and soon stopped. One star came out, and then others
followed as the thunder-clouds swept away in the wind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
can’t go back to the tent - we’ll have to stay here,’ said George. ‘I’ll go and
get our bags for pillows. We can lie on the rug.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
went with her, and carried a bag back too. Soon the girls were lying in a
corner on the rug, their heads on the bags, and Timmy close beside them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
night,’ said Anne. ‘We’ll try to go to sleep again! Blow that storm!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
they were both asleep - but Timmy wasn’t. Timmy was uneasy. Very uneasy! And
quite suddenly he broke into a volley of such loud barks that both girls woke
up in a panic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy!
What’s the matter? Oh Tim, what is it?’ cried George. She clutched his leather
collar and held on to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
leave us! Timmy, what’s scared you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
stopped barking and tried to get away from George’s hand on his collar. But she
would not let him. George was not easily frightened, but what with the
thunderstorm, the queer old cottage and now Timmy’s sudden excitement, she
wanted him near her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
is it?’ asked Anne, in a scared whisper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know. I can’t even imagine,’ said George, also in a low voice. ‘Perhaps
it’s nothing - just the thunderstorm that has upset him and made him nervous.
We’ll keep awake a bit, and see if we hear anything queer.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
lay quietly in their corner, and George kept a firm hand on Timmy. He growled
once or twice, but did not bark any more. George began to think it really must
have been the storm that had upset him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
rumble of thunder came again - the storm was returning, or else another one was
blowing up!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
felt relieved. ‘It’s all right, Anne. It must have been the thunder and
lightning in the distance that upset Timmy. You’re silly, Timmy - scaring us
like that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Crash
- rumble - crash! Yes, certainly the storm was gathering force again! Timmy
barked angrily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Be
quiet! You make more noise than the thunder!’ said George, crossly. ‘No, you
can’t go out into the rain, Timmy. It’s begun again, as bad as before. You’d
only get dripping wet - and then you’d want to come and sit as close to me as
possible and make me wet too. I know you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
- don’t let him go, George,’ said Anne. ‘I like him here with us. My word -
what a storm! I hope it won’t strike this cottage.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
considering that it must have stood here for three or four hundred years, and
have seen thousands of storms, I expect it will come safely through one more!’
said George. ‘Where are you going, Anne?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Just
to look out of the window,’ said Anne. ‘Or out of the place where the window
used to be! I like to see the countryside suddenly lit up for just one moment
in a lightning flash - and then go back to darkness again.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
went to stand at the window. There came the crash of thunder, not far away, and
a brilliant flash of lightning. Anne stared over the countryside, which had
suddenly become visible in the flash - and then disappeared like magic in a
second!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
gave a sudden cry and stumbled back to George. ‘George - George...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Whatever’s
the matter?’ asked George, alarmed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
someone out there - people!’ said Anne, clutching George and making her jump.
‘I saw them just for an instant, when the lightning flashed.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘People?
What sort of people?’ said George, astonished. ‘How many?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know. It was all so quick. I think there were two - or maybe three. They
were standing some way off - quite still, out there in the storm.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Anne,
those are trees!’ said George, scornfully. ‘There are two or three small trees
standing against the sky out there - I noticed them the other day.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘These
weren’t trees,’ said Anne. ‘I know they weren’t. What are people doing out
there in this storm? I’m frightened.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was absolutely certain that Anne had seen the group of little trees that she
knew were there - they would look just like people, in a quick flash of
lightning. No sooner did you see something in a storm than it was gone!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
comforted Anne. ‘Don’t worry, Anne! It’s the easiest thing in the world to
imagine seeing things in a lightning flash. Timmy would bark if there were
people around. He would...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
he did bark, didn’t he?’ said Anne. ‘He woke us both up with his barking.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah
yes - but that was just because he heard the storm coming up again,’ said
George. ‘And you know he gets angry when he hears the thunder growling.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Just
at that moment the thunder crashed again - then the lightning flashed its weird
and brilliant light.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
time both the girls screamed, and Timmy gave an enormous bark, trying his
hardest to get away from George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There!
Did you see that?’ said Anne, in a shaky voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
Yes, I did. Oh, Anne, you’re right! Someone was looking in at the window! And
if we saw him, he must have seen us! Whatever is he doing here in the middle of
the night?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I told you I saw two or three people,’ said Anne, still shakily. ‘I expect it
was one of them. Maybe they saw the cottage in one of the lightning flashes,
and thought they might shelter here - and sent one of their number to see.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Maybe.
But what in the world is anyone doing, wandering about here at night?’ said
George. ‘They can’t possibly be up to any good. Let’s go home tomorrow, Anne. I
wish the boys were here! They’d know what to do, they would have some good
plan!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
storm’s going off again,’ said Anne. ‘Timmy has stopped barking too, thank
goodness. Don’t let him go, George. You never know - those people, whoever they
are, might do him harm. Anyway, I feel safer when he’s with us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wouldn’t dream of letting him go,’ said George. ‘You’re trembling, Anne! You
needn’t be as scared as that! Timmy won’t let you come to any harm.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
know! But it wasn’t very nice suddenly seeing somebody looking in at the window
like that, outlined in a lightning flash!’ said Anne. ‘I can’t possibly go to
sleep again. Let’s play some silly game to take our minds off it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
they played the Alphabet game with Animals. Each had to think in turn of an
animal beginning with A, and a mark went to the one who could keep it up
longest! Then they went on to B and to C and to D.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were doing the E’s when they heard a loud and very comforting sound.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy’s
snoring,’ said George. ‘He’s fast asleep. What an elephantine snore, Tim!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘E
for elephant,’ said Anne, quickly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Cheat!
That should have been my E!’ said George. ‘All right. E for Eland.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘E
for Egg-Eater,’ said Anne, after a pause.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
allowed - you made that up!’ said George. ‘My mark!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>By
the time they got to M, and Anne was two marks ahead, the dawn was breaking. It
was a great relief to the two girls to see the silvering of the sky in the east
and to know that soon the sun would be up. They immediately felt much better.
George even stood up and went bravely to the window, where there was nothing to
be seen but the quiet countryside outside, with its stretches of heather,
gorse-bushes and silver birches<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
were silly to be so scared,’ said George. ‘I don’t think we’ll go back home
today after all, Anne. I hate running away from anything. The boys would laugh
at us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t care if they do,’ said Anne. ‘I’m going back. If the boys were here, I’d
stay - but goodness knows when they’ll come - it might not be till next week!
I’m just NOT staying here another night.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right, all right,’ said George. ‘Do as you like - but for goodness’ sake tell
the boys it was you who wanted to run away, not me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
will,’ said Anne. ‘Oh dear - now I feel sleepy all over again. I suppose it’s
because daylight is here and everything seems safe, so I know I can fall
asleep.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
felt the same! They cuddled down together on the rug again and immediately feel
asleep, They did not wake till quite late - and even then something woke them,
or they might have slept on for hours, tired out with their broken night and
the fright they had had.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were awakened by something scuttling round them, making a very loud noise
indeed. Then Timmy barked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls awoke and sat up, rather dazed. ‘Oh, it’s Jet!’ said Anne. ‘Jet, have you
come to see if we’re all right, you dear, funny little one-eyed thing!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wuff-wuff!’
said Jet, and rolled over on his back to be tickled, his long thin tail wagging
all the time. Timmy leaped on him and pretended to eat him. Then a loud voice
called to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
looked up. The boy was standing at the door, grinning widely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo,
sleepy-heads! I came to see if you were all right after that awful storm. I
know I promised I wouldn’t come here, but I felt a bit worried about you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh.
Well, that’s nice of you,’ said Anne, getting up and brushing the dust from her
skirt. ‘We’re quite all right - but we had rather a queer night. We...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
got a hard nudge from George and stopped suddenly. George was warning her not
to say anything about the people they had seen - or the person at the window.
Did she think they might have anything to do with this boy? Anne said no more
and George spoke instead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wasn’t
it a dreadful storm? How did you get on?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right. I sleep down in a trench, and the rain can’t get at me. Well - so long!
Come on, Jet!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy and the dog disappeared. ‘That was nice of him,’ said Anne. ‘He doesn’t
seem crazy this morning, does he - quite normal! He didn’t even contradict us.
I think I quite like him after all.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went to their soaked tent and got a tin of sardines out to eat with bread and
butter. Just as they were opening it, they heard someone whistling and looked
up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here
comes that boy again!’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
morning. I don’t want to butt in - but I just wondered if you were all right
after the storm,’ said the boy, without even a smile. The girls stared at him
in amazement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
- don’t start being crazy all over again!’ said George. ‘You know jolly well
we’re all right. We’ve already told you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
haven’t. And I didn’t know!’ said the boy. ‘Well, I only came out of
politeness. Sorry to see you are still balmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
off he went. ‘There!’ said Anne, vexed. ‘Just as we thought he was nice again,
and not crazy, he starts all over again. I suppose he thinks it’s funny. Silly
ass!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
set their things out to dry in the sun, and it was half-past twelve before they
were ready to pack and go back to Kirrin Cottage. George was rather cross about
going, but Anne was quite firm. She was NOT going to spend another night on the
common.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was just strapping a package on her bicycle, when the two girls heard the sound
of voices - and then Timmy went quite mad! He barked wildly, and set off down a
path at top speed, his tail wagging nineteen to the dozen!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh!
It can’t be - surely it can’t be Julian and Dick!’ shouted George, in sudden
delight, and she shot off after Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was! It was Julian and Dick! There they came, packs on their backs, grinning
all over their faces! Hurrah! The Famous Five were all together once more!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was such excitement at the arrival of the boys that at first nobody could make
themselves heard. Timmy barked at the top of his very loud voice and simply
would not stop! George shouted, and Dick and Julian laughed. Anne hugged them,
and felt proud of two such brown, good-looking brothers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ju!
We never guessed you’d come so soon!’ said the delighted George. ‘Gosh, I’m
pleased to see you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
got fed up with French food,’ said Dick. ‘I came out in spots and Julian was
sick, and it was SO hot. Phew! Next time I go there I’ll go when it’s cooler.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
we kept on thinking of Kirrin and the bay, and you two girls and Timmy,’ said
Julian, giving George a friendly punch. ‘I think we really got a bit homesick.
So we packed up before we should, and flew home,’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Flew?’
said George. ‘You lucky things! And then did you come straight down here?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
spent the night with Mother and Dad at home,’ said Julian, ‘and then caught the
first train here that we possibly could this morning - only to find that you
weren’t at Kirrin!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
we packed camping-out things in smaller bags and came straight along to you!’
said Dick. ‘I say, George, old thing, do you think you could possibly make
Timmy stop barking? I’m going a bit deaf!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shut
up, Tim,’ ordered George. ‘Let other people bark a bit. Do you notice his
collar, Julian?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Can’t
help seeing it!’ said Julian. ‘He looks a scream in it, doesn’t he? Ha ha!
You’re an Elizabethan dog with a ruff, Timmy - that’s what Uncle Quentin told
us - and that’s what you look like, old fellow!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
looks most comical, I must say,’ said Dick. ‘Enough to make a cat laugh, hey,
Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
looked at George. Goodness, what would she say to hear Julian and Dick laughing
at Timmy and making fun of him! Would she lose her temper at once?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
George only grinned. In fact she gave a little laugh herself. ‘Yes - he does
look funny, doesn’t he? But he doesn’t mind a bit!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
know, we came here to camp because George couldn’t bear people laughing at ...’
began Anne, thinking that she wouldn’t let George get away with this! But
George gave her such a beseeching look, that she stopped at once. George could
never bear to look small in front of Julian and Dick. She prided herself on
being just like a boy - and she was suddenly certain that her two cousins would
think she was ‘just like a girl’ if they heard of the fuss she had made about
people laughing at Timmy’s collar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say - you two seem to be packing up,’ said Julian, looking at the package
strapped to the back of George’s bicycle. ‘What’s happened?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- it got a bit lonely and Anne was...’ and then in her turn George caught a
beseeching loop from Anne! She knew what it meant ‘I didn’t tell tales of you -
so don’t tell tales of me - don’t say I was scared!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Er
- Anne was certain that there was something queer going on here,’ went on
George, who had quite meant to say that Anne was scared and insisted on going
home. ‘And we didn’t feel that we could tackle it ourselves - though if you had
been here we wouldn’t have dreamed of going home, of course.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
do you mean - something queer?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- you see - it began like this,’ said George, but Julian interrupted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
there’s a tale to tell, let’s have it over a meal, shall we? We’ve had nothing
to eat since six o’clock this morning, Dick and I - and we’re ravenous!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
Good idea,’ said Dick, and began to undo a big package which he took out of his
bag. ‘I’ve a picnic lunch here from your mother, George - a jolly good one, I
can tell you. I think she was so relieved to think that she was going to get
rid of us that she really surpassed herself! We’ve got a marvellous piece of
boiled ham - look! It’ll last us for ages - if we don’t give bits to Timmy. Get
away, Tim. This is not for you! Grrrrrr!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
suddenly felt so happy that she could hardly speak. It had been fun camping
with Anne - but what a difference the boys made! So confident of themselves, so
merry, full of jokes, so idiotic, and yet so dependable. She felt that she
wanted to sing at the top of her voice!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sun had been hot again that morning and had dried the common beautifully. It
wasn’t long before the Five were sitting down in the heather with a very fine
feast before them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wouldn’t sell anyone my hunger for a hundred pounds,’ said Dick. ‘Now then -
who’s going to carve this magnificent piece of gammon?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
were no plates, so they had to make sandwiches of the ham. Dick had actually
brought some mustard, and dabbed it generously over the slices of ham before
George put them between pieces of bread. ‘Aha, Tim - this is one way of making
sure you won’t get even a bite of these wonderful ham sandwiches!’ said Dick.
‘You can’t bear mustard, can you? Ju, where’s the meat we brought for Tim?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here.
Pooh - it smells a bit strong,’ said Julian. ‘Do you mind taking it to a nice
secluded corner, Tim?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
immediately sat down close to Julian. ‘Now - don’t be so disobedient!’ said
Julian, and gave Timmy a friendly push.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
doesn’t understand the word “seclucled”,’ said George, with a grin. ‘Tim - buzz
off a bit!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
understood that and took his meat a little way away. Everyone took a ripe red
tomato, and a little lettuce heart from a damp cloth brought by Julian, and
settled down happily to munch sandwiches.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Lovely!’
said Anne, contentedly. ‘Goodness gracious - I can hardly believe we had such a
peculiar time last night!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah
- tell us all about it!’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
first Anne, then George related all that had happened. Anne told of the night
she had seen a light in the old cottage and had heard whispers and footfalls
inside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
did think I might have been dreaming,’ she said, ‘but now we don’t think I was.
We think I really did see and hear those things.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
next?’ asked Julian, taking his third sandwich. ‘This all sounds most
interesting. Quite Famous Five-ish, in fact!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
told of the storm in the night, and how they had had to leave their heather-bed
and go to shelter in the old cottage - and how, in the flashes of lightning,
Anne had seen two or three people standing outside - and then how they had both
seen someone standing silently, looking in at the window.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Queer,’
said Julian, puzzled. ‘Yes - something is up. I wonder what? I mean - there’s
absolutely nothing on this lonely bit of common that’s at all interesting.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- there are the remains of an old Roman camp,’ said Anne. ‘And a boy there who
is examining them to see if he can find anything old and interesting.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
completely mad boy,’ said George. ‘He doesn’t seem to know what he says or
doesn’t say. Contradicts himself all the time - or, to put it another way,
tells the most idiotic fibs.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
he apparently thinks it’s awfully funny to meet us somewhere, and then double
round on his tracks and appear suddenly somewhere else,’ said Anne. ‘Sometimes
I can’t help liking him - other times he’s too fat-headed for words.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
got a little one-eyed dog called Jet,’ said George, and Timmy gave a sudden
bark as he heard the name. ‘You like Jet, don’t you, Tim'?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
all sounds most interesting,’ said Dick. ‘Pass me the tomato bag, Ju, before
you eat the lot. Thanks. As I said, most interesting - a one-eyed dog, a mad
boy, Roman remains - and people who come to an old ruined cottage in the dead
of night and look into windows!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wonder you two girls didn’t pack up and go home,’ said Julian. ‘You must be
braver without us than I thought possible!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
caught Anne’s eye and grinned mischievously, but said nothing. Anne owned up,
red in the face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- I did tell George I was going home this very morning, I was so scared last
night. George didn’t want to, of course, but she was coming, all the same. But
now you’ve turned up, things are different.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah
- well, do we stay on, or don’t we, Ju?’ said Dick. ‘Are we scared or are we
not?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
laughed. ‘Well - if you go back I shall stay on alone!’ said Anne. ‘Just to show
you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
old Anne!’ said Dick. ‘We all stay, of course. It may be nothing - it may be
something - we can’t tell. But we’ll certainly find out. And the first thing to
do is to have a look at the Roman remains and the mad boy. I’m looking forward
to meeting him, I must say! After that we’ll tackle the ruined cottage!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
came up to see if he could get any tit-bits. Julian waved him away. ‘You smell
of too-strong meat, Timmy,’ he said. ‘Go and get a drink. By the way, is there
anything to drink here, George?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes,’ said George. ‘A lovely spring. Not far off, either. Let’s take the
remains of our meal there, and the mug. We’ve only got one unfortunately, so
it’s no good getting water unless we all sit by the spring and take turns at
the mug. Come on!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys thought that the spring was a really splendid one. They grouped themselves
around it and took turns at filling the mug and drinking from it. They were now
eating slabs of Joan’s fruit-cake and it was very good.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now,
you girls unpack again,’ said Dick, when they had finished their meal.
‘Goodness, I did enjoy that! We’d better unpack too, Julian.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,
Where shall we put our things?’ asked Julian, looking around. ‘I don’t somehow
like to leave everything under that little tent, with a mad boy about, and a
one-eyed dog. I feel that both of them might like the rest of that ham.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
it’s too hot to leave ham out in this sun,’ said George. ‘We’ll have to put it
into the old cottage, on a shelf. We’ll put everything there, shall we? Move in
properly, in case it rains again at night. It’s so tiresome to have to bundle
everything indoors in the dark and the rain.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
agree,’ said Dick. ‘Right. We’ll move into the ruined cottage. What fun! Come
on, everyone!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
spent the next half-hour taking their things into the cottage and putting them
in corners or on shelves. George found a dark corner behind the fireplace where
she put the food, for she was half-afraid that Jet, nice little dog though he
seemed, might perhaps smell the ham and gobble up most of their food.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now!’
said Julian, ‘are we ready to go and see the Roman remains and the Mad Boy?
Here we go, then - the Famous Five are off again, and who knows what will
happen!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Five walked off together, Timmy at the back, delighted to have all his friends
with him again. He kept nudging first one person’s heels and then another, just
to remind them that he was there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
they came near the old camp, they saw a boy sitting beside a bush, reading.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
that boy we told you of!’ said George. ‘See?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
looks fairly ordinary,’ said Dick. ‘Very absorbed in his book, I must say.
Determined to take no notice of us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
speak to him,’ said George. So, as they drew near, she called to the boy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo!
Where’s Jet?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy looked up, annoyed. ‘How do I know?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
he was with you this morning,’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
was not,’ said the boy. ‘He’s never with me! Please don’t disturb me, I’m
reading.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
you are!’ said George to the others. ‘He came to see us this morning with Jet -
and now he says the little dog is never with him. Quite, quite mad!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Or
plain rude,’ said Dick. ‘Not worth bothering about, anyway. Well, if he’s not
doing any excavating in his Roman Camp, perhaps we can explore it without being
ordered off!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
walked on slowly and came to the camp, and at once heard a cheerful whistling
going on, and the sound of someone digging. George looked over the top of the
dug-out trench in surprise. She almost toppled in, she was so amazed at what
she saw!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy was there, digging carefully, whistling as he did so! He brushed his
tousled hair from his hot forehead and caught sight of George and the others.
He looked rather astonished.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
on earth did you get down here so quickly?’ said George. ‘Do you have wings or
something?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
been down here all the afternoon,’ said the boy. ‘For at least an hour, I
should think.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Fibber!’
said George. The boy looked very angry, and shouted back at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
tired of you two girls - and now you’ve brought your friends too, I suppose you
think you can come and aggravate me even more!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
be a fathead,’ said Dick, feeling as puzzled about this boy as George and Anne
had been. How in the world had he run around them and got down in the trench so
quickly? Did he enjoy playing tricks like that? He really didn’t look mad!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
this your property, this old camp?’ asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
Of course not. Don’t be daft!’ said the boy. ‘As if I could own a whole camp
like this! It was discovered by my father some time ago, and he gave me
permission to work here for the hols. It’s pretty exciting, I can tell you. See
my finds?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
pointed to a rough shelf where stood a broken pot, something that looked like
an old brooch, a long pinlike thing, and part of a stone head. Julian was at
once interested. He leapt down into the trench.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say - you’ve certainly got something there!’ he said. ‘Any coins too?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- three,’ said the boy and put his hand in his pocket. ‘I found this one first
- then these two close together yesterday. They must be hundreds and hundreds
of years old.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>By
this time all the others were down in the trench too. They looked about with
much interest. Evidently the place had been well excavated by experts, and now
the boy was working here and there on his own, hoping to find something that
had been overlooked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
went out of the trench and began to clamber about over the great stones and
rocks. A small animal suddenly caught his eye - a young rabbit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
stared at him in fright and then disappeared behind a slab of stone. It peeped
out at Dick again, and he was amused. He went cautiously over to the slab, and
the little rabbit disappeared - but soon two or three whiskers poked out. Dick
got down on hands and knees and looked behind the slab. A dark hole was there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
pulled out his torch and flashed it into the hole, wondering if the small
rabbit was hiding there, or whether it was the entrance to a burrow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
his surprise there was a very big hole indeed - a hole that seemed to go down
and down and down - his torch could make out no bottom to it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
far too wide for a rabbit-hole,’ thought Dick. ‘I wonder where it leads to,
I’ll ask that boy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went back to where the boy was still showing his things to Julian, talking eagerly.
‘I say,’ began Dick, ‘there’s a most interesting hole behind one of the stone
slabs over there - what is it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
that - my father says it was explored and that it was only a place for storages
- meat in hot weather, or loot, or something like that. Actually nothing
whatever was found there - most uninteresting. As a matter of fact it may be
nothing to do with the Camp at all.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say, look - here’s another shelf with things on it,’ said George, suddenly
spying a little collection of things on a rough shelf in another part of the
trench. ‘Are these yours too?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Those?
No,’ said the boy. ‘Nothing to do with me at all. Don’t touch them, please.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Whose
are they then?’ asked George, curiously. The boy took no notice whatever of her
question and went on talking to Julian. George took down a beautiful little
round pot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hey!
I told you NOT to touch those!’ yelled the boy, so suddenly and angrily that
George almost dropped the pot. ‘Put it back - and clear out if you can’t do
what you’re told.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Easy,
old man, easy!’ said Julian. ‘No need to yell at her like that. You scared that
little dog of yours and made him jump almost out of his skin! We’d better go, I
think.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- I don’t like being disturbed too much,’ said the boy. ‘People always seem to
be wandering around. I’ve turned off quite a lot.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘People?’
said Julian, remembering Anne’s story of two or three figures standing outside
the cottage the night before, and of someone looking in. ‘What kind of people?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
- nosey ones - wanting to get down and explore - disturbing me - it’s
surprising how many idiots there are wandering about this lonely place,’ said
the boy, picking up a tool again and setting to work. He grinned suddenly. ‘I
don’t mean you. You really know something about this kind of thing.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Was
anyone about last night?’ asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- I rather think so,’ said the boy. ‘Because Jet here barked like mad. But it
might have been the storm that frightened him - not that he’s usually
frightened of storms.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
your name?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Guy
Lawdler,’ said the boy, and Dick whistled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘My
word - is your father the famous explorer, Sir John Lawdler?’ he asked. The boy
nodded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
no wonder you’re so keen on archaeology!’ said Dick. ‘Your father’s done pretty
well in that line, hasn’t he?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on, Dick!’ said George. ‘Let’s go now. We might have time for a swim in the
pool. We forgot to tell you about that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Dick. ‘Come on, Julian. Good-bye, Guy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
left the rather desolate old camp and went back to the cottage to get their
swim-suits and change. It wasn’t long before they were running over the heather
to the pool.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo
- Guy’s having a swim!’ said Dick, in surprise. Sure enough, a boy was there,
his hair falling over his forehead as usual.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hey,
Guy!’ shouted George. ‘Have a swim with us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the boy was already getting out of the water. Dick shouted. ‘Wait a minute -
don’t go. We’d like to have a swim with you, Guy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy turned defiantly. ‘Don’t be an ass!’ he said. ‘My name’s not Guy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And,
leaving four astonished people behind him, he ran lightly over the heather and
disappeared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
you are - he’s mad after all!’ said Anne. ‘Don’t bother about him. Come on in -
the water’s lovely and warm.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
lazed about afterwards and began to feel hungry. ‘Though how any of us could
feel hungry after eating about fifty sandwiches between us at dinner-time, I
don’t know!’ said Dick. ‘Race you back to the cottage, Ju!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
changed back into ordinary clothes and then had tea - fruit cake, shortbread biscuits,
and tinned pineapple on bread. They kept the juice and diluted it with cold
spring water - it was simply delicious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
let’s explore the cottage,’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
already have, Anne and I,’ said George. ‘So I don’t expect you’ll find anything
much.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went methodically through the old house, and even up the old stone stairway to
the two rooms upstairs - though they could hardly be called rooms, for they had
very little roof and not much wall!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nothing
much here, that’s certain,’ said Dick clattering down the stone stairway. ‘Now
let’s go to the out-buildings - not that there’s much left of them either!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
examined everything, and came last of all to the old stables. It was dark
inside, for the windows were very small, and it was some seconds before anyone
could see properly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Old
mangers,’ said Dick, touching them. ‘I wonder how long ago it is since they
were used - and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say!’ said George, suddenly. ‘There’s something funny here. Anne, look - this
bit of floor was undisturbed yesterday, wasn’t it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
looked down at the big white flagstone on which George was standing. It was
quite obvious that it had been lifted, for the edges were not as green with
moss as the others were, and the stone had been put back a little crookedly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- someone’s been interested in this stone - or in what is beneath it!’ said
Dick. ‘I bet something is buried underneath!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Those
men last night - that’s what they came about!’ said George. ‘They went into
these stables and lifted this stone. Why?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
soon find out!’ said Julian. ‘Come on everyone, loosen it with your fingers -
then we’ll heave it up!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>WHAT

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Forty
fingers and thumbs were very hard at work trying to loosen the heavy stone. At
last Julian got hold of a corner which could be held more easily than any other
part of the stone. He tried to lift it and it came away a little.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Help
me this side, Dick,’ said Julian, and Dick put his strong fingers there too.
‘Heave-ho!’ he said - and up came the stone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
went over with a crash and Timmy barked loudly, jumping aside. Everyone peered
down - and then looked exceedingly disappointed!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was nothing there at all. Not even a hole! The black earth, hard as iron, lay
underneath, and nothing else.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all stared down at the dry, hard earth, puzzled. George looked up at Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- that’s queer, isn’t it? Why should anyone lift up this heavy stone if there
is nothing hidden underneath?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
it’s clear that whoever was here didn’t find anything - nor did he hide
anything either,’ said Julian. ‘Dear me - why should anyone lift up a heavy
stone and put it back - just for nothing?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
was obviously looking for something that wasn’t here,’ said Anne. ‘The wrong
stone, probably!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I think Anne’s right,’ said Dick. ‘It’s the wrong stone! Probably there is
something very interesting under the right stone! But which one is it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all sat and looked at one another, and Timmy saw it too, wondering why all this
fuss was made about a flat white stone. Julian thought hard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘From
what you’ve told me, Anne - about seeing a light in the cottage that first
night you were here - and hearing voices - and then seeing those figures
outside last night in the storm - it looks as if someone is urgently hunting for
something round about here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- something under a stone. Treasure of some sort, do you think?’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
shook his head. ‘No. I hardly think that much treasure would be hidden anywhere
about this old cottage - all the people who lived here must have been fairly
poor. The most they would have hidden would have been a few pieces of gold, and
that would have been found long ago.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- someone modern might have hidden something valuable here - even something
stolen,’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
We can’t tell. It’s obviously important and urgent to somebody,’ said Dick. ‘I
wonder if the people that Guy said came bothering him were anything to do with
this?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
may have been,’ said Julian. ‘But they have clearly decided that what they are
looking for is here now, whatever it is. And they must have been most annoyed
to find you and Anne here last night, George. That’s why someone came and
looked in at the window, I expect - to make sure you were asleep! And you
weren’t.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know whether I want to stay on here or not now,’ said Anne, alarmed. ‘If
they haven’t found what they want, they’ll probably come again - in the night
too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who
cares?’ said Dick. ‘We’ve got Timmy, haven’t we? I’m not turning out of here
because somebody’s got a habit of turning up big stones!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
laughed. ‘Nor am I. Let’s stay on! And I don’t see why we shouldn’t do a bit of
pulling up of stones ourselves! We might come across something very
interesting!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right.
It’s decided that we stay on then, is it?’ said Dick. ‘What about you, Anne?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes - of course I’ll stay,’ said Anne, not wanting to in the least, but knowing
that she simply could not bear not to be with the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Five walked round and about the cottage for a while, trying to make out where
the people that the girls had seen the night before had come from - from what
direction did they come and go?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
figures I saw first in the lightning stood about there,’ said Anne, pointing.
‘Let’s go and see if there are any foot-prints. It was pouring with rain and
the ground must have been very muddy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
idea,’ said Dick, and off they went to where Anne had pointed. But it was a
heathery piece of ground, and difficult to tell even if anyone had trodden
there, for the heather was thick and springy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
look just outside the window now - the one where Anne saw someone looking in,’
said Dick. And there they had a find! Just in front of the window were two
quite deeply-printed foot-marks. One was slightly blurred as if the maker of
them had turned his foot sideways as he waited. The other was very clear
indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
got out a piece of paper. ‘I rather think I’ll measure these,’ he said, ‘and
make a note of the pattern on the soles. They had rubber soles and heels - look
at the markings - crepe rubber I should think.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
measured the prints. ‘Size eight shoes,’ he said. ‘Same as yours, Ju. Then he
carefully drew an exact picture of the sole and heel markings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
quite a detective, Dick,’ said Anne, admiringly, and he laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
anyone can copy foot-prints!’ he said. ‘The thing is to match them up with the
owner!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
have a feeling it’s getting on for supper-time - if anyone wants any supper,’
said George. ‘It’s half-past eight! Would you believe that the time could fly
so fast.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t really feel very hungry,’ said Dick. ‘We’ve done pretty well today.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
don’t waste our precious food if you don’t feel hungry,’ said George. ‘We shall
have to keep going home for more if we eat everything too quickly.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
felt terribly hungry. They made a cosy corner in the cottage and had a slice of
cake and a biscuit each, with a drink of pineapple juice and spring-water.
George had had the bright idea of filling the big empty pineapple tin, and they
each filled a mug from it in turn, and drank.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
getting dark,’ said Julian. ‘Are we going to sleep inside the cottage or out?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘In,’
said Dick, promptly. ‘We’ll make things just as difficult for any
night-prowlers as possible!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Julian. ‘I bet they won’t be pleased to find old Timmy here too. Shall we
go out and get some heather for beds? I don’t fancy sharing a thin rug between
the four of us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
they were all dragging in armfuls of the springy heather. They laid it in the
front room, in two corners, for the boys thought they would rather be in the
same room as the girls, in case of danger.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
need an awful lot of heather to make a soft bed,’ said Dick, trying his. ‘My
bones seem to go right through the clumps and rub against the floor!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
can put our macs over our heather,’ said Julian. ‘That will help. The girls can
have the rug. We shan’t need any covering, it’s so hot.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>By
the time they had finished, it was dark. George lay on her heather and yawned.
‘I’m going to sleep,’ she announced. ‘We don’t need to keep guard or anything
like that do we? Timmy will bark if anyone comes near.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
right. I really don’t think we need take turns at keeping awake,’ said Julian.
‘Move up, Dick - you’ve left me no room.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was the last to go to sleep. He lay awake puzzling over the lifted stone slab.
It was clear that someone had expected to find something under it. How did they
know it was that particular slab? Had they a map? If so, it must have shown the
wrong stone - or perhaps the searchers read the map wrong?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before
he could work it out any further, he was asleep. Timmy was asleep too, happy
because all the others were under his care. He had one ear open as usual, but
not very much open!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was enough to let him hear a small mouse of some kind run across the floor. It
was even enough for him to hear a beetle scraping its way up the wall. After a
while his ear dropped down and he didn’t even hear a hedgehog outside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
something caused his ear to listen again and it pricked up. A noise crept
inside the cottage - a noise that got louder and louder - a weird and puzzling
noise!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
woke up and listened. He pawed at George, not knowing whether to bark or not.
He knew he should not bark at owls, but this was not an owl. Perhaps George
would know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t,
Timmy,’ said George sleepily, but Timmy went on pawing her. Then she too heard
the noise and sat up in a hurry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
a truly horrible sound! It was a whining and a wailing, rising and falling
through the night. A sound of misery and woe, that went on and on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian!
Dick! Wake up!’ called George, her heart beating wildly. ‘Something’s
happening.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys awoke at once and so did Anne. They sat and listened to the weird noise.
What in the world could it be? There it went again - wailing high in the air,
and then dying away with a moan, only to begin again a few seconds later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
felt the roots of his hair pricking. He leapt off the heather-bed and ran to
the window. ‘Quick! Gome and look at this!’ he cried. ‘What is it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all crowded to the window, Timmy barking now as loudly as he could. In silence
the others gazed at a very strange sight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Blue
and green lights were shining here and there, sometimes dimly, sometimes
brightly. A curious round white light was travelling slowly in the air, and
Anne clutched George, breathing fast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
won’t come here,’ she said. ‘It won’t, will it? I don’t like it. What is
happening, Julian?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wish that awful wailing, whining noise would stop,’ said Dick. ‘It gets right
inside my head. Do you make anything of all this, Julian?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Something’s
queer abroad,’ said Julian. ‘I’ll go out with Timmy and see what I can find.’
And before anyone could stop him, out he went, Timmy barking beside him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
Julian - come back!’ called Anne, listening as his footsteps became distant.
They all waited tensely at the window - and then suddenly the wailing noise
stopped and the strange lights began to fade.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
they heard Julian’s footsteps coming back firmly in the darkness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ju!
What was it?’ called Dick, as his brother came in at the doorway.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know Dick,’ said Julian, sounding very puzzled. ‘I simply - don’t - know!
Perhaps we can find out in the morning.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four sat in the dark and talked over the horrible noises and the weird blue and
green and white lights. Anne sat close to Julian. She really was frightened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
want to go back to Kirrin,’ she said. ‘Let’s go tomorrow. I don’t like this.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
didn’t see a thing just now,’ said Julian, puzzled, his arm close round Anne.
‘I seemed to go quite close to those wailing sounds - and then they stopped as
soon as I got fairly near. But although Timmy barked and ran around, there
didn’t seem to be anyone there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Did
you get near the lights?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
fairly near. But the odd thing was that they seemed high up when I got near
them - not near the ground as I expected. And again Timmy couldn’t find anyone.
You would have thought if there was anyone about, playing the fool, that Timmy
would have found them. But he didn’t.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, dolefully. He didn’t like this queer business at all!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
if nobody’s making the noises and lights, it makes it even worse,’ said Anne.
‘Do let’s go home, Julian. Tomorrow.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right,’ said Julian. ‘I don’t feel particularly thrilled about all this myself.
But there is one idea I’ve got in my mind which I’d like to sort out tomorrow.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
that?’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- it may quite well be that somebody very badly wants us out of here for some
reason,’ said Julian. ‘And that somebody may want to come and lift other stones
and have a thorough search all over the place - which he can’t do with us
around. So he’s trying to frighten us out!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- I believe you are right, Julian,’ said Dick. ‘Those noises - and lights -
they would be enough to scare anyone out of a place. Too eerie for words! Well
- let’s have a good snoop round in the daylight, to see if we can find any
trace of a trickster!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
will - but it’s extremely odd that Timmy didn’t find him,’ said Julian. ‘Timmy
can smell anyone out of any hiding-place! Yes - we’ll have a very very good
hunt round tomorrow.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
if you find nothing and nobody, we’ll go home?’ asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
we will. I promise you,’ said Julian, hugging Anne. ‘Don’t worry. You shan’t
have to stay here one night longer, unless you want to! Now - let’s try and go
to sleep again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
took the four a long time to go to sleep after all this excitement in the
middle of the night. Anne kept listening for the wailing noises again, but none
came. She kept her eyes shut tightly in case she should happen to see any more
of the queer lights outside the window.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
and the boys lay awake too, puzzling out the problems of lights and noises
which were not apparently caused by anyone! Julian especially was puzzled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Only
Timmy was unconcerned. He went to sleep before anyone else, though he kept one
ear wide open - and up went the other one when George moved, or Dick whispered
to Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
excitement of the night made them all sleep late.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
awoke first, and stared at the low ceiling in surprise. Now - where was he? In
France? No. Ah, of course he was in the old ruined cottage!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
woke Dick, who yawned and stretched. ‘Remember those queer lights and noises
last night?’ asked Dick. ‘What a fright they gave us! It seems silly to think
we were all so puzzled and scared, now that the sun is shining in at the
window, and we can see the countryside around for miles!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
pretty certain someone is trying to scare us away,’ said Julian. ‘We are in
their way here - they want to do some thorough explorations and they can’t,
because of us! I’ve a good mind to take the girls home, Dick, and come back
here with you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Anne
might go, but George wouldn’t,’ said Dick. ‘You know what old George is - good
as any boy, and as full of courage as any boy, too. Let’s not decide anything
till we have had a look round this morning. I don’t really believe there’s
anything spooky about this at all - I agree with you that it’s just a few
tricks to frighten us away.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Julian. ‘Let’s wake the girls. Hey, George! Anne! Sleepyheads! Get up and
get us breakfast! What are girls for if not to get our meals?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
sat up, looking furious, as Julian intended. ‘You jolly well get your own m...’
she began, and then laughed as she saw Julian’s amused face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
was only just striking a little match to set you alight!’ said Julian. ‘Come on
- let’s all go for a swim in the pool!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
set off together happily in the warm sunshine, Timmy padding along, his tail
waving vigorously. As soon as they got to the pool, they saw the boy there,
floating lazily on his back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
Guy!’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wonder if he will admit to his name or not this morning!’ said George.
‘Remember how he told us his name was Guy - and then said it wasn’t a little
while after? Silly ass! I can’t make out if he’s quite mad, or just thinks its
funny to keep playing the fool!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came to the pool. The boy waved to them, grinning. ‘Come on in - it’s fine!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
your name Guy this morning or not'?’ called George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy looked surprised. ‘Of course it’s Guy!’ he said. ‘Don’t be idiotic! Come on
in and have a game.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had a fine swim and a mad one. Guy was like an eel, swimming under the water,
catching their legs, splashing, swimming away fast, doubling round and going
underwater just as they got up to him!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
last they all sat panting on the edge of the pond, the sun shining down warmly
on them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say, Guy - did you hear anything strange last night?’ asked Dick. ‘Or see
anything'?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
didn’t see anything strange - but I thought I heard somebody wailing and crying
in the distance,’ said Guy. ‘Just now and again when the wind brought the sound
this way. Jet didn’t like it at all - did you, Jet? He went and hid under my
legs!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
heard it too - quite near us,’ said Julian. ‘And saw strange lights.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
discussed the matter for some time, but Guy could not really help them, because
he had not been near enough to the noises to hear them as clearly as the others
had.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
getting hungry,’ said George, at last. ‘I keep thinking of ham and tomatoes and
cheese. Let’s go back to the cottage.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Julian. ‘Good-bye, Guy - see you sometime soon. Good-bye, Jet, you mad
little thing.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went off together, their swim-suits almost dry already in the sun.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
Guy was perfectly sensible this morning,’ said Anne. ‘Funny! I wonder why he’s
so silly sometimes.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘See
- isn’t that him - running down the path there - to the right, look!’ said
George, suddenly. ‘Now how did he get there so quickly? We left him by the
pool!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
certainly looked like Guy! They called to him, but he didn’t even look round or
wave, though he must have heard them. They went on, puzzled. How could one
person be so different each time - and why? What was the point?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had a good breakfast and then went out to look round and see if they could find
anything to explain the strange happenings of the night before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
noises seemed to come from about here, when I came out last night,’ said
Julian, stopping near the little group of trees. ‘And the lights seemed to
start about here too - but not near the ground - they were high up, above my
head.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Above
your head?’ said Dick, puzzled. ‘That seems odd.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
doesn’t!’ said Anne. ‘Not a bit odd! What about those trees there? Couldn’t
somebody climb up them and do the wailing and whining there, with some strange
instrument - and set off the weird lights?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
stared up at the trees and then round at Anne. He grinned suddenly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Anne’s
got it! Clever girl! Of course someone was up there - or maybe two people - one
doing the noises with some weird instrument and the other playing about with
fireworks of some kind. Not the noisy kind - just coloured fire or balloons
lighted up from inside.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes!
That’s why the lights seemed to be so high up, when you came out!’ said Dick.
‘They were sent out by someone up in a tree!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
floated away to scare us,’ said Anne. ‘Golly - I do feel glad that it was silly
tricks like that that frightened us so. They wouldn’t frighten me again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
explains something else too,’ said George. ‘It explains why Timmy didn’t find
anyone! They were safely up trees! I bet they hardly breathed when they knew
Tim was down below.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
Of course! That puzzled me too,’ said Julian. ‘It was too spooky for words when
even old Tim couldn’t find anyone real about - just noises and lights!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here’s
something, look - a wrinkled little rubber-skin - pale green!’ said Dick,
picking something up from the ground. ‘That’s what those lights were - balloons
lighted up from inside in some way and sent floating away in the air.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Most
ingenious,’ said Julian. ‘I expect they had quite a lot of funny tricks at
their disposal last night. Yes - they certainly mean to scare us away!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
they won’t,’ said Anne, unexpectedly. ‘I’m not going, for one. I won’t be
scared away by stupid tricks!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
old Anne!’ said Julian, and clapped her on the back. ‘Right - we’ll all stay -
but I’ve got an idea.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What?’
asked everyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
pretend to go!’ said Julian. ‘We’ll pack up everything - remove our things from
here - and go and camp somewhere else. But Dick and I will hide somewhere here
tonight - and watch to see if anyone comes, and where they look for whatever it
is they’re hunting for, and why!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
a wizard plan,’ said Dick, pleased. ‘We’ll do it! Roll on, tonight! Adventure
is about - and we’ll be ready for it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Five spent quite a pleasant day, but when late afternoon came, they decided
that it was time to carry out their plan and pack as if they were leaving.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
imagine someone is spying on our doings,’ said Dick. ‘And won’t he be pleased
to see us apparently on the point of leaving!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
can anyone be spying?’ asked Anne, looking all round as if she expected to see
someone behind a bush. ‘Timmy would be sure to sniff out anyone in hiding.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
he won’t be near enough for Timmy to smell out,’ said Dick. ‘He’ll be a long
way off.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Then
how can he possibly see us - or know that we’re leaving?’ asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Anne
- I don’t know if you’ve heard of field-glasses,’ began Dick, solemnly. ‘Well,
they’re things that can spot anything half a mile away...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
went red and gave Dick a punch. ‘Don’t be an ass! Of course - that’s it!
Field-glasses used by someone on a hillside somewhere - trained on the old
cottage.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Actually
I think I know where the someone is,’ said Dick. ‘I’ve caught sight of a little
flash every now and again on the hill yonder - the kind of flash that is made
by the sun on glass - and I somehow think that our spy is sitting near the top
of the hill, watching us carefully.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
turned to look at the hill, but Julian at once spoke sharply. ‘No - don’t stand
and stare up there, anyone. We don’t want the watcher to know that we know we
are being watched.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went on with their packing, and soon began to stagger out with their bundles.
George was told to strap her things to her bicycle, and stand well out in the
open as she did so, so that the watcher on the hill would be able to observe
all her doings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was in the midst of carefully folding up his things to go into his knapsack,
when Anne gave a sudden exclamation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Someone’s
coming!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
looked round, imagining that they would see a sinister-looking foreigner, or
someone peculiar in some way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
all they saw was a country-woman hurrying along, a shawl over her head, and a
basket under her arm. She wore cheap glasses, had no make-up on, and her hair
was pulled straight back under the shawl. She stopped when she saw the Five.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
afternoon,’ said Julian, politely. ‘Isn’t it glorious weather!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Beautiful,’
said the woman. ‘Are you camping out - you’ve chosen a good time!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
- actually we’re packing,’ said Julian. ‘We’ve been sleeping in the old
cottage, but we’ve decided to move out. Is it very, very old?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes - and it’s supposed to have queer things happening in it at nights,’ said
the woman.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
know that!’ said Julian. ‘My word - we were pretty scared last night, I can
tell you - weird noises and horrible, ghastly lights. We decided not to stay
there any longer.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
right,’ said the woman. ‘Don’t you stay! You get as far from this place as you
can! I can tell you, I wouldn’t come by it at night. Where are you going?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
our home is at Kirrin,’ said Julian, evading the question. ‘You know - on
Kirrin Bay.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah
yes - a fine place,’ said the woman. ‘Well, don’t you stay another night!
Good-bye!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
hurried off, and was soon lost to sight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Go
on packing,’ said Julian to the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
watcher is still up in the hills. I caught sight of a flash again just then.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian
- why did you tell all that to the woman?’ asked Anne. ‘You don’t usually say
so much when we are in the middle of something queer!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘My
dear, unsuspecting Anne - do you mean to say that you thought that woman was
really what she pretended to be - a woman from a nearby farm?’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- wasn’t she?’ said Anne surprised. ‘She looked like one - no make-up - and
that old shawl - and she knew all about the old cottage!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Anne
- farm-women don’t have gold fillings in their teeth,’ said Julian. ‘Didn’t you
notice them when she smiled?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
her hair was dyed,’ said George. ‘I noticed it was blonde at the roots and
black above.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
what about her hands?’ said Dick. ‘A farmer’s wife does a great deal of hard,
rough work, and her hands are never white and smooth - they are rough and
brown. This woman’s hands were as white as a princess’s!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
yes - I did notice them,’ said Anne. ‘And I did notice too that she sometimes
spoke like a country-woman and sometimes not.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
there you are!’ said Julian. ‘She’s one of the unpleasant gang that tried to
scare us last night - and when the watcher on the hill reported that we
appeared to be packing up and going, she was told to go and make sure. So she
pretended to be a country woman and came by - but unfortunately we weren’t
quite so stupid as she thought we would be!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
certainly stuffed her up well!’ said Dick, with a grin. ‘The gang will be down
here tonight, digging up all the big stones they can find. You and I will have
a marvellous time, snooping round them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’ll
be careful they don’t see you, won’t you?’ said Anne. ‘Where will you hide?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
haven’t planned that yet,’ said Dick. ‘Now - come on and we’ll make a new camp
somewhere that won’t be easily seen. You and George and Timmy can sleep there
tonight, and Ju and I will come and watch here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
want to come too,’ said George at once. ‘Anne will be all right with Timmy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
aren’t joining us this time, George,’ said Ju. ‘The fewer people watching, the
better. Sorry, old thing - but you’ll have to stay with Anne.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
scowled and looked sulky at once. Julian laughed and slapped her on the
shoulder. ‘What a lovely scowl! One of your best! I haven’t seen it for quite a
long time. Keep it up, George - go on, scowl a bit harder, it suits you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
grinned unwillingly, and pulled herself together. She hated being left out of
anything - but she did see that it was no use having a crowd of people watching
that night. All right - she would stay with Anne and keep her company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
seemed as if the watcher on the hills must have gone, because there were no
more sudden flashes such as came when he lifted his field-glasses to watch the
Five.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
disguised country-woman has convinced the watcher that we’re going! Any ideas,
anyone, where we can go? Not too far away - but somewhere where the watcher
can’t follow us with his glasses, if he’s still up there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
know a place,’ said George. ‘There’s a simply colossal gorse-bush on the other side
of the spring. And underneath it is all hollow and dry. It’s almost like a kind
of gorse-cave.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sounds
all right,’ said Julian. ‘Let’s go and find it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
led the way, trying to remember exactly where it was. Timmy followed, still in
his enormous cardboard collar, which was now rather the worse for wear. George
stopped when they had gone a little way past the spring.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
was somewhere here,’ she said. ‘I know I could still hear the sound of the
spring when I found the hollow under the bush. Ah - there’s the bush!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
certainly was a great bush, green and spiky outside, with a few yellow blooms
on it still. Under it was a big hollow place, where the ground was soft and
fine, scattered with dry old prickles.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
main trunk - for it was almost a trunk that supported the big bush - was not
quite in the middle, so there was a good bit of room. Julian caught hold of the
branches that hid the hollow, using a folded sheet of brown paper to hold them
by, for the bush was very prickly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
is fine,’ he said. ‘Plenty of room for you two girls - and Timmy. My word,
he’ll have difficulty with his collar though, won’t he - squeezing in and out!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Take
it off!’ said Dick. ‘His ear really is practically healed now. Even if he
scratches it, he can’t do much damage. Dear old Timmy, we simply shan’t know
you without your collar.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said George. She took a quick look at the ear. It was still covered by a piece
of elastoplast, but it was quite obvious that the ear was healthy. She cut the
thread that bound the two ends of the circular collar - and then bent it so
that it came off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all stared at Timmy, who looked most surprised. He wagged his tail gently as if
to say ‘Well - so you’ve taken off that thing - I wonder why?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
Tim - you look sort of undressed without that collar now!’ said Anne. ‘It is
nice to see you without it, though. Good old Tim! You’ll guard me and George
tonight won’t you? You know that we’re in the Middle of Something again, don’t
you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, wagging his tail violently. ‘Woof!’ Yes - he knew all right!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was getting dark - and under the gorse-bush it was very dark indeed! All the
Five had managed to squeeze in there, and Timmy too. One torch only was allowed
to be used at a time, to save the batteries of the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Five were having supper. The ham was now practically finished, but there were
still a few tomatoes and plenty of cake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
opened the last tin of sardines, and made some sandwiches for himself and Dick
to take with them. He also wrapped up two enormous chunks of cake and pocketed
two slabs of chocolate each.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
shall need something to while away the time when we’re on the watch tonight!’
he said, with a grin. ‘I don’t know if the Weepies and Wailies and Floating
Lights will be along to give us a show - but I fear not. They would be wasted
on an empty cottage!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
do hope you’ll be careful,’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Anne
- that’s the seventh time you’ve said that,’ said Dick. ‘Don’t be an ass. Don’t
you understand that Ju and I are going to enjoy ourselves? You’ll be the one
that has to be careful.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How?’
asked Anne, surprised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- you’ll have to be careful of that big black beetle squatting over there,’
said Dick. ‘And mind that the hedgehog doesn’t sit down on your bare legs. And
be careful in case a snake wants to share this nice safe warm place with
you...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
you’re being an ass!’ said Anne, giving him a punch. ‘When will you be back?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
shall be back at exactly the moment you hear us squeezing under here,’ said
Julian. ‘Now Dick - what about it? I think we might be going, don’t you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Dick, and began to squeeze out carefully so as not to be pricked more than
he could help. ‘Oh - why are gorse bushes so horribly spiteful! Jab jab -
anyone would think the bush was trying to prick me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two girls sat quite still when the boys had gone from the bush. They tried to
hear their footsteps, but they couldn’t. Dick and Julian trod too softly on the
wiry grass.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
do so hope they’ll be...’ began Anne, and George groaned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
you say that again I shall slap you, Anne! Honestly I shall.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wasn’t saying it,’ said Anne, ‘I was only going to say that I hope they’ll be
successful tonight. I’d like to get back to Kirrin and have some fun bathing
and boating, wouldn’t you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
And some of Joan’s marvellous cooking,’ said George. ‘Sausages and mash - and
tomatoes with it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
And fried plaice fresh from the sea with Joan’s best chipped potatoes,’ said
Anne. ‘I can almost smell it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, sniffing hard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There!
He thought I meant it!’ said Anne. ‘Isn’t Timmy clever?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had a pleasant talk about how very very clever Timmy was, and Timmy listened
and wagged his tail so hard that he made quite a dust in the gorse-hollow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
go to sleep,’ said Anne. ‘We can’t talk all night - and keeping awake won’t
help the boys!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
curled up on the rug they had brought and cuddled together - not so much for
warmth, because it was a hot night, but because there was so little room! Anne
put out her torch, and the little place immediately became black and dark.
Timmy put his head on George’s tummy. She groaned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
Tim - be careful, please! I had rather a lot of supper!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
giggled and pulled Timmy’s head close to her. It was comforting to have old
Timmy there. She agreed with George that he was the best dog in the whole
world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wonder what the boys are doing now,’ she said, after a while. ‘Do you suppose
they are in the middle of something exciting? Perhaps they are!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
they weren’t! Julian and Dick were feeling extremely bored at that minute. They
had gone cautiously to the cottage when they had left the girls, not using
their torches at all, for fear of giving anyone warning that they were about.
They had debated beforehand where would be the best place to hide, and had
decided that it would be a good idea to climb up the little stone stair and
hide in the roofless rooms above.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
no roof there - and hardly any walls,’ said Dick. ‘We can peep over any side to
watch - and no one would guess that anyone was above them, spying down! It’s a
good thing it’s such a starry night - once we get used to the dim light, we
shall be able to see fairly well. Pity there’s no moon.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had approached the cottage very cautiously indeed, stopping at every step and
listening with bated breath for any sound. But there was none.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
even the light of somebody’s torch, either,’ said Dick, in Julian’s ear. ‘I
don’t think anyone is here yet. Let’s get into the cottage and up those stairs
as soon as we can.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
tiptoed into the cottage, not daring to put on their torches. They fumbled
across to the little stone stairway, and climbed it with as little sound as
they could. Holding their breath made their hearts thump loudly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Can
you hear my heart thumping?’ Dick whispered to Julian, as they at last stood on
the floor of the roofless rooms above.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
Mine’s just the same, thumping away! Well, we’re safely here. Let’s just
shuffle to and fro and see if there are any loose stones we might fall over,
and so give ourselves away!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
cleared away a few loose stones, and then sat down silently on the low broken
wall of the two ruined rooms. The wind blew gently but warmly. Everything was
still except the rose-rambler climbing over the old house. It moved a little in
the wind and made a faint scraping noise. Dick caught his hand on a thorn, and
sucked his finger. The rambler was everywhere, across the floor, and over the
walls and even up what was left of the little chimney!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys had been there for about three-quarters of an hour when Julian gave Dick a
slight nudge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here
they come!’ he whispered. ‘See - over there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
looked round and about and then caught sight of a small, moving light, just a
prick in the darkness. It cast a faint glow before it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
torch!’ he whispered. ‘And another - and another! Quite a procession! A slow
one, too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
procession made very little noise. It made its way to the cottage, and then
split up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Having
a look to see if we really are gone,’ whispered Julian. ‘Hope they won’t think
of coming up here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
get behind the chimney, in case,’ whispered back Dick. So very quietly they
rose and made their way to where the remains of the chimney stood, a dark
shadow in the starry night. The chimney was quite big, though rather crumbly.
The two boys crouched close to it, on the side farthest from where the stone
stairway came up in the corner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Someone
is coming up!’ whispered Dick, his sharp ears catching the sound of someone’s
feet on the stone stairs. ‘I hope he gets caught by the rambler - there’s a big
spray near the top!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sh!’
said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Someone
came right up the stairway, and gave an exclamation of annoyance near the top.
‘Good!’ thought Dick, ‘he has got caught by the rambler!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
torch shone out over the ruined rooms, the crumbling walls and the remains of
the chimney. The boys held their breath, and stood like statues. The light of
the torch played over the place for one second and then a voice called down the
stairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
one here. The kids have gone. We can get on with the job!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys let out a long breath. Good - they were safe - for the time being at any
rate! The visitors down below were no longer cautious - they spoke in ordinary
voices and torches flashed all over the place. Then someone lighted two
lanterns, and the little cottage shone quite brightly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
do we start?’ said a voice. ‘Here, Jess - where’s that plan?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
got it. I’ll spread it on the floor,’ said a voice that the boys recognized at
once. It was the voice of the ‘country-woman’ who had spoken to them that day!
‘Not that it’s much use. Paul’s no good at drawing!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Evidently
the searchers were now leaning over the plan. Voices came up the stone
stairway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
we know for certain is that we have to find that white stone slab - and we know
the size. But we don’t know the place, except that we think it must be here.
After all - we’ve searched the old Roman camp, and there are no slabs there
that size!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
nudged Dick. So some of the visitors that Guy had complained of must have been
these searchers! Whatever was it they were looking for, hidden behind a slab of
stone?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
knew a minute later! A drawling voice said: ‘If we have to get up every great
slab in this neighbourhood, we will. I’m going to find that secret way if it’s
the last thing I do! If we don’t find that, we don’t find those blue-prints -
and if we don’t find them, we might as well go into the poor-house for the rest
of our lives.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Or
prison!’ said someone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
prison,’ said the drawling voice. ‘It’ll be Paul who goes to prison. He managed
to steal them, we didn’t!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Can’t
you get Paul to draw a better plan than this?’ said the voice of the
‘country-woman’. ‘I can’t understand half that’s written here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
ill - almost off his head, too,’ said someone. ‘No good asking him. He had such
a time escaping with those prints, he nearly died. No good asking him, I say.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can’t make out this word here,’ said the woman. ‘ “W-A-D-E-R” - whatever does
it mean?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know - wait, though, I do! It might be W-A-T-E-R - water. T not D in the
middle. Where’s the well? Anywhere in this kitchen? That’s it, that’s it.
Water! I bet there’s a slab over the well. That’s the way to the secret
hiding-place!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
clutched Dick. He was as excited as the man down below. They listened eagerly,
straining their ears.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here’s
the old sink - and this must be the remains of the pump. The well’s underneath
this slab - and see, the stone is just about the right size. Get busy! Buck up,
get busy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
there came the sound of loud breathing and grunts, as the searchers tried to
prise up the stone by the pump. It was obviously very heavy, and very difficult
to move, for it had become almost part of the floor itself, through the
centuries!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Drat
the thing! It’s tearing my hands to pieces!’ said a voice. ‘Lend me that jemmy,
Tom - you don’t seem to be doing much good with it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
a lot more struggling and panting the stone was loosened. ‘Up she comes!’ said
a voice, and up came the stone so suddenly that it sounded as if most of those
pulling at it had sat down very hard on the floor!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two hidden boys were beside themselves with interest and excitement. How they
wished they could go and watch! But it was impossible. They must just listen
and try to make out what was happening from what the men said below them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
it a well down there? Yes, it is! My, the water’s pretty far down - and black
as pitch too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a silence as the well was examined in the light of torches. Then an
exasperated voice, the one with the drawl, said: ‘This is no secret way! Who’s
going to get through that water! It’s just an ordinary small well, and nothing
else. That word can’t have meant Water.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right, boss. What does it mean then?’ said the woman. ‘I don’t know. This isn’t
a plan, it’s a riddle! Why couldn’t Paul have made it clear where this stone
slab is - he just goes and does a lot of scribble round it - and all we can
make out is that it’s on this common, somewhere near here - and the secret way
is behind the slab!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
all we have to do is to go and look behind dozens of heavy slabs!’ said someone
else. ‘I’m fed up. We’ve lifted slabs in that wretched camp - we’ve lifted some
here - and we still don’t know if we’re anywhere near the right one.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shut
up,’ said the voice of the drawler but now the voice was sharp and angry. ‘If
we have to pull this cottage down, if we have to lift every slab there is, if
we have to take over that camp, I’ll do it! I tell you, this makes all the
difference between wealth and poverty! Anyone who wants to back out can do so -
but he’d better be careful!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
boss, now boss, don’t you fly off the handle!’ said the woman. ‘We’re all in
this! We’ll do all you say. Look, let’s start by lifting a few more slabs.
There are not so very many that are the size that Paul figured on this plan.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
began a boring time for the two hidden boys, as slab after slab was lifted and
put back. Nothing was found under any of them, apparently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
men went to the out-buildings too, leaving the woman in the cottage. The boys
thought she had gone as well, and Julian moved a little, feeling rather cramped
after being still for so long. The woman’s ears must have been sharp for she
called out at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who’s
there? Is it you, Tom?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys stiffened and stood like statues. The woman said no more. It was not long
before the men came back, talking among themselves. It sounded as if there were
three of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
go,’ said the drawler. ‘I think we’ll have to search that camp really well
again.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
going to be difficult with someone already there,’ said the woman.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
deal with him,’ said a voice, grimly. Julian frowned. Did that mean that Guy
was in danger? He had better warn him!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
fed up with this place,’ said the woman. ‘Let’s go. I don’t think the slab is
anywhere here! We’re wasting our time!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
the boys’ great relief, the four searchers left the cottage and went off
together. Julian and Dick leaned over the crumbling wall of the room they stood
in, and watched the lights of the torches and lanterns getting dimmer and
dimmer over the common. Good! Now they could go back to the girls!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
stiff!’ said Dick, stretching himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
Ju - we know a lot more now, don’t we? It’s clear that someone called Paul has
stolen some valuable blue-prints of something - maybe a new plane, or
battleship perhaps - and has hidden them in some secret place he knew of about
here - and to get to it you have to lift a slab of stone of a certain size.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
And we know the size because we’ve already seen the one they lifted in the old
stables,’ said Julian. ‘I vote we go there and measure it - or measure the one
by the sink. I should think that the right slab will be somewhere in the old camp.
We’d better tell Guy and let him into the secret. He’ll help us to search!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
a peculiar business this is to find ourselves mixed up in,’ said Dick. ‘All
because George didn’t like people laughing at old Timmy with a cardboard collar
round his neck! Timmy’s the cause of this!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys went down the stone stairs, and, of course, Dick quite forgot about the
rambler, which caught him neatly round the ankle and almost tripped him
headlong down the stairs!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Blow!’
he said, clutching Julian and nearly making him topple too. ‘Sorry. It was that
rambler again. It’s ripped my ankle all round. Put on the torch for goodness’
sake.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
carefully measured the stone slab by the sink and then made their way out of
the cottage and up towards the spring, hoping that they would find the great
gorse-bush in the dark. They tried to get under the wrong one at first, but at
last found the right one. They heard a small welcome bark from Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh!
Julian! Dick! Is it you?’ said Anne’s voice, as the boys squeezed through into
the hollow middle. ‘Oh, what AGES you’ve been! We haven’t slept a wink. Keep
still, Timmy, do - this place is too small for you to rampage about in!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys settled down and torches were put on. Julian related the curious
happenings to the two interested girls. George was thrilled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
I say! Fancy all this springing up out of the blue so suddenly! What are you
going to do?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Warn
Guy first thing in the morning - and then get in touch with the police, I
think,’ said Julian. ‘We ourselves can’t stop the men searching the camp, and
as soon as they do find the slab they’re looking for, they can easily get what
they want and go off with it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
it’s really thrilling,’ said George. ‘I wish I’d been with you. I’ll never go
to sleep tonight!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
they did manage to drop off to sleep, for they were all very tired. After a few
hours, just as dawn was breaking, Timmy lifted his head and growled. George
awoke at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
is it, Tim? I can’t hear anything.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timmy could, that was certain. George woke Julian, and made him listen to
Timmy’s continuous growling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
do you think he’s growling at?’ she asked. ‘He keeps on and on. I can’t hear a
thing, can you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said Julian, listening. ‘Well, it’s no use my creeping out and going searching
in the dark for whatever Timmy’s growling at. It might be something silly like
a weasel or a hedgehog or a stoat. Shut up, Tim. That’s enough.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Although
it was as dark as night under the thick old gorse-bush, outside it was just
getting light. What was Timmy growling at? Were there people about again? Or
was it just one of the hedgehogs he so heartily disliked?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
stopped growling at last and put his head down on his paws, closing his eyes.
George patted him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
whatever it was, it’s gone. Are you comfy, Julian? It’s very cramped in here -
and hot too, isn’t it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
We’ll get up fairly early and go to warn Guy - then we’ll have a swim,’ said
Julian, yawning. He switched off his torch and went to sleep again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was late when they awoke. Dick was the first, and he looked at his watch. He
gave an exclamation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh!
It’s half past eight! Hey, Ju - Anne - George - wake up, it’s almost
afternoon!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
felt stiff and cramped, and they went off to have a swim and to warn Guy. As
they came near the camp, they stopped in amazement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Someone
was howling down in the trench, howling so miserably and so broken-heartedly
that the Five felt quite panic-stricken. Whatever in the world could have
happened? They ran to the edge of the excavations and looked down into the
trench.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy was there, lying on his face, sobbing. He kept lifting his head and
howling, then putting it down again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Guy!
GUY! Whatever’s happened?’ shouted Julian. He leapt down beside the boy. ‘Are
you hurt'? Is Jet hurt? What’s the matter?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
Guy! He’s gone! They’ve taken him,’ howled the boy. ‘And I was so awful to him.
Now he’s gone. He’ll never come back, I know he won’t!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Guy’s
gone? But - but you’re Guy!’ said Julian in astonishment. ‘What do you mean?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
felt sure that the boy really was mad now - quite mad - talking about himself
like that. He patted him on the shoulder. ‘Look - you’re ill. You come along
with us. You need a doctor.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy sprang to his feet, his face swollen and stained. ‘I’m not ill! I tell you
Guy’s gone. I’m not Guy. He’s my twin. There are two of us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
gasped. It took half a minute to think about this and get everything straight -
and then, of course many things were clear! There was not one mad boy, there
were two ordinary boys - but they were twins! There wasn’t, as they had
thought, just one boy who contradicted himself all the time, who seemed
continually to appear suddenly and unexpectedly, and who was sometimes nice and
sometimes not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Twins!
Why on earth didn’t we think of that before?’ said Julian. ‘We thought there
was only one of you. You were never together.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
We quarrelled - quarrelled bitterly,’ said the boy, tears in his eyes again.
‘And when twins quarrel, really quarrel, it’s worse than any quarrel there is!
We hated one another then - we really did! We wouldn’t be with one another, we
wouldn’t eat together, or dig together, or sleep together. We’ve often
quarrelled before, but not like this - not like this! I just pretended that he
didn’t exist - and he did the same with me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
a to-do!’ said Julian, astonished and worried. ‘Well now - what’s happened to
make you so upset? Tell me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Guy
wanted to be friends with me again last night,’ said the boy. ‘And I wouldn’t.
I hit him and walked away. Then this morning I was sorry and went to find him
and be friends - and - and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
stopped and howled again. Everyone felt very sad and uncomfortable. ‘Go on,
tell us,’ said Julian, gently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
was just in time to see him fighting two men, and screaming at them, and kicking
- then they hustled him away somewhere!’ said the boy. ‘I fell down in the
trench and hurt my leg - and by the time I dragged myself up, Guy had gone -
and so had everyone else!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
turned away and wept again. ‘I’ll never forgive myself, never! If I’d made
friends last night I could have helped him - and I didn’t!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was Anne who comforted the boy. She went to him and pulled him down on a stone
beside her. ‘Let me look at your leg,’ she said. ‘It’s pretty bad, isn’t it?
Look, I’ll bind it up for you. Don’t be so upset - we’ll help you. I think we
know what’s happened, don’t we Julian?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy looked at Anne gratefully, and sniffed hard. When she offered him her
handkerchief, he took it and wiped his face. Dick gave Anne his big hanky to
bind up the boy’s cut and bruised leg. He must have fallen right into the
trench in his fright at seeing his brother fighting and being taken away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
do you know what’s happened?’ he said to Julian. ‘Can you get Guy back? Do say
you can! I’ll never forgive myself for this. My twin-brother - and I wasn’t
there to fight by his side when he needed me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
don’t soak my hanky all over again!’ said Anne. He gave her a forlorn little
smile and turned to Julian again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘My
name’s Harry Lawdler, and Guy and I are mad on old camps and buildings and
things. We spend almost all our holidays together, digging and finding all
kinds of things, like these.’ He nodded his head towards the little shelf of
relics that the four had seen before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- Guy told us,’ said Dick. ‘But he never said a word about you. We were often
very puzzled - we thought you and he were one boy - not two, you see - and we
couldn’t understand a lot of things you both said. You’re so very, very alike.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- I tell you, we each pretended that the other didn’t even exist,’ said Harry.
‘We’re like that. We love each other best in the world, and we hate each other
worse - when we quarrel. We’re simply horrible then!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Can
you tell us a bit about the people that Guy was fighting?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
They were some that came before, wanting Guy to clear out while they had a look
round,’ said Harry, wiping his face again. ‘Guy was pretty rude to them. In
fact I heard him say that if they messed about his camp he would throw stones
at them - he’s like that, you know, very fierce, when he’s roused.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
you think these were the same people?’ said Dick. ‘Which way did they go with
Guy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
way,’ said Harry, pointing. ‘I’ve hunted the whole camp round, but they’re gone
- disappeared into thin air! It’s extraordinary!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
have a hunt round,’ said Julian. ‘We might find something. But I imagine that
the searchers have taken Guy off with them because he knew too much - perhaps
they found here what they were looking for, and saw Guy watching.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh!
Then we’re too late!’ said George, in deep disappointment. ‘They’ve got what
they want - and they’ll disappear now and never be caught. I expect by now they
are speeding away in a fast car - and have taken Guy with them to make sure he
doesn’t talk before they’re safely in another country!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no!’ cried Harry. ‘He’s not kidnapped, is he? Don’t say that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on - let’s have a hunt,’ said Julian, and they all made their way among the
various trenches and pits, looking for they hardly knew what.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
gave it up after a while. There were too many slabs and stones of all sizes!
Besides, what good would it be even if they found the right one? The birds had
flown - presumably with what they had come for! In fact, if Guy hadn’t come
along and seen the searchers, nobody would even have known that they had been
in the camp and made a successful search!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
no good,’ said Julian, at last. ‘This is too big a place to know where to look
for anything that might help us. Let’s go back to the gorse-bush and collect
our things, return to Kirrin and go to the police. It’s the only sensible thing
left to do!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
along, Harry,’ said Anne, to the miserable twin. He was so full of remorse that
her handkerchief was now soaked for the third time! ‘You’d better come with us
and tell all you know.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
come,’ said Harry. ‘I’ll do anything to get Guy back. I’ll never quarrel with
him again. Never. To think that...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
don’t go all through that again,’ said Anne. ‘Look, you’re upsetting Timmy so
much that his tail is down all the time!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Harry
gave another forlorn little smile. They all left the camp and made their way
back to the gorse-bush. It was only when they got there, and began pulling out
the tins of food, as well as the rug and other things, that they realized how
extremely hungry they were!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ve
had no breakfast. We’ve been up for ages, and it’s very late. I’m simply
starving!’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
if we finish up all the food, we shan’t have to carry the tins!’ said Dick.
‘Let’s have a meal. Ten minutes more here can’t make much difference.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were thankful not to have to sit under the gorse-bush again. They sat outside
in the sun, and discussed everything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
believe when Timmy began to growl and growl about six o’clock this morning, it
was because he could hear those people coming quietly by to go to search the
camp,’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think you’re right,’ said Julian. ‘I bet they searched the camp well - till Guy
woke and came on the scene and fought like fury. It’s a pity I didn’t squeeze
out from under the bush and follow them, when Timmy growled.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Anyone
want a drink?’ said George. ‘I’ll go and fetch some water from the spring.
Where’s the pineapple tin?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
passed it to her. George got up and took the little rabbit-path that led to the
spring. She could hear it gurgling and bubbling as she came near - a very
pleasant noise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Water
always sounds nice,’ said George to herself. ‘I love the sound of water.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Water!
Now why did that ring a bell in her mind just then? Who had been talking about
water? Oh - Dick and Julian, of course, when they had come back from the old
cottage last night. They had told Anne and herself about the word on the plan -
the word that might have been WATER, not WADER.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wonder which it was,’ said George to herself as she idly held the pineapple tin
to the gurgling water. She gazed at the beautiful little spring, jutting up
from the stony slabs - and then another bell rang loudly in her mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Stone
slabs! Water! Why - I wonder - I just wonder - if one of these slabs is the
one! This one just here is about the right size!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
stared at it. It was set firmly in a high little bank at the back of the place
where the spring gurgled up and then ran into the clean stony channel. Did it
hide anything behind it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
suddenly dropped the tin and ran back to the others at full speed. ‘Julian!
Julian! I believe I’ve found the slab! It’s been staring us in the face the
whole time!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was very startled. So were the others. They stared up at George in
astonishment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
do you mean, George?’ said Julian, jumping to his feet. ‘Show me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Followed
by everyone, George ran back to the spring. She pointed to the white slab
behind the water. ‘There!’ she said. ‘That’s the right size, isn’t it? And it’s
beside WATER - just as it said in the plan you told us about - only the people
thought it was WADER.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh
- I wonder if you’re right, George,’ said Julian, excited. ‘You might be - you
never know. Sometimes springs come from underground passages - secret, hidden
ways into the earth.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
try and move it,’ said Dick, his face red with sudden excitement. ‘It looks
pretty hefty to me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
began to struggle with the stone, getting extremely wet as they splashed about
in the spring. But nobody minded that. This was too exciting for words. Harry
helped too, heaving and tugging. He was very strong indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
stone slab moved a little. It slid to one side and stuck. More tugging. More
pulling. More panting and puffing!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
believe we’ll have to get help,’ said Julian at last. ‘It really is too heavy
and well-embedded.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
go and get some of my tools,’ said Harry. ‘I’m used to heaving stones about
with them. We can easily move it if we have the right tools.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
flew off at top speed. The others sat down and mopped their streaming
foreheads.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Phew!’
said Julian. ‘What a job this is for a hot day! I’m glad Harry remembered his
tools. Just what we want!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
queer that he and Guy are twins!’ said George. ‘I never even thought of such a
thing!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
they behaved so idiotically,’ said Julian. ‘Always pretending there was just
one of them, and neither of them even mentioning the other. I wonder where Guy
has been taken to. I don’t think he’ll come to much harm - but it will be
worrying to his people.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here
comes Harry,’ said Anne, after a pause. ‘One of us ought to have gone with him
to help him. He’s brought dozens of tools!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
things he had fetched proved very useful indeed, especially a big jemmy-like
tool. The stone soon began to move when this was applied by Julian and Harry!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
slipping - it’s coming away - look out, it will fall right down into the
spring!’ cried Dick. ‘Look out, you girls!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
stone was prised right out, and fell into the stony channel where the water
ran. The five children stared at the opening it left.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
leaned forward and looked into it. ‘Yes - there’s a big hole behind,’ he said.
‘Let me shine my torch in.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
great excitement he flashed his torch into the opening. He turned round, his
face glowing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes!
I think we’ve got it! There’s a tunnel behind, going down and down. It widens
out behind this hole!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
was too thrilled for words. George gave Dick a punch, and Anne patted Timmy so
hard that he whined. Harry beamed round, all his woes forgotten.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
we go down now?’ asked Dick. ‘We’ll have to make the opening a bit wider. Earth
and roots have narrowed it very much. Let’s make it bigger.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Then
we’ll explore it!’ said George, her eyes shining. ‘A secret tunnel only known
to us! Quick - let’s explore it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
the children were so excited that they got into each other’s way. Julian pushed
them back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
be sensible! We can’t all make the opening wider - let Harry and me get at it
with the tools - and we’ll soon make it bigger!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
took only a minute to hack away at the sides of the hole to make it big enough
for even Julian to climb through. He stood there panting, smiling broadly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
- it’s done! I’ll get in first. Everyone got torches? We shall need them! It’s
going to be dark in there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
clambered up and into the hole. He had to crawl on hands and knees for a little
way, and then the hole suddenly went downwards and became considerably bigger.
Julian could walk in it, if he bent down, for at that point the tunnel was
about three feet high.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
called back to the others. ‘Follow me! Take hold of each other’s coats or
jerseys and hang on. It’s as dark as pitch in here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
followed after Julian, then Anne, then Dick, then Harry. Timmy went with
George, of course, pushing and shoving like all the rest. Everyone was excited,
and nobody could talk in a normal voice. They all shouted!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
give you a hand! One good shove and you’re in!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say - isn’t it dark!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
a crawl! I feel like a fox going into its den!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy,
don’t butt me from behind like that! I can’t crawl any faster!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah
- thank goodness I can stand up now! What size of rabbit do you think made this
burrow!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
was made by water at some time perhaps. Don’t shove, Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Water
doesn’t run uphill, ass! Hang on to my coat, Harry. Don’t get left behind.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian,
bent almost double at times, walked carefully along the narrow tunnel, which
went steadily downwards. Soon it widened and became higher, and then it was easier
to walk in comfort.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
you suppose this is the right secret way?’ called George, after a time. ‘We
don’t seem to be getting anywhere.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can’t tell. In fact we shan’t know till we find something hidden somewhere - if
we ever do!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
sudden scuttering noise in front of him made Julian stop suddenly. Immediately
everyone bumped into the one in front, and there were shouts at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
up, Ju?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian’s
torch shone on to two pairs of bright, frightened eyes. He gave a laugh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
all right - just a couple of rabbits using our burrow! There are small holes
running out of the tunnel which, I imagine, are rabbit burrows. I bet we’re
giving the bunnies a shock!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
tunnel wound about a good deal, and then suddenly the rather soft ground they
were treading on turned to rock. The passage was now not so high, and the
children had to bend down again. It was most uncomfortable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
stopped once more. He had heard another sound. What was it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Water!’
he said. ‘There must be an underground stream here! How thrilling! Everyone all
right?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes!’
shouted those behind him. ‘Get on, Julian - let’s see the water!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
tunnel suddenly ended, and Julian found himself in a big cave with a fairly
high roof. Almost in the middle of it ran a stream - not a very big one, and
not a very fast one. It gurgled along in a small channel of rock, which it had
carved out for itself through hundreds of years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
shone his torch on it. The water looked very black and glittered in the light
of the torch. The others came one by one out of the tunnel and stared at the
underground stream. It looked rather mysterious, slipping through the cave,
gurgling quietly as it disappeared through a hole at one end,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Queer,’
said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
not unusual, this,’ began Harry. ‘In some parts of the country round about
here, the ground below our feet is honeycombed with little streams. Some come
up as springs, of course, some join other streams when they come out into the
open, others just run away goodness knows where!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was looking up round the cave. ‘Does our tunnel end here?’ he wondered. ‘Is the
where we have to look for whatever is hidden?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
have a look round the cave and see if there are any exits,’ said Dick. Using
their torches the five separated, Timmy keeping close to George, not seeming in
the least surprised at this underground adventure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
found another tunnel over here, leading out of the cave!’ called Dick. No
sooner had he said that than Anne called out too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
one here as well!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
- which do we take?’ said Julian. ‘How annoying that there should be two!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Would
the fellow - what’s his name - Paul - have marked the correct underground way
on his plan?’ said George. ‘I mean - I don’t see how he could possibly expect
either himself or anyone else to find what he had hidden, if there are numbers
of passages to choose from down here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
right!’ said Julian. ‘Let’s look about and see if we can find anything to help
us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
wasn’t long before Dick gave another shout. ‘It’s all right! This is the
passage to take, over here - the one I found just now. There’s an arrow drawn
in white chalk on the wall.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
crowded over to Dick, stepping across the little stream as they did so. Dick
held his torch up and they all saw the white arrow, drawn roughly on the wall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was pleased. ‘Good. That helps a lot! It shows we’re going the right way - and
that this is the secret way that Paul chose. Come on!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
entered the tunnel, left the little stream behind, and went on again. ‘Anyone
got any idea in which direction we’re going?’ called Dick. ‘East, west, north,
south?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Harry
had a compass. He looked at it. ‘I think we’re going rather in the direction of
the old Roman camp,’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah
- that’s interesting,’ said Julian. ‘This tunnel was probably used in olden
times.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Guy
and I have seen the plan of the camp as it probably used to be,’ said Harry.
‘And there are plenty of tunnels and caves and holes shown on it - just roughed
in, not a proper plan of them. Gosh - I never thought I’d be exploring one! My
father warned me not to, in case of roof-falls and things like that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
tunnel suddenly forked into two. One passage was nice and wide, the other
narrow. Julian took the wide one, thinking that the other was really too narrow
to get through. Rut after a minute of two, he stopped, puzzled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
a blank wall of rock here - the tunnel’s ended! We’ll have to turn back! I
suppose we should have taken that very narrow opening.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went back, Harry leading the way now. Timmy suddenly took it into his head that
he would like to lead, too, and made himself a real nuisance, pushing his way
between everyone’s legs!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came back to the fork. Harry shone his torch in at the second opening, the very
narrow one. There, clearly marked on the right hand wall, was a white arrow in
chalk!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’re
idiots,’ said Dick. ‘We don’t even look for the sign-posts! Lead the way,
Julian!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
tunnel was very narrow indeed, and had rough, jutting rocky sides. There were
loud ‘Aahs!’ and ‘Oohs!’ as elbows and ankles were knocked against hard rock.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then again there came a blank wall of rock in front of Julian, and again he had
to stop!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Can’t
go this way either!’ he said. ‘There’s a blank wall again - this is a blind
alley too!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
were cries of dismay at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Blow!
It can’t be!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
gone wrong! Look all round, Ju - flash your torch down at your feet and above
your head!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
shone his torch over his head, and gave an exclamation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
a hole above my head!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
there a white arrow anywhere?’ called Harry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes!
And it’s pointing up, instead of forwards!’ called back Julian. ‘We’re still
all right - we’ve got to go upwards now - but how?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George,
who was just behind him, shone her torch on the side-walls. ‘Look!’ she said.
‘We can easily get up to the hole. There are rough, natural steps up - made by
ledges of rock. Look, Julian!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Julian. ‘We can manage to get up quite easily, I think. George, you go
first - I’ll give you a boost up.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was delighted to go first. She put her torch between her teeth, and began to
climb up the ledges, Julian pushing her as best he could. She came to the hole
and immediately saw that it would be quite easy to hoist herself through.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘One
more boost and I’ll be through!’ she called to Julian. And with one last heave
George, was up, rolling on the floor of a small cave above! She called down in
excitement to the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
believe this is the place where those things are hidden! I can see something on
a ledge. Oh, do buck up!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others followed eagerly. Dick slipped off the rocky ledges in his excitement
and almost squashed poor Harry as he fell on him. However, everyone was up at
last, even Timmy, who was the most difficult of all to heave through! He seemed
to have far too many vigorous legs!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Harry
found no difficulty at all. ‘I’m used to this kind of thing,’ he said. ‘Guy and
I have explored a whole lot of tunnels and caves in hills and other places.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was pointing her torch at a broad ledge of rock. On it was a brown leather bag,
and beside it, marked on the rock, was a very large arrow indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was overjoyed. He picked up the bag at once. ‘My word - I hope there’s
something in it!’ he said. ‘It feels jolly light - as if it’s empty!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Open
it!’ cried everyone - but Julian couldn’t. It was locked - and alas, there
wasn’t a key!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Its
locked - we can’t open the bag,’ said Julian, and shook it vigorously as if
that might make it fly open and spill whatever contents it had!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
don’t know if it’s got anything of value in it or not,’ said Dick, in deep
disappointment. ‘I mean - it might be some trick on that fellow Paul’s part -
he might have taken the blue-prints, or whatever they were he hid, for himself,
and left the bag just to trick the others.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Can
we cut it open?’ asked George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
I don’t think so. It’s made of really strong leather. We would need a special
knife to cut through it - an ordinary pen-knife wouldn’t be any use,’ said
Julian. ‘I think we’ll just have to assume that we’ve got the goods, and hope
for the best. If they’re not in here, it’s just bad luck. Someone else has got
them, if so.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all looked at the tantalizing bag.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
they would have to wait for ages before they found out whether their efforts
had been successful or not!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- what do we do now?’ said George, feeling suddenly flat. ‘Go back all through
that long tunnel once more? I’ll be glad to be in the open air again, won’t
you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Rather!’
said Julian. ‘Well - I suppose we’d better get down through that hole again.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wait!’
said Anne, her sharp eyes catching sight of something. ‘Look - what does all
this mean?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
shone her torch on to various signs on the wall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Again
there were arrows drawn in white chalk - but, very oddly, a line of them ran
downwards across the wall of the little rocky room, right to the edge of the
hole - and another line of arrows pointing the other way, ran horizontally
across the wall!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- do you suppose that’s just meant to muddle people?’ said Dick, puzzled. ‘We
know jolly well that the way out of this room is down that hole, because that’s
the way we came into it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Perhaps
the other line of arrows means that there’s a second way out,’ suggested
George. They all looked round the little rocky room. There didn’t seem any way
out at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
Timmy?’ said Anne, suddenly, flashing her torch round. ‘He’s not here! Has he
fallen down the hole? I never heard him yelp!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
once there was a great to-do. ‘Timmy, Timmy, Timmy! TIMMY! Where are you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
whistled shrilly, and the noise echoed round and round the little room. Then,
from somewhere, there was a bark. How relieved everyone was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
is he? Where did that bark come from?’ said Dick. ‘It didn’t sound as if it
came from below, down that hole!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
came another welcome bark, and the sound of Timmy’s feet. Then to everyone’s
amazement, he appeared in the little rocky room as if by magic - appearing
straight out of the wall, it seemed!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy!
Where were you? Where have you come from!’ cried George, and ran to see. She
came to a standstill and exclaimed loudly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh!
What idiots we are! Why, just behind this big jutting-out piece of rock,
there’s another passage!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
there was! A very, very narrow one, it is true - and completely hidden from the
children because of tlie enormous slab of rock that jutted out from the wall
and hid it! They stood and stared at it, shining their torches on the narrow
way. The arrows ran round the wall to it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
never even looked properly!’ said Dick. ‘Still - it’s a passage that would be
extremely dificult to spot - hidden round the corner of that rock - and very
narrow at that. Well, I do know one thing for certain about that man called
Paul!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What?’
asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
thin - thin as a rake!’ said Dick. ‘No one but a skinny fellow could squeeze
through this opening! I doubt if you can, Julian - you’re the biggest of us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
what about trying'?’ said George. ‘What does everyone say? This might be an
easier, shorter way out - or it might be a harder, longer one.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
won’t be longer,’ said Harry. ‘By my reckoning we must be pretty well near the
Camp now. It’s likely that the way leads straight there - though where it comes
out I can’t imagine. Guy and I have explored the Camp pretty thoroughly.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
suddenly thought of something he hid noticed at the Camp - the big hole behind
the slab of stone, where he had seen the baby rabbit a day or two before! What
had Guy said about that? He had said there was a great hole underground, which
had been explored - but that it was probably just an ancient storage place for
food or for loot! He turned eagerly to Harry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Harry
- would this lead to that enormous hole underground - the one that Guy once
told me had been explored, but was of no interest - probably just an old store-place'?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let
me see,’ said Harry. ‘Yes - yes, it might lead to that. Most of these
underground ways are throughways - ways that lead from one place to another.
They don’t as a rule stop suddenly, but have usually been of use as secret
escape-routes or something of that kind. I think you may be right, Dick - we’re
fairly near the Camp, I’m sure, and we may quite well find that if we go on,
instead of going back, we shall come into the Camp itself - probably through
that great hole!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Then
come on,’ said Julian. ‘It will certainly be a shorter way!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
tried to squeeze through the narrow opening that led out of the little rocky
room. Dick got through all right, and so did the others - but poor Julian found
it very very dificult and almost gave up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
shouldn’t eat so much,’ said Dick, unkindly. ‘Go on - one more try, Ju - I’ll
haul on your arm at the same time!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
got through, groaning. ‘I’m squashed flat!’ he said. ‘Now, if anyone makes any
more jokes about too much breakfast, I’ll pull his nose!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
passage grew wider immediately, and everyone was thankful. It ran fairly
straight, and then went steeply downwards, so that the five slithered about,
and Timmy found himself suddenly running. Then it came to a stop - a complete
stop! This time it was not a blank wall of rock that faced them - it was
something else.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
roof-fall!’ groaned Dick. ‘Look at that! Now we’re done!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
certainly looked most formidable. Earth, rocks and stones had fallen from the
roof and blocked up the whole passage-way. There was no use in going on - they
would just have to turn and go back!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Blow
it!’ said Dick, and kicked at the mass of earth. ‘Well - there’s no use staying
here - we’d better turn back. My torch isn’t too good now, and neither is
yours, George. We don’t want to lose any time - if our torches give out, we
shall find things very difficult.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
turned to go back, feeling very despondent. ‘Come on, Timmy!’ said George. But
Timmy didn’t come. He stood beside the roof-fall, looking very puzzled, his ears
cocked and his head on one side. Then he suddenly gave a sharp bark.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
made everyone jump almost out of their skins, for the sound echoed round and
about in a very queer way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t,
Timmy!’ said George, almost angrily. ‘Whatever’s the matter? Come along!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timmy didn’t come. He began to paw at the pile of earth and rocks in front of
him, and barked without stopping. Wuff-wuff-wuff-wuff-wuff-WUFF!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
up?’ said Julian, startled. ‘Timmy, what on earth’s the matter?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
took absolutely no notice, but went on feverishly scraping at the roof-fall,
sending earth and stones flying all over the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
something he wants to get at - something behind this roof-fall,’ said Dick. ‘Or
perhaps somebody - make him stop barking, George, and we’ll listen ourselves
and see if we can hear anything.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
silenced Timmy with difficulty, and made him stand quiet and still. Then they
all listened intently - and a sound came at once to their ears.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yap-yap-wuff-wuff-wuff!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
Jet!’ yelled Harry, making everyone jump violently again. ‘Jet! Then Guy must
be with him. He never leaves Guy! What’s Guy doing here? He may be hurt. GUY!
GUY! Jet!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
began to bark wildly again and to scrape more furiously than ever. Julian
shouted to the others above the barking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
we can hear Jet barking, this roof-fall can’t be very big. We’d better try and
get through it. Two of us can work in turn with Timmy. We can’t all work at
once, the passage is too narrow.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
began some very hard work - but it didn’t last as long as Julian feared,
because, quite suddenly, the mass of rubble and rock shifted as they worked,
and a gap appeared at the top of the heap, between it and the roof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
began to scramble up, but Julian called to him at once. ‘Be careful, ass! The
roof can’t be too good here - it may come down again, and you’ll be buried. Go
carefully!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
before Dick could go any further, a little figure appeared on the top of the
rubble above their heads, and slid down to them yapping loudly, and waving a long
wiry tail!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Jet!
Oh, Jet! Where’s Guy?’ cried Harry, as the little dog leapt into his arms and
licked his face lavishly, barking joyfully in between the licks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘GUY!’
yelled Julian. ‘Are you there?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
weak voice came back. ‘Yes! Who’s that?’ An absolute volley of voices anwered
him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
us! And Harry! We’re coming to you, we shan’t be long!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
it wasn’t long, either, before the roof-fall was slowly and carefully climbed
by each one - though Timmy, of course, scrambled up, over and down at top speed!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
the other side of the roof-fall was a passage, of course, the continuation of
the one the children had come along. Guy was there, sitting down, looking very
pale. Jet flung himself on him and licked him as if he hadn’t seen him for a
month, instead of just a minute or two before!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo!’
said Guy, in a small voice. ‘I’m all right. It’s just my ankle, that’s all. I’m
jolly glad to...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
before he could say a word more, Harry was beside him, his arms round him, his
voice choking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Guy!
Oh, Guy! I’ve been a beast, I wouldn’t be friends! What happened to you? Are
you really all right? Oh Guy, we are friends again, aren’t we?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
out Harry, old son,’ said Julian gently. ‘He’s fainted. Now just let’s be
sensible and everything will come all right. Flap your hanky at him, Dick, and
give him a little air. It’s only the excitement!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
half a minute Guy opened his eyes and smiled weakly. ‘Sorry!’ he said. ‘I’m all
right now. I only hope this isn’t a dream, and that you really are here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
bet we are!’ said Dick. ‘Have a bit of chocolate, then you’ll know we’re real!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
idea!’ said Julian. ‘We’ll all have some - and I’ve some biscuits in my pocket
too. We’ll eat and talk - and we’ll make plans at the same time. Catch, Guy -
here’s a biscuit!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Eighteen<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THE
WAY OUT<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Guy
soon told his story. It was much as the others had imagined.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
was fast asleep this morning, with Jet curled up to me,’ he said. ‘He began to
bark and I wondered why, so I got up to see - and I saw four people in the
camp.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
four we know!’ said Dick, and Julian nodded. ‘Go on, Guy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
were looking all over the place,’ said Guy, ‘prising up rocks, messing about -
so I yelled at them. But they only laughed. Then one of the men, who was trying
to prise up a slab - the slab that covers that great hole underground, Harry -
you remember it? - well, this man gave a yell and said ‘I’ve got it! This is
the way in - down here, behind this slab!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Guy
stopped, looking very angry. Jet licked him comfortably. ‘Well,’ he went on, ‘I
set Jet on them, and they kicked him cruelly - so I went for them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
a plucky one, aren’t you!’ said Dick, admiringly. ‘Did you knock them all out,
by any chance?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
Of course not,’ said Guy. ‘One of the men pretty well knocked me out though. He
hit me on the head and I went down, dazed. I heard him say “drat this kid -
he’ll be fetching help, and we shan’t be able to get down and hunt for the
goods.” And then another man said “We’ll take him with us then,” and they got
hold of me and dragged me through the opening.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
how did they get down into that great hole?’ said Harry in wonder. ‘There is
such a steep drop into it. You need a rope.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
they had a rope all right,’ said Guy, munching his biscuit and chocolate and looking
decidedly better. ‘One of the men had one tied round and round his waist. They
knotted it fast round a rock - that big one we can’t move, Harry - and then
they swung down on it. All except the woman. She said she’d stay at the top and
keep watch. She hid behind a bush some way off.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
never saw her when I came along!’ said Harry. ‘I never thought of looking
there! What about you? Did you get down too?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I screamed and shouted and kicked and howled, but it wasn’t a bit of good. They
made me swing down the rope - and I fell off half-way down and hurt my ankle. I
howled at the top of my voice for help, and they hurried me along with them,
shaking me like a rat.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
beasts!’ said Harry, fervently. ‘Oh, the beasts!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
heard one of them say that there should be a tunnel out of the hole somewhere,
it was marked on Paul’s plan - whatever that may be - and then I think I must
have fainted - the pain of my ankle, you know. And when I came to myself again,
we were all here, the three men and I - beside this roof-fall - though I really
don’t know how we got here. They must have dragged me along with them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
that’s all, is it?’ asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
quite. They were furious when they saw the roof-fall, but as soon as they began
to scrabble in it a rock rolled down and hit one of the men quite a crack - and
after that they were afraid to do anything. They stood and talked for a bit -
and then they decided to go and get some tools, and come down again to see if
they could remove all this stuff and get through it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
gracious!’ said Julian, startled. ‘Then they may be back at any moment?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
suppose so. They left me here because they couldn’t think of anything else to
do with me! They knew I couldn’t walk, because of my ankle. I think it’s
broken. So of course, I couldn’t possibly find my way out myself! And here I’ve
been waiting for those brutes to come back, and to hack through the rubble to
go after whatever it is they want!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
began to feel rather uncomfortable at the thought that three violent men might
be appearing at any moment. ‘Is it very far to the opening you came down?’
asked Julian. But Guy didn’t know. He had fainted, as he had said, and he
didn’t even know what way they had come.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
can’t be far,’ said Harry. ‘I think it would be worth while trying to find the
opening, see if the men have left the ropes there, and get out that way. If
Guy’s ankle really is broken, he couldn’t possibly manage to go back the long
way we’ve come.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
That’s true,’ said Julian, thoughtfully. ‘Well, that’s what we’ll do then. But
we’ll go jolly cautiously, without a sound, because it might be just our luck
to meet those fellows on their way back here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shall
we start?’ said George. ‘What about Guy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
knelt down beside the boy, and gently examined his ankle. ‘I’ve done my First
Aid Training, like everybody else!’ he said. ‘And I ought to know if his ankle
is broken or just sprained.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
examined the swollen ankle carefully. ‘It’s not broken. I believe I could
bandage it tightly with a couple of large hankies. Give me yours, Dick.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others watched admiringly as Julian deftly and confidently bandaged Guy’s
swollen ankle. ‘There!’ he said. ‘You can perhaps hobble on it now, Guy. It may
hurt, but I don’t think it will damage it. Try. You’ll have to go barefoot
because your ankle is too swollen for your shoe to go on.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Very
gingerly Guy stood up, helped by Harry. He tried his hurt foot, and it
certainly seemed all right to hobble on, though it was very painful. He grinned
round at the others’ anxious faces.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
fine!’ he said. ‘Come on, let’s go! We don’t want to bump into those fellows if
we can help it. Thank goodness we’ve got Jet and Timmy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
set off down the passage, flashing their torches in front as usual, to show
them the way. The tunnel was quite wide and high here, and in a very short time
came out into an enormous pit underground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah
- this is the hole I saw down behind the slab where the rabbit went,’ said
Dick. ‘We weren’t very far from the camp, as we thought. I’m surprised that
when this pit was explored, the underground passages were not discovered, Guy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
expect the men exploring it came to the roof-fall and thought there was nothing
beyond,’ said Guy. ‘Or maybe they were afraid of going further in case of
further falls. They can be very dangerous, you know. Many a man has been buried
under one and never heard of again.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
looked round the enormous hole - it was really a huge round pit. Daylight
showed in the roof at one place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
the opening into it,’ said Guy, eagerly. ‘The one I came through, on the rope.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
limped a few steps forward to look for the rope. Harry held him by the arm,
thankful that the ankle was holding up so well. Guy pointed upwards.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I can see the rope. The men have left it there, thank goodness. They must have
been certain that I couldn’t get to it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
rope hung down from the little opening high above their heads. Julian looked
round at Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Can
you manage to climb up the rope, Anne?’ he said, doubtfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course!’ said Anne, scornfully. ‘We do rope-climbing in the gym at school often
enough. Don’t we, George?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- but our gym rope is a bit thicker!’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
go up first,’ said Harry. ‘We’ve got a much thicker rope, Guy and I, that we
use when we want to haul on very heavy stones. I’ll find it, and let it down.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- we can’t afford to waste any time, in case those fellows come back,’ said
Julian. ‘I daresay the girls can manage all right. George, you go up first.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
went up like a monkey, hand over hand, her legs twisted round the rope. She
grinned down when she got to the top.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Easy!’
she said. ‘Come on up next, Anne, and show the boys how to do it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before
the boys could leap to the rope, Anne was on it, pulling herself up lithely.
Julian laughed. He called up to George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George!
You might have a squint round and see if there’s any sign of people about. If
they were going to borrow Guy’s tools, they would have been back long ago, so I
think probably they’ve had to go to Kirrin or some farm-house to borrow them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
wouldn’t get my tools!’ said Guy, ‘or Harry’s. We had them stolen once, and now
we always hide them where no one can possibly find them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
settles it then,’ said Julian. ‘They’ve had to go a good way, I expect, to get
satisfactory tools to tackle that roof-fall. They probably imagine that it’s a
pretty big fall! All the same, keep a watch out, George, till we’re all up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was difficult to get Guy up, for he was feeling weak, but they managed it at
last. The two dogs had to have the boys’ shirts tied round them so that the
rope would not cut them when they were hauled up. They didn’t seem to mind at
all. Timmy was very heavy to pull up because he appeared to think that he had
to try and make his legs do a running action all the time - just to help! All
that happened was that he began to spin round and round, as he went up!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
was up in the open air at last, hot and perspiring. Julian had the precious bag
safely under his arm. Timmy sat down panting. Then he suddenly stopped panting
and pricked up his ears.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
he said warningly, and stood up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Quiet,
Tim, quiet, Jet,’ said Julian, at once aware that somebody must be about.
‘Hide, everyone - quickly. It may be those fellows coming back!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wuff,’
began Jet, but Guy stopped him immediately. The six children separated and went
into hiding at once, each choosing the best place he or she could see. There
were plenty of hiding-places in the old camp!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
heard voices coming near. Nobody dared to peep out and see who was coming - but
Julian and Dick recognized the drawling voice of one of the men!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
a time we’ve been!’ said the man. ‘Just chuck the spades and things down the
hole - then we’ll all climb down again. Buck up! We’ve wasted too much time
already. Anyone might come on the scene at any moment!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
spades and jemmies went hurtling down the hole. Then one by one the men went
down the rope. The children could not hear the woman’s voice. They thought she
must have been left behind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
gave a low whistle and all the others popped up their heads. ‘We’ll spring for
it!’ said Julian. ‘Buck up!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all shot out of their hiding-places at once and made off - except Julian. He
stayed behind for a minute or two. What could he be doing?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was doing something very simple indeed! He was hauling up the rope that dangled
underground! He slipped it off the rock that held it and tied it round his
waist, looking suddenly very bulky.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
grinned a very wide grin and went after the others. How very, very angry those
men were going to be!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
ran after the others. ‘What were you doing?’ said George. ‘Calling rude names
down to the men?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
I hope they’ll go and dig for hours if they want to!’ said Julian. ‘They’ll
soon find that when they’ve got through it, that roof-fall is nothing much, and
they’ll go on till they come to the little room - and what they’ll say when
they find that the bag is gone, I really don’t know!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wish I could be there!’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
are we going to do about Guy?’ asked Harry. ‘He really can’t walk very far on
that bad foot.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
he can walk as far as the gorse-bush where we’ve left our things, I’ve got a
bike there,’ said George. ‘He could pedal with one foot, I should think.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes - I could easily do that,’ said Guy, pleased. He had dreaded the thought of
having to walk all the way to Kirrin - but neither did he want to be left
behind!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
limped along, helped by Harry, who couldn’t do enough for him. Jet ran along
beside them, excited and happy at being with so many people. Timmy sometimes
wuffed a little bark to him, which made Jet as proud as punch. He thought the
big Timmy was wonderful!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came to the gorse-bush, and found their things all safe. The bicycle was there,
with its packages strapped to it. George unstrapped them, meaning to carry them
herself, so that Guy would not have too heavy a weight to pedal with his one
foot. They all started off together, Guy riding ahead on the bicycle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
will go to Kirrin, dump our things at the cottage, and get Aunt Fanny to ring
the police and ask them if they’ll come along and collect this bag from us,’
said Julian. ‘I don’t want to leave it at the police station - I want to see it
opened in front of us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
do hope it won’t be empty,’ said Anne ‘It does feel terribly light!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
It does,’ said Julian, swinging it to and fro. ‘I can’t help fearing that Paul,
who drew the plan that the men found so difficult to understand, may have
double-crossed his friends - drawn a deliberately difficult plan - and then
left the bag quite empty in the place he marked on the plan! It would be the
kind of hoax that a trickster loves to play - and would give him time to get
away in safety.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
they said he was ill,’ said Dick. ‘Still - perhaps he might have been
pretending that too! It’s a mystery!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
are you getting on, Guy?’ called Anne, as they overtook the boy. He kept riding
on by himself for a little way, and then resting, waiting for them to catch up
with him before he pedalled on again with his one good foot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Very
well indeed, thank you,’ said Guy. ‘This bike was a very good idea of yours.
What a blessing you had it with you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Your
foot doesn’t seem any more swollen,’ said Anne. ‘I expect you’ll be able to
walk on it properly in a day or two. Oh, dear - it does make me laugh when I
think how puzzled we all were when we thought there was just one of you, not
twins!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
met first one of you, then the other, and thought you were the same boy,’ said
George, with a chuckle. ‘We were absolutely wild with you sometimes, you seemed
so mad and contradictory!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
remind us of it,’ said Harry. ‘I can’t bear thinking that if I’d only been with
Guy, all this trouble of his would never have happened.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
well - it’s an ill wind that blows nobody any good!’ said George. ‘The bad and
the good have fitted together very well this time, and made a most exciting
adventure!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here’s
Carters Lane at last,’ said Anne. ‘What a long walk it seemed over the common.
It will be much easier for you to ride that bike when you’re on a proper road,
Guy. It won’t go bumping over heather clumps now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went down the long lane and came into Kirrin at last, realizing that they were
all very hungry indeed. ‘It must be well past dinner-time,’ said George,
looking at her watch. ‘Good gracious - it’s a quarter to two! Would you believe
it! I hope there’s some dinner left over for us - Mother doesn’t know we’re
coming.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
raid Joan’s larder!’ said Dick. ‘She never minds so long as she’s there to grumble
at us while we do it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went in at the gate of Kirrin Cottage and up to the front door, which was open.
George shouted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mother!
Where are you? We’ve come back!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
answered. George yelled again. ‘Mother! We’ve come home!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
door of the study opened and her father looked out, red in the face and
frowning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George!
How many times am I to tell you not to shout when I’m working? Oh, my goodness
me, who are all these?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo,
Father!’ said George, mildly. ‘Surely you know Anne and Julian and Dick! Don’t
say you’ve forgotten them already!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course not! But who are these?’ and George’s father pointed to the startled
twins. ‘They’re as like as peas. Where did they come from? I haven’t seen them
before, have I?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
Father. They’re just friends of ours,’ said George. ‘Where’s Mother? We’ve just
had an adventure and we want to tell her. Oh, and we want to ring the police -
and I think we ought to get a doctor to see to Guy’s foot - and Father, look,
Timmy’s ear is healed!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Bless
us all! There’s never any peace when you are about, George,’ said her father,
groaning. ‘Your mother’s at the bottom of the garden, picking raspberries - or
it might have been strawberries.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no, Father - it’s August, not June!’ said George. ‘You always...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
thought he had better get his uncle safely back in his study before a row blew
up between him and George. Uncle Quentin did not like being disturbed in his
complicated work!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
go and find Aunt Fanny,’ he said, ‘we can tell her everything out in the
garden. Come on!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wuff-wuff!’
said Jet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
gracious - that’s not another dog, is it?’ said George’s father, scowling. ‘How
many times have I said that...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
won’t disturb you any more, Uncle,’ said Julian, hurriedly, seeing Guy’s scared
face. ‘We’ll go and find Aunt Fanny.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went thankfully out in the garden, hearing the house echo to the slam of
Uncle Quentin’s study door. George shouted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mother!
Where are you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shut
up, George - we don’t want to make your father leap out of the window after
us!’ said Dick. ‘Ah - there’s Aunt Fanny!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
aunt was very surprised to see him and the others advancing on her. She went to
greet them, a basket of raspberries on her arm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well!
I thought you wanted to stay away for longer than this!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
did - but an adventure descended on us!’ said Dick. ‘We’ll tell you all about
it in detail later on, Aunt Fanny.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
just now we want two things - can we ring the police - or will you - and ask
them to come here?’ said Julian, very grown-up all of a sudden. ‘There’s
something that might be very important for them to know. And also do you think
we should let a doctor see Guy’s foot - he’s sprained his ankle, I think?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
dear!’ said Aunt Fanny, distressed to see the boy’s swollen foot. ‘Yes - he
ought to have that seen to properly. Who is he? Dear me - there’s another of
them! Aren’t they alike?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Twins,’
said George. ‘I don’t know how I shall be able to tell one from t’other when
Guy’s bad foot is better.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
going to ring the police,’ said Julian, seeing that his aunt could now only
think of Guy’s swollen foot. He went off indoors, and they heard him speaking
on the telephone. He put it down and came out again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
Inspector himself is coming,’ said Julian. ‘Shall I ring the doctor now, Aunt
Fanny?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes. His number is 042,’ said his aunt. ‘How did you get such an ankle, Guy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mother,
you don’t seem at all interested in our adventure,’ complained George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
I am, dear,’ said her mother. ‘But you do have such a lot, you know. What have
you been up to this time?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
before George could do more than begin, a black police car drew up at the front
gate, and the inspector of police got out and marched up to the front door. He
knocked extremely loudly on the knocker.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Which,
of course, had the immediate result of bringing George’s father hotfoot out of
his study in another rage! He flung open the front door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hammering
at the door like what! What’s the matter? I’ve a good mind to report you to the
police! Oh - er - h’m - good afternoon, Inspector. Do come in. Are we expecting
you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Smiling
broadly, the Inspector came in. By this time Julian had come back in the house
again, and greeted him. His uncle went back into his study, rather red in the
face, and actually closed the door quietly!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
wanted me to come along at once, because of something important?’ said the
Inspector. ‘What is it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others came into the room now, with Julian’s aunt behind them. Julian nodded
round at them. ‘They’re all in this, sir - except my aunt, of course. We’ve
brought something we think may be important, sir. Quite a lot of people were
looking for it - but we managed to get hold of it first!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
put the brown bag on the table. The Inspector’s eyes went to it at once. ‘What
is it? What’s inside? Stolen goods?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
sir - blue-prints of some kind, I think. But I don’t know what of, of course.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Open
the bag, my boy! I’ll examine them,’ said the Inspector.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can’t open it,’ said Julian. ‘It’s locked - and there’s no key!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- we’ll soon manage that!’ said the Inspector, and took out a small,
strong-looking tool. He forced the lock, and the bag opened. Everyone leaned
forward eagerly, even Timmy. What was in the bag?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was nothing there! Absolutely nothing! Julian groaned in bitter disappointment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
wonder it felt so light. It’s empty after all. Would you believe it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Twenty<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THE
ADVENTURE ENDS - AS IT BEGAN!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was a moment of great disappointment for all the children. Although they had
talked about the possibility of the bag being empty, everyone had secretly felt
certain that something exciting would be inside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Inspector was astonished. He looked round sharply. ‘Where did you get this bag?
What made you think it had stolen goods inside - and what kind of blue-prints
were they?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
sir - it’s rather a long story,’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
afraid you’ll have to tell it to me,’ said the Inspector, taking out his
notebook. ‘Now - how did this all begin?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- it really began with Timmy hurting his ear and having to wear a cardboard
collar,’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Inspector looked most surprised. He turned to Julian. ‘You’d better tell it,’
he said. ‘I don’t want to waste time on cardboard collars!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
went red and put on a scowl. Julian grinned at her, and began the story, making
it as clear and short as he could.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Inspector became more and more interested. He laughed when Julian came to the
weird noises and lights.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
certainly wanted to get rid of you,’ he said. ‘You were plucky to stay on. Go
on - there’s something behind all this, that’s certain!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
jotted down the name of ‘Paul’, and ‘Jess’, the name of the woman. He noted
that one man had a drawl. ‘Any other clues to them?’ he asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Only
this, sir,’ said Julian and handed his drawing of the crepe-soled shoe to the
Inspector. This was carefully folded and put into the notebook too. ‘Might be
of use. Might not,’ said the Inspector. ‘You never know!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
listened intently to the tale of the underground passages, and picked up the
bag again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can’t understand why it’s empty,’ he said. ‘It isn’t really like a crook
deliberately to mislead his friends when they know quite well where he is and
can get at him whenever they like.’ He shook the bag hard. Then he began to
examine it very very carefully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Finally
he took out a sharp knife and gently slit the lining at the bottom of the bag.
He turned it back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Something
was there - under the lining! Something blue, folded very carefully. Something
covered with thousands of minute figures, thousands of lines, thousands of queer
little designs!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wheeeeeew!’
whistled the Inspector. ‘So the bag’s not empty, after all! Now what is this?
It’s a blue-print of some project - but what?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘My
father would know!’ said George, at once. ‘He’s a scientist, you know,
Inspector - one of the cleverest in the world. Shall I get him?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said the Inspector, laying out the blue-print on the table. ‘Get him at once.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
flew off and returned with her father, who didn’t look very pleased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
afternoon, sir, once more. Sorry to disturb you,’ said the Inspector. ‘But do
you happen to know whether this document is of any importance?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George’s
father took it up. He ran his eyes over it, and then gave a loud exclamation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
- why - no, it’s IMPOSSIBLE! Good heavens, it’s - no, no, it can’t be! Am I
dreaming?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
gazed at him, surprised and anxious. What did he mean? What could it be, this
blue-print?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Er
- it’s important then, sir?’ said the Inspector.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Important?
IMPORTANT? My dear fellow, there are only two of these prints in existence -
and at the moment I have the second one, which I am checking very carefully
indeed. Where did this come from? Why - I simply can’t believe it! Sir James
Lawton-Harrison has the other. There isn’t a third!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
- but - there must be if you have one here and Sir James has the other!’ said
the Inspector. ‘It’s obvious there is a third!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
wrong. It isn’t obvious!’ shouted George’s father. ‘What is obvious is that Sir
James hasn’t got his! I’ll ring him up - this very minute. Astounding! Most
disturbing! Bless us all, what will happen next?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children did not dare to say a word. They were full of astonishment. To think
that the blue-print was so important - and that George’s father actually had a
pair to this one. What was its importance?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
heard George’s father shouting into the telephone, evidently angry and
disturbed. He slammed it down and came back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
Sir James’s copy has been stolen - but it’s been kept very hush-hush because of
its importance. Good heavens - they never even let me know! And to think I
spilt a bottle of ink over mine yesterday - gross carelessness. Stolen! A thing
like that - stolen out of his safe under his very nose. Now there’s only one
copy left!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Two,
sir,’ said the Inspector, tapping the copy on the table. ‘You’re so upset to
hear that Sir James’s copy has gone that you’ve forgotten we have it here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Bless
us all! Thank goodness! Yes, I had forgotten for the moment!’ said Uncle
Quentin. ‘My word, I even forgot to tell Sir James it was here.’ He leapt up to
go to the telephone again, but the Inspector caught his arm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
sir. Don’t telephone again. I think we should keep this as quiet as possible.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Father
- what is this a blue-print of?’ said George, voicing the thoughts of everyone
there, the Inspector included.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
blue-print? I’m certainly not going to tell you!’ said her father. ‘It’s too
big a thing even to speak of to you children - or the Inspector either for that
matter. It’s one of the biggest secrets we have. Here, give it to me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Inspector placed his big hand on it at once. ‘No, sir. I think I must take it
with me, and send a secret messenger to Sir James with it. It wouldn’t do to
have the only two copies in one place. Why, your house might catch fire and
both prints might go up in flames!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Take
it, then, take it! We can’t possibly risk such a thing!’ said George’s father.
He glared round at the children. ‘I still don’t understand how you came to
possess it!’ he said, looking suddenly amazed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sit
down, sir, won’t you, and listen to their tale,’ said the Inspector. ‘They’ve
done very well. They haven’t finished their story.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
went on with it. The Inspector sat up straight when he heard where the the
three men were - down in the great pit below the Roman camp.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
saw them go down into that pit?’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Watched
them swing down on the rope? They may be there now!’ He glanced at his watch.
‘No, they won’t. They’ll be gone.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
groaned loudly. ‘And to think we might easily have caught three clever rogues.
They’ve slipped through our hands again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
haven’t!’ said Julian, his voice rising exultantly. ‘They’re still there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
do you know?’ said the Inspector.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Because
I pulled up their rope and took it away - look, I’ve got it round me!’ said
Julian. ‘They can’t get out without a rope - and they won’t know how to escape
any other way. They’re still there - waiting for you, Inspector!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Inspector slapped the table so hard that everyone jumped and the two dogs
barked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
work!’ he boomed. ‘Magnificent! I must go at once and send some men out there.
I’ll let you know what happens!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
out he went at a run, the precious blue-print buttoned safely in his pocket. He
leapt into the driving-seat and the police-car roared away at top speed down
the lane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Whew!’
said Julian, flopping back into his chair. ‘It’s too exciting for words!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
felt the same, and began to talk at the tops of their voices. Poor Aunt Fanny
couldn’t make herself heard. But when Joan came in and asked if anyone wanted
anything to eat, they heard her at once!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
doctor came to see Guy’s foot, and re-bandaged it. ‘Rest it for a day or two,’
he said. ‘It will soon be all right.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you’ll have to stay here with George and the others, Guy,’ said George’s
mother. ‘You can’t go excavating in that camp of yours again yet. Harry can
stay too. So can Jet.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
twins beamed. They liked this jolly family, and the adventurous life they
seemed to lead. It would be fun to stay with them for a while. They thought it
would be even more fun, when Joan arrived with a truly wonderful meal!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Home-made
veal-and-ham-pie! Stuffed tomatoes! And what a salad - what’s in it, Joan?
Radishes, cucumber, carrot, beetroot, hard boiled eggs, tomatoes, peas - Joan,
you’re a marvel! What is the pudding?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
they were all sitting down enjoying themselves, and talking over their
adventure. Just as they were finishing, the telephone bell rang. Julian went to
answer it. He came back looking thrilled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
was the Inspector. They’ve got all three men! When they got to the pit, one of
the men called up for help - said some idiot of a boy or some hoaxer must have
taken their rope away. So the police - all in plain-clothes, so that of course
the three men suspected nothing - the police let down a rope, and up came the
men one by one...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
were arrested as soon as they popped out of the hole, I suppose!’ said George,
delighted. ‘Oh, I wish I’d been there! What a joke!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
Inspector’s awfully pleased with us,’ said Julian. ‘And so is Sir James
Lawton-Harrison too, apparently. We’re to get a reward - very hush-hush,
though. We mustn’t say anything about it. There’s to be something for each of
us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
for Timmy too?’ said George at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
looked round at Timmy. ‘Well, I can see what old Timmy ought to ask for,’ he
said. ‘A new cardboard collar. He’s scratching his ear to bits!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
screamed and rushed to bend over Timmy. She lifted a woebegone face. ‘Yes! He’s
scratched so hard he’s made his ear bad again. Oh Timmy! You really are a
fatheaded dog! Mother! Mother! Timmy’s messed up his ear again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Her
mother looked into the room. ‘Oh George, what a pity! I told you not to take
off that collar till his ear was absolutely healed!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
maddening!’ said George. ‘Now everyone will laugh at him again.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no they won’t,’ said Julian, and he smiled at George’s scowling face. ‘Cheer up
- it’s a very peculiar thing, George - this adventure began with Timmy and a
cardboard collar - and bless me if it hasn’t ended with Timmy and a cardboard
collar. Three cheers for old Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yes
- three cheers for old Timmy! Get your ear well before the next adventure, Tim
- you really can’t wear a cardboard collar again!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
