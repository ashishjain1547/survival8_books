breakfast, and looking very interested. What had Uncle Quentin done now? Julian
winked at Dick, and Anne kicked George under the table. Would Uncle Quentin

which his wife had just given back to him after she had read it. It was the
letter that was causing all the trouble, Uncle Quentin frowned — and then
decided not to explode. Instead he spoke quite mildly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

expected to remember exactly when the children's holidays come, and if they are
going to be here with us or with your sister? You know I have my scientific
work to do — and very important it is too, at the moment. I can't remember when
the children's schools break up or go back!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

exasperated. 'Really, Quentin — have you forgotten how we discussed having
Julian, Dick and Anne here these Easter holidays because they all enjoy Kirrin
and the sea so much at this time of the year? You said you would arrange to go
off to your conferences after they had had their holidays — not in the very
middle of them!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

Quentin. 'I didn't know they were going to do that.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Well, but you know Easter came late this
year, so they broke up late,' said Aunt Fanny, with a sigh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Father wouldn't think of that,' said
George. 'What's the matter, Mother? Does Father want to go away in the middle
of our holidays, or what?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Yes,' said Aunt Fanny, and she stretched
out her hand for the letter again. 'Let me see — he would have to go off in two
days' time — and I must certainly go with him. I can't possibly leave you
children alone here, with nobody in the house. If Joanna were not ill it would
be all right — but she won't be back for a week or two.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Joanna was the cook. The children were all
very fond of her, and had been sorry to find her missing when they had arrived
for the holidays.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'We can look after ourselves,' said Dick.
'Anne is quite a good little cook.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'I can help too,' said George. Her real name
was <st1:place w:st="on">Georgina</st1:place>, but everyone called her George.
Her mother smiled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Oh George — last time you boiled an egg you
left it in the saucepan till it boiled dry! I don't think the others would like
your cooking very much.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'It was just that I forgot the egg was
there,' said George. 'I went to fetch the clock to tune it, and on the way I
remembered Timmy hadn't had his dinner, and . . .'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Yes, we know all about that,' said her
mother with a laugh. 'Timmy had his dinner, but your father had to go without
his tea!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Woof,' said Timmy from under the table,
hearing his name mentioned. He licked George's foot just to remind her he was
there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Well, let's get back to the subject,' said
Uncle Quentin, impatiently. 'I've got to go to these conferences, that's
certain. I've to read some important papers there. You needn't come with me,
Fanny — you can stay and look after the children.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Mother doesn't need to,' said George. 'We
can do something we badly wanted to do, but thought we'd have to put off till
the summer hols.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Oh yes,' said Anne, at once. 'So we could!
Do let's!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Yes — I'd like that too,' said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Well — what is it?' asked Aunt Fanny. 'I'm
quite in the dark. If it's anything dangerous, I shall say no. So make up your
minds about that!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'When do we ever do anything dangerous?'
cried George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Plenty of times,' said her mother. 'Now,
what's this plan of yours?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'It's nothing much,' said Julian. 'It's only
that all our bikes happen to be in first-class order, Aunt Fanny, and you know
you gave us two small tents for Christmas — so we just thought it would be
great fun sometime to go off on our bikes, taking our tents with us — and do a
little exploring round the countryside.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'It's grand weather now — we could have fine
fun,' said Dick. 'After all, you must have meant us to use the tents, Aunt
Fanny! Here's our chance!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'I meant you to use them in the garden, or
on the beach,' said Aunt Fanny. 'Last time you went camping you had Mr Luffy
with you to look after you. I don't think I like the idea of you going off by
yourselves with tents.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Oh, Fanny, if Julian can't look after the
others he must be a pretty feeble specimen,' said her husband, sounding
impatient. 'Let them go! I'd bank on Julian any time to keep the others in
order and see they were all safe and sound.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Thanks, Uncle,' said Julian, who was not
used to compliments from his Uncle Quentin! He glanced round at the other
children and grinned. 'Of course, it's easy to manage this little lot — though
Anne sometimes is very difficult!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Anne opened her mouth indignantly. She was
the smallest and the only really manageable one. She caught Julian's grin — he
was teasing her, of course. She grinned back. 'I promise to be easy to manage,'
she said in an innocent voice to her Uncle Quentin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>He looked surprised. 'Well, I must say I
should have thought that George was the only difficult one to . . .' he began,
but stopped when he saw his wife's warning frown. George was difficult, but it
didn't make her any less difficult if that fact was pointed out!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Quentin, you never know when Julian is
pulling your leg or not, do you?' said his wife. 'Well — if you really think
Julian can be put in charge — and we can let them go off on a cycling tour —
with their new tents . . .'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Hurray! It's settled then!' yelled George,
and began to thump Dick on the back in joy. 'We'll go off tomorrow. We'll . .
.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'GEORGE! There's no need to shout and thump
like that,' said her mother. 'You know your father doesn't like it — and now
you've excited Timmy too. Lie down, Timmy — there he's off round the room like
a mad thing!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Uncle Quentin got up to go. He didn't like
it when meal-times turned into pandemonium. He almost fell over the excited
Timmy, and disappeared thankfully out of the room. What a household it was when
the four children and the dog were there!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Oh Aunt Fanny — can we really go off
tomorrow?' asked Anne, her eyes shining. 'It is such lovely April weather —
honestly it's as hot as July. We hardly need to take any thick clothes with
us.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Well, if you think that, you won't go,'
said Aunt Fanny, firmly. 'It may be hot and sunny today — but you can never
trust April to be the same two days together. It may be pouring tomorrow, and
snowing on the next day! I shall have to give you money, Julian, so that you
can go to an hotel any night the weather is bad.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

you want to do while we are away,' said Aunt Fanny. 'Dear me — I've been
married all these years to Quentin — and still he makes this kind of muddle

and do your own, Anne — tuck in every corner, smooth the pillow, pat the
eiderdown — do what you like with your own bed, but leave me to make mine my
own way! Wait till we're off on our biking tour — you won't want to bother
about beds then — you'll roll up your sleeping-bag and that will be that!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the cover all crooked, and stuffing his pyjamas under the pillow. Anne laughed
and went to make her own. She was excited too. The days stretched before her,
sunny, full of strange places, unknown woods, big and little hills, chattering
streams, wayside picnics, biking in the moonlight — did Dick really mean that?

into rucksacks the things they would need, folding up the tents into as small a

were, barking and thumping his tail, and generally getting into everyone's way
all day long. But nobody minded. Timmy was one of them, one of the 'Five', he
could do almost everything but speak — it was quite unthinkable to go anywhere

get back to it! However, he waited politely for the children to make
last-minute adjustments, and then they were ready.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

began to feel wet with perspiration. They had sweaters on and they took them
off, stuffing them in their baskets. George looked more like a boy than ever,
with her short curly hair blown up by the wind. All of them wore shorts and
thin jerseys except Julian, who had on jeans. He rolled up the sleeves of his
jersey, and the others did the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

George always thought it was marvellous the way he could be asleep with one ear

them. A small robin hopped near inquisitively, and, with his head on one side,
considered whether or not it would be a good thing to pull a few hairs out of
Timmy's tail to line his new nest. The slit in Timmy's awake-eye widened a
little — woe betide the robin if he tried any funny tricks on Timmy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

have tea somewhere when we feel like it — and then do a bit of shopping for our
supper and breakfast — and then hunt about for a really good place to put up
our tents for the night. I found a little lake on the map, and I thought we

ask permission, and join us later. We'll wait for you; at least we'll wait for
ten minutes, at Croker's Corner. If you don't turn up we'll know you didn't get

In about fifteen minutes they were ready to set off. They had planned where to
stop to buy food for their lunch, and although the journey to Middlecombe Woods
was a longer trip than they had made the day before, they felt able to cope
with more miles on the second day. Timmy was eager to set off too. He was a big
dog, and enjoyed all the exercise he was getting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

indignantly, and then stopped as she saw Dick's grin. He was pulling her leg as

ahead, pleased. They came to a lane and rode down it, avoiding the ruts. They
came out into a road. It was not a main road, for the children didn't like
those; they were too full of traffic and dust. They liked the shady lanes or
the country roads where they met only a few carts or a farmer's car.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

keep trying to ride three abreast, and Julian had to warn him that cyclists

he came up against old Julian!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

country now, with villages few and far between. A farm here and there showed up
on the hillsides, with cows and sheep and fowls. It was a peaceful, quiet

above, patched with great white cotton-wool clouds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the sunny side of a hedge, looking downhill into a small valley. Sheep and
lambs were in the field they sat in. The lambs were very inquisitive, and one came
right up to Anne and bleated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

quite unafraid, and one even tried to put its little front legs up on to
George's shoulders! That was too much for Timmy! He gave such a sudden, fierce
growl that all the lambs shot off at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lime-juice and ginger-beer. The sun was very hot. Soon they would all be burnt
brown — and it was only April. How marvellous! Julian thought lazily that they
were really lucky to have such weather — it would be awful to have to bike
along all day in the pouring rain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

raspberry, and strawberry, and a selection of home-made buns that made the

minutes they all rode off again. They wanted to get to Middlecombe Woods fairly
soon, because there were no villages between Great Giddings and Middlecombe, so
they would have to find the woods and then go on to find a farm-house somewhere
to buy food for supper and breakfast. They hadn't been able to buy any in the
shops at Great Giddings because it was early closing day, and they hadn't liked
to ask the tea-shop woman to sell them anything. They felt they had taken quite
enough of her food already!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

middle of a bush. You never knew when a tramp might be about, watching to steal
something! It didn't matter when Timmy was there, because he would growl if a
tramp came within a mile of them. Dick called out that he would mend his
puncture now. He had found the hole already, where a small nail had gone in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

must do something, even if it was only looking at a map. Julian produced the
map and unfolded it. He and the girls bent over it, by the light of the bicycle
lamp, and Richard peered over their shoulders. Even Timmy tried to look,
forcing his head under their arms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

anywhere,' said Anne. She switched off her lamp too. She glanced down at Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

said, which made Richard give a sudden giggle. Julian smiled. It was nice to

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

aren't they?' said Richard. 'I say — what about that food, Julian?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Right,' said Julian, and he fished in his
basket. But it was very difficult to get it out with one hand, and try to hand
it to the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Better stop for a few minutes, after all,'
he said at last. 'I've already dropped a hard-boiled egg, I think! Come on —
let's stack our bikes by the side of the road for three minutes, and gulp down
something just to satisfy us for now.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Richard was only too pleased. The girls were
so hungry that they too thought it a good idea. They leapt off their bicycles
in the moonlit road and went to the little copse at the side. It was a
pine-copse, and the ground below was littered with dry brown pine-needles.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

Julian. 'I say — what's that over there?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Everyone looked. 'It's a tumbledown hut or
something,' said George, and she went nearer to see. 'Yes, that's all — some
old cottage fallen to bits. There's only part of the walls left. Rather an
eerie little place.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>They went to sit down under the pine-trees.
Julian shared out the food. Timmy got his bit too, though not so much as he
would have liked! They sat there in the pine shadows, munching hungrily as fast
as they could.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'I say — can anyone hear what I hear?' said
Julian, raising his head. 'It sounds like a car!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>They all listened. Julian was right. A car
was purring silently through the countryside! What a bit of luck!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'If only it comes this way!' said Julian.
'We could stop it and ask it for help. It could take us to the nearest
police-station at any rate!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>They left their food in the little copse and
went to the roadside. They could see no head-lights shining anywhere, but they
could still hear the noise of the car.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Very quiet engine,' said Julian. 'Probably
a powerful car. It hasn't got its head-lights on because of the bright
moonlight.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'It's coming nearer,' said George. 'It's
coming down this lane. Yes — it is!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>So it was. The noise of the engine came
nearer, and nearer. The children got ready to leap out into the road to stop
the car.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>And then the noise of the engine died away
suddenly. The moon shone down on a big streamlined car that had stopped a
little way down the lane. It had no lights at all, not even side-lights. Julian
put out his hand to stop the others from rushing into the road and shouting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Wait,' he said. 'This is just a bit —
queer!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>They waited, keeping in the shadows. The car
had stopped not far from the tumbledown hut. A door opened on the off-side. A
man got out and rushed across the road to the shadow of the hedge there. He
seemed to be carrying a bundle of some kind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>A low whistle sounded. The call of an owl
came back. 'An answering signal!' thought Julian, intensely curious about all
this. 'I wonder what's happening?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Keep absolutely quiet,' he breathed to the
others. 'George, look after Timmy — don't let him growl.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>But Timmy knew when he had to be quiet. He
didn't even give a whine. He stood like a statue, ears pricked, eyes watching
the lane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Nothing happened for a while. Julian moved
very cautiously to the shelter of another tree, from where he could see better.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>He could see the tumbledown shack. He saw a
shadow moving towards it from some trees beyond. He saw a man waiting — the man
from the car probably. Who were they? What in the world could they be doing
here at this time of night?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The man from the trees came at last to the
man from the car. There was a rapid interchange of words, but Julian could not
hear what they were. He was sure that the men had no idea at all that he and
the other children were near. He cautiously crept to yet another tree, and
peered from the shadows to try and see what was happening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Don't be long,' he heard one man say.
'Don't bring your things to the car. Stuff them down the well.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Julian could not see properly what the man
was doing, but he thought he must be changing his clothes. Yes — now he was
putting on the others — probably from the bundle the first man had brought from
the car. Julian was more and more curious. What a queer business! Who was the
second man? A refugee? A spy?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The man who had changed his clothes now
picked up his discarded ones and went to the back of the shack. He came back
without them, and followed the first man across the lane to the waiting car.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Even before the door had closed, the engine
was purring, and the car was away! It passed by the pine-copse where the
children were watching, and they all shrank back as it raced by. Before it had
gone very far it was travelling very fast indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Julian joined the others. Well — what do you
make of all that?' he said. 'Funny business, isn't it? I watched a man changing
his clothes — goodness knows why. He's left them somewhere at the back of the
shack — down a well, I think I heard them say. Shall we see?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>They made their way to the ruined shack, and
pushed through overgrown weeds and bushes into the backyard. There was a
broken-down well there, most of its brickwork missing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>It was covered by an old wooden lid. Julian
removed it. It was still heavy, though rotten with age. He peered down the
well, but there was nothing at all to be seen. It was far too deep to see to
the bottom by the light of a bicycle lamp.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

the map,' said Julian. 'No — somehow I don't think the man was an escaped

supplied with clothes — or perhaps a deserter from the army. That's even more
likely!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

chimneys like that,' said Julian. He paused and took a good look. 'It must be a
big place. We ought to come to a drive or something soon.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

Gradually the house came into view. It was more like a mansion, and in the

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

thankfully. He was tired of pushing his bicycle up the hill. 'They're shut.

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

opening? Not for them, that was certain!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Then they heard the sound of a car in the
distance. Of course, that was what the gates were opening for. The car,
however, was not coming up the hill — it was coming down the drive on the other
side of the gates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'I think it must be done by machinery,'
whispered back Julian. 'Probably worked from the house. Let's go back and see
if we can find any machinery that works them.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

them. But there was none.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

It was quite impossible to open them. They had been shut and locked by some

machinery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

We're as much prisoners here as Dick is, if he's here too. We can't get out
through the gates — and if you take a look you'll see a high wall running round
the property from the gates — and I don't mind betting it goes the whole way
round. We can't get out even if we want to.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

bicycles. 'Better wheel them a little way into the trees and leave them,' said

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>They left their bicycles well hidden among
the trees at the side of the wide drive. The drive was not at all well-kept. It
was mossy and weeds grew all over it. It was bare only where the wheels of cars

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

the trees. They followed the curves of the long drive until the house itself

whispers what he had been able to find out. 'We'll see if we can find Dick as
soon as things are quiet in the house,' he said. 'This is a bad house — a house
of secrets, of queer comings and goings. I shall slip out of our room and see
what I can find out later on. I think that man — Mr Perton is his name — is
really waiting for Rooky to come and see if Dick is Richard or not. When he

Dick he'll want to see. He won't be interested in what he thinks are Dick's
brothers and sisters! Now for goodness' sake don't start to howl again, or

Mr Perton — too full of bright ideas!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

led to the attics now — going very carefully and slowly, afraid of making the

at both ends into the side-wings. Julian stood still and debated — now which
way ought he to go? — where exactly was that lighted window? It was somewhere
along this long passage, he was certain. Well, he'd go along the doors and see
if a light shone out through the keyhole, or under the door anywhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

car and shoved me in,' said Dick, through the door. 'The man called Rooky
wasn't there. The others waited for him for some time, then drove off. They
thought he might have gone off to see someone they meant to visit. So I haven't
seen him. He's coming tomorrow morning. What a shock for him when he finds I'm

wish he wasn't — because if Rooky happens to see him he'll be kidnapped, I'm
sure! The only hope is that Rooky will only see you — and as the other men
think we're all one family, they may let us all go. Did you come straight here
in the car, Dick?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

magic when we got here, but I couldn't see anybody. I was shoved up here and
locked in. One of the men came to tell me all the things Rooky was going to do
to me when he saw me — and then he suddenly went downstairs and hasn't come
back again.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

things go all right, we'll be out of here by the morning, when Rooky finds I'm

can make plans then. I wonder what his mother will think when Richard doesn't
get home tonight.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

cock-and-bull story tomorrow morning, about why they got hold of you, when they
find you're not Richard,' went on Julian. 'They'll probably say you threw
stones at their car or something, and they took you in hand — or found your
hurt and brought you here to help you! Anyway, whatever they say, we won't make
much fuss about it. We'll go quietly — and then we'll get things moving! I
don't know what's going on here, but it's something queer. The police ought to
look into it, I'm certain.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Listen — that's Timmy again,' said Dick.
'Howling like anything for George, I suppose. You'd better go, Julian, in case
he wakes up one of the men and they come out and find you here. Good-night. I'm
awfully glad you're near! Thanks awfully for coming to find me.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Good-night,' said Julian, and went back
along the corridor, walking over the patches of moonlight, looking fearfully
into the dark shadows in case Mr Perton or somebody else was waiting for him!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>But nobody was about. Timmy's howling died
down. There was a deep silence in the house. Julian went down the stairs to the
floor on which the bedroom was where the others lay asleep. He paused outside
it. Should he do any further exploring? It really was such a chance!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>He decided that he would. Mr Perton was fast
asleep, he hoped. He thought probably Hunchy and the woman had gone to bed too.
He wondered where the other man was, who had brought Dick to Owl's Dene. He
hadn't seen him at all. Perhaps he had gone out in that black Bentley they had
seen going out of the gate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Julian went down to the ground floor. A
brilliant thought had just occurred to him. Couldn't he undo the front door and
get the others down, and send them out, free? He himself couldn't escape,
because it would mean leaving Dick alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Then he gave up the idea. 'No,' he thought.
'For one thing George and Anne would refuse to go without me — and even if they
agreed to get out of the front door, and go down the drive to the gates, how
would they undo them? They're worked by some machinery from the house.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>So his brilliant idea came to nothing. He
decided to look into all the rooms on the ground floor. He looked into the
kitchen first. The fire was almost out. The moonlight came through the cracks
of the curtains and lighted up the dark silent room. Hunchy and the woman had
evidently retired somewhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>There was nothing of interest in the
kitchen. Julian went into the room opposite. It was a dining-room, with a long
polished table, candlesticks on the walls and mantelpiece, and the remains of a
wood fire. Nothing of interest there either.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The boy went into another room. Was it a
workroom, or what? There was a radiogram there, and a big desk. There was a
stand with a curious instrument of some kind that had a stout wheel-like
handle. Julian suddenly wondered if it would open the gates! Yes — that was
what it was for. He saw a label attached to it. Left Gate. Right Gate. Both
Gates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'That's what it is — the machinery for
opening either or both of the gates. If only I could get Dick out of that room
I'd get us all out of this place in no time!' said Julian. He twisted the
handle — what would happen?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

some kind of strong machinery was set working. Julian hurriedly turned the
handle back. If it was going to make all that noise, he wasn't going to try his
hand at opening the gates! It would bring Mr Perton out of his room in a rush!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

the boy, examining it as well as he could in the moonlight that streamed
through the window. He looked round the room again. A noise came to his ears

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

looked inside it. It was a lounge, but there was nobody there at all. He

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

other room nearby where people could sleep. He went back to the workroom or
study. Yes — now he could hear that noise again — and it was somebody snoring!
Somebody quite near — and yet not near enough to hear properly, or to see. Most
peculiar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Julian walked softly round the room, trying
to find a place where the snoring sounded loudest of all. Yes — by this
bookcase that reached to the ceiling. That was where the snoring sounded most
of all. Was there a room behind this wall, next to the workroom? Julian went
out to investigate. But there was no room behind the study at all — only the
wall of the corridor, as far as he could see. It was more and more mysterious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

the bookcase. Yes — there it was again. Somebody was asleep and snoring not far
off — but WHERE?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

began to examine the bookcase. It was full of books jammed tightly together —
novels, biographies, reference books — all higgledy-piggledy. He removed some
from a shelf and examined the bookcase behind. It was of solid wood.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

bookcase again. It was a very solid affair. Julian looked carefully at the
books, shining in the moonlight. One shelf of books looked different from the
others — less tidy — the books not so jammed together. Why should just one shelf
be different?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Julian quietly took the books from that
shelf. Behind them was the solid wood again. Julian put his hand at the back
and felt about. A knob was hidden in a corner. A knob! Whatever was that there
for?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Then the whole of the back of that
particular shelf slid quietly downwards, and left an opening big enough for
somebody to squeeze through! Julian Held his breath. A sliding panel! What was
behind it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>A dim flickering light came from the space
behind. Julian waited till his eyes were used to it after the bright moonlight.
He was trembling with excitement. The snoring now sounded so loud that Julian
felt as if the snorer must be almost within hand's reach!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Then gradually he made out a tiny room, with
a small narrow bed, a table and a shelf on which a few articles could dimly be
made out. A candle was burning in a corner. On the bed was the snorer. Julian
could not see what he was like, except that he looked big and burly as he lay
there, snoring peacefully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'What a find!' thought Julian. 'A secret
hiding-place — a place to hide all kinds of people, I suppose, who have enough
money to pay for such a safe hole. This fellow ought to have been warned not to
snore! He gave himself away.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The body did not dare to stay there any
longer, looking into that curious secret room. It must be built in a space
between the wall of the study and the wall of the corridor — probably a very
old hiding-place made when the house was built.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Julian felt for the knob. He pushed it back
into place, and the panel slid up again, as noiselessly as before. It was evidently
kept in good working order!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The snoring was muffled again now. Julian
replaced the books, hoping that they were more or less as he had found them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>He felt very thrilled. He had found one of
the secrets of Owl's Dene, at any rate. The police would be very interested to
hear about that secret hole — and perhaps they would be even more interested to
hear about the person inside it!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>It was absolutely essential now that he and
the others should escape. Would it be all right if he went without Dick? No —
if the men suspected any dirty work on his part — discovered that he knew of
the secret hole, for instance — they might harm Dick. Regretfully Julian
decided that there must be no escape for him unless everyone, including Dick,
could come too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>He didn't explore any more. He suddenly felt
very tired indeed and crept softly upstairs. He felt as if he simply must lie
down and think. He was too tired to do anything else.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>He went to the bedroom. The key was still in
the lock outside. He went into the room and shut the door. Mr Perton would find
the door unlocked the next morning, but probably he would think he hadn't
turned the key properly. Julian lay down on the mattress beside Richard. All
the others were fast asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>He meant to think out all his problems — but
no sooner had he closed his eyes than he was fast asleep. He didn't hear Timmy
howling outside once more. He didn't hear the screech owl that made the night
hideous on the hill. He didn't see the moon slide down the sky.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>They all sat up in a hurry, wondering where
in the world they were. 'Hallo!' said Julian, blinking sleepily. 'Breakfast,
did you say? It sounds good. Is there anywhere we can wash?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

woman, sullenly, 'I'm not cleaning any bathroom up after you!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Leave the door unlocked for us to get out!'
said Julian, innocently. 'Mr Perton locked it last night.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'So he said,' answered the woman, 'but he
hadn't locked it! It wasn't locked when I tried the door this morning. Aha! You
didn't know that, did you? You'd have been wandering all over the house, I
suppose, if you'd guessed that.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Probably we should,' agreed Julian, winking
at the others. They knew that he had meant to go and find Dick in the night,
and snoop round a bit — but they didn't know all he had discovered. He hadn't
had the heart to wake them and tell them the night before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'I hope she's taken some breakfast up to
poor old Dick,' said Julian, in a low voice. The others came close to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

whispered Anne. He nodded. Then, very quickly and quietly he told them all he
had discovered — where Dick was — and then how he had heard the snoring — and
discovered the secret panel — the hidden room — and the man who slept so
soundly there, not knowing that Julian had seen him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

woman. 'There's the sink over there, if you want to wash, and I've put a towel
out for you. You look pretty dirty, all of you.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

you know.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>When they had washed they went to a big
scrubbed table. There was no cloth on it. The woman had put out some bread and
butter and some boiled eggs and a jug of steaming hot cocoa. They all sat down
and began to help themselves. Julian talked cheerfully, winking at the others
to make them do the same. He wasn't going to let the hunchback think they were
scared or worried in any way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>They all went to the window. George opened
it. Timmy was there, sitting just outside. George had begged the woman to let
him in, but she wouldn't. She had thrown him some scraps, and told George there
was a pond he could drink from, but beyond that she wouldn't go.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>She was afraid that Timmy might perhaps run
round to the front door, and go for anyone who jumped out of the car. Timmy
looked up at her inquiringly. He was puzzled about this whole affair. Why
wasn't he allowed inside the house with George? He knew there were some people
who didn't welcome dogs into their houses — but George never went to those
houses. It was a puzzle to him, too, to understand why she didn't come out to
him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

say you'd rather keep out here in the grounds — because if you're locked up I

dropped it towards tea-time when they saw Aggie coming out with a basket to

hen-house. She remained there a short time, and then came out with a basketful
of new-laid eggs. She walked to the house without looking at the children
again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

went in for everything, though, and barked so excitedly that Mr Perton came to
a window and yelled to him to stop.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

with a log-fire and the mellow light from an oil-lamp. Hunchy was at the far

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>It was lovely to have hot baths and to be
given clean clothes. George was solemnly handed out shorts like the boys, and
the others grinned to see that both Mr and Mrs Kent thought she was a boy.
George, of course, grinned too, and didn't say a word.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'I was very angry with Richard when I heard
what he had done,' said Mr Kent, when they were all sitting at table, eating
hungrily. 'I'm ashamed of him.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

beseechingly at Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'Yes — Richard made a fool of himself,' said
Julian. 'And landed us all into trouble. He wants taking in hand, sir.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Richard looked even more downcast. He went
very red, and looked at the table-cloth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'But,' said Julian, 'he more than made up
for his silliness, sir — he offered to squash himself into the boot of the car,
and escape that way, and go and warn the police. That took some doing, believe
me! I think quite a bit of Richard now!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>He leaned over and gave the boy a pat on the
back. Dick and the others followed it up with thumps, and Timmy woofed in his
deepest voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

he said, awkwardly. 'I'll remember this.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'See you do, my boy!' said his father. 'It
might all have ended very differently!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>'But it didn't,' said Anne happily. 'It
ended like this. We can all breathe again!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

grin. 'What do you say, Timmy, old boy?'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span

his tail on the floor. 'WOOF!'<o:p></o:p></span></p>
