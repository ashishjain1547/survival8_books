"Times New Roman"'>Five Run Away Together<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was exciting, remembering all the things that had happened last year. It made
George long all the more for the next day, when her three friends would arrive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
wish Mother would let us go and live on the island for a week,&quot; thought
George. &quot;That would be the greatest fun we could have. To live on my very
own island!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was George's island. It really belonged to her mother, but she had said, two or
three years back, that George could have it, and George now thought of it as
really her<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>own.
She felt that all the rabbits on it belonged to her, all the wild birds and
other creatures.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I'll
suggest that we go there for a week, when the others come,&quot; she thought,
excitedly. &quot;We'll take our food and everything, and live there quite by
ourselves. We shall feel like Robinson Crusoe.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
went to meet her cousins the next day, driving the pony and trap by herself.
Her mother wanted to come, but she said she did not feel very well. George felt
a bit worried about her. So often lately her mother had said she didn't feel
very well. Perhaps it was the heat of the summer. The weather had been so very
hot lately. Day after day had brought nothing but blue sky and sunshine. George
had been burnt a dark-brown, and her eyes were startlingly blue in her sunburnt
face. She had had her hair cut even shorter than usual, and it really was
difficult to know whether she was a boy or a girl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
train came in. Three hands waved madly from a window, and George shouted in delight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Julian!
Dick! Anne! You're here at last.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
three children tumbled pell-mell out of their carriage. Julian yelled to a
porter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Our
bags are in the guard's van. Hallo, George! How are you? Golly, you've
grown.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all had. They were all a year older and a year bigger than when they had had
their exciting adventures on <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Kirrin</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Island</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. Even Anne, the
youngest, didn't look such a small girl now. She flung herself on George,
almost knocking her over, and then went down on her knees beside Timothy, who
was quite mad with joy to see his three friends.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a terrific noise. They all shouted their news at once, and Timothy barked
without stopping.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>&quot;We thought the
train would never get here!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh
Timothy, you darling, you're just the same as ever!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Woof,
woof, woof!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Mother's
sorry she couldn't come and meet you too.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;George,
how brown you are! I say, aren't we going to have fun.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;WOOF,
WOOF!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Shut
up, Tim darling, and do get down; you've bitten my tie almost in half. Oh, you
dear old dog, it's grand to see you!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;WOOF!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
porter wheeled up their luggage, and soon it was in the pony-cart. George
clicked to the waiting pony, and it cantered off. The five in the little cart
all talked at once at the top of their voices, Tim far more loudly than anyone
else, for his doggy voice was strong and powerful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
hope your mother isn't ill?&quot; said Julian, who was fond of his Aunt Fanny.
She was gentle and kind, and loved having them all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
think it must be the heat,&quot; said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What
about Uncle Quentin?&quot; asked Anne. &quot;Is he all right?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
three children did not very much like George's father, because he could get
into very fierce tempers, and although he welcomed the three cousins to his
house, he did not really care for children. So they always felt a little
awkward with him, and were glad when he was not there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Father's
all right,&quot; said George, cheerfully. &quot;Only he's worried about Mother.
He doesn't seem to notice her much when she's well and cheerful, but he gets
awfully upset if anything goes wrong with her. So be a bit careful of him at
the moment. You know what he's like when he's worried.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children did know. Uncle Quentin was best avoided when things went wrong. But
not even the thought of a cross uncle could damp them today. They were on
holiday; they were going to Kirrin Cottage; they were by the sea, and there was
dear old Timothy beside them, and fun of all kinds in store for them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Shall
we go to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Kirrin</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Island</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, George?&quot; asked Anne.
&quot;Do let's! We haven't been there since last summer. The weather was too
bad in the winter and Easter holidays. Now it's gorgeous.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Of
course we'll go,&quot; said George, her blue eyes shining. &quot;Do you know
what I thought? I thought it would be marvellous to go and stay there for a
whole week by ourselves! We are older now, and I'm sure Mother would let
us.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Go
and stay on your island for a week!&quot; cried Anne. &quot;Oh! That would be
too good to be true.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Our
island,&quot; said George, happily. &quot;Don't you remember I said I would
divide it into four, and we'd all share it? Well, I meant it, you know. It's
ours, not mine.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What
about Timothy?&quot; said Anne. &quot;Oughtn't he to have a share as well?
Can't we make it five bits, one for him too?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;He
can share mine,&quot; said George. She drew the pony to a stop, and the four
children and the dog gazed out<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>across
the blue bay. &quot;There's <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Kirrin</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Island</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>,&quot; said
George. &quot;Dear little island. I can hardly wait to get to it now. I haven't
been able to go there yet, because my boat wasn't mended.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Then
we can all go together,&quot; said Dick. &quot;I wonder if the rabbits are just
as tame as ever.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Woof!&quot;
said Timothy at once. He had only to hear the word &quot;rabbits&quot; to get
excited.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;It's
no good your thinking about the rabbits on Kirrin,&quot; said George. &quot;You
know I don't allow you to chase them, Tim.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timothy's
tail dropped and he looked mournfully at George. It was the only thing on which
he and George did not agree. Tim was firmly convinced that rabbits were meant
for him to chase, and George was just as firmly convinced that they were not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Get
on!&quot; said George to the pony, and jerked the reins. The little creature
trotted on towards Kirrin Cottage, and very soon they were all opposite the
front gate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
sour-faced woman came out from the back door to help them down with their
luggage. The children did not . know her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Who's
she?&quot; they whispered to George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;The
new cook,&quot; said George. &quot;Joanna had to go and look after her mother,
who broke her leg. Then Mother got this cook—Mrs. Stick her name is.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Good
name for her,&quot; grinned Julian. &quot;She looks a real old stick! But all
the same I hope she doesn't stick here for long. I hope Joanna comes back. I
liked old fat Joanna, and she was nice to Timmy.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Mrs.
Stick has a dog too,&quot; said George. &quot;A dreadful<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>animal,
smaller than Tim, all sort of mangy and moth-eaten. Tim can't bear it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Where
is it?&quot; asked Anne, looking round.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;It's
kept in the kitchen, and Tim isn't allowed near it,&quot; said George.
&quot;Good thing too, because I'm sure he'd eat it! He can't think what's in
the kitchen, and goes sniffing round the shut door till Mrs. Stick nearly goes
mad.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others laughed. They had all climbed down from the pony-cart now, and were
ready to go indoors. Julian had helped Mrs. Stick in with all the bags. George
took the pony-cart away, and the other three went in to say how-do-you-do to
their uncle and aunt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
dears,&quot; said Aunt Fanny, smiling at them from<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
sofa where she was lying down. &quot;How are you all? I'm<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>sorry
I could not come to meet you. Uncle Quentin is out<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>_for
a walk. You had better go upstairs, and wash and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>change.
Then come down for tea.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys went up to their old bedroom, with its queer slanting roof, and its window
looking out over the bay. Anne went to the little room she shared with George.
How good it was to be back again at Kirrin! What fun they would have these
holidays with George and dear old Timmy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Two.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THE
STICK FAMILY.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>IT
was lovely to wake up the next morning at Kirrin Cottage and see the sun
shining in at the windows, and to hear the far-off plash-plash-plash of the
sea. It was gorgeous to leap out of bed and rush to see how blue the sea was,
and how lovely <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Kirrin</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Island</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> looked at the
entrance of the&gt;bay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I'm
going for a bathe before breakfast,&quot; said Julian, and snatched up his
bathing trunks. &quot;Coming, Dick?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You
bet!&quot; said Dick. &quot;Call the girls. We'll all go.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
down they went, the four of them, with Tim galloping behind them, his tail
wagging nineteen to the dozen, and his long pink tongue hanging out of his
mouth. He went into the water with the others, and swam all round them. They
were all good swimmers', but Julian and George were the best.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
put towels round themselves, rubbed their bodies dry and pulled on jeans and
jerseys. Then back to breakfast they went, as hungry as hunters. Anne noticed a
boy in the back garden and stared in surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Who's
that?&quot; she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh,
that's Edgar, Mrs. Stick's boy,&quot; said George. &quot;I don't like him. He
does silly things, like putting out his tongue and calling rude names.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
appeared to be singing when the others went in at the gate. Anne stopped to
listen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Georgie-Porgie,
pudding and pie!&quot; sang Edgar, a silly look on his face. He seemed about
thirteen or fourteen, a stupid, yet sly-looking youth. &quot;Georgie-porgie
pudding and pie!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
went red. &quot;He's always singing that,&quot; she said, furiously. &quot;Just
because I'm called &quot;George&quot;, I suppose. He thinks he's clever. I
can't bear him.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
called out to Edgar. &quot;You shut up! You're not funny, only jolly
silly!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Georgie-porgie,&quot;
began Edgar again, a silly smile on his wide red face. Julian made a step
towards him, and he at once disappeared into the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Shan't
stand much of him,&quot; said Julian, in a decided voice. &quot;I wonder you
do, George. I wonder you haven't slapped his face, stamped on his foot, bitten
his ears off and done a few other things! You used to be so fierce.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well—I
am still, really,&quot; said George. &quot;I feel frightfully fierce down
inside me when I hear Edgar singing silly songs at me like that and calling out
names—but you see, Mother really hasn't been well, and I know jolly well if I
go for Edgar, Mrs. Stick will leave, and poor old Mother would have to do all
the work, and she really isn't fit to at present. So I just hold myself in, and
hope that Timmy will do the same.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Good
for you, old thing!&quot; said Julian, admiringly, for he knew how hard it was
for George to keep her temper at times.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
think I'll just go up to Mother's room and see if she'd like breakfast in
bed,&quot; said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Hang
on to old Timmy a moment, will you? If Edgar appears again, he might go for
him.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
hung on to Timmy's collar. Timmy had growled when Edgar had been in the garden,
now he stood stock still, his nose twitching as if he were trying to trace some
smell.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly
a mangy-looking dog appeared out of the kitchen door. It had a dirty white
coat, out of which patches seemed to have been bitten, and its tail was well
between its legs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Wooooof!&quot;
said Timmy, joyfully, and leapt at the dog. He pulled Julian over, for he was a
big dog, and the boy let go his hold of the dog's collar. Timmy pounced
excitedly on the other dog, who gave a fearful whine and tried to go into the
kitchen door again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Timmy!
Come here, sir!&quot; yelled Julian. But Timmy didn't hear. He was busy trying
to snap off the other dog's ears—or at least, that is what he appeared to be
doing. The other dog yelled for help, and Mrs. Stick appeared at the kitchen
door, a saucepan in her hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Call
off that dog!&quot; she screeched. She hit out at Timmy with the saucepan, but
he dodged and it hit her own dog instead, making it yelp all the more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Don't
hit out with that!&quot; said Julian. &quot;You'll hurt the dogs. Hi, Timmy,
TIMMY!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
now appeared, looking very scared. He picked up a stone and seemed to be
watching his chance to hurl it at Timmy. Anne shrieked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You're
not to throw that stone; you're not to! You bad wicked boy!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the middle of all this turmoil Uncle Quentin appeared, looking angry and
irritable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Good
heavens! What is all this going on? I never heard such a row in my life.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
George appeared, flying out of the door like the wind, to rescue her beloved
Timothy. She rushed to the two dogs and tried to pull Timmy away. Her father
yelled at her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Come
away, you little idiot! Don't you know better than to separate two fighting
dogs with your bare hands? Where's the garden hose?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was fixed to a tap nearby. Julian ran to it and turned on the tap. He picked up
the hose and turned it on the two dogs. At once the jet of water spurted out at
them, and they leapt apart in surprise. Julian saw Edgar standing near, and
couldn't resist swinging the hose a little so that the boy was soaked. He gave
a scream and ran in at once. .<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What
did you do that for?&quot; said Uncle Quentin, annoyed. &quot;George, tie
Timothy up at once. Mrs. Stick didn't I tell you not to let your dog out of the
kitchen unless .you had him on a lead? I won't have this kind of thing
happening. Where's the breakfast? Late as usual!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Stick disappeared into the kitchen, muttering and grumbling, taking her
drenched dog with her. George, looking sulky, tied Timothy up. He lay down in
his kennel, looking beseechingly at his mistress.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I've
told you not to take any notice of that mangy-looking dog,&quot; said George,
severely. &quot;Now you see what happens! You put Father into a bad temper for
the rest of the day, and Mrs. Stick will be so angry she won't make any cakes
for tea!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
gave a whine, and put his head down on his paws. He licked a few hairs from the
corner of his mouth. It was sad to be tied up—but anyhow he had bitten<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>a
bit off the tip of one of that dreadful dog's ears!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went in to breakfast. &quot;Sorry I let Timmy go,&quot; said Julian to
George. &quot;But he nearly tore my arm off. I couldn't possibly hold him! He's
grown into an awfully powerful dog, hasn't he?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes,&quot;
said George, proudly. &quot;He has. He could eat Mrs. Stick's dog up in a
mouthful if we'd let him. And Edgar too.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;And
Mrs. Stick,&quot; said Anne. &quot;All .of them. I don't like any of
them.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Breakfast
was rather a subdued meal, as Aunt Fanny was not there, but Uncle Quentin
was—and Uncle Quentin in a bad temper was not a very cheerful person to have at
the breakfast-table. He snapped at George and glared at the others. Anne almost
wished they hadn't come to Kirrin Cottage! But her spirits rose when she thought
of the rest of the day—they would take their dinner out, perhaps, and have it
on the beach—or maybe even go out to Kirrin Island. Uncle Quentin wouldn't be
with them to spoil things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Stick appeared to take away the porridge plates and bring in the bacon. She
banged the plates down on the table.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No
need to do that,&quot; said Uncle Quentin, irritably. Mrs. Stick said nothing.
She was scared of Uncle Quentin, and no wonder! She put the next lot of plates
down quietly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What
are. you going to do today?&quot; asked Uncle Quentin, towards the end of
breakfast. He was feeling a little better by that time, and didn't like to see
such subdued faces round him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We
thought we might go out for a picnic,&quot; said George, eagerly. &quot;I asked
Mother. She said we might, if Mrs. Stick will make us sandwiches.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
I shouldn't think she'll try very hard,&quot; said Uncle Quentin, trying to
make a little joke. They all smiled politely. &quot;But you can ask her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a silence. Nobody liked the idea of asking Mrs. Stick for sandwiches.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
do wish she hadn't brought Stinker,&quot; said George, gloomily.
&quot;Everything would be easier if he wasn't here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Is
that the name of her son?&quot; asked Uncle Quentin, startled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
grinned. &quot;Oh no. Though it wouldn't be a bad name for him, because he
hardly ever has a bath, and he's jolly smelly. It's her dog I mean. She calls
him Tinker, but I call him Stinker, because he really does smell awful.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
don't think it's a very nice name,&quot; said her father, in the midst of the
others&quot; giggles.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No,
it isn't,&quot; said George; &quot;but then, he isn't a very nice dog.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the end it was Aunt Fanny who saw Mrs. Stick and arranged about the sandwiches.
Mrs. Stick went up to see Aunt Fanny, who was having breakfast in bed, and
agreed to make sandwiches, though with a very bad grace.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
didn't bargain for three more children to come traipsing along,&quot; she said,
sulkily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
told you they were coming, Mrs. Stick,&quot; said Aunt Fanny, patiently.
&quot;I didn't know I should be feeling so ill myself when they came. If I had
been well I could have<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>made
their sandwiches and done many more things. I can only ask you to help as much
as you can till I feel better. I may be all right tomorrow. Let the children
have a good time for a week or so, and then, if I still feel ill, I am sure
they will all turn to and help a bit. But let them have a good time
first.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children took their packets of sandwiches and set off. On the way they met
Edgar, looking as stupid and sly as usual. &quot;Why don't you let me come
along with you?&quot; he said. &quot;Let's go to that island. I know a lot
about it, I do.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No,
you don't,&quot; said George, in a flash. &quot;You don't know anything about
it. And I'd never take you. It's my island, see? Well, ours. It belongs to all
four of us and Timmy, too. We should never allow you to go.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;'Tisn't
your island,&quot; said Edgar. &quot;That's a lie, that is!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You
don't know what you're talking about,&quot; said George, scornfully. &quot;Come
on, you others! We can't waste time talking to Edgar.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
left him, looking sulky and angry. As soon as they were at a safe distance he
lifted up his voice:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Georgie-porgie,
pudding and pie, She knows how to tell a lie, Georgie-porgie, pudding and
pie!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
made as if he would go back after the rude Edgar, but George pulled him on.
&quot;He'll only go and tell tales to his mother, and she'll walk out and
there'll be no one to help Mother,&quot; she said. &quot;I'll just have to put
up with it. We'll try and think of some way to get our own back, though. Nasty
creature! I hate his pimply nose and screwed-up eyes.&quot;!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Woof!&quot;
said Timmy, feelingly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Timmy
says he hates Stinker's miserable tail and silly little ears,&quot; explained
George, and they all laughed. That made them feel better. They were soon out of
hearing of Edgar's silly song, and forgot all about him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Let's
go and see if your boat is ready,&quot; said Julian. &quot;Then maybe we could
row out to the dear old island.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Three.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
NASTY SHOCK.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>GEORGE'S
boat was almost ready, but not quite. It was having a last coat of paint on it.
It looked very gay, for George had chosen a bright red paint, and the oars were
painted red too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh,
can't we possibly have it this afternoon?&quot; said George to Jim the boatman.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
shook his head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No,
Master George,&quot; he said, &quot;not unless you all want to be messed up
with red paint. It'll be dry tomorrow, but not before.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
always made the others smile to hear the boatmen and fishermen call <st1:place
w:st="on">Georgina</st1:place> &quot;Master George.&quot; The local people all
knew how badly she wanted to be a boy, and they knew, too, how plucky and
straightforward she was, so they laughed to one another and said: &quot;Well,
they reckoned she behaved like a boy, and if she wanted to be called
&quot;Master George&quot; instead of &quot;Miss Georgina&quot;, she deserved
it!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
<st1:place w:st="on">Georgina</st1:place> was Master George, and enjoyed
strutting about in her jeans and jersey on the beach, using her boat as well as
any fisher-boy, and swimming faster than them all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'll
go to the island tomorrow then,&quot; said Julian. &quot;We'll just picnic on
the beach today. Then we'll go for a walk.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
they picnicked on the sands with Timothy sharing more than half their lunch.
The sandwiches were not very nice. The bread was too stale; there was not
enough butter inside, and they were far too thick. But Timothy didn't mind. He
gobbled up as many as he could, his tail wagging so hard that it sent sand over
everyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Timothy,
do take your tail out of the sand if you want to wag it,&quot; said Julian,
getting sand all over his hair for the fourth time. Timmy wagged his tail hard
again, and sent another shower over him. Everyone laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Let's
go for a walk now,&quot; said Dick, jumping up. &quot;My legs could do with
some good exercise. Where shall we go?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'll
walk along the cliff-top, where we can see the island all the time, shall
we?&quot; said Anne. &quot;George, is the old wreck still there?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
nodded. The children had once had a most exciting time with an old wreck that
had lain at the bottom of the sea. A great storm had lifted it up and set it
firmly on the rocks. They had been able to explore the wreck then, and had
found a map of the castle in it, with instructions as to where hidden treasure
was to be found.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Do
you remember how we found that old map in the wreck, and how we looked for the
ingots of gold and found them?&quot; said Julian, his eyes gleaming as he
remembered it all. &quot;Isn't the wreck battered to pieces yet, George?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No,&quot;
said George. &quot;I don't think so. It's on the rocks on the other side of the
island, you remember, so we can't see it from here. But we might have a look at
it when we go on the island tomorrow.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes,
let's,&quot; said Anne. &quot;Poor old wreck! I guess it won't last many
winters now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
walked along the cliff-top with Timothy capering ahead of them. They could see
the island easily and the ruined castle rising up from the middle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;There's
the jackdaw tower,&quot; said Anne, looking. &quot;The<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>other
tower's fallen down hasn't it? Look at the jackdaws circling round and round
the tower, George!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes.
They build in it every year,&quot; said George. &quot;Don't you remember the
masses of sticks round about the tower that the jackdaws dropped when they
built their nests? We picked some up and made a fire with them once.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I'd
like to do that again,&quot; said Anne. &quot;I would really. Let's do it each
night if we stay a week on the island. George, did you ask your mother?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh
yes,&quot; said George. &quot;She said she thought we might, but she would
see.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
don't like it when grown-ups say they'll see,&quot; said Anne. &quot;It so
often means they won't let you do something after all, but they don't like to
tell you at the time.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
I expect she will let us,&quot; said George. &quot;After all, we're much older
than last year. Why, Julian is in his teens already, and I soon shall be and so
will Dick. Only Anne is small.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I'm
not,&quot; said Anne, indignantly. &quot;I'm as strong as you are. I can't help
being younger.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Hush,
hush, baby!&quot; said Julian, patting his little sister on the back and
laughing at her furious face. &quot;Hallo—look! What's that over there on the
island?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
had caught sight of something as he was teasing Anne. Everyone swung round and
gazed at Kirrin. George gave an exclamation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Golly—a
spire of smoke! Surely it's smoke! Someone's on my island.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;On
our island,&quot; corrected Dick. &quot;It can't be! That smoke must come from
a steamer out beyond the island. We can't see it, that's all. But I bet the
smoke comes from<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>a
steamer. We know no one can get to the island but us. They don't know the
way.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;If
anyone's on my island,&quot; began George, looking very fierce and angry,
&quot;if anyone's on my island, I'll—I'll—I'll . . .&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You'll
explode and go up in smoke!&quot; said Dick. &quot;There—it's gone now. I'm
sure it was only a steamer letting off steam or smoking hard, whatever they
do.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
watched Kirrin Island for some time after that, but they could see no more
smoke. &quot;If only my boat was ready!&quot; said George, restlessly.
&quot;I'd go over this afternoon. I've a good mind to go and get my boat, even
if the paint tr wet.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Don't
be an idiot!&quot; said Julian. &quot;You know what an awful row we'd get into
if we go home with all our things bright red. Have a bit of sense,
George.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
gave up the idea. She watched for a steamer to appear at one side of the island
or another, to come into the bay, but none came.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Probably
anchored out there,&quot; said Dick. &quot;Come on! Are we going to stand
rooted to this spot for the rest of the day?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'd
better get back home,&quot; said Julian, looking at his wrist-watch. &quot;It's
almost tea-time. I hope your mother is up, George. It's much nicer when she's
at meals.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh,
I expect she will be,&quot; said George. &quot;Come on, then let's go
back!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
turned to go back. They watched Kirrin Island as they walked, but all they
could see was jackdaws or gulls in the sky above it. No more spires of smoke
appeared. It must have been a steamer!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;All
the same, I'm going over tomorrow to have a look,&quot; said George, firmly.
&quot;If any trippers are visiting my island I'll turn them off.&quot; &quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Our
island,&quot; said Dick. &quot;George, I wish you'd remember you said you'd
share it with us.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well—I
did share it out with you,&quot; said George, &quot;but I can't help feeling
it's still my island. Come on! I'm getting hungry.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came back at last to Kirrin Cottage. They went into the hall, and then into the
sitting-room. To their great surprise Edgar was there, reading one of Julian's
books.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What
are you doing here?&quot; said Julian. &quot;And who told you you could borrow
my book?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I'm
not doing any harm,&quot; said Edgar. &quot;If I want to have a quiet read, why
shouldn't I?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You
wait till my Father comes in and finds you lolling about here,&quot; said
George. &quot;My goodness, if you'd gone into his study, you'd have been sorry.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I've
been in there,&quot; said Edgar, surprisingly. &quot;I've seer those funny
instruments he's working with.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;How
dare you!&quot; said George, going white with rage &quot;Why, even we are not
allowed to go into my Father'; study. As for touching his things — well!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
eyed Edgar curiously. He could not imagine why the boy should suddenly be so
insolent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Where's
your father, George?&quot; he said. &quot;I think we had better get him to deal
with Edgar. He must be mad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Call
him if you like,&quot; said Edgar, still lolling in the chair, and flicking
over the pages of Julian's book in a most irritating way. &quot;He won't
come.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What
do you mean?&quot; said George, feeling suddenly scared. &quot;Where's my
mother?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Call
her too, if you like,&quot; said the boy, looking sly. &quot;Go on! Call her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children suddenly felt afraid. What did Edgar mean? George flew upstairs to her
mother's room, shouting loudly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Mother!
Mother! Where are you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
her mother's bed was empty. It had not been made—but it was empty. George flew
into all the other bedrooms, shouting desperately: &quot;Mother! Mother!
Father! Where are you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
there was no answer. George ran downstairs, her face very white. Edgar grinned
up at her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What
did I tell you?&quot; he said. &quot;I said you could call all you liked, but
they wouldn't come.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Where
are they?&quot; demanded George. &quot;Tell me at once!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Find
out yourself,&quot; said Edgar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a resounding slap, and Edgar leapt to his feet, holding his left cheek with
his hand. George had flown at him and dealt him the hardest smack she could.
Edgar lifted his hand to slap her back, but Julian stood in front.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You're
not fighting George,&quot; he said. &quot;She's a girl. If you want a fight,
I'll take you on.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
won't be a girl; I'm a boy!&quot; shouted George, trying to push Julian away.
&quot;I'll fight Edgar, and I'll beat him, you see if I don't.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Julian kept her off. Edgar began to edge towards the doorway, but he found Dick
there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;One
minute,&quot; said Dick. &quot;Before you go — where are our uncle and
aunt?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Gr-r-r-r-r-r-r,&quot;
suddenly said Timothy, in such a threatening voice that Edgar stared at him in
fright. The<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>dog
had bared his great teeth, and had put up the hackles on his neck. He looked
very frightening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Hold
that dog!&quot; said Edgar, his voice trembling. &quot;He looks as if he's
going to spring at me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
put his hand on Tim's collar. &quot;Quiet, Tim!&quot; he said. &quot;Now,
Edgar, tell us what we want to know, and tell us quickly, or you'll be
sorry.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
there isn't much to tell,&quot; said Edgar, keeping his eye on Timothy. He shot
a look at George and went on. &quot;Your mother was suddenly taken very ill —
with a terrible pain here—and they got the doctor and they've taken her away to
hospital, and your father went with her. That's all!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
sat down on the sofa, looking paler still and rather sick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh!&quot;
she said. &quot;Poor Mother! I wish I hadn't gone out today. Oh dear—how can we
find out what's happened?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
had slipped out of the room, shutting the door behind him so that Timmy should
not follow. The kitchen door was slammed, too. The children stared at one
another, feeling sorry and dismayed. Poor George! Poor Aunt Fanny!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;There
must be a note somewhere,&quot; said Julian, and looked round the room. He saw
a letter stuck into the rim of the big mirror there, addressed to George. He
gave it to her. It was from George's father. , &quot;Read it, quickly,&quot;
said Anne. &quot;Oh dear—this is really a horrid beginning to our holidays
here!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Four.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
FEW LITTLE UPSETS.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>GEORGE
read the letter out loud. It was not very long, and had evidently been written
in a great hurry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>DEAR
GEORGE,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Your
mother has been taken very ill. I am going with her to the hospital. I shall
not leave her till she is getting better. That may be in a few days&quot; time,
or in a week's time. I will telephone to you each day at nine o'clock in the
morning to tell you how she is. Mrs. Stick will look after you all. Try to
manage all right till I come back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Your
loving. FATHER.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh
dear!&quot; said Anne, knowing how dreadful George must feel. George loved her
mother dearly, and for once in a way the girl had tears in her eyes. George
never cried—but it was terrible to come home and find her mother gone like
this. And Father too! No one there but Mrs. Stick and Edgar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
can't bear Mother going like this,&quot; sobbed George suddenly, and buried her
head in a cushion. &quot;She—she might never come back.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Don't
be silly, George,&quot; said Julian, sitting down and putting his arm round
her. &quot;Of course she will. Why shouldn't she? Didn't your father say he was
staying with her till she was getting better—and that would be<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>probably
in a few days&quot; time, Cheer up, George! It isn't like you to give way like
this.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;But
I didn't say good-bye,&quot; sobbed poor George. &quot;And I made her ask Mrs.
Stick for the sandwiches, instead of me. I want to go and find Mother and see
how she is myself.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You
don't know where they've taken her, and if you did, they wouldn't let you
in,&quot; said Dick, gently. &quot;Let's have some tea. We shall all feel
better after that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
couldn't eat anything,&quot; said George, fiercely. Timothy pushed his nose into
her hands, and tried to lick them. They were under her buried face. The dog
whined a little.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Poor
Timmy! He can't understand,&quot; said Anne. &quot;He's awfully upset because
you are unhappy, George.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
made George sit up. She rubbed her hands over<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>her
eyes, and let Timmy lick the wet tears off them. He looked surprised at the
salty taste. He tried to get on to George's knee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Silly
Timmy!&quot; said George, in a more ordinary voice. &quot;Don't be upset. I
just got a shock, that's all! I'm better now, Timmy. Don't whine like that,
silly! I'm all right. I'm not hurt.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timothy felt certain George was really hurt or injured in some way to cry like
that, and he kept whining, and pawing at George, and trying to get on to her
knee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
opened the door. &quot;I'm going to tell Mrs. Stick we want our tea,&quot; he
said, and went out. The others thought he was rather brave to face Mrs. Stick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
went to the kitchen door and opened it. Edgar was sitting there, one side of
his face scarlet, where George had slapped it. Mrs. Stick was there, looking
grim,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;If
that girl slaps my Edgar again I'll be after her,&quot; she said,
threateningly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Edgar
deserved what he got,&quot; said Julian, &quot;Can we have some tea,
please?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I've
a good mind to get you none,&quot; said Mrs. Stick. Her dog started up from its
corner and growled at Julian. &quot;That's right, Tinker! You growl at folks
that slap Edgar,I said Mrs. Stick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was not in the least afraid of Tinker. &quot;If you are not going to get us any
tea, I'll get it myself,&quot; said the boy. &quot;Where is the bread, and
where are the cakes?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Stick stared at Julian, and the boy looked back al her steadfastly. He thought
she was a most unpleasant woman, and he certainly was not going to allow her to
get the better of him. He wished he could tell her to go—<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>but
he had a feeling that she wouldn't, so it would be a waste of his breath.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Stick dropped her eyes first. &quot;I'll get your tea,&quot; she said,
&quot;but if I've any nonsense from you I'll get you no other meals.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;And
if I have any nonsense from you I shall go to the police,&quot; said Julian,
unexpectedly. He hadn't meant to say that. It came out quite suddenly, but it
had a surprising effect on Mrs. Stick. She looked startled and alarmed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Now,
there's no call to be nasty,&quot; she said in a much more polite voice.
&quot;We've all had a bit of a shock, and we're upset, like—I'll get you your
tea right now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
went out. He wondered why his sudden threat of going to the police had made
Mrs. Stick so much more polite. Perhaps she was afraid the police would get on
to his Uncle Quentin and &quot;he would come tearing back. Uncle Quentin
wouldn't care for a hundred Mrs. Sticks!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went back to &quot;the others. &quot;Tea's coming,&quot; he said. &quot;So
cheer up, everyone!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
wasn't a very cheerful company that sat down to the tea Mrs. Stick brought in.
George was now feeling ashamed of her tears. Anne was still upset. Dick tried
to make a few silly jokes to cheer everyone up, but they fell so flat that he
soon gave it up. Julian was grave and helpful, suddenly very grown-up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timothy
sat close beside George, his head on her knee. &quot;I do wish I had a dog who
loved me like that,&quot; thought Anne. Timmy kept gazing up at George out of
big brown devoted eyes. He had no eyes or ears for anyone but his little
mistress now she was sad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
noticed what they had for tea, but all the same<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>it
did them goodIand they felt better after it. They didn't like to go out to the
beach afterwards in case the telephone bell rang, and there was news of
George's mother. So they sat about in the garden, keeping an ear open for the
telephone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>From
the kitchen came a song.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Georgie-porgie,
pudding and pie, Sat herself down and had a good cry, Georgie-porgie . .
.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
got up. He went to the kitchen window and looked in. Edgar was there alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Come
on out here, Edgar!&quot; said Julian, in a grim voice. I'll teach you to sing
another song. Come along!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
didn't stir. &quot;Can't I sing if I want to?&quot; he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh
yes,&quot; said Julian, &quot;but not that song. I'll teach you another. Come
along out!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No
fear,&quot; said Edgar. &quot;You want to fight me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes,
I do,&quot; said Julian. &quot;I think a little bit of good honest fighting
would be better for you than sitting singing nasty little songs about a girl
who is miserable. Are you coming out? Or shall I come in and fetch you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Ma!&quot;
called Edgar, suddenly feeling panicky. &quot;Ma! Where are you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
suddenly reached a long arm in at the window, caught hold of Edgar's over-long
nose, and pulled it so hard that Edgar yelled in pain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Led
go! Led go! You're hurding me! Led go by dose!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Stick came hurrying into the kitchen. She gave a scream when she saw what
Julian was doing. She flew at<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>him.
Julian withdrew his arm, and stood outside the window.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;How
dare you!&quot; yelled Mrs. Stick. &quot;First that girl slaps Edgar, and then
you pull his nose! What's the matter with you all?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Nothing,&quot;
said Julian, pleasantly; &quot;but there's an awful lot wrong with Edgar, Mrs.
Stick. We feel we just must put it right. It should be your job, of course, but
you don't seem to have done it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You're
downright insolent,&quot; said Mrs. Stick, outraged and furious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes,
I dare say I am,&quot; said Julian. &quot;It's just the effect Edgar has on me.
Stinker has the same effect.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Stinker!&quot;
cried Mrs. Stick, getting angrier still. &quot;That's not my dog's name, and
well you know it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
it really ought to be,&quot; said Julian, strolling off. &quot;Give him a bath,
and maybe we'll call him Tinker instead.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Leaving
Mrs. Stick muttering in fury, he went back to the others. They stared at him
curiously. He somehow seemed a different Julian—a grim and determined Julian, a
very grown-up Julian, a rather frightening Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I'm
afraid the fat's in the fire now,&quot; said Julian, sitting down on the grass.
&quot;I pulled old Edgar's nose nearly off his fat face, and Ma saw me doing
it. I guess it's open warfare now! We shan't have a very merry time from now
on. I doubt if we'll get any meals.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'll
get them ourselves then,&quot; said George. &quot;I hate Mrs. Stick. I wish
Joanna would come back. I hate that horrid Edgar too, and that awful Stinker.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Look—there
is Stinker!&quot; suddenly said Dick, putting<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>out
his hand to catch Timothy, who had risen with a growl. But Timmy shook off his
hand and leapt across the grass at once. Stinker gave a woeful howl and tried
to escape. But Timothy had him by the neck and was shaking him like a rat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Stick appeared with a stick and lashed out, not seeming to mind which dog she
hit. Julian rushed for the hose again. Edgar skipped indoors at once,
remembering what had happened to him before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
water gushed out, and Timothy gave a gasp and let go the howling mongrel he
held in his teeth. Stinker at once hurled himself on Mrs. Stick, and tried to
hide in her skirts trembling with terror.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I'll
poison that dog of yours!&quot; said Mrs. Stick, furiously, to George. &quot;Always
setting on to mine. You look out or I'll poison him.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
disappeared indoors, and the four children went and sat down again. George
looked really alarmed. &quot;Do you suppose she really might try to poison
Timmy?&quot; she asked Julian, in a scared voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;She's
a nasty bit of work,&quot; said Julian, in a low tone. &quot;I think it would
be just as well to keep old Timmy close by us, day and night, and only to feed
him ourselves, from our own plates.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
pulled Timothy to her, horrified at the thought that anyone might want to
poison him. But Mrs. Stick really was awful—she might do anything like that,
George thought. How she wished her father and mother were back! It was horrid
to be on their own, like this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
telephone bell suddenly shrilled out and made everyone jump. They all leapt to
their feet, and Timmy<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>growled.
George flew indoors and lifted the receiver. She heard her father's voice, and
her heart began to beat fast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Is
that you, George?&quot; said her father. &quot;Are you all right? I hadn't time
to stay and tell you everything.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Father—what
about Mother? Tell me quick—how is she?&quot; said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We
shan't know till the day after next,&quot; said her father. &quot;I'll
telephone tomorrow morning and then the. next morning too. I shan't come back
till I know she's better.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh
Father—it's awful without you and Mother,&quot; said poor George. &quot;Mrs.
Stick is so horrid.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Now,
George,&quot; said her father, rather impatiently, &quot;surely you children
can see to yourselves and make do with Mrs. Stick till I get back! Don't worry
me about such things now. I've enough worry as it is.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;When
will you be back, do you think?&quot; said George. &quot;Can I come and see
Mother?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No,&quot;
said her father. &quot;Not for at least two weeks, they say. I'll be back as
soon as I can. But I'm not going to leave your Mother now. She needs me.
Good-bye and be good, all of you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
put back the receiver. She turned to face the others. &quot;Shan't know about
Mother till the day after next,&quot; she said. &quot;And we've got to put up
with Mrs. Stick till Father comes back—and goodness knows when that will be!
It's awful, isn't it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Five.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>MRS.
STICK was in such a bad temper that evening that there was no supper at all.
Julian went to ask about some, but he found the kitchen door locked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went back to the others with a gloomy face, for they were all hungry.
&quot;She's locked the door,&quot; he said. &quot;She really is a dreadful
creature. I don't believe we'll get any supper tonight.&quot; &quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'll
have to wait till she goes to bed,&quot; said George. &quot;We'll go down and
hunt in the larder then, and see what we can find.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went to bed hungry. Julian listened for Mrs. Stick and Edgar to go to bed, too.
When he heard them going upstairs, and was sure their doors had shut, he
slipped down into the kitchen. It was dark there, and Julian was just about to
put on the light when he heard the sound of someone breathing heavily. He
wondered who it could be. Was it Stinker? No—it couldn't be the dog. It sounded
like a human being.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
stood there, his hand over the light switch, puzzled and a little scared. It
couldn't be a burglar, because burglars don't go to sleep in the house they
have come to rob. It couldn't be Mrs. Stick or Edgar. Then who was it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
snapped on the light. The kitchen was flooded with radiance, and Julian's eyes
fastened on the figure of a <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>small
man lying on the sofa. He was fast asleep, his mouth wide open.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>He was not a very pleasant sight. He had not
shaved for some days, and his cheeks and chin were bluish-black. He didn't seem
to have washed for even longer than that, for his hands were black, and so were
his finger-nails. He had untidy hair and a nose exactly like Edgar's.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Must
be dear Edgar's father,&quot; thought Julian to himself. &quot;What a sight!
Well, poor Edgar hadn't much chance to be decent with a father and mother like
his.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
man snored. Julian wondered what to do. He<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>badly
wanted to go to the larder, but on the other hand he didn't particularly want
to wake up the man and have a row. He didn't see how he could turn him out—for
all he knew his aunt and uncle might have agreed to Mrs. Stick's husband coming
there now and again, though he hardly thought so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was very hungry. The thought of the good things in the larder made him snap off
the light again and creep towards the larder door in the dark. He opened the
door. He felt along the shelves. Good!—that felt like a pie of some sort. He
lifted it up and sniffed. It smelt of meat. A meat-pie—good!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
felt along the shelf again and came to a plate on which were what he thought
must be jam-tarts, for they were round and flat, and had something sticky in
the middle. Well, a meat-pie and jam-tarts ought to be all right for four
hungry children!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
picked up the meat-pie and the dish of tarts, and made his way carefully out of
the larder. He pushed the door to with his foot. Then he turned to go out of
the room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
in the dark he went the wrong way, and by bad luck walked straight into the
sofa! The dish of tarts got a sudden jerk and one of them fell off. It landed
on the open mouth of the sleeping man, and woke him up with a start.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Blow!&quot;
said Julian to himself, and began to back away quietly, hoping that the man
would turn over and go to sleep again. But the sticky jam-tart sliding down his
chin had startled the man, and he sat up with a jerk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Who's
there? That you, Edgar? What you doing down here?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
said nothing but sidled towards what he hoped was the door. The man leapt up
and lurched over to where he thought the light switch was. He found it and
switched it on. He stared in the greatest astonishment at Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What
are you doing here?&quot; he demanded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Just
what I was about to ask you? said Julian, coolly. &quot;What do you think
you're doing here, sleeping in my uncle's kitchen?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I've
a right to be here,&quot; said the man, in a rude voice. &quot;My wife's cook
here, isn't she? My ship's in and I'm on leave. Your uncle arranged with my
wife I could come here then, see?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
had feared as much. How awful to have a Mr. Stick as well as a Mrs. and Master
Stick in the house! It would be quite unbearable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
can ask my uncle about it when he telephones in the morning,&quot; said Julian.
&quot;Now get out of my way, please. I want to go upstairs.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Ho!&quot;
said Mr. Stick, eyeing the meat-pie and jam-tarts that Julian was carrying.
&quot;Ho! Stealing out of the larder, I see! Nice goings-on I must say.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was not going to argue with Mr. Stick, who evidently felt that he was top-dog.
&quot;Get out of my way,&quot; he said. &quot;I will talk to you in the morning
after my uncle has telephoned.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Stick didn't seem as if he was going to get out of the way at all. He stood
there, a nasty little man, not much taller than Julian, a sarcastic smile on
his unshaven face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
pursed up his lips and whistled. There came a bump on the floor above. That was
Timothy jumping off<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George's
bed! Then there came the pattering of feet down the stairs ,and up the. kitchen
passage. Timmy was coming!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
smelt Mr. Stick in the doorway, put up his hackles, bared his teeth and
growled. Mr. Stick hastily removed himself from the doorway and then neatly
banged the door in the dog's face. He grinned at Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Now
what are you going to do?&quot; he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Shall
I tell you?&quot; said Julian, his temper suddenly rising. &quot;I'm going to
hurl this nice juicy meat-pie straight into your grinning face!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
raised his arm, and Mr. Stock ducked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Now
don't you do that,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm only pulling your leg, see? Don't
you waste that nice meat-pie. You can go upstairs if you want to.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
moved away to the sofa. Julian opened the door and Timothy bounded in growling.
Mr. Stick eyed him uncomfortably.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Don't
you let that nasty great dog come near me,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't like
dogs.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Then
I wonder you don't get rid of Stinker,&quot; said Julian. &quot;Come here,
Timmy! Leave him alone. He's not worth growling at.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
went upstairs with Timothy close at his heels. The others crowded round him,
wondering what had happened, for they had heard the voices downstairs. They
laughed when Julian told them how he had nearly thrown the meat-pie at Mr. Stick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;It
would have served him right,&quot; said Anne, &quot;though it would have been a
great pity, because we shouldn't have been able to eat it. Well, Mrs. Stick may
be simply<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>horrible,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>but she can<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>cook.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This pie is gorgeous.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children finished all the pie and the tarts, too. Julian told them all about
Mr. Stick coming on leave from his ship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Three
Sticks are a lot too much,&quot; said Dick thoughtfully. &quot;Pity we can't
get rid of them all and manage for ourselves. George, can't you possibly
persuade your father tomorrow to let us get rid of the Sticks and look after
ourselves?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I'll
try,&quot; said George. &quot;But you know what he is—awfully difficult to
argue with. But I'll try. Golly, I'm sleepy now. Come on, Timmy, let's get to
bed! Lie on my feet. I'm hardly going to let you out of my sight now, in case
those awful Sticks poison you!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
the four children, now no longer hungry, were sleeping peacefully. They did not
fear the Sticks coming up to their rooms, for they knew that Timmy would wake
and warn them at once. Timmy was the best guard they could have.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the morning Mrs. Stick actually produced some sort of breakfast, which
surprised the children very much. &quot;Guess she knows your father will
telephone, George,&quot; said Julian, &quot;and she wants to keep herself in
the right. When did he say he would &quot;phone? Nine o'clock, wasn't it? Well,
it's half-past eight now. Let's go for a quick run down to the beach and
back.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
off they went, the five of them, ignoring Edgar, who stood in the back garden
ready to make some of his silly faces at them. The children couldn't help
thinking he must be a bit mad. He didn't behave at all like a boy of Julian's
age.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
they came back it was about ten minutes to nine. &quot;We'll sit in the
sitting-room till the telephone rings,&quot; said Julian. &quot;We don't want
Mrs. Stick to answer it first.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
to their great dismay, as they reached the house, they heard Mrs. Stick using
the telephone in the hall!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes,
sir,&quot; they heard her say, &quot;everything is quite all right. I can
manage the children, sir, even if they do make things a bit difficult. Yes,
sir. Of course, sir. Well, sir, it's lucky my husband is home on leave from his
ship, sir, because he can help me round, like, and it makes things easier.
Don't you worry about nothing, sir, and don't you bother to come back till
you're ready. I'll manage everything.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
flew into the hall like a wild thing, and snatched the receiver out of Mrs.
Stick's hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Father!
It's me, George! How's Mother? Tell me quick!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No
worse, George,&quot; said her father's voice. &quot;But we shan't know anything
definite till tomorrow morning. I'm glad to hear from Mrs. Stick that
everything is all right. I'm very upset and worried, and I'm glad to feel I can
tell your Mother that you are all right, and everything is going smoothly at
Kirrin Cottage.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;But
it isn't,&quot; said George, wildly. &quot;It isn't. It's all horrid. Can't the
Sticks go and let us manage things by ourselves?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Good
gracious me, of course not,&quot; said her father's voice, surprised and
annoyed. &quot;What can you be thinking of? I did hope, George, that you would
be sensible and helpful. I must say...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You
talk to him, Julian,&quot; said George, helplessly, and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>thrust
the receiver into Julian's hand. The boy put it to his ear and spoke into the
telephone in his clear voice.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Good
morning, sir. This is Julian! I'm glad my aunt is no worse.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
she will be if she thinks things are going wrong at Kirrin Cottage,&quot; said
Uncle Quentin, in an exasperated voice. &quot;Can't you manage George and make
her see reason? Good gracious, can't she put up with the Sticks for a week or
two? I tell you frankly, Julian, I am not going to sack the Sticks in my
absence—I want the house ready for me to bring back your aunt. If you can't put
up with them, you had better find out from your own parents if they can take
you back for the rest of the holidays. But George is not to go with you. She is
to stay at Kirrin Cottage. That's my last word on the subject.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;But,
sir,&quot; began Julian, wondering how in the world he could deal properly with
his hot-tempered uncle, &quot;I must tell you that . . .&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a click at the other end of the &quot;phone. Uncle Quentin had put down his
receiver and gone. There was no more to be said. Blow! Julian pursed up his
mouth and looked round at the others, frowning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;He's
gone!&quot; he said. &quot;Cut me off just as I was trying to reason with
him.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Serves
you right!&quot; said Mrs. Stick's harsh voice from the end of the hall.
&quot;Now you know where you stand. I'm here and I'm staying here, on your
uncle's orders. And you're all going to behave yourselves, or it'll be the
worse for you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Six.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>JULIAN
DEFEATS THE STICKS.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THERE
was a slam. The kitchen door shut, and Mrs. Stick could be heard telling the
news triumphantly to Edgar and Mr. Stick. The children went into the
sitting-room, sat down and stared at one another gloomily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Father's
awful!&quot; said George, furiously. &quot;He never will listen to
anything.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
after all, he is very upset,&quot; said Dick, reasonably. &quot;It was a great
pity that he rang before nine, so that Mrs. Stick got her say in first.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What
did Father say to you?&quot; said George. &quot;Tell us exactly.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;He
said that if we couldn't put up with the Sticks, Anne and Dick and I were to go
back to our own parents,&quot; said Julian. &quot;But you were to stay
here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
stared at Julian. &quot;Well,&quot; she said at last, &quot;you can't put up
with the Sticks, so you'd better all go back. I can look after myself.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Don't
be an idiot!&quot; said Julian, giving her arm a friendly shake, &quot;You know
we wouldn't desert you. I can't say I look forward to the idea of being under
the thumb of the amiable Sticks for a week or two, but there are worse things
than that. We'll &quot;stick&quot; it together.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the feeble little joke didn't raise a smile, even from Anne. The idea of being
under the Sticks&quot; three thumbs<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>was
a most unpleasant prospect. Timothy put his head on George's knee. She patted
him and looked round.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You
go back home,&quot; she said to the others. &quot;I've got a plan of my own,
and you're not in it. I've got Timmy, and he'll look after me. Telephone to
your parents and go home tomorrow.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
stared round defiantly. Her head was up, and there was no doubt but that she
had made a plan of some sort.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
felt uneasy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Don't
be silly,&quot; he said. &quot;I tell you we all stand together in this. If you've
got a plan, we'll come into it. But we're staying here with you, whatever
happens.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Stay
if you like,&quot; said George, &quot;but my plan goes on, and you'll find
you'll have to go home in the end. Come on, Timothy! Let's go to Jim and see if
my boat is ready.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'll
go with you,&quot; said Dick. He was sorry for George. He could see below her
defiance, and he knew she was very unhappy, worried about her mother, angry
with her father, and upset because she felt the others were staying on because
of her, when they could go back home and have a lovely time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was not a happy day. George was very stand-offish, and kept on insisting that
the others should go back home and leave her. She grew quite angry when they
were as insistent that they would not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You're
spoiling my plan,&quot; she said at last. &quot;You might go back, you really
might. I tell you, you're spoiling my plan completely.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
what is your plan?&quot; said Julian impatiently. &quot;I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>can't
help feeling you're just pretending you've got a plan, so that we'll go.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I'm
not pretending,&quot; said George, losing her temper. &quot;Do I ever pretend?
You know I don't! If I say I've got a plan, I have got a plan. But I'm not
giving it away, so it's no good asking me. It's my own secret, private
plan.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
I really do think you might tell us,&quot; said Dick, quite hurt. &quot;After
all, we're your best friends, aren't we? And we're going to stick by you, plan
or no plan—yes, even if we spoil your plan, as you say, we shall still stay
here with you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
shan't let you spoil my plan,&quot; said George, her eyes flashing.
&quot;You're mean. You're against me, just like the Sticks are.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh,
George, don't,&quot; said Anne, almost in tears. &quot;Don't let's quarrel.
It's bad enough quarrelling with those awful Sticks, without us quarrelling
too.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George's
temper died down as quickly as it had risen. She looked ashamed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Sorry!&quot;
she said. &quot;I'm an idiot. I won't quarrel. But I do mean what I say. I
shall go on with my plan, and I shan't tell you what it is, because if I do, it
will spoil the holidays for you. Please believe me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Let's
take our dinner out with us again,&quot; said Julian, getting up. &quot;We'll
all feel better away from this house today. I'll go and tackle the old
Stick.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Dear
old Ju, isn't he brave!&quot; said Anne, who would rather have died than go and
face Mrs. Stick at that moment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.<span

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>victorious
at the time, and was also very annoyed to find that her beautiful meat-pie and
jam-tarts had disappeared. Mr. Stick was in the middle of telling her where
they had gone when Julian appeared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;How
you can expect sandwiches for a picnic when you've stolen my meat-pie and
jam-tarts, I don't know!&quot; she began, indignantly. &quot;You can have dry
bread and jam for your-picnic, and that's all. And what's more, I wouldn't give
you that either except that I'm glad to be rid of you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Good
riddance to bad rubbish,&quot; murmured Edgar to himself. He was lying sprawled
on the sofa, reading some kind of highly-coloured comic paper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;If
you've anything to say to me, Edgar, come outside and say it,&quot; said
Julian, dangerously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You
leave Edgar alone,&quot; said Mrs. Stick, at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;There's
nothing I should like better,&quot; said Julian, scornfully. &quot;Who wants to
be with him? Cowardly little spotty-face!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Now,
now, look &quot;ere!&quot; began Mr. Stick, from his corner. . .<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
don't want to look at you,&quot; said Julian at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Now, look &quot;ere,&quot; said Mr.
Stick, angrily, standing up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I've
told you I don't want to,&quot; said Julian. &quot;You're not a pleasant
sight.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Insolence!&quot;
said Mrs. Stick, rapidly losing her temper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No,
not insolence—just the plain truth,&quot; said Julian, airily. Mrs. Stick
glared at him. Julian defeated her. He had such a ready tongue, and he said
everything so politely. The ruder his words were, the more politely he spoke.
Mrs. Stick didn't understand people like Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
felt that they were too clever for her. She hated the boy, and banged a
saucepan viciously down on the sink, wishing that it was Julian's head under
the saucepan instead of the sink.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Stinker
jumped up and growled at the sudden noise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Hallo,
Stinker!&quot; said Julian. &quot;Had a bath yet? Alas, no! — as smelly as
ever, aren't you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You
know that dog's name isn't Stinker,&quot; said Mrs. Stick, angrily. &quot;You
get out of my kitchen.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Right!&quot;
said Julian. &quot;Pleased to go. Don't bother about the dry bread and jam.
I'll manage something a bit better than that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went out, whistling. Stinker growled, and Edgar repeated loudly what he had
said beIore: &quot;Good riddance to bad rubbish!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What
did you say?&quot; said Julian, suddenly poking his head in at the kitchen door
again. But Edgar did not dare to repeat it, so off went Julian again, whistling
merrily, but not feeling nearly as merry as his whistle. He was worried. After
all, if Mrs. Stick was going to make meals as difficult as this, life was not
going to be very pleasant at Kirrin Cottage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Anyone
feel inclined to have dry bread and jam for lunch?&quot; inquired Julian, when
he returned to the others. &quot;Not? I rather thought so, so I turned down
Mrs. Stick's kind offer. I vote we go and buy something decent. That shop in
the village has good sausage-rolls.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was very silent all that day. She was worrying about her mother, the others
knew. She was probably thinking about her plan too, they thought, and wondered
whatever it could be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Shall
we go over to Kirrin Island today?&quot; asked Julian, thinking that it would
take George's mind off her worries, if they went to her beloved island.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
shook her head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;NoI
she said. &quot;I don't feel like it. The boat's all ready, I know—but I just
don't feel like it. You-see, till I know Mother is going to get better, I don't
feel I want to be out of reach of the house. If a telephone message came from
Father; the Sticks could always send Edgar to look for me—and if I was on the
island, he couldn't find me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children messed about that day, doing nothing at all. They went back to tea,
and Mrs. Stick provided them with bread and butter and jam, but no cake. The
milk was sour too, and everyone-had to have tea without milk, which they all
disliked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
they ate their tea, the children heard Edgar outside the window. He held a tin
bowl in his hand, and put it down on the grass outside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Your
dog's dinner,&quot; he yelled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;He
looks like a dog's dinner himself,&quot; said Dick, in disgust. &quot;Messy creature!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
made everyone laugh. &quot;Edgar, the Dog's Dinner!&quot; said Anne. &quot;Any
biscuits in that tin on the sideboard, do you think, George?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
got up to see. Timothy slipped out of doors and went to the dish put down
for.him. He sniffed at it. George, coming back from the sideboard, looked out
of the window as she passed and saw him. At once the thought of poison came
back to her mind and she yelled to Timothy, making the others jump out of their
skins.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>TIM!
TIM! Don't touch it!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timothy
wagged his tail as if to say he didn't mean to touch it, anyway. George rushed
out of doors, and picked up the mess of raw meat. She sniffed at it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You
haven't touched it, have you, Timothy?&quot; she said, anxiously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
leaned out of the window.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>.
&quot;No, he didn't eat any. I watched him. He sniffed all round and about it,
but he wouldn't touch it. I bet it's been dosed with rat-poison or
something.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was very white. &quot;Oh Timmy!&quot; she said. &quot;You're such a sensible
dog. You wouldn't touch poisoned stuff, would you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Woof!&quot;
said Timmy, decidedly. Stinker heard the bark and put his nose out of the
kitchen door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
called to him in a loud voice:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Stinker,
Stinker, come here! Timmy doesn't want his dinner. You can have it. Come along,
Stinker, here it is!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
came rushing out behind Stinker. &quot;Don't you give that to him,&quot; he
said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Why
not?&quot; asked George. &quot;Go on, Edgar—tell me why not.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;He
don't eat raw meat,&quot; said Edgar, after a pause. &quot;He only eats dog
biscuits.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;That's
a lie!&quot; said George, flaming up. &quot;I saw him eating meat yesterday.
Here, Stinker — you come and eat this.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
snatched the bowl from George, almost snarling at her, and ran indoors at top
speed. George was about to go after him, but Julian, who had jumped out of the
window when Edgar came up, stopped her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No
good, old thing!&quot; he said. &quot;You won't get anything out of him. The
meat's probably at the back of the kitchen fire by now. From now on, we feed
Timothy ourselves with meat bought from the butcher with our own money. Don't
be afraid that he'll eat poisoned stuff. He's too wise a dog for that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;He
might, if he was terribly, awfully hungry, Julian,&quot; said George, looking
rather green now. She felt sick inside. &quot;I wasn't going to let Stinker eat
that poisoned stuff, of course, but I guessed that if.it was poisoned, one of
the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sticks
would come rushing out and stop Stinker eating it. And Edgar did. So it proves
it was poisoned, doesn't it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
rather think it does,&quot; said Julian. &quot;But don't worry, George. Timmy
won't be poisoned.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;But
he might, he might,&quot; said George, putting her hand on the big dog's head.
&quot;Oh, I can't bear the thought of it, Julian. I can't, I really
can't.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Don't
think about it then,&quot; said Julian, taking her indoors again. &quot;Here,
have a biscuit!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You
don't think the Sticks would poison us, do you?&quot; said Anne, looking
suddenly scared and gazing at her biscuit as if it might bite her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No,
idiot. They only want to get Timmy out of the way because he guards us so
well,&quot; said Julian. &quot;Don't look so scared. All this will settle down
in a day or two, and we'll have a grand time after all. You'll see!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Julian only said this to comfort his little sister. Secretly he was very
worried. He wished he could take Anne, Dick and George back to his own home.
But he knew George wouldn't come. And how could they leave her to the Sticks?
It was quite impossible. Friends must stick together, and somehow they must
face things until Aunt Fanny and Uncle Quentin came back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Seven.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>BETTER
NEWS.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Do
you think we'd better slip down after the Sticks have gone to bed and get some
food out of the larder again?&quot; said Dick, when no supper appeared that
evening. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
didn't feel inclined to sneak down and confront Mr. Stick again. Not that he
was afraid of him, but the whole thing was so unpleasant. This was their house,
the food was theirs—so why should they have to beg for it, or take it on the
sly? It was ridiculous.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Come
here, Timothy!&quot; said Julian. The dog left George's side and went to
Julian, looking up at the boy inquiringly. &quot;You're going to come with me
and persuade dear kind Mrs. Stick to give us the best things out of the
larder!&quot; said Julian, with a grin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others laughed, cheering up at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Good
idea!&quot; said Dick. &quot;Can we all come and see the fun.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Better
not,&quot; said Julian. &quot;I can manage fine by myself.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went down the passage to the kitchen. The radio was going inside, so no one in
the kitchen heard Julian till he was actually standing inside the door. Then
Edgar looked up and saw Timothy as well as Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
was scared of the big dog, who was now growling fiercely. He went behind the
kitchen sofa and stayed there, eyeing Timmy fearfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What
do you want?&quot; said Mrs. Stick, turning off the radio.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Supper,&quot;
said Julian, pleasantly. &quot;Supper! The best things out of the larder—bought
with my uncle's money, cooked on my aunt's stove with gas she pays for—yes,
supper! Open the larder door and let's see what there is in there.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
of all the nerve!&quot; began Mr. Stick, in amazement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You
can have a loaf of bread and some cheese,&quot; said Mrs. Stick, &quot;and
that's my last word.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
it isn't my last word,&quot; said Julian, and he went to the larder door.
Timmy, keep to heel! Growl all you like, but don't bite anybody—yet!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy's
growls were really frightful. Even Mr. Stick put himself at the other end of
the room. As for Stinker, he was nowhere to be seen. He had gone into the
scullery at the very first growl, and was how shivering behind the wringer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Stick's mouth went into a hard straight line. &quot;You take the bread and
cheese and clear out,&quot; she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
opened the larder door, whistling softly, which annoyed Mrs. Stick more than
anything else. &quot;My word!&quot; said Julian, admiringly. &quot;You do know
how to stock a larder, I must say, Mrs. Stick. A roast chicken! I thought I
smelt one cooking. I suppose Mr. Stick killed one of our chickens today. I
thought I heard a lot of squawking. And what fine tomatoes! Best to be got from
the village, I've no doubt. And oh, Mrs. Stick—what a perfectly marvellous
treacle tart! I must say you're a good cook, I really must.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
picked up the chicken, the dish of tomatoes, and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>then
balanced the plate with the treacle tart on the top.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Stick yelled at him. &quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You
leave them things alone! That's our supper! You leave them there.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You've
made a little mistake,&quot; said Julian, politely. It's our supper! We've had
very little to eat today, and we could do with a good supper. Thanks
awfully!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Now
look &quot;ere!&quot; began Mr. Stick, angrily, furious at seeing his lovely
supper walking away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You
surely don't want me to look at you again,&quot; said Julian, in a tone of
amazement. &quot;What for? Have you shaved yet—or washed? I'm afraid not. So,
if you don't mind I think I'd rather not look at you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Stick was speechless. He was not ready with his tongue at any time, and a boy
like Julian took his breath away, and left him with nothing to say except his
favourite &quot;Now, look 'ere!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Put
them things down,&quot; said Mrs. Stick sharply. &quot;What do you think we're
going to have for our supper if you walk off with them; you tell me that!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Easy!&quot;
said Julian. &quot;Let me offer you our supper—bread and cheese, Mrs. Stick,
bread and cheese!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Stick made an angry noise, and started to go after Julian with her hand raised.
But Timothy immediately leapt at her, and his teeth snapped together with a
loud click.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh!&quot;
howled Mrs. Stick. &quot;That dog of yours nearly took my hand off! The brute!
I'll do for him one day, you see if I don't.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You
had a good try today, didn't you?&quot; said Julian, in a quiet voice, fixing
his eyes straight on the woman's face. &quot;That's a matter for the police,
isn't it? Be careful, Mrs. Stick. I've a good mind to go to the police
tomorrow.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Just
as before, the mention of the police seemed to frighten Mrs. Stick. She cast a
look at her husband and took a step backward. Julian wondered if the man had
done something wrong and was hiding from the police. He never seemed to put a
foot out of doors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy went up the passage triumphantly. Timmy followed at his heels, disappointed
that he hadn't been able to get a nibble at Stinker. Julian marched into the
sitting-room, and set the dishes carefully down on the table.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What
ho!&quot; he said. &quot;Look what I've got—the Sticks&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>own
supper!&quot; Then he told the others all that had happened, and they laughed
loudly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;How
do you think of all those things to say?&quot; said Anne, admiringly. &quot;I
don't wonder you make them feel wild, Ju. It's a good thing we've got Timmy to
back us up.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes,
I shouldn't feel nearly so bold without Timmy,&quot; said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was a very good supper. There were knives and forks in the sideboard, and the
children made do with fruit plates from the sideboard too, rather than go and
get plates from the kitchen. There was bread over from their tea, so they were
able to make a very good meal. They enjoyed it thoroughly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Sorry
we can't give you the chicken bones, Tim,&quot; said George, &quot;but they
might split inside you and injure you. You can have all the scraps. See you
don't leave any for Stinker!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
didn't. With two or three great gulps he cleared his plate, and then sat
waiting for any scraps of treacle tart that might descend his way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children felt cheerful after such a good meal. They had completely eaten the
chicken. Nothing was left except a pile of bones. They had eaten all the
tomatoes too, finished the bread, and enjoyed every scrap of the treacle tart.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was late, Anne yawned, and then George yawned too. &quot;Let's go to bed,&quot;
she said. &quot;I don't feel like having a game of cards or anything.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
they went to bed, and as usual Timothy lay heavily on George's feet. He lay
there awake for some time, his<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ears
cocked to hear noises from below. He heard the Sticks go up to bed. He heard
doors closing. He heard a whine from Stinker. Then all was silence. Timmy dropped
his head on to his paws and slept—but he kept one ear cocked for danger.
Timothy didn't trust the Sticks any more than the children did!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children awoke very early in the morning. Julian awoke first. It was a
marvellous day. Julian went to the window and looked out. The sky was a very
pale blue, and rosy-pink clouds floated about it. The sea was a clean blue too,
smooth and calm. Julian remembered what Anne often said—she said that the world
in the early morning always looked as if it had come back fresh from the
laundry — so clean and new and fresh!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children all bathed before breakfast, and this time they were back at half-past
eight, afraid that George's father might telephone early again. Julian saw Mrs.
Stick on the stairs and called to her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Has
my uncle telephoned yet?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No,&quot;
said the woman, in a surly tone. She had been hoping that the telephone would
ring while the children were out, then, as she had done the day before, she
could answer it, and get a few words in first.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'll
have breakfast now, please,&quot; said Julian. &quot;A. good breakfast, Mrs.
Stick. My uncle might ask us what we'd had for breakfast, mightn't he? You
never know.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Stick evidently thought that Julian might tell his uncle if she gave them only
bread and butter for breakfast, so very soon the children smelt a delicious
smell of bacon frying. Mrs. Stick brought in a dish of it garnished with
tomatoes. She banged it down on the table with the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>plates.
Edgar arrived with a pot of tea and a tray of cups and saucers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Ah,
here is dear Edgar!&quot; said Julian, in a tone of amiable surprise.
&quot;Dear old spotty-face!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Garn!&quot;
said Edgar, and banged down the teapot. Timmy growled, and Edgar fled for his
life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
didn't want any breakfast. Julian put hers back in the warm dish and put a
plate over it. He knew that she was waiting for news. If only the telephone
would ring—then she would know if her mother was really better or not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
did ring as they were halfway through the meal. George was there before the
bell had stopped pealing. She put the receiver to her ear. &quot;Father! Yes,
it's George. How's Mother?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a pause as George listened. All the children stopped eating and listened in
silence, waiting for George to speak. They would know by her next words if the
news was good or not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh—oh,
I'm so glad!&quot; they heard George say. &quot;Did she have the operation
yesterday? Oh, you never told me! But it's all right now, is it? Poor Mother!
Give her my love. I do want to see her. Oh Father, can't I come?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Evidently
the answer was no. George listened for a while, then spoke a few more words and
said good-bye.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
ran into the sitting-room. &quot;You heard, didn't you?&quot; she said,
joyfully. &quot;Mother's better. She'll get all right now, and will be back
home soon—in about ten days. Father won't come back till he brings her home.
It's good news about Mother—but I'm afraid we can't get rid of the
Sticks.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Eight. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>GEORGE'S
PLAN.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>MRS.
STICK had overheard the conversation on the telephone—at least, she had heard
George's side of it. She knew that George's mother was better and that her
father would not return till her mother could be brought home. That would be in
about ten days! The Sticks could have a fine time till then, no doubt about
that!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
suddenly found that her appetite had come back. She ate her bacon hungrily, and
scraped the dish round with a piece of bread. She had three cups of tea, and
then sat back contentedly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
feel better,&quot; she said. Anne slipped her hand in hers. She was very glad
that her aunt was going to be all right. If it wasn't for those awful Sticks
they could have a lovely time. Then George said something that made Julian
cross.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
now that I know Mother is going to be better, I can stand up to the Sticks all
right by myself with Timmy. So I want you three to go back home and finish the
hols without me. I shall be all right.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Shut
up, George,&quot; said Julian. &quot;We've argued this all out before. I've
made up my mind—and I don't change it, any more than you. do, when I've made it
up. You make me cross.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,&quot;
said George, &quot;I told you I'd got a plan—and you don't come into it, I'm
afraid—and you'll find<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>you'll
have to go back home whether you mean to or not.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Don't
be so mysterious, George!&quot; said Julian, impatiently. &quot;What is this
strange plan? You'd better tell us, even if we're not in it. Can't you trust
us?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes,
of course. But you might try to stop me,&quot; said George, looking sulky.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Then
you'd certainly better tell us,&quot; said Julian feeling uneasy. George was
such a madcap once she got ideas into her head. Goodness knows what she might
do!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
George wouldn't say another word. Julian gave it up at last, but secretly made
up his mind not to let George out of his sight that day. If she was going to
carry out some wild plan, then she would have to do it under his, Julian's,
eye!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
George didn't seem to be carrying out any wild plan. She bathed again with the
others, went for a walk with them, and went for a row on the sea. She didn't
want to go to Kirrin Island, so the others didn't press her, thinking that she
didn't want to be out of sight of the beach in case Edgar came with a message
from her father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was quite a pleasant day. The children bought sausage rolls again, and fruit,
and picnicked on the beach. Timmy had a large and juicy bone from the
butcher's.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I've
got a bit of shopping to do,&quot; said George, about tea-time. &quot;You
others go and see if Mrs. Stick is getting some tea for us, and I'll fly down
to the shops and get what I want.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
pricked up his ears at once. Was George sending them off so that she could be
alone to carry out this mysterious plan of hers?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I'll
come with you,&quot; said Julian, getting up. &quot;Dick can tackle Mrs. Stick
for once, and take Timmy with him.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No,
you go,&quot; said George. &quot;I won't be long.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Julian was determined not to go. In the end they all went with George, for Dick
did not want to face Mrs. Stick without Julian or George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
went into the little general shop and got a new battery for her torch. She
bought two boxes of matches, and a bottle of methylated spirit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Whatever
do you want that for?&quot; said Anne in surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh,
it might come in useful,&quot; said George, and said no more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went back to Kirrin Cottage. Tea was actually on the table! True, it was
not a thrilling tea, being merely bread and jam and a pot of hot tea—still it
was there, and was eatable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
rained that evening. The children sat round the table and played cards. Their
hearts were lighter now that they had had good news of George's mother. In the
middle of the game Julian got up and rang the bell. The others stared at him in
the greatest surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What
are you ringing the bell for?&quot; asked George, her eyes wide with
astonishment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;To
tell Mrs. Stick to bring some supper,&quot; said Julian, with a grin. But no
one answered the bell. So Julian rang again and then again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
kitchen door opened at last and Mrs. Stick came<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>up
the passage, evidently in a bad temper. She came into the sitting-room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>.
&quot;You stop ringing that bell!&quot; she said, angrily. &quot;I'm not
answering any bells rung by you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
rang it to tell you that we wanted some supper,&quot; said Julian, &quot;And to
say that if you would rather I came and got it myself from the larder—with
Timmy—as I did last night, I'll come with pleasure. But if not, you can bring a
decent supper to us yourself.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;If
you come stealing things out of my larder again, I'll—I'll . . .&quot; began
Mrs. Stick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You'll
call in the police!&quot; Julian finished for her. &quot;Do. That would please
us very much. I can see our local policeman taking down all the details in his
notebook. I could give him quite a few.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Stick muttered something rude under her breath, glared at Julian as if she
could kill him, and went off down the passage again. By the sound of the
clattering . and crashing of crockery in the kitchen it was plain that Mrs.
Stick was getting some sort of supper for them, and Julian grinned to himself
as he dealt out the cards.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Supper
was not as good as the night before, but it was not bad. It was a little cold
ham, cheese and the remains of a milk pudding. There was also a plate of cooked
meat for Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
looked at it sharply. &quot;Take that away,&quot; she said. &quot;I bet you've
poisoned it again. Take it away!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No.
On the contrary, leave it here,&quot; said Julian. &quot;I'll take it down to
the local chemist tomorrow and get him. to test it. If, as George thinks, it's
poisoned, the chemist might have a lot of interesting things to tell us.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Stick took the meat away without a word. &quot;Horrible woman!&quot; said
George, pulling Timothy close to her. &quot;How I hate her! I feel so afraid
for Timmy.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Somehow
that spoilt the evening. As it grew dark the children became sleepy. &quot;It's
ten o'clock,&quot; said Julian. &quot;Bed, I think, everyone! Anne ought to
have gone long ago. She isn't nearly old enough to stay up as late as
this.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well!&quot;
began Anne, indignantly. &quot;I'm nearly as old as George, aren't I? I can't
help being younger, can I?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;All
right, all right!&quot; said Julian laughing. &quot;I shan't make you go off to
bed by yourself, don't worry. We all keep together in this house while the
Sticks are about. Come on! We'll go now, shall we?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children were tired. They had swum, walked and rowed that day. Julian tried to
keep awake a little while, but he too fell asleep very quickly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
awoke with a jump, thinking that he had heard a. noise. But everything was
quiet. What could the noise have been? Was it one of the Sticks creeping about?
No—it couldn't be that, or Tim would have barked the house down. Then what was
it? Something must have waked him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
suppose it's not old George doing anything about that plan of hers!&quot;
thought Julian, suddenly. He sat up, He felt about for his dressing-gown and
put it on. Without waking Dick he crept to the girls&quot; room, and switched
on his torch to see that they were all right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
was in her bed, sleeping peacefully. But George's bed was empty. George's
clothes were gone!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Blow!&quot;
said Julian, under his breath. &quot;Where has she gone? I bet she's run away
to find where her mother is!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
torch picked out a white &quot;envelope pinned to George's pillow. He stepped
softly over to it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
had his name printed on it in bold letters. &quot;JULIAN.&quot; . Julian ripped
it open and read it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Dear
JULIAN,&quot; said the note,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Don't
be angry with me, please. I daren't stay in Kirrin Cottage any longer in case
the Sticks somehow poison Timmy. You know that would break my heart. So I've
gone to live by myself on our island till Mother and Father come back. Please
leave a note for Father and tell him to ask Jim to sail near Kirrin Island with
his little red flag flying from the mast as soon as they are back. Then I'll
come home. You and Dick and Anne must go back to your own parents now I've
gone. It would be silly to stay at Kirrin Cottage with the Sticks now I'm not
there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Love
from<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>GEORGE.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
read the note through. &quot;Well, why didn't I guess that was her plan!&quot;
he said to himself. &quot;That's why we didn't come into it! She meant to go
off by herself with Timmy. I can't let her do that. She can't live all by
herself on Kirrin Island for so long. She might fall ill. She might slip on a
rock and hurt herself, and no one would ever know!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>.
The boy was really worried about the determined little girl. He wondered what
to do. That noise he heard must have been made by George. So she couldn't have
got a very long start really. If he tore down to the beach,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
might still be there, and he could stop her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So,
in his dressing gown, he ran down the front path, out of the gate, and took the
road to the beach. The rain had stopped, and the stars were out. But it was not
at all a light night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;How
can George expect to get through those rocks in the dark,&quot; he thought.
&quot;She's mad! She'll strike her boat on a rock, and sink.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
tore on in the darkness, talking aloud to himself. &quot;No wonder she wanted a
new battery for her torch, and matches—and I suppose the methylated spirit was
for her little cooking stove! Why ever couldn't she tell us? It would have been
fun to go with her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
came to the beach. He saw the light of a torch where George kept her boat. He
ran to it, his feet sinking in the soft wet sand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;George!
Idiot! You're not to go off like this all alone, in the dead of night!&quot;
called Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was pushing her boat out into the water. She jumped when she heard Julian's
voice. &quot;You can't stop me!&quot; she said. &quot;I'm just off!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Julian caught hold of the boat, as he waded up to his waist in the water.
&quot;George, listen to mej You can't go like this. You'll strike a rock. Come
back!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No,&quot;
said George, getting cross. &quot;You can go back to your own home, Julian. I
shall be all right. Let go my boat!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;George,
why didn't you tell me your plan?&quot; said Julian, almost swept off his feet
by a wave. &quot;Dash these waves! I shall have to get into the boat.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
climbed in. He could not see George, but he felt<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>quite
certain she was glaring at him. Timmy licked his wet legs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You're
spoiling everything,&quot; said George, with a break in her voice that meant
she was upset.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I'm
not, silly!&quot; said Julian, in a gentle voice. &quot;Listen!—you come back
to Kirrin Cottage with me now, George. And I'll faithfully promise you
something. Tomorrow we'll all go to the island with you. See? The whole lot of
us. Why shouldn't we? Your mother said we could spend a week there, anyway,
didn't she? We shall be out of the reach of those horrible Sticks. We shall enjoy
ourselves, and have a marvellous time. So will you come back now, George, and
let us go together tomorrow?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Nine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>AN
EXCITING NIGHT.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THERE
was a silence, except for the waves splashing round the boat. Then George's
voice came out of the darkness, lifted joyfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh
Julian—do you really mean it? Will you really come with me? I was afraid I'd
get into trouble for doing this, because Father said I must stay at Kirrin
Cottage till he came back—and you know how he hates disobedience. But I knew if
I stayed there, you would too—and I didn't want you to be miserable with those
horrid Sticks—so I thought I'd come away. I didn't think you'd come too,
because of getting into trouble! I never even thought of asking you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You're
a very stupid person sometimes, aren't you, George?&quot; said Julian. &quot;As
if we'd care about getting into trouble, so long as we were all together,
sticking by one another! Of course we'll come with you—and I'll take all the
responsibility for this escape, and tell your father it's my fault.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh
no you won't,&quot; said George, quickly. &quot;I shall say it was my idea. If
I do wrong, I'm not afraid to own up to it. You know that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
we won't argue that now,&quot; said Julian. &quot;We shall have at least a week
or ten days on Kirrin Island to do all the arguing we want to. The thing
is—let's get back now, wake up the others for a bit, and have a nice quiet<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>talk
in the dead of night about this plan of yours. I must say it's a very, very
good idea!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was overjoyed. &quot;I feel as if I could hug you, Julian,&quot; she said.
&quot;Where are the oars? Oh, here they are! The boat's floated quite a long
way out.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
rowed strongly back to the shore. Julian jumped out and pulled the boat up the
beach, with George's help. He shone his torch into the boat and gave an
exclamation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You've
quite a nice little store of things here,&quot; he said. &quot;Bread and ham
and butter and stuff. How did you manage to get them without old Mr. Stick
seeing you tonight? I suppose you slipped down and got them out of the
larder?&quot; &quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes,
I did,&quot; said George. &quot;But there was no one in the kitchen tonight.
Perhaps Mr. Stick has gone to sleep upstairs. Or maybe he has gone back to his
ship. Anyway, there was no one there when I crept down, not even Stinker.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'd
better leave them here,&quot; said Julian. &quot;Stuff them into that locker
and shut down the lid. No one will guess there's anything there. We'll have to
bring down a lot more stuff if we're all going to live on the island. Golly,
this is going to be fun!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children made their way back to the house, feeling thrilled and excited.
Julian's wet dressing-gown flapped round his legs, and he pulled it up high to
be out of the way. Timothy gambolled round, not seeming at all surprised at the
night's doings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
they got back to the house they woke the other two, who listened in
astonishment to what had happened<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>that
night. Anne was so excited to think that they were all going to live on the
island that she raised her voice in joy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh!
That's the loveliest thing that could happen! Oh, I do think . . .&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Shut
up!&quot; said three furious voices in loud whispers. &quot;You'll wake the
Sticks!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Sorry!&quot;
whispered Anne. &quot;But oh—it's so terribly, awfully exciting.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
began to discuss their plans. &quot;If we go for a week or ten days, we must
take plenty of stores,&quot; said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;The
thing is—can we possibly find food enough for so long? Even if we entirely
empty the larder I doubt if that would be enough for a week or so. We all seem
such hungry people, somehow.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Julian,&quot;
said George, suddenly remembering something, &quot;I know what we'll do! Mother
has a store-cupboard in her room. She keeps dozens and dozens of tins of food
there, in case we ever get snowed up in the winter, and can't go to the
village. That has happened once or twice you know. And I know where Mother
keeps the key! Can't we open the cupboard and get out some tins?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Of
course!&quot; said Julian, delighted. &quot;I know Aunt Fanny wouldn't mind.
And anyway, we can make a list of what we take and replace them for her, if she
does mind. It will be my birthday soon, and I am sure to get money then.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Where's
the key?&quot; whispered Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Let's-go
into Mother's room, and I'll show you where<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>she
keeps it,&quot; said George. &quot;I only hope she hasn't&quot; taken it with
her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
George's mother had felt far too ill when she left home to think of cupboard
keys. George fumbled at the back of a drawer in the dressing-table and brought
out two or three keys tied together with thin string. She fitted first one and
then another into a cupboard set in the wall. The second one opened the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
shone his torch into the cupboard. It was filled with tins of food of all
kinds, neatly arranged on the shelves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Golly!&quot;
said Dick, his eyes gleaming. &quot;Soup—tins of meat—tins of fruit—tinned
milk—sardines—tinned butter—biscuits—tinned vegetables! There's everything we
want here!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes,&quot;
said Julian, pleased. &quot;It's fine. We'll take all we can carry. Is there a
sack or two anywhere about, George, do you know?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
the tins were quietly packed into two sacks. The cupboard door was shut and
locked again. The children stole to their own rooms once more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
that's the biggest problem solved—food,&quot; said Julian. &quot;We'll raid the
larder too, and take what bread there is—and cake. What about water, George? Is
there any on the island?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
I suppose there is some in that old well,&quot; said George, thinking,
&quot;but as there's no bucket or anything, we can't get any. I was taking a
big container of fresh water with me—but we'd better fill two or three more now
you are all coming! I know where there are some, quite clean and new.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
they filled some containers with fresh water, and put them with the sacks,
ready to take to the boat. It was so exciting doing all these things in the
middle of the night! Anne could hardly keep her voice down to a whisper, and it
was a wonder that Timothy didn't bark, for he sensed the excitement of the
others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a tin of cakes in the larder, freshly made, so those were added to the heap
that was forming in the front garden. There was a large joint of meat too, and
George wrapped it in a cloth and put that with the heap,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>telling
Timmy in a fierce voice that if he so much as sniffed at it she would leave him
behind!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I've
got my little stove for boiling water on, or heating up anything,&quot; whispered
George. &quot;It's in the boat. That's what I bought the methylated spirit for,
of course. You didn't guess, did you? And the matches for lighting it. I
say—what about candles? We can't use our torches all the time, the batteries
would soon run out.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
found a pound of candles in the kitchen cupboard, a kettle, a saucepan, some
old knives and forks and spoons, and a good many other things they thought they
might possibly want. They also came across some small bottles of ginger-beer,
evidently stored for their own use by the Sticks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;All
bought out of my mother's money!&quot; said George. &quot;Well, we'll take the
ginger-beer too. It will be nice to drink it on a hot day.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Where
are we going to sleep at night?&quot; said Julian. &quot;In that ruined part of
the old castle, where there is just one room with a roof left, and walls?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;That's
where I planned to sleep,&quot; said George. &quot;I was going to make my bed
of some of the heather that grows on the island, covered by a rug or two, which
I've got down in the boat.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'll
take all the rugs we can find,&quot; said Julian. &quot;And some cushions for
pillows. I say, isn't this simply thrilling? I don't know when I've felt so
excited. I feel like a prisoner .escaping to freedom! Won't the Sticks be
amazed when they find us gone!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes
— we'll have to decide what to say to them,&quot; said George, rather soberly.
&quot;We don't .want them sending<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>people
after us to the island, making us come back. I don't think they should know
we've gone there.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'll
discuss that later,&quot; said Dick. &quot;The thing is to get everything to
the boat while it's dark. It will soon be dawn.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;How
are we going to get all this down to George's boat?&quot; said Anne, looking at
the enormous pile of goods by the light of her torch. &quot;We'll never be able
to carry them all!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Certainly
it looked a great pile. Julian had an idea, as usual. &quot;Are there any
barrows in the shed?&quot; he asked George. &quot;If we could pile the things
into a couple of barrows, we could easily take everything in one journey. We
could wheel the barrows along on the sandy side of the road so that we don't
make any noise.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh,
good idea!&quot; said George, delighted. &quot;I wish I'd thought of that
before. I had to make about five journeys to and from the boat when I took my
own things. There are two barrows in the shed. We'll get them. One has a
squeaky wheel, but we'll hope no one hears it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Stinker
heard the squeak, as he lay in a corner of Mrs. Stick's room. He pricked up his
ears and growled softly. He did not dare to bark, for he was afraid of bringing
Timothy up. Mrs. Stick did not hear the growl. She slept soundly, not even
stirring. She had no idea what was going on downstairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
things were all stowed into the boat. The children didn't like leaving them
there unguarded. In the end they decided to leave Dick there, sleeping on the
rugs. They stood thinking for a moment before they went back without Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
do hope we've remembered all we shall want,&quot; said George, wrinkling up her
forehead. &quot;Golly—I know! We haven't remembered a tin-opener—nor a thing to
take off the tops of the ginger-beer bottles. They've got those little tin lids
that have to be forced off by an opener.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'll
put those in our pockets when we get back to the house and find them,&quot;
said Julian. &quot;I remember seeing some in the sideboard drawer. Good-bye,
Dick. We'll be down very early to row off. We must get some bread at the
baker's as soon as he opens, because we've got hardly any, and we'll see if we
can pick up a very large bone at the butcher's for Timmy. George has got a bag
of biscuits in the boat for him too.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
three of them set off back to the house with Timmy, leaving Dick curled up
comfortably on the rugs. He soon fell asleep again, his face upturned to the
stars that would soon fade from the sky.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others talked about what to tell the Sticks. &quot;I think we won't tell them
anything,&quot; said Julian, at last. &quot;I don't particularly want to tell
them deliberate lies, and I'm certainly not going to tell them the truth. I
know what we'll do—there is a train that leaves the station about eight o'clock,
which would be the one we'd catch if we were going back to our own home. We'll
find a time-table, leave it open on the dining-room table, as if we'd been
looking up a train, and then we'll all set off across the moor at the back of
the house, as if we were going to the station.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh
yes—then the Sticks will think we've run away, and gone to catch; the train
back home,&quot; said Anne. &quot;They will never guess we've gone to the
island.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;That's
a good idea,&quot; said George, pleased. &quot;But how shall we know when
Father and Mother get back?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Is
there anyone you could leave a message with—somebody you could really
trust?&quot; asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
thought hard. &quot;There's Alf the fisher-boy,&quot; she said at last.
&quot;He used to look after Tim for me when I wasn't allowed to have him in the
house. I know he'd not give us away.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'll
call on Alf before we go then,&quot; said Julian. &quot;Now, let's look for
that time-table and lay it open on the table at the right place.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
hunted for the time-table, found the right page, and underlined the train they
hoped that the Sticks would think they were catching. They found the tin and
bottle openers,and put them into their pockets. Julian found two or three more
boxes of matches too. He thought two would not last long enough.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>By
this time dawn had come and the house was being flooded with early sunshine.
&quot;I wonder if the baker is open,&quot; said Julian. &quot;We might as well
go and see. It's about six o'clock.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went to the baker. He was not open, but the new loaves had already been made.
The baker was outside, sunning himself. He had baked his bread at night, ready
to sell it new-made in the morning. He grinned at the children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Up
early today,&quot; he said. &quot;What, you want some of my loaves—how many?
Six! Good gracious, whatever for?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;To
eat,&quot; said George, grinning. Julian paid for six enormous loaves, and they
went to the butcher's. His shop was not open either, but the butcher himself
was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>sweeping
the path outside. &quot;Could we buy a very big bone for Timmy, please?&quot;
asked George. She got an enormous one, and Timmy looked at it longingly. Such a
bone would last him for days, he knew!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Now,&quot;
said Julian, as they set off to the boat, &quot;we'll pack these things into
the boat, then'go back to the house, and make a noise so that the Sticks know we're
there. Then we'll set off across the moors, and hope the Sticks will think we
are making for the train.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
woke Dick, who was still sleeping peacefully in the boat, and packed in the
bread and bone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Take
the boat into the next cove,&quot; said George. &quot;Can you do that? We shall
be hidden there from anyone on the beach then. The fishermen are all out in
their boats, fishing. We shan't be seen, if we set offin about an hour's time.
We'll be back by then.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went back to the house and made a noise as if they were just getting up. George
whistled to Timmy, and Julian sang at the top of his voice. Then, with a great
banging of doors they set out down the path and cut across the moors, in full
sight of the kitchen window.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Hope
the Sticks won't notice Dick isn't with us,&quot; said Julian, seeing Edgar
staring out of the window. &quot;I expect they'll think he's gone ahead.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
kept to the path until they came to a dip, where they were hidden from any
watcher at Kirrin Cottage. Then they took another path that led them, unseen,
to the cove where Dick had taken the boat. He was there, waiting anxiously for
them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Ahoy
there!&quot; yelled Julian, in excitement. &quot;The adventure is about to
begin.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Ten.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>KIRRIN
ISLAND ONCE MORE!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THEY
all clambered into the boat. Timothy leapt in lightly and ran to the prow,
where he always stood. His tongue hung out in excitement. He knew quite well
that something was up—and he was in it! No wonder he panted and wagged his tail
hard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Off
we go!&quot; said Julian, taking the oars. &quot;Sit over there a bit, Anne.
The luggage is weighing &quot;down the boat awfully the other end. Dick, sit by
Anne to keep the balance better. That's right. Off we go!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
off they went in George's boat, rocking up and down on the waves. The sea was
fairly calm, but a good breeze blew through their hair. The water splashed
round the boat and made a nice gurgly, friendly noise. The children all felt
very happy. They were on their own. They were escaping from the horrid Sticks.
They were going to stay on Kirrin Island, with the rabbits and gulls and
jackdaws.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Doesn't
that new-made bread smell awfully good?&quot; said Dick, feeling very hungry as
usual. &quot;Can we just grab a bit, do you think?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes,
let's,&quot; said George. So they broke off bits of the warm brown crust, handed
some to Julian, who was rowing, and chewed the delicious new-made bread. Timmy
got a bit too, but his was gone as soon as it went into his mouth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Timmy's
funny,&quot; said Anne. &quot;He never eats his food as we do—he seems to drink
it—just takes it into his mouth and swallows it, as if it was water!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others laughed. &quot;He doesn't drink his bones.&quot; said George. &quot;He
always eats those all right—chews on them for hours and hours. Don't you,
Timothy?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Woof!&quot;
said Timmy, agreeing. He eyed the place where that enormous bone was, wishing
he could have it now. But the children wouldn't let him. They were afraid it
might go overboard, and that would be a pity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
don't believe anyone has noticed us going,&quot; said Julian. &quot;Except Alf
the fisher-boy, of course. We told him about going to the island, Dick, but
nobody else.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had called at Alf's house on their way to the cove. Alf was alone in the yard
at the back.: His mother was away and his father was out fishing. They had told
him their secret, and Alf had nodded his tousled head and promised faithfully
to tell nobody at all. He was evidently very proud at being trusted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;If
my mother and father come back, you must let us know,&quot; said George.
&quot;Sail as near the island as you dare, and hail us. You can get nearer to
it than anyone else.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I'll
do that,&quot; promised Alf, wishing he could go with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;So,
you see, Dick,&quot; said Julian, as he rowed out to the island, &quot;if by
any chance Aunt Fanny does return sooner than we expect, we shall know at once
and come back. I think we've planned everything very well.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes,
we have,&quot; said Dick. He turned and faced the island, which was coming
nearer. &quot;We shall soon be there. Isn't George going to take the oars and
guide the boat in?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes,&quot;
said George. &quot;We've come to the difficult bit now, where we've got to
weave our way in and out of the different rocks that keep sticking up. Give me
the oars,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ju.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
took the oars, and the others watched in admiration as the girl guided the big
boat skillfully in and out of the hidden rocks. She certainly was very clever.
They felt perfectly safe with her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boat slid into the little cove. It was a natural harbour, with the water
running up to a stretch of sand. High rocks sheltered it. The children jumped
out eagerly, and four pairs of willing hands tugged the boat quickly up the
sand. .<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Higher
up still,&quot; panted George. &quot;You know what awful storms suddenly blow
up in this bay. We want to be sure the boat is quite safe, no matter how high
the seas run.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boat soon lay on one side, high up the stretch of sand. The children sat down,
puffing and blowing. &quot;Let's have breakfast here,&quot; said Julian.
&quot;I don't feel like unloading all those heavy things at the moment. We'll
get what we want for breakfast, and have it here on this warm bit of
sand.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
got a loaf of new bread, some cold ham, a few tomatoes and a pot of jam. Anne
found knives and forks and plates. Julian opened two bottles of ginger-beer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Funny
sort of breakfast,&quot; he said, setting the bottles down on the sand,
&quot;But simply gorgeous when anyone is as hungry as we are.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
ate everything except about a third of the loaf. Timmy was given his bone and
some of his own biscuits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
crunched up the biscuits at once, and then sat down contentedly to gnaw the
fine bone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;How
nice to be Timmy—with no plate or knife or fork or cup to bother about,&quot;
said Anne, lying on her back in the sun, feeling that she really couldn't eat
anything more. &quot;Oh, if we are always going to have mixed-up meals like
this on the island, I shall never want to go back. Who would have thought that
ham and jam and ginger-beer would go so well together?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was thirsty. He sat with his tongue hanging out wishing that George would give
him a drink. He didn't like ginger-beer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
eyed him lazily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh
Timmy—are you thirsty?&quot; she said. &quot;Oh dear, J feel as if I really
can't get up! You'll have to wait a few minutes, then I'll go to the boat and
empty out some water for you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timothy couldn't wait. He went off to some nearby rocks, which were out of
reach of the sea. In a hole in one of them he found some rain-water, and he
lapped it up eagerly. The children heard him lapping it, and laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Isn't
Timmy clever?&quot; murmured Anne. &quot;I should never have thought of
that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children had been up half the night, and now they were full of good things, and
were very sleepy. One by one they fell asleep on the warm sand. Timothy eyed
them in astonishment. It wasn't night-time! Yet here were all the children
sleeping tightly. Well, well—a dog could always go to sleep too at any time! So
Timothy threw himself down beside George, put his head right on her middle, and
closed his eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sun was high when the little company &quot;awoke. Julian awoke first, then
Dick, feeling very hot indeed, for the sun was blazing down. They sat up,
yawning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Goodness!&quot;
said Dick, looking at his arms. &quot;The sun has caught me properly. I shall
be terribly sore by tonight. Did we bring any cream, Julian?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No.
We never thought of it,&quot; said Julian. &quot;Cheer up! You'll be burnt much
more by the time this day ends. The sun's going to be hot—there's not a cloud
in the sky!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
woke up the girls. George pushed Timmy's head off her tummy. &quot;You give me
nightmares when you put your heavy head there,&quot; she complained. &quot;Oh,
I say—we're on the island, aren't we? For a moment I thought I was back in bed
at Kirrin Cottage!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Isn't
it gorgeous—here we are for ages, all by ourselves, with tons of nice things to
eat, able to do just what we like!&quot; said Anne, contentedly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
guess the old Sticks are glad we've gone,&quot; said Dick. &quot;Spotty Face
will be able to loll in the sitting-room and read all our booksI if he wants
to.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;And
Stinker-dog will be able to wander all over the house and lie on anybody's bed
without being afraid that Timothy will eat him whole,&quot; said George.
&quot;Well, let him. I don't care about anything now that I've escaped.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was fun to lie there and talk about everything. But soon Julian, who could
never rest for long, once he was awake, got up and stretched himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Come
on!&quot; he said to the others. &quot;There is work to do, Lazy-Bones! Come
along!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Work
to do? What do you mean?&quot; said George in astonishment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
we've got to unload the boat and pack everything somewhere where it won't get
spoilt if the rain happens to come,&quot; said Julian. &quot;And we've got to
decide exactly where we're going to sleep, and get the heather for our beds and
pile the rugs on them. There's plenty to do!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh,
don't let's do it yet,&quot; said Anne, not at all wanting to get up out of the
warm sand. But the others pulled her up, and together they all set to work to
unload the boat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Let's
go and have a look at the castle,&quot; said Julian. &quot;And find the little
room where we'll sleep. It's the only one left whole, so it will have to be
that one.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went right to the top of the inlet, climbed up on to the rocks and made their
way towards the old ruined castle, whose walls rose up from the middle of the
little island. They stopped to gaze at it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;It's
a fine old ruin,&quot; said Dick. &quot;Aren't we lucky to have an island and a
castle of our own! Fancy, this is all ours!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
gazed through a big broken-down archway, to old steps beyond. The castle had
once had two fine towers, but now one was almost gone. The other rose high in
the air, half-ruined. The black jackdaws collected there, talking loudly.
&quot;Chack, chack, chack! Chack, chack, chack!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Nice
birds,&quot; said Dick. &quot;I like them. See the grey patch at the back of
their heads, Anne? I wonder if they ever stop talking.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
don't think so,&quot; said George. &quot;Oh, look at the rabbits—tamer than
ever!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
courtyard was full of big rabbits, who eyed them<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>as
they came near. It really seemed as if it would be possible to pat them, they
were so tame—but one by one they edged away as the children approached.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timothy
was in a great state of excitement, and his tail quivered from end to end. Oh
those rabbits! Why<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>couldn't
he chase them? Why was George so difficult about rabbits? Why couldn't he make
them run a bit?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
George had her hand on his collar, and gave him: stern glance. &quot;Now,
Timothy, don't you dare to chase even the smallest of these rabbits. They're
mine, every one o them.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Ours!&quot;
corrected Anne at once. She wanted to share in the rabbits, as well as in the
castle and the island.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Ours!&quot;
said George. &quot;Let's go and have a look at the little dark room where we'll
spend the nights.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
made their way to where the castle did not seen to be quite so ruined. They
came to a doorway and looked inside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Here
it is!&quot; said Julian, peeping in. &quot;I shall have to us my torch. The
windows are only slits here, and it's quit dark.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
turned on his torch—and the children all gaze&lt; into the old room where they
proposed to store their goods and sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
gave a loud exclamation. &quot;Golly! We can't use this room! The roof has
fallen in since last summer.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
it had. Julian's torch shone on to a heap of fallen stones, scattered all over
the floor. It was quite impossible to use the old room now. In any case it
might be dangerous to do so, for it looked as if more stones might fall at any
moment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Blow!&quot;
said Julian. &quot;What shall we do about this? W shall have to find somewhere
else for a storing an sleeping-place!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Eleven.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ON
THE OLD WRECK.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>IT
was quite a shock to have their plans spoilt. They knew there was no other room
in the ruined castle that was sufficiently whole to shelter them. And they must
find some sort of shelter, for although the weather was fine at the moment, it
might rain hard any day—or a storm might blow up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;And
storms round about Kirrin are so very violent,&quot; said Julian, remembering
one or two. &quot;Do you remember the storm that tossed your wreck up from the
bottom of the sea, George?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh
yes,&quot; said George and Anne, together, and Anne added eagerly: &quot;Let's
go and see the wreck today if we can. I'd love to see if it's still balanced on
those rocks, as it was last year, when we explored it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
first we must make up our minds where we are going to sleep,&quot; said Julian,
firmly. &quot;I don't know if you realise it, but it's about three o'clock in
the afternoon! We slept for hours on the sand—tired out with our exciting
night, I suppose. We really must find some safe place and put our things there
at once, and make our beds.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
but where shall we go?&quot; said Dick. &quot;There's no other place in the old
castle.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;There's
the dungeon below,&quot; said Anne, shivering. &quot;But I don't want to go
there. It's so dark and mysterious.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
wanted to sleep down in the dungeons! Dick<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>frowned
and thought hard. &quot;What about the wreck?&quot; he said. &quot;Any chance
of living there?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We
might go and see,&quot; said Julian. &quot;I don't somehow fancy living on a
damp old rotting wreck—but if it's still high on the rocks, maybe the sun will
have dried it, and it might be possible to have our bed and stores there.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Let's
go and see now,&quot; said George. So they made their way from the ruined
castle to the old wall that ran round it. From there they would be able to see
the wreck. It had been cast up the year before, and had settled firmly on some
rocks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
stood on the wall and looked for the wreck, but it was not where they had
expected it. &quot;It's moved,&quot; said<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Julian, in surprise. &quot;There it is, look, on those rocks—nearer to
the shore than it was before. Poor old wreck! It's been battered about a good
bit this last winter, hasn't it? It looks much more of a real wreck than it did
last summer.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
don't believe we shall be able to sleep there,&quot; said Dick. &quot;It's
dreadfully battered. We might be able to store food there, though. Do you know,
I believe we could get to it from those rocks that run out from the
island.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes,
I believe we could,&quot; said George. &quot;We could only reach it safely by
boat last summer—but when the tide is down, I think we could climb out over the
line of rocks, right to the wreck itself.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'll
try in about an hour,&quot; said Julian, feeling excited. &quot;The tide will
be off the rocks by then.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Let's
go and have a look at the old well,&quot; said Dick, and they made their way
back to the courtyard of the castle. Here, the summer before, they had found
the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>entrance
to the well-shaft that ran deep down through the rock, past the dungeons below,
lower than the level of the sea, to fresh water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children looked about for the well, and came to the old wooden cover. They drew
it back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;There
are the rungs of the old iron ladder I went down last year,&quot; said Dick,
peering in. &quot;Now let's find the entrance to the dungeon. The steps down
into it are somewhere near here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
found the entrance, but to their surprise some enormous stones had been pulled
across it. &quot;Who did that?&quot; said George, frowning. &quot;We didn't!
Someone has been here!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Trippers,
I suppose,&quot; said Julian. &quot;Do you remember that we thought we saw a
spire of smoke here the other day? I bet it was trippers. You know, the story
of Kirrin Island, and its old castle and dungeons, and the treasure we found in
it last year, was all in the newspapers. I expect one of the fishermen has been
making money by taking trippers and landing them on our island.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;How
dare they?&quot; said George, looking very fierce. &quot;I shall put up a board
that says &quot;Trespassers will be sent to prison.&quot; I won't have
strangers on our island.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
don't worry about the stones&quot; pulled across the dungeon entrance,&quot;
said Julian. &quot;I don't think any of us want to go down there. Look at poor
old Timmy! He's gazing at those rabbits most unhappily. Isn't he funny?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timothy
was sitting down behind the children, looking most mournfully at the ring of
rabbits all round the weed grown courtyard. He looked at the rabbits and then
he<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>looked
at George, then he looked back at—the rabbits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No
good, Timmy,&quot; said George, firmly. &quot;I'm not going to change my mind
about rabbits. You're not to chase them on our island.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
expect he thinks you're most unfair to him,&quot; said Anne. &quot;After all,
you said he might share your quarter of the island with you—and so he thinks he
ought to have his share of your rabbits too!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
laughed. Timmy wagged his tail and looked hopefully at George. They all walked
across the courtyard—and then Julian suddenly came to a stop.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Look!&quot;
he said in surprise, pointing to something on the ground. &quot;Look! Someone
has been here! This is where they built a fire!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
gazed at the ground. There was a heap of wood-ash there, quite evidently left
from a fire. Stamped into the ground was a cigarette end, too. There was
absolutely no doubt about it—someone had been on the island!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;If
trippers come here I'll set Timmy on to them!&quot; cried George, in a fury.
&quot;This is our own place, it doesn't belong to anybody else at all. Timothy,
you mustn't chase rabbits here, but you can chase anybody on two legs, except
us! See?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
wagged his tail at once. &quot;Woof!&quot; he said, quite agreeing. He looked
all round as if he hoped to see somebody appearing that he could chase. But
there was no one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
should think the tide is about off those rocks by now,&quot; said Julian.
&quot;Let's go and see. If it is we'll climb along them and see if we can get
to the wreck. Anne had better<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>not
come. She might slip and fall, and the sea is raging all round the rocks.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Of
course I'm coming!&quot; cried Anne, indignantly &quot;You're just as likely to
fall as I am.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
I'll see if it looks too dangerous,&quot; said Julian They made their way over
the castle wall, down to the line of rocks that ran out seawards, towards the
wreck Big waves did wash over the rocks occasionally, but it seemed fairly
safe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;If
you keep between me and Dick, you can come Anne,&quot; said Julian. &quot;But
you must let us help you over difficult parts, and not make a fuss. We don't
want you to fall in and get washed away.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
began to make their way along the line of rugged slippery rocks. The tide went
down even farther as the; got nearer to the wreck, and soon there was very
little danger of being washed off the rocks. It was possible now to get right
to the wreck across the rocks—a thing they had not been able to do the summer
before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Here
we are!&quot; said Julian at last, and he put his ham on the side of the old
wreck. She was a big ship now that they were near to her. She towered above
them, thick with shell-fish and seaweed, smelling musty and old. The water
washed round the bottom part of her, but the top part was right out of the
water, even when the tide was at its highest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;She's
been thrown about a bit last winter,&quot; said George, looking at her.
&quot;There are a lot more new hole in her side, aren't there? And part of her
old mast is gone and some of the deck. How can we get up to her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I've
got a rope,&quot; said Julian, and he undid a rope that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>he
had wound round his waist. &quot;Half a minute—I'll make a loop and see if I
can throw it round that post sticking out up there.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
threw the rope two or three times, but could not get the loop round the post.
George took it from him impatiently. At the first throw she got it round the
post. She was very good indeed at things like that—better than a boy in some
things, Anne thought admiringly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
was up the rope like a monkey, and soon stood on the sloping slippery deck. She
almost slipped, but caught at a broken piece of deck just in time. Julian
helped Anne to go up, and then the two boys followed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;It's
a horrid smell, isn't it?&quot; said Anne, wrinkling up her nose. &quot;Do all
wrecks smell like this? I don't think I'll go and look down in the cabins like
we did last time. The smell would be worse there.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
the others left Anne up on the half-rotten deck while they went to explore a
bit. They went down to the smelly, seaweed-hung cabins, and into the captain's
old cabin, the biggest of the lot. But it was quite plain that not only could
they not sleep there, but they could certainly not hope to store anything
there, either. The whole place was damp and rotten. Julian was half afraid his
foot would go through the planking at any moment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Let's
go up to the deck,&quot; he said. &quot;It's nasty down here—awfully dark
too.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were just going up, when they heard a shout from Anne, &quot;I say! Come here,
quick! I've found something!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
hurried up as fast as they could, slipping and sliding on the sloping deck.
Anne was standing where they had left her, her eyes shining brightly. She was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>pointing
to something on the opposite side of the ship &quot;What is it?&quot; said
George. &quot;What's the matter?&quot; &quot;Look—that wasn't here when we came
here before surely!&quot; said Anne, still pointing. The others looked when she
pointed. They saw an open locker at the other side o the deck, and stuffed into
it was a small black trunk! How extraordinary!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;A
little black trunk!&quot; said Julian, in surprise. &quot;No—that wasn't there
before. It's not been there long either—it's quite dry and new! Whoever does it
belong to? And why should it be here?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Twelve. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THE
CAVE IN THE CLIFF.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>CAUTIOUSLY
the children made their way down the slippery deck towards the locker. The door
of this had evidently been shut on the trunk but had come open, so that the
trunk was not hidden, as had been intended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
pulled out the little black trunk. All the children were amazed. Why should
anyone put a trunk there?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Smugglers,
do you think?&quot; said Dick, his eyes gleaming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes—it
might be,&quot; said Julian, thoughtfully, trying to undo the straps of the
trunk. &quot;This would be a very good place for smugglers. Ships that knew the
way could put in, cast off a boat with smuggled goods, leave them here, and go
on their way, knowing that people could come and collect the goods at their
leisure.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Do
you think there are smuggled goods inside the trunk?&quot; asked Anne, in
excitement. &quot;What would there be? Diamonds? Silks?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Anything
that has a duty to be paid on it before it can get into the country,&quot; said
Julian. &quot;Blow these straps! I can't undo them.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Let
me try,&quot; said Anne, who had very deft little fingers. She began to work at
the buckles, and in a short time had the straps undone. But a further
disappointment awaited them. The trunk was well and truly locked! There were
two good locks, and no keys!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Blow!&quot;
said George. &quot;How sickening! How can we get the trunk open now?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We
can't,&quot; said Julian. &quot;And we mustn't smash it open, because it would
warn whoever it belongs to that the goods had been found. We don't want to-warn
the smugglers that we have discovered their little game. We want to try and
catch them!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Ooooh!&quot;
said Anne, going red with excitement. &quot;Catch the smugglers! Oh Julian! Do
you really think we could?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Why
not?&quot; said Julian. &quot;No one knows we are here. If we hid whenever we
saw a ship approaching the island, we might see a boat coming to it, and we
could watch and find out what is happening. I should think that the smugglers
are using this island as a sort of dropping-place for goods. I wonder who comes
and fetches them? Someone from Kirrin Village or the nearby places, I should
think.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;This
is going to be awfully exciting,&quot; said Dick. &quot;We always seem to have
adventures when we come to Kirrin It's absolutely full of them. This will be
the third one we have had.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
think we ought to be getting back over the rocks, said Julian, suddenly looking
over the side of the ship and seeing that the tide had turned. &quot;Come on —
we don't want to be caught by the tide and have to stay here for hours and
hours! I'll go down the rope first. Then you come, Anne.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were soon climbing over the rocks again, feeling very excited. Just as they
reached the last stretch of rock leading to the rocky cliff of the island
itself, Dick stopped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What's
up?&quot; said George, pushing behind him. &quot;Do get on!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Isn't
that a cave, just beyond that big rock there?&quot; said Dick, pointing.
&quot;It looks awfully like one to me. If it was, it would be a simply lovely
place to store our things in, and even to sleep in, if it was out of reach of
the sea.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;There
aren't any caves on Kirrin,&quot; began George, and then she stopped short.
What Dick was pointing at really did look like a cave. It was worth while
seeing if it was one. After all, George had never explored this line of rocks,
and so had never been able to catch sight of the cave that lay just beyond. It
could not possibly be seen from the land.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'll
go and see,&quot; she said. So they changed their direction, and instead of
climbing back the way they had come, they cut across the mass of rock and made
their way towards a jutting-out part of the cliff, in which the cave seemed to
be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came to it ,at last. Steep rocks guarded the entrance, and half hid it. Except
from where Dick had seen it, it was really impossible to catch sight of it, it
was so well-hidden.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;It is a cave!&quot; said Dick, in
delight, stepping into it. &quot;And my, what a fine one!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
really was a beauty. Its floor was spread with fine white sand, as soft as
powder, and perfectly dry, for the cave was clearly higher than the tide
reached, except, possibly in a bad winter storm. Round one side of it ran a
stone ledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Exactly
like a shelf made for us!&quot; cried Anne, in joy. &quot;We can put all our
things here. How lovely! Let's come<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and
live here and sleep here. And look, Julian—we've even got a skylight in the
roof!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
little girl pointed upwards, and the others saw that the roof of the cave was
open in one part, giving on to the cliff-top itself. It was plain that
somewhere on the heathery cliff above was a hole that looked down to the cave,
making what Anne called a &quot;skylight'.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We
could drop all our things down through that hole,&quot; said Julian, quickly
making plans. &quot;We would have an awful time bringing them over the rocks.
If we can find that hole up there when we are out on the cliff again, we can
let down everything on a rope. It's not a very high &quot;skylight&quot;, as
Anne calls it, for the cliffs are low just here. I believe we could swing
ourselves down a rope easily, so that we needn't have the bother of clambering
over the rocks to the seaward entrance we have just come in by!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
was a grand discovery. &quot;Our island is even more exciting than we
thought,&quot; said Anne, happily. &quot;We've got a beautiful cave to share
now!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
next thing to do, of course, was to go up on the cliff and find the hole that
led to the roof of the cave. So out they all went, Timmy too. Timmy was funny
on the slippery rocks. His feet slithered about, and two or three times he fell
into the water. But he just swam across the pools he fell into, clambered out
and went on again with his slithering.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;He's
like George!&quot; said Anne, with a laugh. &quot;He never gives up, whatever
happens to him!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
climbed up to the top of the cliff. It was easy to find the hole once they knew
it was there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Pretty
dangerous, really,&quot; said Julian, when he had<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>found
it, and was peering down. &quot;Any one of us might have run on this cliff and
popped down the hole by accident. See, it's all criss-crossed with blackberry
brambles.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
scratched their hands, trying to free the hole from the brambles. Once they had
cleared the hole, they could look right down into the cave quite easily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;It's
not very far down,&quot; said Anne. &quot;It looks almost as if we could jump
down, if we let ourselves slide down this hole.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Don't
you do anything of the sort,&quot; said Julian. &quot;You'd break your leg.
Wait till we get a rope fixed up, hanging down into the cave. Then we can
manage to get in and out easily.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went back to the boat, and began unloading it. They took everything across to
the seaward side of the island, where the cave was. Julian took a strong rope
and knotted it thickly at intervals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;To
give our feet a hold as we go down,&quot; he explained. &quot;If we drop down
too quickly, we'll hurt our hands. These knots will stop us slipping and help
us to climb up.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Let
me go down first, and then you can lower all our things to me,&quot; said
George. So down she went, hand over hand, her feet easily finding the thick
knots, feeling for one after another. It was a good way to go down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;How
shall we get Timmy down?&quot; said Julian. But Timothy, who had been whining
anxiously at the edge of the hole, watching George sliding away from him,
solved the difficulty himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
jumped into the hole and disappeared down it! There came a shriek from below.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh!
My goodness, what's this! Oh Timmy! Have you hurt yourself?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sand was very soft, like a velvet cushion and Tim had not hurt himself at all.
He gave himself a shake and then barked joyfully. He was with George again! He
wasn't going to have his mistress disappearing down mysterious holes without
following her at once. Not Timmy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
followed the business of lowering down all the goods. Anne and Dick tied the
things together in rugs, and Julian lowered them carefully. George untied the
rope as soon as it reached her, took out the goods, and then back went the rope
again to be tied round another bundle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Last
one!&quot; called Julian, after a long spell of really hard work. &quot;Then
down we come too, and I don't mind telling you that before we make our beds or
anything, our next job is to have a jolly good meal! It's hours and hours since
we had a meal, and I'm starving.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
they were all sitting on the warm soft floor of the cave. They opened a tin of
meat, cut huge slices of bread and made sandwiches. Then they opened a tin of
pineapple chunks and ate those, spooning them out of the tin full of sweetness
and juice. After that they still felt hungry so they opened two tins of
sardines and dug them out wit! biscuits. It made a really grand meal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Ginger-pop
to finish up with please,&quot; said Dick &quot;My word, why don't people
always have meals like this?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'd
better hurry up or we shan't be able to get heather for our beds,&quot; said
George, sleepily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Who
wants heather?&quot; said Dick, &quot;I don't! This lovely soft sand is all I
shall want—and a cushion and a rug or two. I shall sleep better here than ever
I did in bed!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
the rugs and cushions were spread out on the sandy floor of the cave. A candle
was lighted as it grew dark, and the four sleepy children looked at one
another. Timmy, as usual, was with George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Good-night,&quot;
said George. &quot;I can't keep awake another minute. &quot;Good-night, ev . .
. ery . . . body . . . good . . . night!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Thirteen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
DAY ON THE ISLAND.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THE
children hardly knew where they were the next day when they woke up. The sun
was pouring into the cave entrance, and fell first of all on George's sleeping
face. It awoke her and she lay half-dozing, wondering why her bed felt rather
less soft than usual.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;But
I'm not in my bed—I'm on Kirrin Island, of course!&quot; she thought suddenly
to herself. She sat up and gave Anne a punch. &quot;Wake up, sleepy-head! We're
on the island!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
they were all awake rubbing the sleep from their eyes. &quot;I think I'm going
to get heather today for my bed, after all,&quot; said Anne. &quot;The sand
feels soft at first, but it gets hard after a bit.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others agreed that they would all get heather for their beds, set on the sand,
with rugs for covering. Then they would have really fine beds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;It's
fun to live in a cave,&quot; said Dick. &quot;Fancy having a fine cave like
this on our island, as well as a castle and dungeons! We arc really very
lucky.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
feel sticky and dirty,&quot; said Julian. &quot;Let's go and have a bathe
before we have breakfast. Then cold ham, bread, pickles and marmalade for
me!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We
shall be cold after our bathe,&quot; said George. &quot;We'd better light my
little stove and put the kettle on to boil while we're bathing. Then we can
make some hot cocoa when we come back shivering!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh
yes,&quot; said Anne, who had never boiled anything on such a tiny stove
before. &quot;Do let's. I'll fill the kettle with water from one of the
containers. What shall we do for milk?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;There's
a tin of milk somewhere in the pile,&quot; said Julian. &quot;We can open that.
Where's the tin-opener?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was not to be found which was most exasperating. But at last Julian discovered
it in his pocket, so all was well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
little stove was filled with methylated spirit, and lighted. The kettle was
filled and set on top. Then the children went off to bathe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Look!
There's a simply marvellous pool in the middle of those rocks over there!&quot;
called Julian, pointing. &quot;We've never spotted it before. Golly, it's like
a small swimming-pool, made specially for us!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Kirrin
Swimming Pool, five pence a dip!&quot; said Dick. &quot;Free to the owners,
though! Come on—it looks gorgeous! And see how the waves keep washing over the
top of the rocks and splashing into the pool. Couldn't be better!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
really was a lovely rock-pool, deep, clear and not too cold. The children
enjoyed themselves thoroughly, splashing about and swimming and floating.
George tried a dive off one of the rocks, and went in beautifully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;George
can do anything in the water,&quot; said Anne, admiringly. &quot;I wish I could
dive and swim like George. But I never shall.*<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We
can see the old wreck nicely from here,&quot; said Julian, coming out of the
water. &quot;Blow! We didn't bring any towels.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'll
use one of the rugs, turn and turn about,&quot; said<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick.
&quot;I'll go and fetch the thinnest one. I say—do you remember that trunk we
saw in the wreck yesterday? Odd, wasn't it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes,
very odd,&quot; said Julian. &quot;I don't understand it. We'll have to keep a
watch on the wreck and see who comes to collect the trunk.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
suppose the smugglers—if they are smugglers—will come slinking round this side
of the island and quietly send off a boat to the wreck,&quot; said George,
drying herself vigorously. &quot;Well, we'd better keep a strict look-out, and
see if anything appears on the sea out there in the way of a small steamer,
boat or ship.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes.
We don't want them to spot us,&quot; said Dick. &quot;We shan't find out
anything if they see us and are warned. They'd at once give up coming to the
island. I vote we each of us take turns at keeping a look-out, so that we can
spot anything at once and get under cover.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Good
idea!&quot; said Julian. &quot;Well, I'm dry, but not very warm. Let's race to the
cave, and get that hot drink. And breakfast — golly, I—could eat a whole
chicken and probably a duck as well, to say nothing of a turkey.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others laughed. They all felt the same. They raced off to the cave, running
over the sand and climbing over a few rocks, then down to the cave-beach and
into the big entrance, still splashed with sunshine. .<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
kettle .was boiling away merrily, sending a cloud of steam up from its tin
spout. &quot;Get the ham out and a loaf of bread, and that jar of pickles we
brought,&quot; ordered Julian. &quot;I'll open the tin of milk. George, you
take the tin of cocoa and that jug, and make enough for all of us.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I'm
so terribly happy,&quot; said Anne, as she sat at the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>entrance
to the cave, eating her breakfast. &quot;It's a lovely feeling. It's simply
gorgeous being on our island like this, all by ourselves, able to do what we
like.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all felt the same. It was such a lovely day too, and the sky and sea were so
blue. They sat eating and drinking, gazing out to sea, watching the waves break
into spray over the rocks beyond the old wreck. It certainly was a very rocky
coast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Let's
arrange everything very nicely in the cave,&quot; said Anne, who was the
tidiest of the four, and always liked to<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>play
at &quot;houses&quot; if she could. &quot;This shall be our house, our home.
We'll make four proper beds. And we'll each have our own place to sit in. And
we'll arrange everything tidily on that big stone shelf there. It might have
been made for us!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'll
leave Anne to play &quot;houses&quot; by herself,&quot; said George, who was
longing to stretch her legs again. &quot;We'll go and get some heather for
beds. And oh!—what about one of us keeping a watch on the old wreck, to see who
comes there?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes—that's
important,&quot; said Julian at once. &quot;I'll take first watch. The best
place would be up on the cliff just above this cave. I can find a gorse bush
that will hide me all right from anyone out at sea. You others get the heather.
We will take two-hourly watches. We can read if we like, so long as we keep on
looking up.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
and George went to get the heather. Julian climbed up the knotted rope that
still hung down through the hole, tied firmly to the great old root of an
enormous gorse bush. He pulled himself out on the cliff and lay on the heather
panting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
could see nothing but to sea at all except for some big steamer miles out on
the sky-line. He lay down in the sun, enjoying the warmth that poured into
every inch of his body. This look-out job was going to be very nice!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
could hear Anne singing down in the cave as she tidied up her &quot;house'. Her
voice came up through the cave-roof hole, rather muffled. Julian smiled. He
knew Anne was enjoying herself thoroughly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
she was. She had washed the few bits of crockery they had used for breakfast,
in a most convenient little<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>rain-pool
outside the cave. Timmy used it for drinking-water too, but he didn't seem to
mind Anne using it for washing-up water, though she apologised to him for doing
so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I'm
sorry if I spoil your drinking water, Timmy darling,&quot; she said, &quot;but
you are such a sensible dog that I know if it suddenly tastes nasty to you, you
will go off and find another rain-pool.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Woof!&quot;
said Timmy, and ran off to meet George, who was just arriving back with Dick,
armed with masses of soft, sweet-smelling heather for beds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Put
the heather outside the cave, please George,&quot; said Anne. &quot;I'll make
the beds inside when I'm ready.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Right!&quot;
said George. &quot;We'll go and get some more. Aren't we having fun?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Julian's
gone up the rope to the top of the cliff,&quot; said Anne. &quot;He'll yell if
he sees anything unusual. I hope he does, don't you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;It
would be exciting,&quot; agreed Dick, putting down his heather on top of Timmy,
and nearly burying him. &quot;Oh sorry Timmy—are you there? Bad luck!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
had a very happy morning. She arranged everything beautifully on the shelf-
crockery and knives and forks and spoons in one place —saucepan and kettle in
another — tins of meat next, tins of soup together, tins of fruit neatly piled
on top of one another. It really was a splendid larder and dresser!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
wrapped all the bread up in an old tablecloth they had brought, and put it at
the back of the cave in the coolest place she could find. The containers of
water went there too, and so did all the bottles of drinks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
the little girl set to work to make the beds. She decided to make two nice big
ones, one on each side of the cave.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;George
and I and Tim will have the one this side,&quot; she thought, busy patting down
the heather into the shape of a bed. &quot;And Julian and Dick can have the
other side. I shall want lots more heather. Oh, is that you, Dick? You're just
in time! I want more heather.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
the beds were made beautifully, and each had an old rug for an under-blanket,
and two better rugs for covers. Cushions made pillows.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What
a pity we didn't bring night-things,&quot; thought Anne. &quot;I could have
folded them neatly and put them under the cushions. There! It all looks lovely.
We've got a beautiful house.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
came sliding down the rope from the cliff to the cave. He looked round
admiringly. &quot;My word, Anne—the cave does look fine! Everything in order
and looking so tidy. You are a good little girl.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
was pleased to hear Julian's praise, though she didn't like him calling her a
little girl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes,
it does look nice, doesn't it?&quot; she said. &quot;But why aren't you
watching up on the cliff, Ju?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;It's
Dick's turn now,&quot; said Julian. &quot;The two hours are up. Did we bring
any biscuits? I feel as if I could do with one or two, and I bet the others
could too. Let's all go up to the cliff-top and have some. George and Timmy are
there with Dick.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
knew exactly where to put her hand on the tin of biscuits. She took out ten and
climbed up to the cliff-top Julian went up on the rope. Soon all five were
sitting b)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>the
big gorse-bush, nibbling at biscuits, Timmy too. At least, he didn't nibble. He
just swallowed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
day passed very pleasantly and rather lazily. They took turns at being
look-out, though Anne was severely scolded by Julian in the afternoon for
falling asleep during her watch. She was very ashamed of herself and cried.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You're
too little to be a look-out, that's what it is,&quot; said Julian. &quot;We
three and Timmy had better do it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh,
no, do let me too,&quot; begged poor Anne. &quot;I never, never will fall
asleep again. But the sun was so hot and . . .&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Don't
make excuses,&quot; said Julian. &quot;It only makes things worse if you do.
All right—we'll give you another chance, Anne, and see if you are really big
enough to do the things we do.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
though they all took their turns, and kept a watch on the sea for any strange
vessel, none appeared. The children were disappointed. They did so badly want
to know who had put that trunk on the wreck and why, and what it contained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Better
go to bed now,&quot; said Julian, when the sun sank low. &quot;It's about nine
o'clock. Come on! I'm really looking forward to a sleep on those lovely
heathery beds that Anne has made so nicely!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Fourteen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>DISTURBANCE
IN THE NIGHT.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>IT
was dark in the cave, not really quite dark enough to light a candle, but the
cave looked so nice by candlelight that it was fun to light one. So Anne took
down the candle-stick and lighted the candle. At once queer shadows jumped all
round the cave, and it became a rather exciting place, not at all like the cave
they knew by daylight!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
wish we could have a fire,&quot; said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'd
be far too hot,&quot; said Julian. &quot;And it would smoke us out. You can't
have a fire in a cave like this. There's no chimney.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes,
there is,&quot; said Anne, pointing to the hole in the roof. &quot;If we
lighted a fire just under that hole, it would act as a chimney, wouldn't
it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;It
might,&quot; said Dick, thoughtfully. &quot;But I don't think so. We'd simply
get the cave full of stifling smoke, and we wouldn't be able to sleep for
choking.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
couldn't we light a fire at the cave entrance then?&quot; said Anne who felt
that a real home ought to have a fire somewhere. &quot;Just to keep away wild
beasts, say! That's what the people of old times did. It says so in my history
book. They lighted fires at the cave entrance at night to keep away any wild animal
that might be prowling around.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
what wild beasts do you think are likely to come<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>and
peep into this cave?&quot; asked Julian, lazily, finishing up a cup of cocoa.
&quot;Lions? Tigers? Or perhaps you are afraid of an elephant or two.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
laughed. &quot;No—I don't really think animals like that would come,&quot; said
Anne. &quot;Only—it would be nice to have a red, glowing fire to watch when we
go to sleep.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Perhaps
Anne thinks the rabbits might come in and nibble our toes or something,&quot;
said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Woof!&quot;
said Tim, pricking up his ears as he always did at the mention of rabbits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
don't think we ought to have a fire,&quot; said Julian, &quot;because it might
be seen out at sea and give a warning to anyone thinking of coming to the
island to do a bit of smuggling.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh
no, Julian—the entrance to this cave is so well-hidden that I'm sure no one
could see a fire out to sea,&quot; said George, at once. &quot;There's that
line of high rocks in front, which must hide it completely. I think it would be
rather fun to have a fire. It would light up the cave so queerly and
excitingly.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh
good, George!&quot; said Anne, delighted to find someone agreeing with her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
we can't possibly fag out and get sticks for it now,&quot; said Dick, who was
far too comfortable to move.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You
don't need to,&quot; said Anne, eagerly. &quot;I got plenty myself today, and
stored them at the back of the cave, in case we wanted a fire.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Isn't
she a good little house-wife!&quot; said Julian, in great admiration. &quot;She
may go to sleep when she's look-out, but she's wide-awake enough when it comes
to making a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>house
for us out of a cave! All right, Anne—we'll make a fire for you!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all got up and fetched the sticks from the back of the cave. Anne had been to
the jackdaw tower and had picked up armfuls that the birds had dropped when
making their nests in the tower. They built them up to make a nice little fire.
Julian got some dried seaweed too, to drop into it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
lighted the fire at the cave-entrance, and the dry sticks blazed up at once.
The children went back to their heather-beds, and lay down on&quot; them,
watching the red flames leaping and crackling. The red glow lit up the cave and
made it very weird and exciting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;This
is lovely,&quot; said Anne, half-asleep. &quot;Really lovely. Oh Timmy, move a
bit do. You're so heavy on my feet. Here, George, pull Timothy over to your
side. .You're used to him lying on you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Good-night,&quot;
said Dick, sleepily. .'The fire is dying down, but I can't be bothered to put
any more wood on it. I'm sure all the lions and tigers and bears and elephants
have been frightened away.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Silly!&quot;
said Anne. &quot;You needn't tease me about it — you've enjoyed it as much as I
have! Good-night.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all fell asleep and dreamed peacefully of many things. Julian awoke with a
jump. Some queer noise had awakened him. He lay still, listening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timothy
was growling deeply, right down in his throat. &quot;R-r-r-r-r-r-r,&quot; he
went. &quot;Gr-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
awoke too, and put out her hand sleepily. &quot;What's the matter, Tim?&quot;
she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;He's
heard something, George,&quot; said Julian, in a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>low
voice from his bed .on the other side of the cave.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
sat up cautiously. Timmy was still growling. &quot;Sh!&quot; said George and he
stopped. He was sitting up straight, his ears well cocked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Perhaps
it's the smugglers come in the night,&quot; whispered George, and a funny
prickly feeling ran down her back. Somehow smugglers in the day time were
rather exciting and quite welcome—but at night they seemed different. George
didn't at all want to meet any just then!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I'm
going out to see if I can spy anything,&quot; said Julian, getting off his bed
quietly, so as not to wake Dick. I'll go up the rope to the top of the cliff. I
can see better from there.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Take
my torch,&quot; said George. But Julian didn't want it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No,
thanks. I can feel the way up that knotted rope quite well, whether I can see
or not,&quot; he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went up the rope in the dark, his body twisting round as the rope turned. He
climbed up on to the cliff and looked out to sea. It was a very dark night, and
he could see no ship at all, not even the wreck. It was far too dark.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Pity
there's no moon,&quot; thought Julian. &quot;I might be able to see something
then.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
watched for a few minutes, and then George's voice came through the hole in the
roof, coming out queerly at his feet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Julian!
Is there anything to see? Shall I come up?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Nothing
at all,&quot; said Julian. &quot;Is Timmy still growling?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes,
when I take my hand off his collar,&quot; said George. &quot;I can't imagine
what's upset him.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly
Julian caught sight of something. It was a light, a good way beyond the line of
rocks. He watched in excitement. That would be just about where the wreck was!
Yes—it must be someone on the &quot;wreck with a lantern!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;George!
Come up!&quot; he said, putting his head inside<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>the hole.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
came up, hand over hand, like a monkey, leaving Timothy growling below. She sat
by Julian on the cliff-top. &quot;See the wreck—look, over there!&quot; said
Julian. &quot;At least, you can't see the wreck itself, it's too dark—but you
can see a lantern that someone has put there.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes—that's
someone on our wreck, with a lantern!&quot; said George, feeling excited.
&quot;Oh, I wonder if it's the smugglers—coming to bring more things.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Or
somebody fetching that trunk,&quot; said Julian. &quot;Well, we'll know
tomorrow, for we'll go and see. Look!—whoever is there is moving off now—the
light of the lantern is going lower—they must be getting into a boat by the
side of the wreck. And now the light's gone out.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children strained their ears to hear if they could discover the splash of oars
or the sound of voices over the water. They both thought they could hear
voices.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;The
boat must have gone off to join a ship or something,&quot; said Julian. &quot;I
believe I can see a faint light right out there—out to sea, look! Maybe the
boat is going to it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was nothing more to see or hear, and soon the two of them slid down the knotted
rope back to the cave. They didn't wake the others, who were still sleeping
peacefully. Timothy leapt up and—licked Julian and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George,
whining joyfully. He did not growl any more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You're
a good dog, aren't you?&quot; said Julian, patting him. &quot;Nothing ever
escapes your sharp ears, does it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timothy
settled down on George's feet again. It was plain that whatever it was that had
disturbed him had gone. It must have been the presence of the stranger or
strangers on the old wreck. Well, they would go there in the morning and see if
they could discover what had been taken away or brought there in the night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
and Dick were most indignant the next morning when they heard Julian's tale.
&quot;You might have waked us!&quot; said Dick, crossly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We
would have if there had been anything much to see,&quot; said George. &quot;But
there was only just the light from a lantern, and nothing else except that we
thought we heard the sound of voices.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
the tide was low enough the children and Timothy set off over the rocks to the
wreck. They clambered up and stood on the slanting, slippery deck. They looked
towards the locker where the little trunk had stood. The door of the locker was
shut this time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
slid down towards it and tried to pull it open. Someone had stuffed a piece of
wood in to keep the locker from swinging open. Julian pulled it out. Then the
door opened easily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Anything
else in there?&quot; said George, stepping carefully over the slimy deck to
Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes,&quot;
said Julian. &quot;Look! Tins of food! And cups and plates and things—just as
if someone was going to come and live on the island too! Isn't it funny? The
trunk is still here too, locked as before. And here are some candles<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>-
and a. little lamp—and a bundle of rags. Whatever are they here for?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
really was a puzzle. Julian frowned for a few minutes, trying to think it out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;It
looks as if someone is going to come and stay on the island for a bit—probably
to wait there and take in whatever goods are going to be smuggled. Well—we
shall be on the look-out for them, day or night!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
left the wreck, feeling excited. They had a fine hiding-place in their cave—no
one could possibly find them there. And, from their hiding-place they could
watch anyone coming to and from the wreck, and, from the wreck, to the island.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What
about our cove, where we put our boat?&quot; said George, suddenly. &quot;They
might use that cove, you know—if they came in a boat. It's rather dangerous to
reach the island from the wreck, if anyone tried to get to the rocky beach
near-by.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well—if
anyone came to our cove, they'd see our boat,&quot; said Dick, in alarm.
&quot;We'd better hide it, hadn't we?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;How?&quot;
said Anne, thinking that it would be a difficult thing to hide a boat as big as
theirs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Don't
know,&quot; said Julian. &quot;We'll go and have a look.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
four and Timmy went off to the cove into which they had rowed their boat. The
boat was pulled high up, out of reach of the waves. George explored the cove
well, and then had an idea. &quot;Do you think we could pull the boat round
this big rock? It would just about hide it, though anyone going round the rock
would see it at once.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others thought it would be worth while trying,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>anyway.
So, with much panting and puffing, they hauled the boat round the rock, which
almost completely hid her. &quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Good!&quot;
said George, going down into the cove to see if very much of the boat showed.
&quot;A bit of her does show still. Let's drape it with seaweed!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
they draped the prow of the boat with all the seaweed they could find at hand,
and after that, unless anyone went deliberately round the big rock, the boat
really was not noticeable at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Good!&quot;
said Julian, looking at his watch. &quot;I say—it's long past tea-time — and,
you know, while we've been doing all this with the boat, we quite forgot to
have someone on the look-out post on the cliff-top. What idiots we are!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
I don't expect anything has happened since we've been away from the cave,&quot;
said Dick, putting a fine big bit of seaweed on the prow of the boat, as a last
touch. &quot;I bet the smugglers will only come at night.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
dare say you're right,&quot; said Julian. &quot;I think we'd better keep a
look-out at night, too. The look-out could take rugs up to the cliff-top and
curl up there.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Timmy
could be with whoever is keeping watch,&quot; said Anne, &quot;Then if the
look-out goes to sleep by mistake, Timmy would growl and wake them up if he saw
anything.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You
mean, when you go to sleep,&quot; said Dick, grinning. &quot;Come on—let's get
back to the cave and have some tea.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then Timothy suddenly began to growl again!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Fifteen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>WHO
IS ON THE ISLAND?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Sh!&quot;
said Julian, at once. &quot;Get down behind this bush, quick, everyone!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had left the cove and were walking towards the castle when Timmy growled. Now
they all crouched behind a mass of brambles, their hearts beating fast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Don't
growl, Timmy,&quot; said George, in Timothy's nearest ear. He stopped at once,
but he stood stiff and quivering, on the watch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
peeped through the bush, parting the brambles and scratching his hands. He
could just see somebody in the courtyard—one person—two persons—maybe three. He
strained his eyes to try and see, but even as he looked, they disappeared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
believe they've moved those big stones over the entrance to the dungeons, and
have gone down there,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Stay here, and I'll creep out a
bit and see. I won't let anyone spot me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
came back and nodded. &quot;Yes—they've gone down the dungeons. Do you think
they can be the smugglers? Do you suppose they are storing their smuggled goods
down there? It would be a marvellous place, of course.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Let's
get back to the cave while they are underground,&quot; said George. &quot;I'm
so afraid Timmy will give the game away by barking. He's just bursting himself
trying not to make some sort of noise.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Come
on, then!&quot; said Julian. &quot;Don't go across the courtyard—make for the
shore and we'll scramble round it till we get to the cave. Then one of us can
pop up through the hole and hide behind that big gorse-bush there to see who
the smugglers are. They must have come in by boat either from the wreck, or by
rowing cleverly through the rocks off-shore.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
got to the cave at last and went in. But no sooner had Julian shinned up the
rope, helped by the others, than Timothy disappeared! He ran out of the cave
while the others&quot; backs were turned, and when George turned round there
was no Timmy to be seen!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Timmy!&quot;
she called in a low voice. &quot;Timmy! Where are you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
no answer came! Timmy had gone off on his own. If only the smugglers didn't see
him! What a bad dog he was to do that!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timmy had smelt something exciting-he had smelt a smell he knew—a dog-smell—and
he meant to find the owner of it and bite off his ears and tail!
&quot;Gr-r-r-r-r-r!&quot; Timmy was not going to allow dogs on his island!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
sat close beside the gorse-bush, watching all round. There was nothing to be
seen on the&quot; wreck, and there was no ship out to sea. Probably the boat
that had brought the strangers to the island was hidden down below among the
rocks. Julian looked behind him, towards the castle—and even as he looked, he
saw an astonishing sight!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
dog was sniffing about the bushes not far away—and creeping up behind him, all
his hackles up, was Timothy! Timothy was stalking the dog as if he were a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>cat
stalking a rabbit! The other dog suddenly heard him and leapt round, facing
Timothy. Timmy flung himself on the dog with a blood-curdling howl, and the dog
howled in fright.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
watched in horror, not knowing what to do. The two dogs made a fearful noise,
especially the other dog whose howls of terror and yelps of rage resounded
everywhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;This
will bring the smugglers &quot;up, and they will see Timmy and know there's
someone on the island,&quot; thought Julian. &quot;Oh, blow you, Timmy!—why
didn't you stay with George and keep quiet?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>From
the walls of the ruined castle came three figures, running pell-mell to see
what was happening to their dog—and Julian stared at them in the very greatest
amazement.- for the three people were no other than Mr. Stick, Mrs. Stick and
Edgar!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Golly!&quot;
said Julian, crawling round the bush to get to the hole quickly. &quot;They've
come after us! They've guessed we've gone here and they've come to look for us,
the beasts, to make us go back! Well, they won't find us! But oh, what a pity
Timmy's given the show away!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
came a shrill whistle from down below him. It was George, who, hearing the row
from the dogs, was feeling worried, and had sent out her piercing whistle for
Timmy. It was a whistle the dog always obeyed, and he let go his hold of the
dog and shot off to the cliff-top at once, just as the three Sticks arrived on
the scene, and picked up their bleeding, whining mongrel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
tore after Timmy, up to the cliff-top. Julian dropped down to the cave when he
spotted Edgar appearing. Timmy ran to the hole and dropped bodily down, landing
almost on top of Julian. He flung himself on George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Shut
up, shut up!&quot; said George, in an urgent whisper to the excited dog.
&quot;Do you want to give our hiding-place away, you idiot?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar,
panting and puffing, arrived on the cliff-top, and was completely amazed to see
Timothy apparently disappear into the solid earth. He hunted about for a bit,
but it was clear that the dog was no longer on the cliff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
and Mrs. Stick came up too. &quot;Where did that dog go?&quot; shouted Mrs.
Stick. &quot;What was he like?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;He
looked awfully like that horrible dog of the children's,&quot; said Edgar. His
voice could clearly be heard by everyone down in the cave. The children kept as
quiet as mice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;But
it couldn't be!&quot; came Mrs. Stick's voice. &quot;The children have gone home—we
saw them, and the dog too, making off towards the railway. It must be some sort
of stray dog left here by a tripper.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
where is he, then?&quot; said Mr. Stick's hoarse voice. &quot;Can't see no dog
anywhere about now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;He
disappeared into the earth,&quot; said Edgar, in a surprised voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Stick made a rude and scornful noise. &quot;You tell lovely tales, you
do,&quot; he said. &quot;Disappeared into the earth! What next? Fell over the
cliff, I should think. Well, he got his teeth into poor Tinker good and proper.
My word, if I see that dog, I'll shoot him!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;He
might &quot;have some hiding-place about this cliff,&quot; said Mrs. Stick.
&quot;Let's have a look!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children sat as quiet as mice. George with a warning hand on Timmy's collar.
They could hear that the Sticks were really very near. Julian expected one of
them to fall down the hole at any moment!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
mercifully they didn't happen on the hole that led down to the cave. They,
stood quite near to it, though, while they were discussing the problem.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;If
it's the children's dog, then those tiresome kids must have come to this
island, instead of going home,&quot; said Mrs. Stick. &quot;That would upset
our plan all right! We shall have to find out. I'll have no peace till I
know.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We
can soon find out,&quot; said Mr. Stick. &quot;No need to worry about that.
Their boat will be here somewhere—and they'll all be about, too! It's
impossible for four children, a dog and a boat to be hidden on this small
island once anyone starts hunting for them! Edgar, you go round that way.
Clara, you get along round about the castle. They may be hiding somewhere in
the ruins. I'll have a look about here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children crouched together in the cave. How they hoped that their boat would
not be found! How they hoped that no one would find any traces of them at all!
Timmy growled softly, wishing that he could go and find that Stinker-dog again!
It had been lovely to bite his ears hard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
was half-scared of finding the children, and a good deal more scared of coming
up against Timmy somewhere. So he did not make much of a search for either the
children or the boat. He went into the cove where the boat had been pulled up,
and although he saw traces where the vessel had been hauled up, barely<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>smoothed
out by the sea-water at high-tide, he did not notice the seaweedy prow of the
boat sticking out round the rock behind which it was hidden.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Nothing
here!&quot; he called to his mother, who was going round and about the ruins,
looking into every likely nook. But she found nothing either, and neither did
Mr. Stick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Couldn't
have been the children's dog,&quot; said Mr. Stick, at last. &quot;They'd be
here if he was, and so would their boat, but there's no sign of them at all.
That dog must have been some wild stray. Have to look out for him, no doubt
about it. Gone wild, I should think.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children relaxed after about an hour, thinking that the Sticks must have given
up looking for them. They boiled the kettle to make some tea, and Anne began to
cut some sandwiches. Timmy was tied up in case he wandered out again to look
for Stinker.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
ate their tea quietly, not speaking above a whisper. &quot;The Sticks haven't
come here to look for us, after all,&quot; said Julian. &quot;It's quite plain
from what they said that they thought we had gone to catch the train home,
taking George and Timmy with us.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Then
what are they here for?&quot; demanded George, fiercely. &quot;It's our island!
They've no right here. Let's go and turn them off! They're scared of Timmy.
We'll take him with us and say we'll set him on to them if they don't clear
out.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No,
George,&quot; said Julian, &quot;Do be sensible. We don't want them rushing off
and telling your father we are here, or he may lose his temper and come flying
home to order us back. And—there's another thing I've thought of.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What?',
asked the others, seeing Julian's eyes gleam in the way they did when he had an
idea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,&quot;
said Julian, &quot;don't you think it's possible that the Sticks are something
to do with the smugglers? Don't you think they may come here to take off
smuggled goods, or to hide them till they can take them off in safety? Mr.
Stick is a sailor, isn't he? He would know all about smuggling. I bet he's in
the pay of the smugglers all right.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
believe you're right!&quot; said George, in excitement. &quot;Well—we'll wait
till the Sticks have gone, and then we'll go down into the dungeons and see if
they've hidden anything there! We'll find out their little game and stop it! It
will be terribly thrilling, won't it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Sixteen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THE
STICKS GET A FRIGHT.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>BUT
the Sticks didn't go! The children peeped out of the spy-hole at the top of the
cave-roof every now and again, and saw one or other of the Sticks. The evening
went on and it began to be dark. Still the Sticks didn't go. Julian ran down to
the nearby shore and discovered a small boat there. So the Sticks had managed
to find their way round the island, rowed near the wreck, maybe landed on it
too, and then come to the shore, cleverly avoiding the rocks they might strike
against.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;It
looks as if the Sticks have come to stay for the night,&quot; said Julian,
gloomily. &quot;This is going to spoil our stay here, isn't it? We rush away
here to escape from the Sticks—and lo and behold! the Sticks are on top of us
again. It's too bad.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Let's
frighten them,&quot; said .George, her eyes shining by the light of the one
candle in the cave.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What
do you mean?&quot; said Dick, cheering up. He always liked George's ideas, mad
as they sometimes were.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
I suppose they must be living down in one of the dungeon rooms, mustn't
they?&quot; said George. &quot;There is no place in the ruins to live in proper
shelter, or we'd be there ourselves—and the only other place is down in the
dungeons. I wouldn't care to sleep there myself, but I don't suppose the Sticks
would mind.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
what about it?&quot; said Dick. &quot;What's your idea?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Couldn't
we creep down, and do a bit of shouting, so that the echoes start up all
round?&quot; said George. &quot;You know how frightening we found the echoes
when we first went down into the dungeons. We only had to say one or two words,
and the echoes began saying them over and over again shouting them back at
us.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh
yes, I remember,&quot; said Anne. &quot;And wasn't Timmy frightened when he
barked! The echoes barked back at him, and he thought there were thousands of
dogs hiding down there! He was awfully frightened.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;It's
a good idea,&quot; said Julian. &quot;Serve the Sticks right for coming to our
island like this! If we can frighten them away, that would be one up to us!
Let's do it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What
about Timothy?&quot; said Anne. &quot;Hadn't we better leave him behind?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No.
He can come and stand at the dungeon entrance to guard it for us,&quot; said
George. &quot;Then if any of the real smugglers happened to come, Timmy could
give us warning. I'm not going to leave him behind.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Come
on, then, let's go now!&quot; said Julian. &quot;It would be a fine trick to
play. It's quite dark, but I've got my torch, and as soon as we are certain
that the Sticks are down in the dungeons, we can start to play our joke.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no sign or sound of the Sticks anywhere about. No light of fire or candle
was to be seen, no sound of voices to be heard. Either they had gone, or they
were below in the dungeons. The stones had been taken from the entrance, so the
children felt sure they were down there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Now
Timmy, you stay quite still and quiet here,&quot; whispered George to Timmy.
&quot;Bark if anyone comes, but not unless. We're going down into the
dungeons.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
think perhaps I'll stay up here with Timothy,&quot; said Anne, suddenly. She
didn't like the dark look of the dungeon entrance. &quot;You see, George—Timmy
might be frightened or lonely up here by himself.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others chuckled. They knew Anne was frightened. Julian squeezed her arm.
&quot;You stay here, then,&quot; he said, kindly. &quot;You keep old Timmy
company.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
Julian, George and Dick went down the long flight of steps that led into the
deep old dungeons of Kirrin Castle. They had been there the summer before, when
they had been seeking for lost treasure; now here they were again!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
crept down the steps and came to the many cellars or dungeons cut out of the
rock below the castle. There were scores of those, some big and some small,
queer, damp underground rooms in which, maybe, unhappy prisoners had been kept
in the olden days.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children crept down the dark passages. Julian had a piece of white chalk with
him, and drew a chalk-line here and there on the rocky walls as he went, so
that he might easily find the way back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly
they heard voices and saw a light. They stopped and whispered softly together
in each other's ears.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;They're
in that room where we found the treasure last year! That's where they're camping
out! What noises shall we make?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I'll
be a cow,&quot; said Dick. &quot;I can moo awfully like a cow. I'll be a
cow.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I'll
be a sheep,&quot; said Julian. &quot;George, you be a horse. You can whinny and
hrrrumph just like a horse. Dick, you begin!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
Dick began. Hidden behind a rocky pillar, he opened his mouth and mooed
dolefully, like a cow in pain. At once the echoes took up the mooing, magnified
it, sent it along all the underground passages, till it seemed as if a thousand
cows had wandered there and were mooing together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Moo—oo—oo—OOOOOOOO,
ooo—oo—MOOOOOOO!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Sticks listened in amazement and fright at the sudden awful noise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What
is it, Ma?&quot; said Edgar, almost in tears. Stinker crouched at the back of
the cave, terrified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;It's
cows,&quot; said Mr. Stick, amazed. &quot;Them there's cows. Can't you hear the
moos? But how did cows get to be here?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Nonsense!&quot;
said Mrs. Stick, recovering herself a little. &quot;Cows down these caves!
You're mad! You'll be telling me there's sheep next!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was funny that she should have said that, for Julian chose that moment to begin
baa-ing like a flock of sheep. His one long, bleating &quot;baa-baa-aa-aa&quot;
was taken up by the echoes at once, and it seemed suddenly as if hundreds of
poor lost sheep were baa-ing their way down the dungeons!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Stick jumped to his feet, as white as a sheet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
if it isn't sheep now!&quot; he said. &quot;What's up? What's in these
&quot;ere dungeons? I never did like them.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Baa-aa-AAAAAAAAAAP
went the mournful bleats all round and about. And then George started her whinnying
and neighing, just like an impatient horse. The little girl tossed her head in
the darkness and hrrrumphed exactly like a horse and then she stamped with her
foot, and at once the echoes stamped too, sending the whinnying and neighing
and stamping into Sticks&quot; cave twenty times louder than George had made
them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Poor
Stinker began<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>to whine<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>pitifully.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>frightened
almost out of his life. He pressed himself against the floor as if he would
like to disappear into it. Edgar clutched his mother's arm. &quot;Let's go
up,&quot; he said. &quot;I can't stay here. There's hundreds of sheep and
horses . and cows roaming these dungeons, you can hear them. They're not real,
but they've got voices and hoofs, and I'm scared of them.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Stick went to the door of the room they were in, and shouted loudly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Get
out, you! Clear out! Whoever you are!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
giggled. Then she shouted out in a very deep, hoarse voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;BE-WARE!&quot;
And the echoes thundered out all round.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;WARE!
'WARE! &quot;WARE-ARE-ARE!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Stick went back quickly into the cave-room, and lighted another candle. He shut
the big wooden door that led into the room. His hands were shaking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Queer
goings-on,&quot; he said. &quot;Shan't stay here much longer if we get this
kind of thing happening every night.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian,
Dick and George were now in such a state of giggle that they could not imitate
any more-cows, horses or sheep. George did begin to be a pig, and gave such a
realistic snort and grunt that Dick nearly died of laughing. The snorts and
grunts were echoed everywhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Come
out&quot; gasped Julian, at last. &quot;I shall burst with trying not to laugh.
Come out!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Come
out!&quot; whispered the echoes. &quot;Come out, out, out!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
stumbled out, stuffing hankies into their mouths as they went, following
Julian's chalk-marks easily by the light of his torch. It was impossible to
take the wrong passage if they followed his guiding-lines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
sat on the dungeon steps with Anne and Timmy, and choked with laughter as they
related all they had done. &quot;We heard old Stick yelling to us to clear
out,&quot; said George, &quot;and he sounded scared stiff. As for Stinker, we
never heard even the smallest growl from him. I bet the Sticks will clear off
tomorrow after this! It must have given them a most terrible fright.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh,
that was grand!&quot; said Julian. &quot;It was a pity I began to laugh. I was
just feeling I might trumpet like an elephant next. The echoes would like
that!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Funny
the Sticks all staying on the island like this,&quot; said Dick, thoughtfully.
&quot;They've left Kirrin Cottage—but they're not looking for us. They must be
in league with the smugglers all right. Perhaps that's why Mrs. Stick took the
job with your mother, George — to be near the island when the time came—when
the smugglers wanted their help.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We
could really go back to Kirrin Cottage, couldn't we?&quot; said Anne, who, much
as she loved the island, .was not nearly so keen on it now that the Sticks were
there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Go
back! Leave an adventure just when it's beginning!&quot; said George,
scornfully. &quot;How silly you are, Anne. Go back if you want to — but I'm
sure nobody will go with you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh,
Anne will stay with us all right,&quot; said Julian,, knowing that Anne would
feel hurt at the suggestion she should leave them. &quot;It will be the Sticks
who have to go, don't worry!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Let's
go back to the cave,&quot; said Anne, thinking longingly of its safety and
bright little candle. They got up and made their way across the courtyard to
the little wall that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ran
round the castle. They climbed over it and turned their steps to the cliff.
Julian switched on his torch when he thought it was, safe, for it was
impossible to see clearly in the dark, and he did not want any of them to fall
down the hole, instead of climbing down properly by the rope.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
stood by the hole at last, shining his torch so that the others might climb
down the rope in safety, one by one. He glanced up, looking over the dark sea,
as he&quot; stood there, and then stared intently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a light out to sea, and it was signalling. It must have seen his
torchlight! Julian watched, wondering if it was a ship that was signalling, and
how far out it was, and why it was signalling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Perhaps
they're going to put more stuff into the old wreck for the Sticks to
find,&quot; he thought. &quot;I wonder if they are. How I'd like to find
out—but it would be dangerous to go there in daylight in case the Sticks see
us.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
signalling went on for a long time, as if a message was being flashed. Julian
could not for the life of him make out what it .was. It simply looked like the
flash-flash-flash of a lantern to him. But it must mean a signal or message of
some sort to the Sticks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
they won't get it tonight!&quot; thought Julian, with a chuckle, when at last
the signalling stopped. &quot;I rather think the Stick family will stay where
they are tonight, too scared of sheep and cows and horses rushing about in
those dungeons!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was quite right—the Sticks did stay where they were! Nothing would get them out
of their underground room till morning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Seventeen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
SHOCK FOR EDGAR.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THE
children slept well that night, and as Timothy did not growl at all, they were
sure that nothing important could have happened. They had a fine breakfast of
tongue, tinned peaches, bread and butter, golden syrup and ginger-beer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;That's
the end of the ginger-beer, I'm afraid,&quot; said Julian, regretfully. &quot;I
must say ginger-beer is a gorgeous drink—seems to go with simply
everything.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;That
was the nicest meal I've ever had,&quot; said Anne. &quot;It<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>really was. We do have lovely meals on Kirrin
Island. I wonder if the Sticks are having nice meals too.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You
bet they are!&quot; said Dick. &quot;I expect they have ransacked Aunt Fanny's
cupboards and taken the best they can find.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh,
the beasts!&quot; said George, her eyes flashing. &quot;I never thought of
that—they may have robbed the house and taken all kinds of things.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;They
probably have,&quot; said Julian, and he frowned. &quot;I say, I never thought
of that, somehow. How awful, George, if your mother came back, feeling ill and
weak, and found half her belongings gone!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh
dear!&quot; said Anne, dismayed. &quot;George, wouldn't that be dreadful?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes,&quot;
said George, looking very angry. &quot;I would believe anything of those
Sticks! If they have the cheek to come<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>to
our island and live here, they've the cheek to steal from my mother's house. I
wish we could find out.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
could have brought quite a lot of things away in their boat,&quot; said Julian.
&quot;They must have come here by boat. If they did bring stolen goods, they
must have put them somewhere—down in the dungeons, I suppose.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We
might have a look round and see if we can spy anything, without the Sticks
seeing us,&quot; suggested Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Let's
have a look round now,&quot; said George, who always liked doing things at
once. &quot;Anne, you do the washing up and tidy our cave-house for us, will
you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
was torn between wanting to go with the others, and longing to play
&quot;house&quot; again. She did so love arranging everything and making the
beds and tidying up the cave. In the end she said she would stay and the others
could go.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
up the rope they went. Timothy stayed with Anne, because they were afraid he
might bark. Anne tied him up, and he whined a little, but did not make a
terrible noise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
other three lay flat on the cliff-top, looking down on the ruined castle. There
seemed to be no one about, but, even as they watched, the three Sticks appeared,
apparently coming up from the dungeons. They seemed glad to be in the sunshine,
and the children were not surprised, for the dungeons were so cold and dark.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Sticks looked all round. Stinker kept close to Mrs. Stick, his tail well down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;They're
looking for the cows and sheep and-horses they heard down in the dungeons last
night!&quot; whispered Dick to Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Sticks spoke together for a minute or two, and then went off in the direction
of the shore that faced the wreck. Edgar went to the room in which the children
had first planned to sleep—the one whose roof had fallen in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I'm
going to stalk the two Sticks,&quot; whispered Julian to the others. &quot;You
two see what Edgar is up to.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
disappeared, keeping behind bushes as he watched where the Sticks went, and
followed them. George and Dick went cautiously and quietly over the cliff to
the castle in the middle of the little island. They<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>could
hear Edgar whistling. Stinker was running about the courtyard of the castle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
appeared out of the ruined room, carrying a pile of cushions, which had
evidently been stored there. George went red with rage and clutched Dick's arm
fiercely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Mother's
best cushions!&quot; she whispered. &quot;Oh, the beasts!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
felt angry too. It was quite plain that the Sticks had helped themselves to
anything handy when they had left Kirrin Cottage. He picked up a clod of earth,
took careful aim, and flung it into the air. It fell between Edgar and Stinker,
breaking into a shower of earth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
dropped the cushions, and looked up into the air in fright. It was plain that
he thought something had fallen from the sky. George picked up another clod,
took aim, and flung it high into the air. It fell all over Stinker, and the dog
gave a yelp, and scuttled down the hole that led into the dungeons.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
looked up into the sky and then all round and about him, his mouth wide open.
What could be happening? Dick waited until he was looking in the opposite
direction, and then once more sent a big clod into the air. It fell into bits
and scattered itself all over the startled Edgar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
Dick gave one of his realistic moos, exactly like a cow in pain, and Edgar
stood rooted to the spot, almost frightened out of his skin. Those cows again!
Where were they?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
mooed again, and Edgar gave a yell, found his feet, and almost fell down the
dungeon steps. He dis-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>appeared
with a dismal howl, leaving behind all the cushions on the ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Quick!&quot;
said Dick, jumping to his feet. &quot;He won't be back for a few minutes,
anyhow. He'll be too scared. Let's grab the cushions and bring them here. I
don't see why the Sticks should use them down in those awful old
dungeons.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two children raced to the courtyard, picked up the cushions and raced back to
their hiding-place. Dick looked across to the room where Edgar had brought them
from.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What
about slipping across there and seeing what else they've stored away?&quot; he
said. &quot;I don't see why they should be allowed to have anything that isn't
theirs.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I'll
go across, and you keep watch by the dungeon entrance,&quot; said George.
&quot;You've only got to moo again if you see Edgar, and he'll run for
miles.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Right,&quot;
said Dick, with a grin, and went swiftly to the flight of steps that led
underground to the dungeons. There was no sign of Edgar at all, nor of Stinker.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
went to the ruined room and gazed round in anger. Yes, the Sticks certainly had
helped themselves to her mother's things, no doubt about that! There were
blankets and silver and all kinds of food. Mrs. Stick must have gone into the
big cupboard under the stairs and taken out various things stored there for
weekly use.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
ran to Dick. &quot;There are heaps of our things!&quot; she said, in a fierce
whisper. &quot;Come and help me to get them. We'll see if we can take them all
before Edgar appears, or the Sticks come back.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Just
as they were whispering together, they heard a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>low
whistle. They looked round, and saw Julian coming along. He joined them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;The
Sticks have rowed off to the wreck,&quot; he said. &quot;They've got an old
boat somewhere down among those rocks. Old Pa Stick must be a good sailor to be
able to take the boat in and out of those awful hidden rocks.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh,
then we've got time to do what we want to do,&quot; said Dick, pleased. He
hurriedly told Julian of the things George had seen in the ruined room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Awful
thieves!&quot; said Julian, indignantly. &quot;They don't mean to go back to
Kirrin Cottage, that's plain. They've got some business on with the smugglers
here—and when that is done they'll go off with all their stolen goods, join a
ship somewhere, and get off scot-free.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No,
they won't,&quot; said George at once. &quot;We are going to get everything and
take it to the cave! Dick's going to keep watch for Edgar at the cave entrance,
and you and I, Julian, can quickly carry the things away. We can drop them down
the hole into the cave.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Hurry
then!&quot; said Julian. &quot;We must do it before the Sticks return, and I
don't expect they'll be long. They've probably gone to fetch the trunk and
anything else in the wreck. You know I saw a light out to sea last night—maybe
that's a signal that the smugglers were leaving something in the wreck for the
Sticks to fetch.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
and Julian ran to the ruined room, piled their arms with the goods there, and
then ran to hide them on the cliff, ready to take them to the hole when they had
time. It looked as if the Sticks had just taken whatever was easiest to lay
their hands on. They had even got the kitchen clock!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
did not appear at all, so Dick had nothing to do but sit by the steps of the
dungeon and watch the others. After some time Julian and George gave a sigh of
relief and beckoned to Dick. He left his place and went to join them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We've
got everything now,&quot; said Julian. &quot;I'm just going to the cliff-edge
to see if the Sticks are returning yet. If they're not we'll all carry the
things to the hole in the roof of the cave.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
soon returned. &quot;I can see their boat tied to the wreck,&quot; he said.
&quot;We're safe for some while yet. Come on, let's get the things to safety!
This really is a bit of luck.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
carried the things to the hole and called down it to Anne. &quot;Anne! We've
got tons of things to put down the hole. Stand by to catch!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
all kinds of things came down the hole into the cave! Anne was most astonished.
The silver and anything that might be hurt by a fall was first wrapped up in
the blankets, and then let down by a rope.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;My
goodness!&quot; said Anne. &quot;This cave will really look like a house soon,
when I have arranged all these things too!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Just
as they were finishing their job the children heard voices in the distance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;The
Sticks are back!&quot; said Julian, and looked cautiously over the cliff-top.
He was right. They had returned to their boat, and were even now on their way
back to the castle, carrying the trunk from the wreck.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Let's
follow them, and see what happens when they find everything gone,&quot; grinned
Julian. &quot;Come on, everyone!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
wriggled over the cliff on their tummies, and came to a clump of bushes behind
which they could hide and watch. The Sticks put the trunk down, and looked
round for Edgar. But Edgar was nowhere to be seen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Where's
that boy?&quot; said Mrs. Stick, impatiently. &quot;He's had plenty of time to
do everything. Edgar! Edgar! Edgar!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Stick went to the ruined room and peeped inside. He came back to Mrs. Stick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;He's
taken everything down,&quot; he said. &quot;He must be down in the dungeon.
That room's quite empty.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
told him to come up and sit in the sun when he'd finished,&quot; said Mrs.
Stick. &quot; 'Tisn't healthy down in them dungeons. EDGAR!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
time Edgar heard, and his head appeared, looking out of the entrance to the
dungeon. He looked extremely scared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Come
on up!&quot; said Mrs. Stick. &quot;You've got all the things down, and. you'd
better stay up here in the sunshine now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I'm
scared,&quot; said Edgar. &quot;I'm not staying up here alone.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Why
not?&quot; said Mr. Stick, astonished. .<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;It's
them cows again!&quot; said poor Edgar. &quot;Hundreds of them, Pa, all
a-mooing round me, and throwing things at me. They're dangerous animals, they
are, and I'm not coming up here alone!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Eighteen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>AN
UNEXPECTED PRISONER.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THE
Sticks stared at Edgar as if he was mad.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Cows
throwing things?&quot; said Mrs. Stick at last. &quot;What do you mean by that?
Cows don't throw any thing.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;These
ones did,&quot; said Edgar, and then began to exaggerate in order to make his
parents sympathise with him. &quot;They were dreadful cows, they were-hundreds
of them, with horns as long as reindeer, and awful mooing voices. And they
threw things at me and Tinker. Proper scared he was, and so was I. I dropped
the cushions I was taking down, and rushed away to hide.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Where
are the cushions?&quot; said Mr. Stick, looking round. &quot;I can't see no
cushions. I suppose you'll tell us the cows ate them.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Didn't
you take everything down into the dungeons?&quot; demanded Mrs. Stick.
&quot;Because that room's empty now. There's not a thing in it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
didn't take nothing down at all,&quot; said Edgar, coming cautiously out of the
dungeon entrance. &quot;I dropped the cushions just about where you're
standing. What's happened to them?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Look
&quot;ere!&quot; said Mr. Stick, in amazement. &quot; 'Oo's been 'ere since
we've been gone? Someone's taken them cushions and everything else too. Where
have they put them?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Pa,
it was them cows,&quot; said Edgar, looking all round as if he expected to see
cows walking off with cushions and silver and blankets.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Shut
up about them cows,&quot; said Mrs. Stick, suddenly losing her temper.
&quot;For one thing there aren't any cows on this island, and that we do know,
for we looked all over it this morning. What we heard last night must have been
queer sort of echoes rumbling round. No, my boy — there's something funny about
all this. Looks as if there w somebody on the island!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
dismal howl came echoing up from below the ground. It was Stinker, terrified at
being alone below, and not daring to come up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Poor
lamb!&quot; said Mrs. Stick, who seemed much fonder of Stinker than of anyone
else.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What's
up with him?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Stinker
let out an even more doleful howl, and Mrs. Stick hurried down-the steps to go
to him. Mr. Stick followed her, and Edgar lost no time in going after them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Quick!&quot;
said Julian, standing up. &quot;Come with me, Dick. We may just have time to
get that trunk! Run!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two boys ran quickly down to the courtyard of the ruined castle. Each took a
handle of the small trunk, and lifted it between .them. They staggered back to
George with it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'll
take it to the cave,&quot; whispered Julian. &quot;You stay here a few minutes
and see what happens.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys went over the cliff with the trunk. George flattened herself behind her
bush and watched. Mr. Stick appeared again in a few minutes, and looked round
for the trunk. His mouth fell open in astonishment when he<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>saw
that it was gone. He yelled down the entrance to the dungeon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Clara!
The trunk's gone!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Stick was already on her way up, with Stinker close beside her and Edgar just
behind. She climbed out and stared round.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Gone?&quot;
she said, in enormous surprise. &quot;Gone? Where's it gone?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;That's
what I'd like to know!&quot; said Mr. Stick. &quot;We leave it here a few
minutes — and then it goes. Walks off by itself—just like all the other
things!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Look
here! There's someone on this island,&quot; said Mrs. Stick. &quot;And I'm
going to find out who it is. Got your gun, Pa?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
have,&quot; said Mr. Stick, slapping his belt. &quot;You get a good stout stick
too, and we'll take Tinker. If we don't ferret out whoever's trying to spoil
our plans, my name's not Stick!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
slipped away quietly to warn the others. Before she slid down the rope into the
cave, she pulled several bramble sprays across the hole. She dropped down to
the floor of the cave, and told the others what had happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
had been trying to open the trunk, but it was still locked.. He looked up as
George panted out&quot; her tale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'll
be all right here so long as no one falls down that hole in the roof!&quot; he
said. &quot;Now keep quiet everyone, and don't you dare to growl, Timmy!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nothing
was heard for some time, and then Stinker's bark came in the distance.
&quot;Quiet now,&quot; said Julian. &quot;They are near here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Sticks were up on the cliff once more, searching carefully behind every bush.
They came to the great bush behind which the children often hid, and saw the
flattened grass there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Someone's
been here,&quot; said Mr. Stick. &quot;I wonder if they're in the middle of
this bush—it's thick enough to hide half an army! I'll try and force my way in,
Clara, while you stand by with my gun.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
wandered off by himself while this was happening, feeling certain that nobody
would be foolish enough to live in the middle of such a prickly bush. He walked<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>across
the cliff— and then, to his awful horror, he found himself falling! His legs
disappeared into a hole, he clutched at some thorny sprays but could not save
himself. Down he went, and down and down—and down—crash!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
had fallen down the hole in the roof of the cave. He suddenly appeared before
the children's startled eyes, and landed in a heap on the soft sand. Timmy at
once pounced on him with a fearsome growl, but George pulled him off just in
time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
was half-stunned with fright and his fall. He lay on the floor of the cave,
groaning, his eyes shut. The children stared at him and then at one another.
For a few moments they were completely taken aback and didn't know what to do
or say. Timmy growled ferociously—so ferociously that Edgar opened, his eyes in
fright. He stared round at the four children and their dog in the utmost
surprise and horror.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
opened his mouth to yell for help, but at once found Julian's large hand over
it. &quot;Yell just once and Timmy shall have a bite out of any part of you he
likes!&quot; said Julian, in a voice as ferocious as Timothy's growl.
&quot;See? Like to try it? Timmy's waiting to bite.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
shan't yell,&quot; said Edgar, speaking in such a low whisper that the others
could hardly hear him. &quot;Keep that dog off. I shan't yell.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
spoke to Timothy. &quot;Now you listen, Timothy—if this boy shouts, you just go
for him! Lie here by him and show him your big teeth. Bite him wherever you
like if he yells.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Woof!&quot;
said Timmy, looking really pleased. He lay<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>down
by Edgar, and the boy tried to move away. But Timmy came nearer every time he
moved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
looked round at the children. &quot;What you doing on this island?&quot; he
said. &quot;We thought you'd gone home.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;It's
our island!&quot; said George, in a very fierce voice. &quot;We've every right
to be on it if we want to—but you have no right at all. None! What are you and
your father and mother here for?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Don't
know,&quot; said Edgar, looking sulky.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You'd
better tell us;&quot; said Julian. &quot;We know you're in league with
smugglers.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
looked startled. &quot;Smugglers?&quot; he said. &quot;I didn't know that. Pa
and Ma don't tell me nothing. I don't want nothing to do with smugglers.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Don't
you know any-thing?&quot; said Dick. &quot;Don't you know why you've come to
Kirrin Island?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
don't know nothing,&quot; said Edgar, in an injured tone. &quot;Pa and Ma are
mean to me. They never tell me nothing. I do as I'm told, that's all. I don't
know nothing about smugglers, I tell you that.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was quite plain to the children that Edgar really did not know anything of the
reasons for his parents coming to the island. &quot;Well, I'm not surprised
they don't let Spotty-Face into their secrets,&quot; said Julian. &quot;He'd
blab them if he could, I bet. Anyway, we know it's smuggling they're mixed up
in.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You
let me go,&quot; said Edgar, sullenly. &quot;You got no right to keep me
here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We're
not going to let you go,&quot; said George at once. &quot;You're our prisoner
now. If we let you go back to your parents, you'd tell them all about us, and
we don't want<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>them
to know we're here. We're going to spoil their pretty plans, you see.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
saw. He saw quite a lot of things. He felt rather sick. &quot;Was it you that
took the cushions and things?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh
no, dear Edgar,&quot; said Dick. &quot;It was the cows, wasn't it? Don't you
remember how you told your mother about the hundreds of cows that mooed at you
and threw things and stole the cushions you dropped? Surely you haven't
forgotten your cows already?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Funny,
aren't you?&quot; said Edgar, sulkily. &quot;What you going to do with me? I
won't stay here, that's flat.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;But
you will, Spotty-Face,&quot; said Julian. &quot;You will stay here till we let
you go—and that won't be till we've cleared up this little smuggling mystery.
And let me warn you that any nonsense on your part will be punished by
Timmy.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Lot
of beasts you are,&quot; said Edgar, seeing that he could do nothing but obey
the four children. &quot;My Pa and Ma won't half be furious with you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
Ma and Pa were feeling extremely astonished. There had, of course, been nobody
hiding in the big thick bush, and when Mr. Stick had wriggled out, scratched
and bleeding, he had looked round for Edgar. And Edgar was not to be seen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Where's
that dratted boy?&quot; he said, and shouted for him. &quot;Edgar!
ED-GAR!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Edgar did not answer. The Sticks spent a very long time looking for Edgar, both
above ground and underground. Mrs. Stick was convinced that poor Edgar was lost
in the dungeons, and she tried to send Stinker to find him. But Stinker only
went as far as the first cave. He<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>remembered
the peculiar noises of the night before and was not at all keen on exploring
the dungeons.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
turned his attention to the little trunk, once Edgar had been dealt with.
&quot;I'm going to open this somehow,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm sure it's got
smuggled goods in, though goodness knows what.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You'll
have to smash the locks then,&quot; said Dick. Julian got a small rock and
tried to smash the two locks. He managed to wrench one open after a while, and
then the other gave way too. The children threw back the lid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
the top was a child's blanket, embroidered with white rabbits. Julian pulled it
off, expecting to see the smuggled goods below. But to his astonishment there
were a child's clothes!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
pulled them out. There were two blue jerseys, a blue skirt, some vests and
knickers and a warm coat. At the bottom of the trunk were some dolls and a
teddy bear!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Golly!&quot;
said Julian, in amazement. &quot;What are all these for? Why did the Sticks
bring these to the island—and why did the smugglers hide them in the wreck?
It's a puzzler!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
appeared to be as astonished as the rest. He too had expected valuable goods of
some kind. George and Anne pulled out the dolls. They were lovely ones. Anne
cuddled them up to her. She loved dolls, though George scorned them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Who
do they belong to?&quot; she said. &quot;Oh won't she be—sad not to have them?
Julian, isn't it funny? Why should anyone bring a trunk full of clothes and
dolls to Kirrin Island?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Nineteen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
SCREAM IN THE NIGHT.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>NOBODY
could even guess the answers to Anne's surprised questions. The children stared
into the trunk and puzzled over it. It seemed such a funny thing to smuggle.
They remembered the other things in the wreck too—the tins of food. They were
queer things to smuggle into the island. There didn't seem any point in it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Funny,&quot;
said Dick, at last. &quot;It beats me. There's no doubt that queer things are
afoot here, or the Sticks wouldn't be hanging around our island. And we've seen
signals from a ship out to Sea. Something's going on. We thought if we opened
this trunk it might help us — but it's only made the mystery deeper.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Just
then the voices of the two parent Sticks could be heard shouting for Edgar. But
Edgar did not dare to shout back. Timmy's nose was poked against his leg. He
might be nipped at any time. Timmy growled every now and again to remind Edgar
that he was still there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Do
you know anything about the ship that signals to this island at night?&quot;
asked Julian, turning to Edgar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy shook his head. &quot;Never heard of no signals,&quot; he said. &quot;I
just heard my mother saying that she expected the Roomer tonight, but I don't
know what she meant.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;The
Roomer?&quot; said George, at once. &quot;What's that—a man—or a boat—or
what?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
don't know,&quot; said Edgar. &quot;I'd only have got a clip on the ear if I'd
asked. Find out yourself.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We
will,&quot; said Julian, grimly. &quot;We'll watch out for the Roomer tonight!
Thanks for the information.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children spent a quiet and rather boring day in the cave—all but Anne, who had
plenty of things to arrange again. Really, the cave looked most home-like when
she had finished! She put the blankets on the bed, and used the rugs as
carpets. So the cave really looked most imposing!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
was not allowed to go out of the cave, and Timothy didn't leave him for a
moment. He slept most of the time, complaining that &quot;them cows and
things&quot; had frightened him so much the night before that he'd not been
able to sleep a wink.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others discussed their plans in low voices. They decided to keep watch on the
cliff-top, two and two together, that night. They would wait and see what
happened. If the Roomer came, they would hurriedly make fresh plans then.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sun sank. The night came up dark over the sea. Edgar snored softly, after a
very good supper of sardines, pressed beef sandwiches, tinned apricots and
tinned milk. Anne and Dick went up to keep the first watch. It was about
half-past ten.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
half-past twelve Julian and George climbed up the knotted rope and joined the
other two. They had nothing to report. They went down into the cave, got into
their comfortable beds and went to sleep. Edgar was snoring away in his corner,
Timmy still on guard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and George looked out to sea, watching for any<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>sign
of a ship. The moon was up that night, and things were not quite so dark.
Suddenly they heard low voices, and saw shadowy figures down by the rocks
below.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;The
two Sticks,&quot; whispered Julian. &quot;Going to row out to the wreck again,
I suppose.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was the splash of oars, and the children saw a boat move out over the water. At
the same time George nudged Julian violently and pointed out to sea. A light
was being shown a good way out, from a ship that the children could barely see.
Then the moon went behind a cloud, and they could see nothing for some time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
watched breathlessly. Was that shadowy ship a good way out the Roomer? Or was
the owner of it the &quot;Roamer'? Were the smugglers at work tonight?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;There's
another boat coming—look!&quot; said George. &quot;It must be coming from that
ship out to sea. Now the moon has come out again, you can just see it. It is
going to the old wreck. It must be a meeting-place, I should think.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then,
most irritatingly, the moon went behind a cloud again, and remained there so
long that the children grew impatient. At last it sailed out again and lighted
up the water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Both
boats are leaving the wreck now,&quot; said Julian excitedly. &quot;They've had
their meeting—and passed over the smuggled goods, I suppose—and now one boat is
returning to the ship, and the other, the Sticks&quot; boat, is coming back
here with the goods. We'll follow the Sticks when they get back and see where
they put the goods.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
a long time the Sticks&quot; boat came to shore again. The children could not
see anything then, but presently they saw the Sticks going back towards the
castle. Mr. Stick carried what looked like a large bundle, flung over his
shoulder. They could not see if Mrs. Stick carried anything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Sticks went into the courtyard of the castle, and came to the dungeon entrance.
&quot;They're taking the smuggled goods down there,&quot; whispered Julian to
George. The children were now watching from behind a nearby wall. &quot;We'll
go back and tell the others, and make some more plans. We must somehow or other
get those goods ourselves, and take them back to the mainland and get in touch
with the police!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Just
then a scream rang out in the night. It was a high-pitched, terrified scream,
and frightened the watching children very much. They had no idea where it came
from.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Quick!
It must be Anne!&quot; said Julian, and the two ran as fast as they could to
the hole that led down to the cave. They dropped down the rope and Julian
looked round the quiet cave anxiously. What had happened to Anne to make her
scream like that?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Anne was peacefully asleep on her bed, and so was Dick. Edgar still snored and
Timmy watched, his eyes gleaming green.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Funny,&quot;
said Julian, still startled. &quot;Awfully queer. Who screamed like that? It
couldn't possibly have been Anne—because if she had screamed in her sleep like
that, she would have wakened the others.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
who screamed, then?&quot; said George, feeling rather scared. &quot;Wasn't it
weird, Julian? I didn't like it. It was somebody who was awfully frightened.
But who could it be?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
woke Dick and Anne and told them about the strange scream. Anne was very
startled. Dick was interested to hear that two boats had met at the wreck, and
that the Sticks had brought back smuggled goods of some sort, and taken them
down in the dungeons.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'll
get those tomorrow, somehow!&quot; he said, cheerfully. &quot;We'll have good
fun.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Why
did you think it was me screaming?&quot; asked Anne. &quot;Did you think it was
a girl's scream?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes.
It sounded like the scream you give when one of us jumps out at you suddenly,&quot;
said Julian, &quot;A proper little girl's scream—not a yell, like a boy
gives.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;It's
funny,&quot; said Anne. She cuddled down into her bed again, and George got in
beside her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh
Anne!&quot; said George, in disgust, &quot;you've got our bed simply full of
those dolls—and that teddy bear is here too! You really are a baby!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No,
I'm not,&quot; said Anne. &quot;The dolls and the bear are babies—they are
frightened and lonely because they're not with the little girl they belong to.
So I had them in bed with me instead! I'm sure the little girl would be
glad.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;The
little girl!&quot; said Julian, slowly. &quot;We thought we heard a little girl
scream tonight—we found a small trunk full of a little girl's clothes, and a
little girl's dolls. What docs it all mean?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a silence—and then Anne spoke excitedly. &quot;I know! The smuggled goods
are a little girl! They've stolen a little girl away—and these are her dolls,
and those over there are her clothes that were stolen at the same time, for her
to dress in and play with. The little<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>girl's
here, on this island now—you heard her scream tonight when those horrid Sticks
carried her down into the dungeons!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well
— I do believe Anne has hit on the right idea,&quot; said Julian. &quot;Clever
little girl, Anne! I think you're right. It isn't smugglers who are using this
island—it's kidnappers!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What
are kidnappers?&quot; said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;People
who steal away children or grown-ups and hide them somewhere till a large sum
of money is paid out for them,&quot; explained Julian. &quot;It's called a
ransom. Till the ransom is paid, the prisoner is held by the captors.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
that's what's happened here then!&quot; said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
bet it has! Some poor little rich girl has been stolen away—and brought to the
wreck by boat from some ship — and taken over by those horrible Sticks. Wicked
creatures!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;And
we heard the poor little thing scream just as she was taken down
underground,&quot; said George. &quot;Julian, we've got to rescue her.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes,
of course,&quot; said Julian. &quot;We will, never fear! We'll rescue her
tomorrow.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
woke up and joined in the conversation suddenly. &quot;What you talking
about?&quot; he said. &quot;Rescue who?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Never
you mind,&quot; said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
nudged him and whispered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;All
I hope is that Mrs. Stick is feeling as upset about losing her dear Edgar as
the mother of the little girl,&quot; she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Tomorrow
we find the little girl somehow, and take<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>her
away,&quot; said Julian. &quot;I expect the Sticks will be on guard, but we'll
find a way.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I'm
tired now,&quot; said George, lying down. &quot;Let's go to sleep. We'll wake
up nice and fresh. Oh Anne, do put these dolls your side. I'm lying on at least
three.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
took the dolls and the bear and arranged them on her side of the bed.
&quot;Don't feel lonely,&quot; George heard her say. &quot;I'll look after you
all right till you go back to your own mistress. Sleep tight!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
they all slept—all but Timothy, who lay with one eye open all night long. There
was no need to put anyone on guard while Timmy was there. He was the best
guardian they could have.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

RESCUE—AND A NEW PRISONER!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>THE
next day Julian was awake early and went up the rope to the cliff-top to see if
the Sticks were about. He saw them coming up the steps that led from the
dungeons. Mrs. Stick looked pale and worried.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We've
got to find our Edgar,&quot; she kept saying to Mr. Stick. &quot;I tell you
we've got to find our Edgar. He's not down in the dungeons. That I do know.
We've yelled ourselves hoarse down there.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;And
he's not on the island,&quot; said Mr. Stick. &quot;We hunted all over it
yesterday. I think whoever was here then, took our goods, caught Edgar, and
made off with him and everything else in their boat. That's what I think.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
they've taken him to the mainland then,&quot; said Mrs. Stick. &quot;We'd
better take our boat and go back there and ask a few questions. What I'd like
to know is—who is it messing about here and interfering with our plans? It
makes me scared. Just when things are going nicely Too!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Is
it all right to leave here just now?&quot; said Mr. Stick, doubtfully.
&quot;Suppose whoever was here yesterday is still here—they might pop down into
the dungeons when we're gone.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
they're not here,&quot; said Mrs. Stick, firmly. &quot;Use your common sense,
if you've got any—wouldn't our Edgar yell the place down if he was being kept
prisoner<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>on
this little island—and wouldn't we hear him? I tell you he must have been taken
off in a boat, together with all the other things that are gone. And I don't
like it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;All
right, all right!&quot; said Mr. Stick in a grumbling tone. &quot;That boy's
always a nuisance—always in silly trouble of some sort.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>&quot;How can you talk of poor Edgar like
that?&quot; cried Mrs. Stick. &quot;Do you think the poor child likes being
captured! Goodness knows what he's going through — feeling frightened and
lonely without me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
felt disgusted. Here was Mrs. Stick talking like that about old Spotty-Face—and
yet she had a little girl down in the dungeons—a child much younger than Edgar!
What a beast she was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What
about Tinker?&quot; said Mr. Stick, in a sulky tone. &quot;Better leave him
here, hadn't we, to guard the entrance to the dungeons? Not that there will be
anyone here, if what you say is right.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh,
we'll leave Tinker,&quot; said Mrs. Stick, setting off to the boat. Julian saw
them embark, leaving the dog behind. Tinker watched them rowing away, his tail
well down between his legs. Then he turned and ran back to the courtyard, and
lay down dolefully in the sun. He was very uneasy. His ears were cocked and he
kept looking . this way and that. He didn't like this queer island and its
unexpected noises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
tore back to the cave and dropped down the rope, startling Edgar very much.
&quot;Come outside the cave and I'll tell you my plans,&quot; said Julian to
the others. He didn't want Edgar to hear them. They all went outside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
had got breakfast ready while Julian had been gone, and the kettle was boiling
away merrily on the little stove.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Listen!&quot;
said Julian. &quot;The Sticks have gone off in their boat back to the mainland
to see if they can find their precious little darling Edgar. Mrs. Stick is all
hot and bothered because she thinks someone's gone off with him and she's
afraid the poor boy will be feeling frightened and lonely!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well!&quot;
said George. &quot;Doesn't she think that the little kidnapped girl must be
feeling much worse? What a horrid woman she is!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You're
right,&quot; said Julian. &quot;Well, what I propose to do is this—we'll go
down into the dungeons now and rescue the little girl—and bring her here to our
cave for breakfast. Then we'll take her off in our boat, go to the police, find
out where her parents are, and telephone to them that she is safe.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What
shall we do with Edgar?&quot; said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
know!&quot; said George at once. &quot;We'll put Edgar into the dungeon instead
of the little girl! Think how astonished the Sticks will be to find the little
girl gone — and their dear Edgar shut up in the dungeon instead!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oooh!—that
is a good idea,&quot; said Anne, and all the others laughed and agreed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You
stay here, Anne, and cut some more bread and butter for the little girl,&quot;
said Julian. He knew that Anne hated going down into the dungeons.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
nodded, pleased..<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;All
right, I will. I'll just take the kettle off for a bit too, or else the water
will boil away.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went back into the cave. &quot;Come with us, Edgar,&quot; said Julian.
&quot;You come too, Timmy.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Where
you going to take me?&quot; said Edgar, suspiciously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;A
nice cosy, comfortable place, where cows can't get at you,&quot; said Julian.
&quot;Come on! Buck up.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Gr-r-r-r-r-r,&quot;
said Timmy, his nose against Edgar's leg. Edgar got up in a hurry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went up the rope, one after another, though Edgar was terribly scared, and
was sure he couldn't. But with Timmy snapping at his ankles below, he climbed
up the rope remarkably quickly, and was hauled out at the top by Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Now,
quick march!&quot; said Julian, who wanted to get everything over before the
Sticks thought of returning. And quick march it was, over the cliffs, over the
low wall of the castle, and down into the courtyard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I'm
not going down into them dungeons with you,&quot; said Edgar, in alarm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You
are, Spotty-Face,&quot; said Julian, amiably.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Where's
my Pa and Ma?&quot; said Edgar, looking anxiously all round.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Those
cows have got them, I expect,&quot; said George. &quot;The ones that came and
mooed at you and threw things, you know.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
giggled, except Edgar, who looked worried and pale. He did not like this kind
of adventure at all. The children came to the dungeon entrance, and found that
the Sticks had not only closed down the stone that opened the way to the
dungeons, but had also dragged heavy rocks across it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Blow
your parents!&quot; said Julian, to Edgar. &quot;Making a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>lot
of trouble for everybody. Come on, stir yourself— all hands to these stones.
Edgar, pull when we pull. Go on! You'll get into trouble if you don't.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
pulled with the rest, and one by one the rocks were moved away. Then the heavy
trapdoor stone was hauled up too, and the flight of steps was exposed leading
down into darkness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;There's
Tinker!&quot; suddenly cried Edgar, pointing to a bush some distance away.
Tinker was there, hiding, quite terrified at seeing Timothy again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tat
lot of good Stinker is,&quot; said Julian. &quot;No, Timmy—you're not to eat
him. Stay here! He wouldn't taste nice if you did eat him!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timothy
was sorry not to be able to chase Stinker round and round the island. If he
couldn't chase rabbits, he might at least be allowed to chase Stinker!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went down into the dungeons. Julian's white chalk-marks were still on the
rocky walls, so it was easy to find the way to the cave-like room where the
children, last summer, had found piles of golden ingots. They felt sure that
the little kidnapped girl had been put there, for this cave had a big wooden
door that could be bolted on the outside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came to the door. It was well and truly bolted. There was no sound from inside.
Everyone halted outside and Timmy scratched at the door, whining gently. He
knew there was someone inside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Hallo,
there!&quot; shouted Julian, in a loud and cheerful voice. &quot;Are you all
right? We've come to rescue you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a scrambling noise, as if someone had got up from a stool. Then a small
voice sounded from the cave.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Hallo!
Who are you? Oh, do please rescue me! I'm so lonely and frightened!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Just
undoing the door!&quot; called back Julian, cheerfully. &quot;We're all
children out here, so don't be afraid. You'll soon be safe.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
shot back the bolts, and flung open the door. Inside the cave, which was
lighted by a lantern, stood a small girl, with a scared little white face, and
large dark eyes. Dark red hair tumbled round her cheeks, and she had evidently
been crying bitterly, for her face was dirty and tear-stained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
went to her and put his arm round her. &quot;Everything's all right now,&quot;
he said. &quot;You're safe. We'll take you back to your mother.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
do want her, I do, I do,&quot; said the little girl, and tears ran down her
cheeks again. &quot;Why am I here? I don't like being here.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh,
it's just an adventure you've had,&quot; said. Julian. &quot;It's over now—at
least, nearly over. There's still a bit of it left—a nice bit, though. We want
you to come and have breakfast with us in our cave. We've a lovely cave.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh,
have you?&quot; said the little girl, rubbing her eyes. &quot;I want to go with
you, I like you, but I didn't like those other people.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Of
course you didn't,&quot; said George. &quot;Look! This is Timothy, our dog. He
wants to be friends with you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What
a simply lovely dog!&quot; said the little girl, and flung her arms around
Timmy's neck. He licked her ir delight. George was pleased. She put her arm
round the little girl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What's
your name?&quot; she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Jennifer
Mary Armstrong,&quot; said the little girl. &quot;What's yours?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;George,&quot;
said George, and the little girl nodded, thinking that George was a boy, not a
girl, for she was dressed in jeans just like Julian and Dick, and her hair was
short, too, though very curly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others told her their names—and then she looked at Edgar, who had said nothing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;This
is Spotty-Face,&quot; said Julian. &quot;He isn't a friend of ours. It was his
father and mother who put you here, Jennifer. Now we are going to leave him
here in your . place. It will be such a pleasant surprise for them, won't
it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
gave a yell of dismay and tried to back away—but Julian gave him a strong shove
that sent him flying into the cave.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;There's
only one way to teach people like you and your parents that wickedness doesn't
pay!&quot; said the boy, grimly. &quot;And that is to punish you hard. People
like you don't understand kindness. You think it's just being soft and silly.
All right—you can have a taste of what Jennifer has had. It will do you good,
and do your parents a lot of good too! Good-bye!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
began to howl dismally as Julian bolted the big wooden door top and bottom.
&quot;I shall starve!&quot; he wailed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh
no, you won't,&quot; said Julian. &quot;There's plenty of food and water in
there, so help yourself. It would do you good to go hungry for a while, all the
same.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Mind
the cows don't get you!&quot; called Dick, and he gave a realistic moo that
startled Jennifer very much, for the echoes came mooing round too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;It's
all right—only the echoes,&quot; said George, smiling at her in the
torch-light. Edgar howled away in the cave, sobbing like a baby.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Little
coward, isn't he?&quot; said Julian. &quot;Come on—let's get back. I'm awfully
hungry for my breakfast.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;So
am I,&quot; said Jennifer, slipping her small hand into Julian's. &quot;I
wasn't hungry at all in that cave — but now I am. Thank you for rescuing
me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Don't
mention it,&quot; said Julian, grinning at her. &quot;It's a real pleasure—and
an even greater one to put old Spotty-Face there instead of you. Nice to give
the Sticks a dose of their own medicine.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jennifer
didn't know what he meant, but the others did, and they chuckled. They made
their way back through the dark, musty passages of the dungeons, passing many
caves, big and small, on the way. They came at last to the flight of steps and
went up them into the dazzling sun-light.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh!&quot;
said Jennifer, breathing in great gulps of the—. fresh, sea-smelling air.
&quot;Oh! This is lovely! Where am I?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;On
our island,&quot; said George. &quot;And this is our ruined castle. You were
brought here last night in a boat. We heard you scream, and that's how we
guessed you were being made a prisoner.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
walked to the cliff, and Jennifer was amazed at the way they disappeared down
the knotted rope. She was eager to try too, and soon slid down into the cave.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Nice
kid, isn't she?&quot; said Julian to George. &quot;My word, she's had even more
of an adventure than we have!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Twenty-One.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
VISIT TO THE POLICE STATION.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ANNE
liked Jennifer very much, and gave her a hug and a kiss. Jennifer looked round
the well-furnished cave in amazement and wonder—and then she gave-a scream of
surprise and joy. She pointed to Anne's neatly-made bed, on which sat a number
of beautiful dolls, and a large teddy-bear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>.'My
dolls!&quot; she said. &quot;Oh, and Teddy, too! Oh, oh, where did you get
them? I've missed them so! Oh Josephine and Angela and Rosebud and Marigold, have
you missed me?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
flung herself on the dolls. Anne was very interested to hear their names.
&quot;I've looked after them well,&quot; she told Jennifer. &quot;They're quite
all right.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh,
thank you,&quot; said the little girl, happily. &quot;I do think you're all
nice. Oh, I say—what a lovely breakfast!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was. Anne had opened a tin of salmon, two tins of peaches, a tin of milk, cut
some bread and butter, and made a big jug of cocoa. Jennifer sat down and began
to eat. She was very hungry, and as she ate, she began to lose her paleness and
look rosy and happy. .<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children talked busily as they ate. Jennifer told them about herself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
was playing in the garden with my nurse,&quot; she said, &quot;and suddenly,
when nurse had gone indoors to fetch something, a man climbed over the wall,
threw a shawl<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>round
my head, and took me away. We live by the sea, you know, and I soon heard the
sound of the waves splashing on the shore, and I knew I was being put into a
boat. I was taken to a big ship, and locked down in a cabin for two days: Then
I suppose I was brought here one night. I was so frightened that I
screamed.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;That
was the scream we heard,&quot; said George. &quot;It was lucky we heard it. We
had thought there was smuggling going on here, in our island—we didn't guess it
was a case of kidnapping, till we heard you scream—though we had found your
trunk with your clothes and toys.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
don't know how the man got those,&quot; said Jennifer. &quot;Maybe one of our
maids helped him. There was one I didn't like at all. She was called Sarah
Stick.'-<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Ah!&quot;
said Julian, at once. &quot;That's the one, then! It was Mr. and Mrs. Stick who
brought you here. Sarah Stick, your maid, must be some relation of theirs. They
must have been in the pay of someone else, I should think—someone who had a
ship, and could bring you here to hide you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Jolly
good hiding-place, too,&quot; said George. &quot;No one but us would ever have
found it out.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
ate all their breakfast, made some more cocoa, and discussed their future
plans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'll
take our boat and go to the mainland this morning,&quot; said Julian.
&quot;We'll go straight to the police-station with Jennifer. I expect the
newspapers are full of her disappearance, and the police will recognise her at
once.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
hope they catch the Sticks,&quot; said George. &quot;I hope they won't
disappear into thin air as soon as they hear that Jennifer is found.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Yes—we
must warn the police of that,&quot; said Julian, thoughtfully. &quot;Better not
spread the news abroad till the Sticks are caught. I wonder where they
are.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Let's
get the boat now,&quot; said Dick. &quot;There's no point in waiting about.
Jennifer's parents will be thrilled to know she is safe.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
don't really want to leave this lovely cave,&quot; said Jennifer, who was
thoroughly enjoying herself now. &quot;I wish I lived here, too. Are you going
to come back to the island and live here, Julian?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
we shall come back for a few days more, I expect,&quot; said Julian. &quot;You
see, our aunt's home is empty at the moment because she is away ill and our
uncle is with her. So we might as well stay on our island till they come back.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh,
could I come back with you?&quot; begged Jennifer, her small round face alight
with joy at the thought of living in a cave on an island with these nice
children and their lovely dog. &quot;Oh, do let me! I would so like it. And I
do so love .Timmy.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
don't expect your parents would let you, especially after you've just been
kidnapped,&quot; said Julian. &quot;But you can ask them, if you like.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went to the boat and got in. Julian pushed off. George steered the boat in
and out of the rocks. They saw the wreck, which interested Jenny very much
indeed. She badly wanted to stop, but the others thought they ought to get to
land as quickly as possible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
they were near the beach. Alf, the fisher-boy was there. He saw them and waved.
He ran to help them to pull in their boat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
was coming out in my boat this morning,&quot; he said. &quot;Your father's
back, Master George. But not your mother. She's getting better, they say, and
will be back in a week's time.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
what's my father come back for?&quot; demanded George, in surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;He
got worried because nobody answered the telephone,&quot; explained Alf.
&quot;He came down and asked me where you all were. I didn't tell him, of
course. I kept your secret. But I was just coming out to warn you this morning.
He got back last night—and wasn't he wild? No one there to give him any food —
all the house upside down and half the things gone! He's at the police station
now.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Golly!&quot;
said George. &quot;That's just where we are going too! We shall meet him there.
Oh dear, I do hope he won't be in an awful temper. You just can't do anything
with my father when he's cross.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Come
on!&quot; said Julian. &quot;It's a good thing, in a way, that your father is
here, George — we can^ explain everything to him and to the police at the same
time.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They left Alf, who looked
very surprised to see Jennifer with the others. He couldn't make out where she
had come from. Certainly she had not started out to the island with them—but
she had come back in their boat. How was that? It seemed very mysterious to
Alf.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children arrived at the police station and marched in, much to the surprise of
the policeman there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Hallo!&quot;
he said. &quot;What's the matter? Been doing a burglary, or something, and come
to own up?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Listen!&quot;
said George, suddenly, hearing a loud voice<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>in
the .room next to theirs. &quot;That's Father's voice!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
darted to the door. The policeman called to her, shocked. &quot;Now don't you
go in there. The Inspector's in there. Come over here special, he has, and
mustn't be interrupted.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
George had flung open the door and gone inside. Her father turned and saw her.
He rose to his feet. &quot;George! Where have you been? How dare you go away
like this and leave the house and everything! It's been robbed right and left!
I've just been telling the Inspector about all the things that have been
stolen.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Don't
worry, Father,&quot; said George. &quot;Really don't worry. We've found them
all. How's Mother?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Better,
much better,&quot; said her father, still looking amazed and angry. &quot;Thank
goodness I can go back and tell her where you are. She kept asking me about you
all, and I had to keep saying you were all right, so as not to worry her- but I
hadn't any idea what was happening to you or where you had gone. I feel very
displeased with you. Where were you?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;On
the island,&quot; said George, looking rather sulky, as she often did when her
father was angry with her. &quot;Julian will tell you all about it.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
came in, followed by Dick, Anne, Jennifer and Timothy. The Inspector, a big,
clever-looking man with dark eyes under shaggy eyebrows, looked at them all
closely. When he saw Jennifer, he stared hard—and then suddenly rose to his
feet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What's
your name, little girl?&quot; he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Jennifer
Mary Armstrong,&quot; said Jenny, in a surprised voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Bless
us all!&quot; said the-Inspector, in a startled voice. &quot;Here's the child
the whole country is looking for—and she walks in here as cool as a cucumber!
Lands sakes, where did she come from?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;What
do you mean?&quot; said George's father, looking surprised. &quot;What child is
the whole country looking for? I haven't read the papers for some days.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Then
you don't know about little Jenny Armstrong being kidnapped?&quot; said the
Inspector, sitting down and pulling Jenny near him. &quot;She's the daughter of
Harry Armstrong, the millionaire, you know. Well, somebody kidnapped her and
wants a hundred thousand pounds ransom for her. My word, we've combed the
country for her — and here she is, as merry as you please. Well, I'm
blessed—this is the queerest thing I ever knew. Where have you been, little
Missy?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;On
the island,&quot; said Jenny. &quot;Julian—you tell it all.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
Julian told the whole story from beginning to end. The policeman from outside
came in, and took notes down as he spoke. Everyone listened in amazement. As
for George's father, his eyes nearly fell out of his head. What adventures
these children did have, to be sure and how well they managed everything!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;And
do you happen to know who was the owner of the ship that brought little Miss
Jenny along—the one that sent a boat off to the wreck and put her there for the
Sticks to take?&quot; asked the Inspector.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;No,&quot;
said Julian. &quot;All we heard was that the Roomer was coming that
night.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;A-HA!&quot;
said the Inspector, with great satisfaction in his voice. &quot;Aha and oho! We
know the Roomer all right—<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>a
ship we've been watching for some time—owned by somebody we're very, very
suspicious of- we think he's dabbling in a whole lot of shady deals. Now this
is very good news indeed. The thing is — where are the Sticks—and how can we
catch them red-handed, now you've got Miss Jenny out of their clutches? They'll
probably deny everything.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
know how we could catch them,&quot; said Julian, quickly. &quot;We've left
their nasty son, Edgar, locked in the same dungeon where they put Jenny. If
only one of us could pass the word to the Sticks, that that is where Edgar is,
they'd go back to the island all right, and go right into the dungeons—so if
you found them there, it wouldn't be much good them denying that they don't
know anything about the island, and have never been there.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;That
would certainly make things a lot easier,&quot; said the Inspector. He pressed
a bell and another policeman came into the room. The Inspector gave him a full
description of Mr. and Mrs. Stick, and told him to watch the countryside round
about, and report when they were found.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Then,
Master Julian, you might like to go and have a little conversation with them
about their son, Edgar,&quot; said the Inspector, smiling. &quot;If they do go
back to the island, we shall follow them, and get all the evidence we want.
Thank you for your very great help. Now we must telephone to Miss Jenny's
parents and tell them she is safe.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;She
can come back to Kirrin Cottage with us,&quot; said George's father, still
looking rather dazed at all that had happened. &quot;'I've got Joanna, our old
cook, to come back for a while to put things straight, so there will be someone<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>there
to see to the children. They must all come back.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
Father,&quot; said George, firmly, &quot;we will come back just for today, but
we plan to spend another week on Kirrin Island till Mother comes back. She said
we could, and we are having such a fine time there. Let Joanna stay at Kirrin
Cottage and keep it in order and get it ready for Mother when she comes home —
she won't want the bother of looking after us too. We can look after ourselves on
the island.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I
certainly think these children deserve a reward for. the good work they have
done,&quot; remarked the Inspector, and that settled the matter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Very
well,&quot; said George's father, &quot;you can all go off to the island
again—but you must be back when your Mother returns, George.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Of
course I will,&quot; said George. &quot;I badly want to see Mother. But home
isn't nice without her. I would rather be on our island.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;And
I want to be there, too,&quot; said Jenny, unexpectedly. &quot;Ask my parents
to come to Kirrin, please — so that I can ask them if I can go with the other
children.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I'll
do my best,&quot; said the Inspector, grinning at the five children. They liked
him very much. George's father stood up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Come
along!&quot; he said. &quot;I want my lunch. All this has made me feel hungry.
We'll go and see if Joanna has got anything for us.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Off
they all went, talking nineteen to the dozen, making George's poor father feel
quite bewildered. He always seemed to get into the middle of some adventure
when these children were about!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Twenty-Two.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>BACK
TO KIRRIN ISLAND!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>SOON
everyone was at Kirrin Cottage. Joanna, the old cook they had had before, gave
them a good welcome, and listened to their adventures in astonishment, getting
the lunch ready all the while.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was while they were having lunch that Julian, looking out of the window,
suddenly caught sight of a figure he knew very well—someone skulking along
behind the hedge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Old
Pa Stick!&quot; he said, and jumped up. &quot;I'll go after him. Stay here,
everyone.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went out of the house, ran round a corner and came face to face with Mr.
Stick.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Do
you want to know where Edgar is?&quot; said Julian mysteriously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Stick looked startled. He stared at Julian not knowing what to say. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;He's
down in the dungeons, locked in that cave,&quot; said Julian, even more
mysteriously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You
don't know nothin' about Edgar,&quot; said Mr. Stick. &quot;Where have you
been? Didn't you go home?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Never
you mind,&quot; said Julian. &quot;But if you want to find Edgar—look in that
cave!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Stick gave the boy a glare and left him. Julian hurried indoors and rang up the
police station. He felt sure that Mr. Stick would tell Mrs. Stick what he had<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>said,
and that Mrs. Stick would insist on going back to the island to see if what he
had said was true. So all that needed to be done was for the police to keep a
watch on the boats along the shore and see when the Sticks left.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children finished their dinner, and Uncle Quentin announced that he must return
to his wife, who would want to know his news. &quot;I'll tell her you are having
a fine time on the island,&quot; he said, &quot;and we can tell her all the
extraordinary details when she returns home, better.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
left in a car, and the children wondered whether they might now return to their
island or not. But they decided to wait a little, for they did not know what to
do with Jennifer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Very
soon a large car drove up and stopped outside the gate of Kirrin Cottage. Out
jumped a tall man with dark red hair, and a pretty woman. &quot;They must be
your father and mother, Jenny,&quot; said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were—and Jennifer got so many hugs and kisses that she quite lost her breath.
She had to tell her story again and again, and her father could not thank
Julian and the others enough for all they had done.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Ask
me for any reward you like!&quot; he said, &quot;and you can have it. I shall
never, never be able to tell you how grateful I am to you for rescuing our
little Jenny.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh—we
don't want anything, thank you,&quot; said Julian, politely. &quot;We enjoyed
it all very much. We like adventures.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Ah,
but you must tell me something you want!&quot; said Jenny's father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
glanced round at the others. He knew that none<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>of
them wanted a reward. Jenny nudged him hard and nodded her head vigorously.
Julian laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,&quot;
he said, &quot;there is one thing we'd all like very much.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;It's
granted before you ask it!&quot; said Jenny's father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Will
you let Jenny come and spend a week with us on our island?&quot; said Julian.
Jenny gave a squeal and pressed Julian's arm very hard between her two small
hands.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jenny's
parents looked rather taken-aback. &quot;Well,&quot; said her father,
&quot;well—she's just been kidnapped, you know—and we don't feel inclined to
let her out of our sight at the moment — and...&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You
promised Julian you'd grant what he asked, you promised, Daddy,&quot; said
Jenny, urgently. &quot;Oh please do let me. I've always wanted to live on an
island. And this one has got a perfectly marvellous cave, and a wonderful
ruined castle, and the dungeons where I was kept, and —&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;And
we take Timothy, our dog, with us,&quot; said Julian. &quot;See what a big
powerful fellow he is—nobody could come to much harm with Timmy about — could
they, Tim?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Woof!&quot;
said Timothy, in his deepest voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
you can go, Jenny, on one condition,&quot; said the little girl's father at
last, &quot;and that is that I and your mother, come over tomorrow and spend
the day on the island, to see that everything is all right for you.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Oh,
thank you, thank you, Daddy!&quot; cried Jenny, and danced round the room in
delight. A whole week on the island with these new friends of .hers, and Timmy
the dog! What could be lovelier?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Jenny
can stay here the night, can't she?'. said George. &quot;You'll be staying at
the hotel, I suppose?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
Jenny's parents left and went to the police station to get all the details of
the kidnapping. The children went to see if Joanna was going to make cakes for
tea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Just
about tea-time there came a knocking at the-door. A large policeman stood
outside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Is
Master Julian here?&quot; he said. &quot;Oh, you're the boy we want, sir. The
Sticks have just left for the island in their boat, and we've got ours on the
beach to follow. But we don't think we know the way in and out of those hidden
rocks that lie all round Kirrin Island. Could you or Miss Georgina guide us, do
you think?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I'm
Master George, not Miss Georgina,&quot; said George, in a cold voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Sorry,
sir,&quot; said the policeman, with a grin. &quot;Well, could you come
too?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'll
all come!&quot; said Dick, jumping up. &quot;I want to go back to the dear old
island and sleep in our cave again tonight. Why should we miss a single night?
We can fetch Jenny's people tomorrow in our own boat. We'll all come.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
policeman was a little doubtful about the arrangement, but the children
insisted, and as there was no time to waste, they all ended in crowding into
the two boats, with three big policemen, George and Julian leading the way in
their own boat. Timmy lay down at George's feet as usual.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
guided the boat as cleverly as ever, and soon they landed in the usual little
sandy cove. The Sticks had evidently gone round by the wreck as usual, and landed
on the rockier part.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Now,
no noise,&quot; said Julian, warningly. They all went<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>quietly
towards the ruin, and came into the courtyard. There was no sign of the Sticks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'll
go down underground,&quot; said Julian. &quot;I've got my torch. I expect the
Sticks are down there already, letting out dear Edgar.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went down the steps into the dark dungeons. Anne went too, this time, holding
on to the hand of one of the big policemen. They moved quietly through the
long, dark, winding passages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came at last to the door of the cave in which they had imprisoned Edgar. It was
still bolted at the top and bottom!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Look!&quot;
said Julian, in a whisper, shining his torch on to the door. &quot;The Sticks
haven't been down here yet.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Sh!&quot;
said George, as Timmy growled softly. &quot;There's someone coming. Hide! It's
the Sticks, I expect.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all hid behind the wall that ran near by. They could hear footsteps coming
nearer, and then the voice of Mrs. Stick raised in anger.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;If
my Edgar's locked in there, I'll have something to say about it! Locking up a
poor innocent boy like that. I don't understand it. If he's there, where's the
girl? You answer me that. Where's the girl? It's my belief that the boss has
done some double-crossing to do us out of our share of the money. Didn't he say
that he'd give us a thousand pounds if we kept Jenny Armstrong for a week? Now
I think he must have sent someone to this island, played tricks on us, taken
the girl himself and locked up our Edgar.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You
may be right, Clara,&quot; said Mr. Stick, his voice coming nearer and nearer.
&quot;But how did this boy Julian<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>know
where Edgar was? There's a lot I don't understand about all this.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
the Sticks were right at the door of the cave, with Stinker at their heels.
Stinker smelt the others in hiding and whined in fear. Mr. Stick kicked him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>!Stop
it! It's enough to hear our own voices echoing away all round without your
whines too!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Stick was calling out loudly: &quot;Edgar! Are you there? Edgar!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Ma!
Yes, I'm here!&quot; yelled Edgar. &quot;Let me out, quick! I'm proper scared.
Let me out!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Stick undid the bolts at once and flung open the door. By the light of the
lantern in the cave she saw Edgar. He ran to her, half-crying.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Who
put you here?&quot; demanded Mrs. Stick. &quot;You tell your Pa and he'll knock
their heads off, won't you, Pa? Putting a poor frightened child into a dark
cave like this. It's a wicked thing to do!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly
the Stick family had the fright of their lives — for a large policeman stepped
out of the shadows, torch in one hand and notebook in the other!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Ah!&quot;
said the policeman, in a deep voice. &quot;You're right, Clara Stick. To shut
up a poor frightened child in that cave is a wicked thing to do — and that's
what you did, isn't it? You put Jenny Armstrong there! She's only a little
girl. This boy of yours knew he wasn't coming to any harm — but that little
girl was scared to death!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs.
Stick stood there, opening and shutting her mouth like a goldfish, not finding
a word to say. Mr. Stick squealed like a rat caught in a corner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We're
copped! It's a trap, that's it We're copped!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Edgar
began to cry, sobbing like a four-year-old. The other children felt disgusted
with him. The Sticks suddenly caught sight of all the children when Julian
switched on his torch;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Snakes
alive, there's all the children—and there's Jenny Armstrong too!&quot; said Mr.
Stick, in a tone of the greatest amazement. &quot;What's all this? What's
happening? Who shut up Edgar?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We'll
tell you the answers when we get to the police-station,&quot; said the big
policeman. &quot;Now, are you coming quietly?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Sticks went quietly, Edgar sobbing away to himself. He imagined his mother and
father in prison, and he himself sent to a hard and difficult school, not
allowed to see his mother for years. Not that that would matter, for the.
Sticks, both mother and father, were no good to Edgar, and had taught him
nothing but bad things. There might be a chance for the wretched boy if he were
kept away from them, and set a good example instead of a bad one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;We
shan't be coming back with you,&quot; said Julian, politely, to the policeman.
&quot;We're staying here the night. You could go back in the Sticks&quot; boat.
They know the way all right. Take their dog with you. There he is—Stinker, we
call him.&quot; Then he added, I guess your colleagues could follow in the
police boat!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Sticks' boat was found and the policeman, the two grown-up Sticks and Edgar got
in. Stinker jumped in too, glad to get away from the glare of Timothy's green
eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
pushed the boat out. &quot;Good-bye!&quot; he called, and the other children
waved good-bye, too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Good-bye;
Mr. Stick, don't go kidnapping any more children. Good-bye, Mrs. Stick, look
after Edgar better, in case he gets kidnapped again! Good-bye, Spotty-Face, try
and be a better boy! Good-bye, Stinker, do get a bath as soon as possible.
Good-bye!&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
policemen grinned and waved. The Sticks said not a word, nor did they wave.
They sat sullen and angry, trying to work out in their minds what had happened
to make things end up like this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boats rounded a high rock and were soon out of sight. &quot;Hurrah!&quot; said
Dick. &quot;They've gone—gone for ever! We've got our island to ourselves at
last. Come on, Jenny, we'll show you all over it! What a lovely time we're
going to have.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
raced away, happy and carefree, five children and a dog, alone on an island
they loved. And we will leave them there to enjoy their week's happiness. They
really do deserve it!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
