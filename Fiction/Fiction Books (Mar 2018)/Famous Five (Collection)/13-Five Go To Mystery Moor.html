THE STABLES<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ve
been here a week and I’ve been bored every single minute!’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
haven’t,’ said Anne. ‘You’ve enjoyed all the rides we’ve had, and you know
you’ve enjoyed messing about the stables when we haven’t been out riding.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
tell you, I’ve been bored every single minute,’ said George, quite fiercely. ‘I
ought to know, oughtn’t I? That awful girl Henrietta too. Why do we have to put
up with her?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
- Henry!’ said Anne, with a laugh. ‘I should have thought you’d find a lot in
common with another girl like yourself, who would rather be a boy, and tries to
act like one!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two girls were lying by a haystack eating sandwiches. Round them in a field
were many horses, most of which the girls either rode or looked after. Some way
off was an old rambling building, and by the front entrance was a great board,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Captain
Johnson’s Riding School<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
and George had been staying there for a week, while Julian and Dick had gone to
camp with other boys from their school. It had been Anne’s idea. She was fond
of horses, and had heard so much from her friends at school what fun it was to
spend day after day at the stables, that she had made up her mind to go
herself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
hadn’t wanted to come. She was sulky because the two boys had gone off
somewhere without her and Anne, for a change. Gone to camp! George would have
liked that, but girls were not allowed to go camping with the boys from
Julian’s school, of course. It was a camp just for the boys alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
silly to keep feeling cross because you couldn’t go camping too,’ said Anne.
‘The boys don’t want us girls round them all the time. We couldn’t do the
things they do.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
thought differently. ‘I can do anything that Dick and Julian do,’ she said. ‘I
can climb, and bike for miles, can walk as far as they can, I can swim, I can
beat a whole lot of boys at most things.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
what Henry says!’ said Anne, with a laugh. ‘Look, there she is, striding about
as usual, hands in her <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">jodhpur</st1:place></st1:City>
pockets, whistling like the stable boy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
scowled. Anne had been very much amused to see how Henrietta and George hated
one another at sight - and yet both had so very much the same ideas. George’s
real name was <st1:place w:st="on">Georgina</st1:place>, but she would only
answer to George. Henry’s real name was Henrietta, but she would only answer to
Henry, or Harry to her very best friends!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
was about as old as George, and her hair was short too, but it wasn’t curly.
‘It’s a pity yours is curly,’ she said to George, pityingly. ‘It looks so
girlish, doesn’t it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
be an ass,’ George said, curtly. ‘Plenty of boys have curly hair.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
maddening part was that Henrietta was a wonderful rider, and had won all kinds
of cups. George hadn’t enjoyed herself a bit during that week at the stables,
because for once in a way another girl had outshone her. She couldn’t bear to
see Henrietta striding about, whistling, doing everything so competently and
quickly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
had had many a quiet laugh to herself, especially when the two girls had each
made up their minds not to call one another Henry and George, but to use their
full names, Henrietta and <st1:place w:st="on">Georgina</st1:place>! This meant
that neither of them would answer the other when called, and Captain Johnson,
the big burly owner of the riding-stables, got very tired of both of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
are you behaving like this for?’ he demanded one morning, seeing their sulky
looks at one another at breakfast-time. ‘Behaving like a couple of idiotic
schoolgirls!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
made Anne laugh! A couple of idiotic schoolgirls. My goodness, how annoyed both
girls were with Captain Johnson. Anne was a bit scared of him. He was
hot-tempered, out-spoken, and stood no nonsense at all, but he was a wonder
with the horses, and loved a good, hearty laugh. He and his wife took either
boys or girls for the holidays, and worked them hard, but the children always
enjoyed their stay immensely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
it hadn’t been for Henry, you’d have been perfectly happy this week,’ said
Anne, leaning back against the haystack. ‘We’ve had heavenly April weather, the
horses are lovely, and I like Captain and Mrs Johnson very much.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wish the boys were here,’ said George. ‘They would soon put that silly
Henrietta in her place. I wish I’d stayed at home now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you had the choice,’ said Anne, rather cross. ‘You could have stayed at Kirrin
Cottage with your father and mother, but you chose to come here with me, till
the boys came back from camp. You shouldn’t make such a fuss if things aren’t
exactly to your liking. It spoils things for me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sorry,’
said George. ‘I’m being a pig, I know, but I do miss the boys. We can only be
with them in the hols and it seems funny without them. There’s just one thing
that pleases me here you’ll be glad to know...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
needn’t tell me, I know what it is!’ said Anne, with a laugh. ‘You’re glad that
Timmy won’t have anything to do with Henry!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘With
Henrietta,’ corrected George. She grinned suddenly. ‘Yes, old Timmy’s got some
sense. He just can’t stick her. Here, Timmy boy, leave those rabbit-holes alone
and come and lie down for a bit. You’ve run for miles this morning when we took
the horses out, and you’ve snuffled down about a hundred rabbit-holes. Come and
be peaceful.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
left his latest rabbit-hole reluctantly and came to flop down beside Anne and
George. He gave George a hearty lick and she patted him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’re
just saying, Timmy, how sensible you are not to make friends with that awful
Henrietta,’ said George. She stopped suddenly at a sharp nudge from Anne. A
shadow fell across them as someone came round the haystack.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was Henrietta. By the annoyed look on her face it was clear that she had heard
George’s remark. She held out an orange envelope to George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
telegram for you, <st1:place w:st="on">Georgina</st1:place>,’ she said,
stiffly. ‘I thought I’d better bring it in case it was important.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
thanks, Henrietta,’ said George, and took the telegram. She tore it open, read
it and groaned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
at that!’ she said to Anne and passed it to her. ‘It’s from Mother.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
took the telegram and read it. ‘Please stay another week. Your father is not
well. Love from Mother.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
bad luck!’ said George, a familiar scowl on her face. ‘Just when I thought we’d
be going home in a day or two, and the boys would join us at Kirrin. Now we’ll
be stuck here by ourselves for ages! What’s the matter with Father? I bet he’s
only got a headache or something, and doesn’t want us stamping about in and out
of the house and making a noise.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
could go to my home,’ said Anne. ‘That’s if you don’t mind its being a bit
upside down because of the decorating we’re having done.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
I know you want to stay here with the horses,’ said George. ‘Anyway your father
and mother are abroad, we’d only be in the way. Blow, blow, blow! Now we’ll
have to do without the boys for another week. They’ll stay on in camp, of
course.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Captain
Johnson said yes, certainly the two girls could stay on. It was possible that
they might have to do a bit of camping out if one or two extra children came,
but they wouldn’t mind that, would they?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
a bit,’ said George. ‘Actually we’d rather like to be on our own, Anne and I.
We’ve got Timmy, you see. So long as we could come in to meals and do a few
jobs for you, we’d love to go off on our own.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
smiled to herself. What George really meant was that she wanted to see as
little of Henrietta as possible! Still, it would be fun to camp out if the
weather was fine. They could easily borrow a tent from Captain Johnson.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Bad
luck, Georgina!’ said Henry, who was listening to all this. ‘Very bad luck! I
know you’re terribly bored here. It’s a pity you don’t really like horses. It’s
a pity that you-’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shut
up,’ said George, rudely and went out of the room. Captain Johnson glared at
Henrietta, who stood whistling at the window, hands in pockets.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
two girls!’ he said. ‘Why don’t you behave yourselves? Always aping the boys,
pretending you’re so mannish! Give me Anne here, any day! What you want is your
ears boxing. Did you take that bale of straw to the stables?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Henrietta, without turning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
sir,’ said Captain Johnson. ‘If you want to act like a boy, be one, and say
“sir” when you speak to me, if you can’t bother to remember I’ve got a name.
It’s...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
broke off as a small boy came running in. ‘Sir, there’s a gypsy kid outside
with a horse, a skewbald, a mangy looking thing. He says can you help him - the
horse has got something wrong with its leg.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Those
gypsies again!’ said Captain Johnson. ‘All right, I’ll come.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went out and Anne went with him, not wanting to be left alone with the angry
Henrietta. She found George outside with a small dirty gypsy boy and a patient
little skewbald horse, its brown and white coat looking very flea-bitten.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
have you done to your horse this time?’ said Captain Johnson, looking at its
leg. ‘You’ll have to leave it here, and I’ll see to it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Can’t
do that, sir,’ said the boy. ‘We’re off to Mystery Moor again.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you’ll have to,’ said Captain Johnson. ‘It’s not fit to walk. Your caravan
can’t go with the others, this horse isn’t fit to pull it. I’ll get the police
to your father if you try to work this horse before it’s better.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
do that!’ said the boy. ‘It’s just that my Dad says we’ve got to go on
tomorrow.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
the hurry?’ said Captain Johnson. ‘Can’t your caravan wait a day or two?
Mystery Moor will still be there in two days time! It beats me why you go
there, a desolate place like that, not even a farm or a cottage for miles!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
leave the horse,’ said the boy, and stroked the skewbald’s nose. It was clear
that he loved the ugly little horse. ‘My father will be angry, but the other
caravans can go on without us. We’ll have to catch them up.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
gave a kind of half-salute to the captain and disappeared from the stable-yard,
a skinny little sunburnt figure. The skewbald stood patiently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Take
it round to the small stable,’ said Captain Johnson to George and Anne. ‘I’ll
come and see to it in a minute.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls led the little horse away. ‘Mystery Moor!’ said George. ‘What a queer
name! The boys would like that, they’d be exploring it at once, wouldn’t they?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I do wish they were coming here,’ said Anne. ‘Still, I expect they’ll like the
chance of staying on in camp. Come on, you funny little creature, here’s the
stable!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls shut the door on the gypsy’s pony and turned to go back. William, the boy
who had brought the message about the horse, yelled to them.<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>    </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hey,
George and Anne! There’s another telegram for you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two hurried into the house at once. ‘Oh, I hope Father is better and we can go
home and join the boys at Kirrin!’ said George. She tore open the envelope and
then gave a yell that made Anne jump.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look,
see what it says. They’re coming here!’ Anne snatched the telegram and read it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Joining
you tomorrow. We’ll camp out if no room. Hope you’ve got a nice juicy adventure
ready for us! Julian and Dick.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’re
coming! They’re coming!’ said Anne, as excited as George. ‘Now we’ll have some
fun!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was quite a different person now that she knew her two cousins were coming the
next day. She was even polite to Henrietta!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Captain
Johnson scratched his head when he heard that the boys were arriving. ‘We can’t
have them in the house, except for meals,’ he said. ‘We’re full up. They can
either sleep in the stables or have a tent. I don’t care which.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
will be ten altogether then,’ said his wife. ‘Julian, Dick, Anne, George, Henry
- and John, Susan, Alice, Rita and William. Henry may have to camp out too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
with us,’ said George, at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think you’re rather unkind to Henry,’ said Mrs Johnson. ‘After all, you and she
are very alike, George. You both think you ought to have been boys, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
not a bit like Henrietta!’ said George, indignantly. ‘You wait till my cousins
come, Mrs Johnson. They won’t think she’s like me. I don’t expect they’ll want
anything to do with her.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
well, you’ll just have to shake down together somehow, if you want to stay
here,’ said Mrs Johnson. ‘Let me see, I’d better get some rugs out. The boys
will want them, whether they sleep in the stables or in a tent. Come and help
me to look for them, Anne.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne,
George and Henry were a good bit older than the other five children staying at
the stables, but all of them, small or big, were excited to hear about the
coming of Julian and Dick. For one thing George and Anne had related so many of
the adventures they had had with them, that everyone was inclined to think of
them as heroes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Henrietta
disappeared after tea that day and could not be found. ‘Wherever have you
been?’ demanded Mrs Johnson when she at last turned up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Up
in my room,’ said Henrietta. ‘Cleaning my shoes and my jods, and mending my
riding-jacket. You keep telling me to, and now I’ve done it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Aha!
Preparing for the heroes!’ said Captain Johnson, and Henry immediately put on a
scowl very like the one George often wore.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nothing
of the sort!’ she said. ‘I’ve been meaning to do it for a long time. If
Georgina’s cousins are anything like her I shan’t be very interested in them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
you might like my brothers,’ said Anne, with a laugh. ‘If you don’t there’ll be
something wrong with you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
be silly,’ said Henrietta. ‘Georgina’s cousins and your brothers are the same
people!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
clever of you to work that out,’ said George. But she felt too happy to keep up
the silly bickering for long. She went out with Timmy, whistling softly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’re
coming tomorrow, Tim,’ she said. ‘Julian and Dick. We’ll all go off together,
like we always do, the five of us. You’ll like that, won’t you, Timmy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy approvingly and waved his plumy tail. He knew quite well what she
meant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Next
morning George and Anne looked up the trains that arrived at the station two
miles away. ‘This is the one they’ll come by,’ said George, her finger on the
timetable. ‘It’s the only one this morning. It arrives at half past twelve.
We’ll go and meet them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Anne. ‘We’ll start at ten minutes to twelve - we’ll be in plenty of time
then. We can help them with their things. They won’t bring much.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Take
the ponies up to Hawthorn Field, will you?’ called Captain Johnson. ‘Gan you
manage all four of them?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes,’ said Anne pleased. She loved the walk to Hawthorn Field, up a little
narrow lane set with celandines, violets and primroses, and the fresh green of
the budding hawthorn bushes. ‘Come on, George, let’s catch the ponies and take
them now. It’s a heavenly morning.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
set off with the four frisky ponies, Timmy at their heels. He was quite a help
with the horses at the stable, especially when any had to be caught.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>No
sooner had they left the stables and gone on their way to Hawthorn Field than
the telephone rang. It was for Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
I’m sorry, she’s not here,’ said Mrs Johnson, answering it. ‘Who is it
speaking? Oh, Julian her brother? Can I give her a message?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
please,’ said Julian’s voice. ‘Tell her we are arriving at the bus-stop at
Milling Green at half past eleven, and is there a little hand-cart she and
George could bring, because we’ve got our tent with us and other odds and
ends?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
we’ll send the little wagon,’ said Mrs Johnson. ‘The one that always goes to
meet the train or the bus. I’ll get George to meet you with Anne, they can
drive it in. We’re pleased you are coming. The weather’s very good and you’ll
enjoy yourselves!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Rather!’
said Julian. ‘Thanks awfully for putting us up. We won’t be any trouble, in
fact we’ll help all we can.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs
Johnson said good-bye and put down the receiver. She saw Henrietta passing
outside the window, looking much cleaner and tidier than usual. She called to
her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Henry!
Where are George and Anne? Julian and Dick are arriving at the bus-stop at
Milling Green at eleven-thirty and I’ve said we’ll meet them in the little
wagon. Will you tell George and Anne? They can put Winkie into the cart and
trot him down to the bus-stop.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Henry. Then she remembered that George and Anne had been sent up to
Hawthorn Field with the four ponies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say, they won’t be back in time!’ she called. ‘Shall I take the wagon and meet
them?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
do. That would be kind of you, Henry,’ said Mrs Johnson. ‘You’d better hurry,
though. Time’s getting on. Where’s Winkie? In the big field?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Henry and hurried off to get him. Soon he was in the wagon shafts, and
Henry was in the driving-seat. She drove off smartly, grinning to herself to
think how cross George and Anne would be to find they had missed meeting the
two boys after all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and Dick had already arrived at the bus-stop when Henry drove up. They looked
hopefully at the wagon, thinking that perhaps one of the girls was driving into
meet them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
go,’ said Dick. ‘It’s somebody else, driving into the village. I wonder if the
girls got our message. I thought they would meet us at the bus-stop here. Well,
we’ll wait a few minutes more.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had just sat down on the bus-stop seat again when the wagon stopped nearby.
Henry saluted them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Are
you Anne’s brother?’ she called. ‘She didn’t get your telephone message, so
I’ve come with the wagon instead. Get in!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
jolly nice of you,’ said Julian, dragging his things to the wagon. ‘Er - I’m
Julian - and this is Dick. What’s your name?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Henry,’
said Henrietta, helping Julian with his things. She heaved them in valiantly,
then clicked to Winkie to stand still and not fidget. ‘I’m glad you’ve come.
There are rather a lot of small kids at the stables. We’ll be glad of you two!
I say, Timmy will be pleased to see you, won’t he?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
old Tim,’ said Dick, heaving his things in. Henry gave them a shove too. She
wasn’t very fat but she was wiry and strong. She grinned round at the boys.
‘All set! Now we’ll get back to the stables. Or do you want to have an
ice-cream or anything before we start? Dinner’s not till one.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
We’ll get on, I think,’ said Julian. Henry leapt into the driver’s seat, took
the reins and clicked to Winkie. The boys were behind in the wagon. Winkie set
off at a spanking pace.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nice
boy!’ said Dick to Julian, in a low voice, as they drove off. ‘Decent of him to
meet us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
nodded. He was disappointed that Anne and George hadn’t come with Timmy, but it
was good to be met by someone! It wouldn’t have been very funny to walk the
long road to the farm carrying their packs by themselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
arrived at the stables and Henry helped them down with their things. Mrs
Johnson heard them arriving and came to the door to welcome them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah,
there you are. Come along in. I’ve a mid-morning snack for you, because I
guessed you’d have had breakfast early. Leave the things there, Henry. If the
boys sleep in one of the stables, there’s no sense in bringing them into the
house. Now, are George and Anne still not back? What a pity!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Henry
disappeared to put away the wagon. The boys went into the pleasant house and
sat down to lemonade and home-made biscuits. They had hardly taken a bite
before Anne came running in. ‘Henry told me you’d come! Oh, I’m sorry we didn’t
meet you! We thought you’d come by train!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
came racing in, his tail waving madly. He leapt at the two boys, who were just
giving Anne a hug each. Then in came George, her face one big beam.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian!
Dick! I am so glad you’ve come! It’s been dull as ditch-water without you! Did
anyone meet you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
An awfully nice boy,’ said Dick. ‘Gave us quite a welcome and dragged our packs
into the wagon, and was very friendly. You never told us about him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
was that William?’ said Anne. ‘Well, he’s only little. We didn’t bother about
telling you of the juniors here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
he wasn’t little,’ said Dick. ‘He was quite big, very strong too. You didn’t
mention him at all.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we told you about the other girl here,’ said George. ‘Henrietta, awful
creature! Thinks she’s like a boy and goes whistling about everywhere. She
makes us laugh! You’ll laugh too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
sudden thought struck Anne. ‘Did the - er - boy who met you, tell you his
name?’ she asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
what was it now, Henry,’ said Dick. ‘Nice chap. I’m going to like him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
stared as if she couldn’t believe her ears. ‘Henry! Did she meet you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
- not she - he,’ corrected Julian. ‘Fellow with a big grin.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
that’s Henrietta!’ cried George, her face flaming red with anger. ‘The awful
girl I told you about, who tries to act like a boy, and whistles and strides
about all over the place. Don’t tell me she took you in! She calls herself
Henry, instead of Henrietta, and wears her hair short, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh,
she sounds very like you, George,’ said Dick. ‘Well, I never! It never occurred
to me that he was a girl. Jolly good show she put up. I must say I liked him -
her, I mean.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh!’
said George really furious. ‘The beast! She goes and meets you and never says a
word to us, and makes you think she’s a boy - and - and - spoils everything!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hold
your horses, George, old thing,’ said Julian, surprised. ‘After all, you’ve
often been pleased when people take you for a boy, though goodness knows why. I
thought you’d grown out of it a bit. Don’t blame us for thinking Henry was a
boy, and liking him - her, I mean.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
stamped out of the room. Julian scratched his head and looked at Dick. ‘Now
we’ve put our foot in it,’ he said. ‘What an ass George is! I should have
thought she’d have liked someone like Henry, who had exactly the same ideas as
she has. Well, she’ll get over it, I suppose.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
going to be a bit awkward,’ said Anne, soberly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
was right. It was going to be very awkward!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

said Dick, at once. ‘Henrietta!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Henry
grinned. ‘Oh, so they’ve told you, have they? I was tickled pink when you took

even got your riding jacket buttons buttoning up the wrong way,’ said Anne,
noticing for the first time. ‘You really are a fathead, Henry. You and George
are a pair!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I look more like a real boy than George does, anyway,’ said Henry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

because of your hair,’ said Dick. ‘It’s straight.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
say that in front of George,’ said Anne. ‘She’ll immediately have hers cut like
a convict or something, all shaven and shorn.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No

we supposed to leave any for politeness sake?’ said Dick, eyeing the plate.
‘They’re home-made and quite super. I could wolf the lot.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
aren’t frightfully polite here,’ said Henry, with a grin. ‘We aren’t
frightfully clean and tidy, either. We have to change out of our jods at night

bothers to change his.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

nothing,’ said Anne. ‘The only excitement is the horses, nothing more. This is
quite a lonely place, really, and the only exciting thing we’ve heard is the
name of the big, desolate moor that stretches from here to the coast. Mystery
Moor it’s called.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why?’
asked Dick. ‘Some long-ago mystery gave it that name, I suppose?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know,’ said Anne. ‘I think only gypsies go there now. A little gypsy boy
came in with a lame horse yesterday, and said his people had to go to Mystery
Moor. Why they wanted to go to such a deserted stretch of land I don’t know -
no farms there, not even a cottage.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gypsies
have peculiar ideas sometimes,’ said Henry. ‘I must say I like the way they
leave messages for any gypsy following - patrins, they’re called.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Patrins?
Yes, I’ve heard of those,’ said Dick. ‘Sticks and leaves arranged in certain patterns,
or something, aren’t they?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Henry. ‘I know our gardener at home showed me an arrangement of sticks
outside our back gate once, which he said was a message to any gypsy following.
He told me what it meant, too!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
did it mean?’ asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
meant “Don’t beg here. Mean people. No good!” ’ said Henry, with a laugh.
‘That’s what he said, anyway!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
might ask the little gypsy boy who came with the skewbald horse,’ said Anne.
‘He’ll probably show us some messages. I’d like to learn some. You never know
when anything like that could come in useful!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
And we’ll ask him why the gypsies go to Mystery Moor,’ said Julian, getting up
and dusting the crumbs off his coat. ‘They don’t go there for nothing, you may
be sure!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
old George gone?’ asked Dick. ‘I do hope she’s not going to be silly.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was in one of the stables, grooming a horse so vigorously that it was most
surprised. Swish-swish-swish-swish! What a brushing! George was working her
intense annoyance out of herself. She mustn’t spoil things for the boys and
Anne! But oh, that horrible Henrietta, meeting them like that, pretending to be
a boy. Heaving their luggage about, playing a joke on them! But surely they
might have guessed!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
there you are, George, old thing,’ said Dick’s voice at the stable-door. ‘Let
me help. Gosh, aren’t you brown! Just as many freckles as ever!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
grinned unwillingly. She tossed Dick the brush. ‘Here you are, then! Do you and
Ju want to go riding at all? There are plenty of horses to choose from here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
was relieved to see that George appeared to have got over her rage. ‘Yes. It
might be fun to go off for the day. What about tomorrow? We might explore a
little of Mystery Moor.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said George. She began to heave some straw about. ‘But not with That Girl,’ she
announced, from behind the straw she was carrying.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
girl?’ asked Dick, innocently. ‘Oh, Henry, you mean? I keep thinking of her as
a boy. No, we won’t have her with us. We’ll be just the five as usual.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
all right then,’ said George happily. ‘Oh, here’s Julian. Give a hand, Ju!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was lovely to have the two boys again, joking, laughing, teasing. They all went
out in the fields that afternoon and heard the tales of the camp. It was just
like old times, and Timmy was as pleased as anyone else. He went first to one
of the four, then to another, licking each one as he went, his tail wagging
vigorously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
three times you’ve smacked me in the face with your tail, Timmy,’ said Dick,
dodging it. ‘Can’t you look behind yourself and see where my face is?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy happily, and turned round to lick Dick, wagging his tail in Julian’s
face this time!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Somebody
squeezed through the hedge behind them. George stiffened, feeling sure that it
was Henrietta. Timmy barked sharply.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
wasn’t Henrietta. It was the little gypsy boy. He came up to them. There were
pale streaks down his dirty little face, made by tears that had run through the
dirt!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
come for the horse,’ he said. ‘Do you know where he is?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
not ready for walking yet,’ said George. ‘Captain Johnson told you he wouldn’t
be. What’s the matter? Why have you been crying?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘My
father hit me,’ said the boy. ‘He cuffed me and knocked me right over.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Whatever
for?’ asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Because
I left the horse,’ said the boy. ‘My father said all it wanted was a bit of
ointment and a bandage. He has to start off with the other caravans today, you
see.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you really can’t have the horse yet,’ said Anne. ‘It isn’t fit to walk, let alone
drag a caravan. You don’t want Captain Johnson to tell the police you’re
working it when it’s not fit, do you? You know he means what he says?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
But I must have the horse,’ said the small gypsy. ‘I daren’t go back without
it. My father would half kill me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
suppose he doesn’t care to come himself, so he sends you instead,’ said Dick,
in disgust.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy said nothing, and rubbed his dirty sleeve across his face. He sniffed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Get
your hanky,’ said Dick. ‘Don’t you ever wash your face?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said the boy, looking quite surprised. ‘Let me have my horse. I tell you, I’ll
be half killed if I go back without him.’ He began to cry again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children felt sorry for him. He was such a thin, skinny misery of a boy, and
goodness, how he sniffled all the time!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
your name?’ asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sniffer,’
said the boy. ‘That’s what my father calls me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was certainly a good name for him; but what a horrid father he must have!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Haven’t
you got a proper name?’ asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
But I’ve forgotten it,’ said Sniffer. ‘Let me have my horse. I tell you, my
father’s waiting.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
got up. ‘I’ll come and see your father and put some sense into him. Where is
he?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Over
yonder,’ said Sniffer with a big sniff, and he pointed over the hedge. ‘I’ll
come too,’ said Dick. In the end everyone got up and went with Sniffer. They
walked through the gate and saw a dark-faced, surly-looking man standing
motionless not far off. His thick, oily hair was curly, and he wore enormous
gold rings hanging from his ears. He looked up as the little company came near.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Your
horse isn’t fit to walk yet,’ said Julian. ‘You can have it tomorrow or the
next day, the Captain says.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
have it now,’ said the man, in a surly tone. ‘We’re starting off tonight or
tomorrow over the moor. I can’t wait.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
what’s the hurry?’ said Julian. ‘The moor will wait for you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
man scowled and shifted from one foot to another. ‘Can’t you stay for another
night or two and then go after the others?’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Listen,
Father! You go with the other caravans,’ said Sniffer, eagerly. ‘Go in Moses’
caravan and leave ours here. I can put our horse into the shafts tomorrow, or
maybe the next day, and follow after!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
how would you know the way?’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sniffer
made a scornful movement with his hand. ‘Easy! They’ll leave me patrins to
follow,’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes,’ said Dick, remembering. He turned to the silent gypsy fellow. ‘Well, what
about it? It seems that Sniffer here has quite a good idea, and you most
certainly can’t have the horse today anyway.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
man turned and said something angry and scornful to poor Sniffer, who shrank
away from the words as if they were blows. The four children couldn’t
understand a word, for it was all poured out in some gypsy talk that they could
not follow. Then the man turned on his heel and without so much as a look at
them, slouched away, his ear-rings gleaming as he went.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
did he say?’ asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sniffer
gave one of his continual sniffs. ‘He was very angry. He said he’d go with the
others, and I could come on with Clip the horse, and drive our caravan,’ he
said. ‘I’ll be all right there tonight with Liz.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who’s
Liz?’ asked Anne, hoping that it was someone who would be kind to this poor
little wretch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘My
dog,’ said Sniffer, smiling for the first time. ‘I left her behind because she
sometimes goes for hens, and Captain Johnson, he doesn’t like that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
bet he doesn’t,’ said Julian. ‘All right, that’s settled then. You can come for
Clip, or Clop, or whatever your horse is called, tomorrow, and we’ll see if
it’s fit to walk.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
glad,’ said Sniffer, rubbing his nose. ‘I don’t want Clip to go lame, see? But
my father, he’s fierce, he is.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
we gather,’ said Julian, looking at a bruise on Sniffer’s face. ‘You come
tomorrow and you can show us some of the patrins, the messages, that you
gypsies use. We’d like to know some.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
come,’ promised Sniffer, nodding his head vigorously. ‘And you will come to see
my caravan? I shall be all alone there, except for Liz.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I suppose it would be something to do,’ said Dick. ‘Yes, we’ll come. I hope
it’s not too smelly.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Smelly?’
said Sniffer, surprised. ‘I don’t know. I will show you patrins there and Liz
will show you her tricks. She is very very clever. Once she belonged to a
circus.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
must certainly take Timmy to see this clever dog,’ said Anne, patting Timmy,
who had been hunting for rabbits and had only just come back. ‘Timmy, would you
like to go and visit a very clever dog called Liz?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, wagging his tail politely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Dick. ‘I’m glad you approve, Tim. We’ll all try and come tomorrow,
Sniffer, after you’ve been to see how Clip is getting on. I don’t somehow think
you’ll be able to have him then, though. We’ll see!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys slept in one of the stables that night. Captain Johnson said they could
either have mattresses sent out, or could sleep in the straw, with rugs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
straw and rugs, please,’ said Julian. ‘That’s fine. We’ll be as snug as
anything with those.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wish Anne and I could sleep in a stable too,’ said George, longingly. ‘We never
have. Can’t we, Captain Johnson?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
You’ve got beds that you’re paying for,’ said the Captain. ‘Anyway, girls can’t
do that sort of thing, not even girls who try to be boys, George!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
often slept in a stable,’ said Henrietta. ‘At home when we’ve too many
visitors, I always turn out and sleep in the straw.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Bad
luck on the horses!’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why?’
demanded Henry at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Because
you must keep them awake all night with your snoring!’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Henry
snorted crossly and went out. It was maddening that she should snore at night,
but she simply couldn’t help it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Never
mind!’ George called after her. ‘It’s a nice manly snore, Henrietta!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shut
up, George,’ said Dick, rather shocked at this sudden display of pettiness on
George’s part.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
tell me to shut up,’ said George. ‘Tell Henrietta!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George,
don’t be an ass,’ said Julian. But George didn’t like that either, and stalked
out of the room in just the same stiff, offended way that Henry had done!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
dear!’ said Anne. ‘It’s been like this all the time. First Henry, then George,
then George, then Henry! They really are a couple of idiots!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
went to see where the boys were to sleep. They had been told to use a small
stable, empty except for the gypsy’s horse that lay patiently down, its
bandaged leg stretched out on the floor. Anne patted it and stroked it. It was
an ugly little thing but its patient brown eyes were lovely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys had heaps of straw to burrow into, and some old rugs. Anne thought it all
looked lovely. ‘You can wash and everything at the house,’ she said. ‘Then just
slip over here to sleep. Doesn’t it smell nice? All straw and hay and horse! I
hope that gypsy’s horse won’t disturb you. He may be a bit restless if his leg
hurts him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nothing
will disturb us tonight!’ said Julian. ‘What with camp-life and open-air and
wind-on-the-hills and all that kind of thing, we’re sure to sleep like logs. I
think we’re going to enjoy it here, Anne, very quiet and peaceful!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
looked in at the door. ‘I’ll lend you Timmy, if you like,’ she said, anxious to
make up for her display of temper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
hallo, George! No thanks. I don’t particularly want old Tim climbing over me
all night long, trying to find the softest part of me to sleep on!’ said
Julian. ‘I say, look, he’s showing me how to make a good old burrow to sleep
in! Hey, Tim, come out of my straw!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
had flung himself into the straw and was turning vigorously round and round in it
as if he were making a bed for himself. He stood and looked up at them, his
mouth open and his tongue hanging out at one side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
laughing,’ said Anne, and it did indeed look as if Timmy was having a good old
laugh at them. Anne gave him a hug and he licked her lavishly, and then began
to burrow round and round in the straw again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Someone
came up, whistling loudly, and put her head in at the door. ‘I’ve brought you a
couple of old pillows. Mrs Johnson said you’d better have something for your
heads.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
thanks awfully, Henry,’ said Julian, taking them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
kind of you, Henrietta,’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
a pleasure, Georgina,’ said Henry, and the boys burst out laughing. Fortunately
the supper-bell went just then and they all went across the yard at once.
Somehow everyone was always hungry at the stables!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls looked very different in the evening, because they had to change out of
their dirty, smelly jodhpurs or breeches and put on dresses. Anne, Henry and
George hurried to change before Mrs Johnson rang the supperbell again. She
always gave them ten minutes’ grace, knowing that they might sometimes have a
job to finish with the horses, but everyone was supposed to be at the table
when the second supper-bell had finished ringing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
looked nice, because her curly hair went with a skirt and blouse quite well,
but Henry looked quite wrong, somehow, in her frilly dress.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
look like a boy dressed up!’ said Anne, and this pleased Henry, but not George.
The talk at the suppertable was mainly about all the wonderful things that
Henry had done in her life. Apparently she had three brothers and did
everything with them, and according to her own tales, she was considerably
better than they were!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had sailed a ship up to Norway. They had hiked from London to York.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Was
Dick Turpin with you?’ inquired George, sarcastically. ‘On his horse, Black
Bess? I expect you got there long before him, didn’t you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Henry
took no notice. She went on with wonderful tales of her family’s exploits,
swimming across wide rivers, climbing Snowdon to the top, goodness, there
wasn’t a single thing she didn’t seem to have done!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
certainly ought to have been a boy, Henry,’ said Mrs Johnson, which was exactly
what Henry wanted everyone to say!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Henry,
when you’ve told us the story of how you climbed Mount Everest and got there
before anyone else, perhaps you would finish your plateful,’ said Captain
Johnson, who got very tired of Henry’s tongue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
roared with laughter, not that she thought it was very funny, but because she
loved any chance to laugh at Henry. Henry tackled the rest of her food at top
speed. How she did love to hold everyone spellbound with her extraordinary
tales! George didn’t believe a word, but Dick and Julian thought it quite
likely that this tall, wiry girl could do things just as well as her brothers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
were a few jobs to be done after supper, and Henry kept well away from George,
knowing quite well that she would have a few cutting things to say. Well, she
didn’t care! Everyone else thought she was marvellous! She tore off her frilly
dress and put on jodhpurs again, although it would only be a short time before
they all went to bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
and Anne went with the boys to their stable. They were in pyjamas and
dressing-gowns, both yawning as they went. ‘Got your torches?’ said George.
‘We’re not allowed to have candles in the stables, because of the straw, you
know. Good night! Sleep well! And I hope that that fathead of a Henry doesn’t
come along early in the morning, whistling like a paper-boy, and wake you up!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nothing
will wake me up tonight, nothing at all!’ said Julian, with a huge yawn. He lay
down in the straw and pulled an old rug over him. ‘Oh, what a bed! Give me
stable straw every time to sleep in!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls laughed. The boys really did look very comfortable. ‘Sleep tight,’ said
Anne, and walked off with George to the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
all the lights were out everywhere. Henry was asleep and snoring as usual. She
had to have a separate room, otherwise she kept everyone awake! But even so,
Anne and George could hear her, snoring away - rrrumph - rrrumph! rrrumph -
RRRRUMPH!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Blow
Henrietta!’ said George, sleepily. ‘What a row she makes. Anne, she’s not to
come with us when we go riding tomorrow. Do you hear, Anne?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
very well,’ murmured Anne, trying to open her eyes. ‘G’ night, George!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was on George’s feet as usual. He lay snuggled there, eyes shut and ears asleep
too. He got as tired as everyone else, running over the hills all day,
scrabbling at scores of rabbit-holes, chasing dozens of remarkably fleet-footed
rabbits. But at night he too slept like a log.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Out
in the stable the two boys slept peacefully, covered by the old rug. Nearby the
little skewbald horse moved restlessly, but they heard nothing. An owl came swooping
over the stable, looking for mice down below. It screeched loudly, hoping to
scare a mouse into sudden flight. Then it would swoop down and take it into its
talons.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Not
even the screech awakened the boys. They slept dreamlessly, tired out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
door of the stable was shut and latched. Clip, the horse, suddenly stirred and
looked round at the door. The latch was moving! Someone was lifting it from the
outside. Clip’s pricked ears heard the sound of a little shuffle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
watched the door. Who was coming? He hoped it was Sniffer, the boy he liked so
much. Sniffer was always kind to him. He didn’t like being away from Sniffer.
He listened for the sniff-sniff that always went with the little gypsy boy, but
he didn’t hear it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
door opened very slowly indeed. It gave no creak. Clip saw the night sky
outside, set with stars. He made out a figure outlined against the darkness of
the starry night, a black shadow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Someone
came into the stable, and whispered ‘Clip!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
horse gave a little whinny. It wasn’t Sniffer’s voice. It was his father’s.
Clip did not like him, he was too free with cuffs and kicks, and slashes with
the whip. He lay still, wondering why the gypsy had come.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
man had no idea that Dick and Julian were sleeping in the stable. He had come
in quietly because he had thought there might be other horses there, and he did
not want to startle them and make them stamp about in fright. He had no torch,
but his keen gypsy’s eyes made out Clip at once, lying in his straw.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
tiptoed across to him and fell over Julian’s feet, sticking out from the straw
bed he was lying on. He fell with a thud, and Julian sat up very suddenly
indeed, awake at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who’s
there! What is it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
gypsy shrank down beside Clip, keeping silent. Julian began to wonder if he had
been dreaming. But his foot distinctly hurt him. Surely somebody had trodden on
it, or fallen over it? He woke Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
the torch? Hello, look, the stable door is open! Quick, Dick, where on earth is
the torch?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
found it at last and Julian clicked it on. At first he saw nothing, for the
gypsy was in Clip’s stall, lying down behind the horse. Then the torch picked
him out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo!
Look there - it’s that gypsy, Sniffer’s father!’ said Julian. ‘Get up, you!
What on earth are you doing here, in the middle of the night?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
man got up sullenly. His ear-rings shone in the light of the torch. ‘I came to
get Clip,’ he said. ‘He’s my horse, isn’t he?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
were told he wasn’t fit to walk yet,’ said Julian. ‘Do you want him to go lame
for life? You ought to know enough about horses to know when one can be worked
or not!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
got my orders,’ said the man. ‘I’ve got to take my caravan with the others.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who
said so?’ said Dick, scornfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Barney
Boswell,’ said the man. ‘He’s boss of our lot here. We’ve got to start off
together tomorrow.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
why?’ said Julian, puzzled. ‘What’s so urgent about all this? What’s the
mystery?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
ain’t no mystery,’ said the man, still sullen. ‘We’re just going to the moor.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
are you going to do there?’ asked Dick, curiously. ‘It doesn’t seem to me to be
the place to take a lot of caravans to. There’s nothing there at all, is there?
Or so I’ve heard.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
man shrugged his shoulders and said nothing. He turned to Clip as if to get him
up. But Julian rapped out at him at once,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no, you don’t! If you don’t care about injuring a horse, I do! You’ve only got
to be patient for a day or two more, and he’ll be quite all right. You’re not
to take him tonight. Dick, go and wake Captain Johnson. He’ll know what to do.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said the man, scowling. ‘Don’t go waking anybody. I’ll go. But just you see
that Clip is given to Sniffer as soon as it’s possible, or I’ll know the reason
why! See?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
looked at Julian in a threatening way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Take
that scowl off your face,’ said Julian. ‘I’m glad you’ve seen sense. Clear out
now. Go off with the others tomorrow and I’ll see that Sniffer has the horse in
a short time.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
man moved to the door and slid out like a shadow. Julian went to watch him
across the yard, wondering whether, out of spite, the man might try to steal a
hen, or one of the ducks sleeping beside the pond.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
there was no sudden clucking, no loud quack. The man had gone as silently as he
had come.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Most
peculiar, all this!’ said Julian, latching the door again. He tied a piece of
thick string over it his side, so that it could not be lifted from outside.
‘There! Now if the gypsy comes again, he’ll find he can’t get in. What a nerve,
coming here in the middle of the night like that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
got back into the straw. ‘He must have fallen right over my foot,’ he said,
snuggling down. ‘He woke me up with an awful jump. Good thing for Clip that we
were sleeping out here tonight, or he’d be dragging along a heavy cart
tomorrow, and going lame again. I don’t like that fellow!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
fell asleep again and so did Dick. Clip slept too, his leg feeling easier. How
glad he had been that day not to have to drag along the heavy caravan!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys told Captain Johnson next morning about the gypsy’s midnight visit. He
nodded. ‘Yes, I ought to have warned you that he might come. They’re not always
very good to their horses. Well, I’m glad you sent him off. I don’t reckon
Clip’s leg will be ready for walking on till the day after tomorrow. There’s no
harm in giving the poor creature a few days’ rest. Sniffer can easily take the
caravan on after the others.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
looked as if that day was going to be fun. After all the horses had been seen
to, and many odd jobs done, the four, with Timmy, planned to set out for a
day’s ride. Captain Johnson said he would let Julian ride his own sturdy cob
and Dick took a bonny chestnut horse with four white socks. The girls had the
horses they usually rode.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Henry
hung about, looking very mournful. The boys felt quite uncomfortable. ‘We
really ought to tell her to come along too,’ said Dick to Julian. ‘It seems
jolly mean to leave her behind with those little kids.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
I know. I agree with you,’ said Julian. ‘Anne, come here! Can’t you suggest to
George that we take Henry too? She’s longing to come, I know.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
She is,’ said Anne. ‘I feel awful about it. But George will be mad if we ask
Henry. They really do get across one another. I simply daren’t ask George to
let Henry come, Ju.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
this is silly!’ said Julian. ‘To think we don’t dare to ask George to let
somebody come! George will have to learn sense. I like Henry. She’s boastful,
and I don’t believe half the tales she tells, but she’s a sport and good fun.
Hey, Henry!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Coming!’
yelled Henry, and came running, looking very hopeful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Would
you like to come with us?’ said Julian. ‘We’re all going off'for the day. Have
you got any jobs to do, or can you come?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Can
I come! Rather,’ said Henry, joyfully. ‘But - does George know?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
soon tell her,’ said Julian, and went in search of George. She was helping Mrs
Johnson to get saddle-bags ready, full of food.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George,’
said Julian, boldly. ‘Henry is coming too. Will there be enough food for
everyone?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh!
How nice of you to ask her!’ said Mrs Johnson, sounding very pleased. ‘She’s
dying to come. She’s been so good this week, too, while we’ve been shorthanded.
She deserves a treat. Isn’t that nice, George?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
muttered something peculiar and went out of the room, her face scarlet. Julian
stared after her, his eyebrows cocked in a comical manner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t somehow feel that George thinks it’s nice,’ he said. ‘I feel as if we are
in for an awkward day, Mrs Johnson.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
don’t take any notice of George when she’s silly,’ said Mrs Johnson,
comfortably, filling another paper bag with delicious-looking sandwiches. ‘And
don’t take any notice of Henry, either, when she’s idiotic. There! If you get
through all this food, I shall be surprised!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>William,
one of the younger ones, came in just then. ‘What a lot of food you’ve given
them,’ he said. ‘Will there be enough left for us to have today?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
gracious, yes!’ said Mrs Johnson. ‘You think of nothing but your tummy,
William! Go and find George and tell her the food is ready for her to put into
the saddle-bags.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>William
disappeared and then came back. ‘George says she’s got a headache and doesn’t
think she’ll go on the ride,’ he announced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
looked startled and upset. ‘Now you listen to me, Julian,’ said Mrs Johnson,
beginning to insert the parcels of food carefully into the saddle-bags, ‘just
you leave her to her imaginary headache. Don’t go fussing round her, and
begging her to come and saying you won’t have Henry. Just believe quite firmly
in her headache, and go off by yourselves. It’s the quickest way to make George
see sense, believe me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I think you’re right,’ said Julian, frowning. To think that George should
behave like a sulky little girl, after all the adventures they had been through
together! Just because of Henry. It really was absurd.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
is George!’ he said to William.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Up
in her room,’ said William, who had been engrossed in picking up and eating all
the crumbs he could. Julian went out of the room and into the yard. He knew
which window belonged to the room where George and Anne slept. He yelled up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say, George! Sorry about your headache, old thing! Sure you don’t feel like
coming?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No!’
came back an answering shout, and the window was shut down with a slam.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Righto!
Awfully disappointed and all that!’ shouted Julian. ‘Do hope your head will
soon be better! See you later!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>No
other reply came from the window, but, as Julian went across the yard to the
stables, a very surprised face watched him go, from behind the bedroom
curtains. George was extremely astonished to have been taken at her word,
shocked at being left behind after all, and angry with Henry and everyone else
for putting her into this fix!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
told the others that George had a headache and wasn’t coming. Anne was most
concerned and wanted to go and comfort her but Julian forbade her to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
She’s up in her room. Leave her alone, Anne. That’s an order - see?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right,’ said Anne, half-relieved. She felt sure that George’s headache was
mostly temper, and she didn’t at all want to go and argue with her for half an
hour. Henry hadn’t said a word. She had flushed with surprise when Julian had
announced that George was not coming, and she knew at once that there was no
real headache! She was George’s headache, she knew that!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
went up to Julian. ‘Look, I guess it’s because you’ve asked me to come, that
Georgina won’t come with us. I don’t want to spoil things. You go and tell her
I’m not going after all.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
looked at Henry gratefully. ‘That’s jolly nice of you,’ he said. ‘But we’re
taking George at her word. Anyway, we didn’t ask you out of politeness. We
wanted you to come!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thanks,’
said Henry. ‘Well, let’s go before anything else happens! Our horses are ready.
I’ll fix the saddle-bags.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
all four were on their horses, and were walking over the yard to the gate.
George heard the clippity-clop-clippity-clop of the hooves and peeped out of
the window again. They were going after all! She hadn’t thought they really
would go without her. She was horrified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Why
did I behave like that? I’ve put myself in the wrong! thought poor George. Now
Henrietta will be with them all day and will be as nice as possible, just to
show me up. What an ass I am! ‘Timmy, I’m an ass and an idiot, and a great big
fathead! Aren’t I?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
didn’t think so. He had been puzzled to hear the others going off without him
and George, and had gone to the door and whined. Now he came back to George and
put his head on her knee. He knew George was not happy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
don’t care how I behave, do you, Tim?’ said George, stroking the soft, furry
head. ‘That’s the best of a dog! You don’t care if I’m in the wrong or not, you
just love me all the same, don’t you? Well, you shouldn’t love me today, Tim.
I’ve been an idiot!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a knock at her door. It was William again. ‘George! Mrs Johnson says, if
your headache is bad, undress and get into bed. But if it’s better, come down
and help with Clip, the gypsy’s horse.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
come down,’ said George, flinging away her sulks at one go. ‘Tell Mrs Johnson
I’ll go to the stable at once.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right,’ said the stolid William, and trotted off like a reliable little pony.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
went downstairs with Timmy, and into the yard. She wondered how far the others
had gone. She couldn’t see them in the distance. Would they have a good day
together, with that horrid Henry? Ugh!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others were almost a mile away, cantering easily. What fun! A whole day before
them, on Mystery Moor!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
think it’s got a jolly good name, Mystery Moor,’ said Dick, as the four of them
went along. ‘Look at it stretching for miles, all blazing with gorse.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t think it looks at all mysterious,’ said Henry, surprised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
it’s got a sort of quietness and broodiness,’ said Anne. ‘As if something big
happened long ago in the past and it’s waiting for something to happen again.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Quiet
and broody? It sounds like one of the farmyard hens sitting on her eggs!’ said
Henry with a laugh. ‘I think it might be a bit frightening and mysterious at
night, but it’s just an ordinary stretch of country in the day-time, fine for
riding over. I can’t think why it’s called Mystery Moor.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
have to look it up in some book that tells about this part of the country,’
said Dick. ‘I expect it was called that because of some queer happenings or
other, hundreds of years ago, when people believed in witches and things like
that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
followed no road or path, but rode where they pleased. There were great
stretches of wiry grass, masses of heather springing up afresh, and, blazing its
gold everywhere on this lovely April day, was the gorse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
sniffed continually as they rode past the gorse bushes. Dick looked at her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
sound like Sniffer!’ he said. ‘Have you got a cold?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
laughed. ‘No, of course not. But I do so love the smell of the gorse. What does
it smell of? Vanilla? Hot coconut? It’s a lovely warm smell!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look!
What’s that moving over there?’ said Julian, suddenly reining in his horse.
They all strained their eyes to see.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why,
it’s caravans!’ said Julian, at last. ‘Of course! They were setting out today,
weren’t they? Well, they must find it very rough going, that’s all I can say.
There’s no real road anywhere, as far as I can see.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
can they be going?’ wondered Anne. ‘What’s over in that direction?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’ll
come to the coast if they keep on the way they are going,’ said Julian,
considering. ‘Let’s ride over and have a look at them, shall we?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
Good idea!’ said Dick. So they turned their horses’ heads to the right, and
rode towards the faraway caravans. These made quite a splash of colour as they
went along. There were four of them - two red ones, a blue one and a yellow
one. They went very slowly indeed, each pulled by a small, wiry horse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
all look like skewbalds, brown and white,’ said Dick. ‘It’s funny that so many
gypsies have skewbald horses. I wonder why it is?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
heard shouting as they came near the caravans, and saw one man pointing them
out to another. It was Sniffer’s father!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look,
that’s the fellow who woke us up in the stable last night,’ said Julian to
Dick. ‘Sniffer’s father! What a nasty bit of work he is! Why doesn’t he get a
haircut?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
morning!’ called Dick, as they rode up to the caravans on their horses. ‘Nice
day!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no answer. The gypsies driving their caravans and those walking alongside,
looked sourly at the four riders.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
are you going?’ asked Henry. ‘To the coast?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
naught to do with you,’ said one of the gypsies, an old man with curly grey
hair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Surly
folk, aren’t they?’ said Dick to Julian. ‘I suppose they think we’re spying on
them, or something. I wonder how they manage about food on this moor, no shops
or anything. I suppose they take it all with them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
ask them,’ said Henry, not at all put off by the surly looks. She rode right up
to Sniffer’s father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
do you manage about food, and water?’ she asked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
got food there,’ said Snifler’s father, jerking his head back towards one of
the caravans. ‘As for water, we know where the springs are.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Are
you camping on the moor for a long time?’ asked Henry, thinking that a gypsy’s
life might be a fine one, for a time! Fancy living out here on this lovely moor
with gorse blazing gold all around, and primroses by the thousand in the
sheltered corners!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
naught to do with you!’ shouted the old man with curly grey hair. ‘You clear
off and let us alone!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on, Henry,’ said Julian, swinging round to go off. ‘They don’t like us asking
them questions. They think it’s prying, not interest. Maybe they have lots of
things to hide, and don’t want us poking around - one or two chickens from a
farm, a duck or so from some pond. They live from hand to mouth, these folk.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Some
dark-eyed children peered from the vans as they went by. One or two were
running outside, but they sheered off like frightened rabbits when Henry
cantered towards them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
well, they simply don’t want to be friendly,’ she said, and went to join the
other three. ‘What a strange life they lead, in their houses on wheels! Never
staying anywhere for long, always on the move. Get up, there, Sultan. Go after
the others!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Her
horse obediently followed the other three, taking care not to step into any
rabbit-holes! What fun it was to be out here in the sunshine, jogging up and
down on a horse’s back, without a care in the world! Henry was very happy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
other three were enjoying their day, but they were not quite so happy. They
kept wondering about George. They missed Timmy too. He should be trotting
beside them, enjoying the day as well!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
lost sight of the caravans after a time. Julian kept track of the way they
went, half-afraid of being lost. He had a compass with him, and checked their
direction continually. ‘It would never do to have to spend a night out here!’
he said. ‘Nobody would ever find us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had a magnificent lunch about half-past twelve. Really, Mrs Johnson had
surpassed herself! Egg and sardine sandwiches, tomato and lettuce, ham - there
seemed no end to them! Great slices of cherry cake were added too, and a large,
juicy pear each.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
like this kind of cherry cake,’ said Dick, looking at his enormous slice. ‘The
cherries have all gone to the bottom. They make a very nice last mouthful!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Any
drinks?’ said Henry, and was handed a bottle of ginger-beer. She drank it
thirstily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
does ginger-beer taste so nice on a picnic?’ she said. ‘Much nicer than
drinking it sitting down in a shop, even if it’s got ice in it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
a spring or something nearby,’ said Julian. ‘I can hear it bubbling.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all listened. Yes, there was a little bubbling, tinkling noise. Anne got up to
trace it. She found it in a few minutes and called the others. There was a
round pool, cool and blue, lying two or three feet down, and into it, from one
side, fell a crystal clear spring of water, tinkling as it fell.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘One
of the springs that the gypsies use, when they travel this deserted moor, I
expect,’ said Julian. He cupped his hands under the falling water and got his
palms full. He carried the water to his mouth and sipped it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Delicious!
Cool as an ice-box,’ he said. ‘Taste it, Anne.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
rode a little farther, but the moor seemed the same everywhere, heather, wiry
grass, gorse, a clear spring falling into a pool or tiny stream here and there,
and a few trees, mostly silver birch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Larks
sang all the time, soaring high in the air, almost too far up to see.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Their
song falls down like raindrops,’ said Anne, holding out her hands as if to
catch them. Henry laughed. She liked this family, and was very glad they had
asked her to come out with them. She thought George was silly to have stayed at
the stables.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think we ought to go home,’ said Julian at last, looking at his watch. ‘We’re a
good way away. Let me see now. We want to make more or less for the setting
sun. Come on!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
led the way, his horse picking its own path over the heather. The others
followed. Dick stopped after a while.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Are
you sure we’re quite right, Ju? I don’t somehow feel that we are. The moor is
different here, rather sandy and not so much gorse.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
stopped his horse and looked round and about. ‘Yes, it does look a bit
different,’ he said. ‘But yet we seem to be going in the right direction. Let’s
go a bit more to the west. If only there was something on the horizon to guide
us. But this moor hasn’t a thing that stands out anywhere!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went on again, and then Henry gave an exclamation. ‘I say! What’s this? Do come
here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two boys and Anne swerved over to Henry. She was now off her horse, and was
bending over, scraping away at the heather.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look,
it seems like rails, or something,’ said Henry. ‘Very old and rusty. But they
can’t be, surely?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
was now down on their knees, scraping sand and heather away. Julian sat back
and considered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
it’s rails. Old ones, as you say. But what in the world were rails laid down here
for?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can’t think,’ said Henry. ‘I only caught sight of them by chance, they’re so
overgrown. I couldn’t believe my eyes!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
must lead from somewhere to somewhere!’ said Dick. ‘Perhaps there was a quarry,
or something on the moor and they ran little engines with trucks there, to
fetch the sand, and take it back to town to sell.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
about it,’ said Julian. ‘It’s very sandy here, as we noticed. Good, fine sand.
Maybe there is a quarry on the moor. Well, that way, behind us goes right out
on the moor, so this way must lead back to some town or village, probably
Milling Green or somewhere like that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
You’re right,’ said Dick. ‘In which case, if we follow the lines along, we’ll
get back to civilization sooner or later!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
seeing that we seem to be more or less lost, that would be quite a good idea!’
said Henry. She mounted her horse again and rode along the lines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’re
fairly easy to see!’ she called. ‘If you ride between them, that is, because
they go so straight.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
lines ran steadily over the moor, sometimes very overgrown, and in about half
an hour’s time Henry gave a cry and pointed forward. ‘Houses! I thought we’d
soon come to some place!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
is Milling Green!’ said Julian, as the rails came to a sudden end, and they rode
out into a small cart-road.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we haven’t far to go now, to get to the stables,’ said Henry, pleased. ‘I say,
wouldn’t it be fun to follow those lines all across the moor and see where they
really lead to?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
We might do that one day,’ said Julian. ‘Gosh, it’s getting late. I wonder how
old George has been getting on today!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
walked quickly along to the stables, thinking of George. Would she have retired
to bed? Would she still be cross, or worse still, hurt and grieved? It was
anybody’s guess!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

George,’ said Captain Johnson, who, to her relief, had said nothing about her
not having gone riding with the others. ‘Now would you like to come and put
jumps up for the youngsters? They’re longing to do some more jumping.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
found that it was quite amusing to teach the younger ones how to jump. They
were so very very proud of themselves when they went over even a foot-high jump
on their little ponies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
that Sniffer arrived, accompanied by a peculiar little mongrel called Liz. Liz
was a bit of a spaniel, a bit of a poodle, and odd bits of something else - and
looked rather like a small, walking hearth-rug of black curly fur.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was amazed to see this walking mat, and sat and watched Liz sniffing here and
there for some time, before he came to the conclusion that it really was some
kind of dog. He gave a sharp little bark to see what this comical creature
would do when she heard it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Liz
took no notice at all. She had unearthed a small bone, which smelt extremely
interesting. Timmy considered that all bones within the radius of at least a
mile, belonged to him and him alone. So he ran over to Liz at once and gave a
small, warning growl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Liz
immediately dropped the bone humbly at his feet, then sat up on her hind-legs
and begged. Timmy eyed her in astonishment. Then Liz stood up on her hindlegs
and walked daintily all round Timmy and back again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was astounded. He had never seen a dog do that before. Could this hearthrug
affair be a dog after all?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Liz
saw that Timmy was really impressed, and went on with yet another trick she had
learnt during the time she had been with the circus.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
turned head-over-heels, yapping all the time. Timmy retreated a few steps into
the bushes. This was going too far! What was this animal doing? Trying to stand
on its head?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Liz
went on turning head-over-heels very rapidly and ended up almost on Timmy’s
front paws. He had now backed into the bush as far as he could.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Liz
remained on her back, paws in air, tongue hanging out, panting. She gave a very
small, beseeching whine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
bent his head down and sniffed at her paws. Behind him his tail began to move a
little, yes, it had a wag in it! He sniffed again. Liz leapt on to her four
feet and pranced all round Timmy, yapping as if to say ‘Come on and play! Do
come!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then suddenly Timmy fell upon the absurd little creature and pretended to worry
it. Liz gave a delighted volley of yaps and rolled over and over. They had a
marvellous game, and when it was all over, Timmy sank down panting for breath,
in a sunny corner of the yard and Liz settled herself between his front paws,
as if she had known him all her life!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
George came out of the stable with Sniffer, she could hardly believe her eyes.
‘What’s that Timmy’s got between his paws?’ she said. ‘It’s surely not a dog!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
Liz,’ said Sniffer. ‘She can get round any dog there is, Master George! Liz!
You’re a monkey, aren’t you! Walk, then, walk!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Liz
left Timmy and ran over to Sniffer, walking daintily on her hind legs. George
laughed. ‘What a funny little creature, like a bit cut out of a furry
hearthrug!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She’s
clever,’ said Sniffer and patted Liz. ‘Well, Master George, when can I have
Clip, do yon think? My father has gone off with the other caravans and he’s
left me with ours. So it doesn’t matter whether it’s today or tomorrow, or even
the next day.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
it won’t be today, that’s certain,’ said George, pleased that Sniffer called
her Master George not Miss. ‘It might perhaps be tomorrow. Haven’t you got a
hanky, Sniffer? I never on my life heard anyone sniff as often as you do.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sniffer
rubbed his sleeve across his nose. ‘I never had no hanky,’ he said. ‘But I’ve
got my sleeve, see?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think you’re quite disgusting,’ said George. ‘I’m going to give you one of my
own hankies, and you’re to use it. You’re not to keep sniffing like that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Didn’t
know I did,’ said Sniffer, half sulkily. ‘What’s it matter, anyway?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
George had gone indoors and up the stairs. She chose a large hanky, in red and
white stripes. That would do nicely for Sniffer! She took it down to him. He
looked at it in surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
a scarf for my neck!’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
it isn’t. It’s a hanky for your nose,’ said George. ‘Haven’t you a pocket to
put it in? That’s right. Now, use it instead of sniffing, for goodness’ sake!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
are the others?’ asked Sniffer, putting the hanky carefully into his pocket,
almost as if it were made of glass.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gone
riding,’ said George, shortly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
said they would come and see my caravan,’ said Sniffer. ‘They said so!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
they won’t be able to today,’ said George. ‘They’ll be back too late, I expect.
I’ll come and see it, though. There’s nobody in it, is there?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was not keen on meeting Sniffer’s father or any other of his relations! He
shook his head. ‘No, it’s empty. My father’s gone, I told you, and my aunt and
my grandma too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
do you do on the moor?’ asked George, as she followed Sniffer across the field
and up the hill to where the caravans had stood. Now only one was left -
Sniffer’s.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Play
around,’ said Sniffer, and gave an enormous sniff. George gave him a shove in
the back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sniffer!
What did I give you the hanky for? Don’t do that! It gets on my nerves!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sniffer
used his sleeve at once, but fortunately George didn’t notice. She had now come
to the caravan and was staring at it. She thought of Sniffer’s answer to her
question a minute or two back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
said you just played around on the moor. But what does your father do, and your
uncle and grandad and all the rest of the men? There’s nothing to do there at
all, as far as I can see, and no farmhouse to beg eggs or milk or anything
from.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sniffer
shut up like a clam. He was just about to sniff and thought better of it. He
stared at George, his mouth set in an obstinate line.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
looked at him impatiently. ‘Captain Johnson said you and your caravans went
there every three months,’ she said. ‘What for? There must be some reason?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,’
said Sniffer, looking away from her, ‘we make pegs, and baskets, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
know that! All gypsies make things to sell,’ said George. ‘But you don’t need
to go into the middle of a deserted moor to make them. You can do them just as
well in a village, or sitting in a field near a farmhouse. Why go to such a
lonely place as the moor?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sniffer
said nothing, but bent over a queer little arrangement of sticks set on the
path beside his caravan. George saw them and bent over them too, her question
forgotten.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh!
Is that a patrin? A gypsy message! What does it mean?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
were two sticks, one long and one short, neatly arranged in the shape of a
cross. A little farther up on the path were a few single, straight sticks, all
pointing in the same direction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Sniffer, very glad to have the subject changed. ‘It’s our way of telling
things to those who may come after us. See the sticks in the shape of the
cross? That’s a patrin that says we’ve been along this way and we’re going in
the direction that the long stick points.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
see,’ said George. ‘How simple! But what about these four straight sticks, all
pointing the same way too. What do they mean?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
mean that the travellers went in caravans,’ said Sniffer, giving a sudden
sniff. ‘See, four sticks, four caravans, going that way!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
see,’ said George, making up her mind that she herself would evolve quite a few
‘patrins’ for use at school when they went for walks. ‘Are there any more
“patrins” Sniffer?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Plenty,’
said the boy. ‘Look, when I leave here, I shall put a patrin like this!’ he
picked a large leaf from a nearby tree, and then a small one. He placed them
side by side, and weighted them down with small stones.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
in the world does that mean?’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
it’s a patrin, a message, to say that me and my little dog have gone in the
caravan too,’ said Sniffer, picking up the leaves. ‘Suppose my father came back
to find me, and he saw those leaves there, he’d know I’d gone on with my dog.
It’s simple. Big leaf for me, little leaf for my dog!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I like it,’ said George, pleased. ‘Now let’s look at the caravan.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was an old-fashioned kind of caravan, not very big, and with high wheels. The
door and the steps down were in front. The shafts rested on the ground waiting
for Clip to come back. The caravan was black, with red designs on it here and
there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
went up the steps. ‘I’ve been inside a few caravans,’ she said. ‘But never one
quite like this.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
peeped in curiously. It certainly wasn’t very clean, but it wasn’t as dirty as
she expected either.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
not smelly, is it?’ said Sniffer, quite anxiously. ‘I tidied it up today,
seeing as how I thought you were all visiting me. That’s our bed at the back.
We all sleep on it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
stared at the big bunk-like bed stretched at the end of the caravan, covered
with a bright quilt. She imagined the whole family sleeping there, close
together. Well at least they would be warm in the winter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
you get hot in the summer, sleeping in this small caravan?’ asked George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no, only my grandma sleeps here then,’ said Sniffer, swallowing a sniff in a hurry,
before George could hear it. ‘Me and the others sleep under the caravan. Then
if it rains it don’t matter.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
thanks for showing me so many things,’ said George, looking round at the
cupboards, the little locker-seats, and the over-big chest of drawers. ‘How you
all get in here is a miracle.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
didn’t go in. Even though Sniffer had tidied up, there was still a distinctly
peculiar smell hanging about!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
and see us tomorrow, Sniffer,’ she said, going down the steps. ‘Clip may be all
right by then. And Sniffer, don’t you forget you’ve got a hanky now!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
won’t forget,’ said Sniffer, proudly. ‘I’ll keep it as clean as can be, Master
George!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was feeling very lonely by the time the evening came. How had the others got on
without her? Had they missed her at all? Perhaps they hadn’t even thought of
her!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Anyway,
they didn’t have you, Timmy!’ said George. ‘You wouldn’t go off and leave me,
would you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
pressed against her, glad to see that she was happier again. He wondered where
the others were, and where they had gone to all day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was suddenly a clattering of hooves in the stableyard and George flew to the
door. Yes, they were back! How should she behave? She felt cross and relieved
and rather humble and glad all at once! She stood there, not knowing whether to
frown or to smile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others made up her mind for her. ‘Hallo, George!’ shouted Dick. ‘We did miss
you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How’s
your head?’ called Anne. ‘I hope it’s better!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo!’
called Henry. ‘You ought to have come. We’ve had a super day!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
and help us stable the horses, George,’ shouted Julian. ‘Tell us what you’ve
been doing!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
had sped over to them, barking in delight. George found her legs running
towards them too, a welcoming smile on her face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo!’
she called. ‘Let me help! Did you really miss me? I missed you too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys were very relieved to see that George was herself again. Nothing more was
said about her headache! She busied herself unsaddling the horses and listening
to their story of the day. Then she told them about Sniffer and his patrins,
and how she had given him a brand-new handkerchief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
I’m sure he thinks he’s got to keep it spotlessly clean!’ she said. ‘He never
used it once when I was with him. There’s the supper-bell, we’ll only just be
in time! Are you hungry?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
bet we are!’ said Dick. ‘Though after Mrs Johnson’s sandwiches I never thought
I’d be able to eat any supper at all. How’s Clip?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Never
mind now. I’ll tell you everything at supper,’ said George. ‘Do you want any
help, Henry?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Henry
was surprised to hear George call her Henry instead of Henrietta. ‘No thanks -
er - George,’ she said. ‘I can manage.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was a very jolly supper-time that evening. The youngsters were set at a table
by themselves, so the older ones talked to their hearts’ content.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Captain
Johnson was very interested to hear about the old railway they had found. ‘I
never knew there was anything like that on the moors,’ he said. ‘Though, of
course, we’ve only been here about fifteen years, so we don’t know a great deal
of the local history. You want to go and ask old Ben the blacksmith about that.
He’s lived here all his life, and a long life it is, for he’s over eighty!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we’ve got to take some of the horses to be shod tomorrow, haven’t we?’ said
Henry, eagerly. ‘We could ask him then! Why, he might even have helped to make
the rails!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
saw the caravans, George, when we had got pretty far out on the moor,’ said
Julian. ‘Goodness knows where they were heading for, towards the coast, I
should think. What’s the coast like beyond the moor, Captain Johnson?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wild,’
said the Captain. ‘Great, unclimbable cliffs, and reefs or rocks stretching out
to sea. Only the birds live there. There’s no bathing, no boating, no beach.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
it beats me where those caravans are going,’ said Dick. ‘It’s a mystery. They
go every three months, don’t they?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘About
that,’ said Captain Johnson. ‘I’ve no idea what the attraction of the moor is
for the gypsies. It just beats me! Usually they won’t go anywhere where there
are not a few farms, or at least a small village where they can sell their
goods.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’d
like to go after them and see where they are and what they’re doing,’ said
Julian, eating his third hard-boiled egg.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right. Let’s,’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
how? We don’t know where they’ve gone,’ said Henry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
Sniffer’s going to join them tomorrow, or as soon as Clip is all right for
walking,’ said George. ‘And he’s got to follow the patrins left on the way by the
others. He says that he looks at the places where fires have been made on the
way, and beside them somewhere he will see the patrins, the sticks that point
in the direction he must follow.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
sure to destroy them,’ said Dick. ‘We couldn’t follow them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
ask him to leave his own patrins,’ said George. ‘I think he will. He’s not a
bad little boy, really. I could ask him to leave plenty of patrins, so that we
could easily find the way.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
it might be fun to see if we could read the right road to go, just as easily as
the gypsies do,’ said Julian. ‘We could make it a day’s ride. It would be
interesting!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Henry
gave a most enormous yawn, and that made Anne yawn too, though hers was a very
polite one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Henry!’
said Mrs Johnson.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sorry,’
said Henry. ‘It just came almost like a sneeze does. I don’t know why, but I
feel almost asleep.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Go
to bed then,’ said Mrs Johnson. ‘You’ve had such a day of air and sunshine! You
all look very brown too. The April sun has been as hot as June today.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
five of them, and Timmy, went out for a last look at the horses, and to do one
or two small jobs. Henry yawned again, and that set everyone else off, even
George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Me
for the straw!’ said Julian, with a laugh. ‘Oh, the thought of that warm, comfy
straw bed is too good for words! You girls are welcome to the beds!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hope Sniffer’s Pa doesn’t come in the middle of the night again,’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
shall tie up the latch,’ said Julian. ‘Well, let’s go and say goodnight to Mrs
Johnson.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
wasn’t long before the three girls were in bed and the two boys cuddled down in
the straw of the stable. Clip was there still, but he no longer fidgeted. He
lay down quietly, and did not once move his bad leg. It was getting much
better. He would certainly be able to go after the others the next day!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and Dick fell asleep at once. No one came creeping in at the stable door that
night. Nothing disturbed them until the morning, when a cock got into the
stable through a window, sat on a rafter just above them, and crowed loudly
enough to wake both boys with a jump.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
that!’ said Dick. ‘That awful screeching in my ear! Was it you, Ju?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
cock crowed again and the boys laughed. ‘Blow him!’ said Julian, settling down
again. ‘I could do with another couple of hours sleep!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
morning Sniffer came slipping in at the gate again. He never came boldly in, he
slid through the hedge, or crept in at the gate, or appeared round a corner. He
saw George and went over to her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Master
George,’ he called, much to Julian’s amusement. ‘Is Clip better?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes!’
called back George. ‘Captain Johnson says you can take him today. But wait a
bit, Sniffer, I want to ask you something before you go.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sniffer
was pleased. He liked this girl who had presented him with such a magnificent
handkerchief. He took it carefully out of his pocket, hoping to please her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘See,’
he said. ‘How clean it is! I have kept it very carefully.’ He sniffed loudly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
a fathead,’ said George, exasperated. ‘I gave it to you to use, not to keep
clean in your pocket. It’s to stop your sniffing. Honestly, you’re a bit of a
mutt, Sniffer. I shall take that hanky away if you don’t use it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sniffer
looked alarmed. He shook it out carefully and then lightly touched his nose
with it. He then folded it up conscientiously in the right creases and put it
back into his pocket again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now,
NO sniffing!’ commanded George, trying not to laugh. ‘Listen, Sniffer, you know
those patrins you showed me yesterday?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
Master George,’ said Sniffer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
will the other gypsies who have gone in front, leave you patrins to follow, so
that you will know the way?’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sniffer
nodded. ‘Yes, but not many, because I have been that way twice before. They
will only leave them in places where I might go wrong.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
see,’ said George. ‘Now Sniffer, we want to have a sort of game. We want to see
which of us can follow patrins, and we want you to lay patrins for us quite
often, on your way to your family today. Will you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes, I will,’ said Sniffer, quite proud to have a favour asked of him. ‘I will
lay the ones I showed you, the cross, the long sticks, and the big and little
leaf.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
do,’ said George. ‘That will mean that you have passed in a certain direction
and you are a boy and a dog. That’s right, isn’t it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Sniffer, nodding his head. ‘You have remembered!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right.
And we’re going to have a kind of game, trying to pretend we are travelling
gypsies following others who have passed,’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
must not show yourselves when you come up to our caravans,’ said Sniffer,
looking suddenly alarmed. ‘I should get into trouble for laying patrins for
you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right. We’ll be careful,’ said George. ‘Now let’s go and get Clip.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
fetched the patient little skewbald who came out gladly. He no longer limped,
and his rest seemed to have done him good. He went off at a good pace with
Sniffer. The last George heard of them was a very loud sniff indeed!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sniffer!’
she shouted, warningly. He put his hand in his pocket and pulled out the hanky.
He waved it gaily in the air, a sudden grin lighting up his face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
went to find the others. ‘Sniffer has taken Clip,’ she said. ‘What about going
down to the blacksmith, and taking those horses that want shoeing?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
idea,’ said Julian. ‘We can ask him all about Mystery Moor then, and the
strange little railway line, or whatever it is! Come on.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
took the horses that needed shoeing. There were six of them, so they each rode
one, and Julian led the sixth. Timmy ran happily along beside them. He loved
the horses, and they regarded him as a real friend, bending their long noses
down to sniff at him, whenever he came near.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went slowly down the long lane to the blacksmith’s. ‘There it is!’ said George.
‘A proper old smithy with a lovely fire! And there’s the smith!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Old
Ben was a mighty figure of a man, even though he was over eighty. He didn’t
shoe many horses now, but sat in the sun, watching all that was going on. He
had a great mane of white hair, and eyes that were as black as the coal he had so
many times heated to a fiery flame.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
morning, young masters and Miss,’ he said and Julian grinned. That would please
George and Henry!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ve
got some questions to ask you,’ said George, dismounting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ask
away!’ said the old man. ‘If it’s about this place, there’s nothing much old
Ben can’t tell you! Give Jim your horses. Now, ask away!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Well,
began Julian, ‘we went riding on Mystery Moor yesterday, and for one thing we’d
like to know if there is any reason for the curious name. Was there ever a
mystery on that moor?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
there be plenty of mysteries away there,’ said Old Ben. ‘People lost and never
come back again, noises that no one could find the reason of...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
kind of noises?’ said Anne, curiously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah
now, when I were a boy, I spent nights up on that moor,’ said old Ben,
solemnly, ‘and the noises that went on there! Screeches and howls and the like,
and moans and the sweep of big wings...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
all that might have been owls and foxes and things like that,’ said Dick. ‘I’ve
heard a barn-owl give a screech just over my head which made me nearly jump out
of my skin. If I hadn’t known it was an owl I’d have run for miles!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ben
grinned and his face ran into a score of creases and wrinkles.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
is it called Mystery Moor?’ persisted Julian. ‘Is it a very old name?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘When
my Grandad was a boy it were called Misty Moor,’ said the old blacksmith,
remembering. ‘See, Misty, not Mystery. And that were because of the sea-fogs
that came stealing in from the coast, and lay heavy on the moor, so that no man
could see his hand in front of his face. Yes, I’ve been lost in one of them
mists, and right scared I was too. It swirled round me like a live thing, and
touched me all over with its cold damp fingers.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
horrid!’ said Anne with a shiver. ‘What did you do?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
first I ran for my life,’ said Ben, getting out his pipe and looking into the
empty bowl. ‘I ran over heather and into gorse. I fell a dozen times, and all
the time the mist was feeling me with its damp fingers, trying to get me,
that’s what the old folk used to say of that mist, it was always trying to get
you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Still,
it was only a mist,’ said George, feeling that the old man was exaggerating.
‘Does it still come over the moor?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
ay,’ said Ben, ramming some tobacco into his pipe. ‘Autumn’s the time, but it
comes sudden-like at any moment of the year. I’ve knowed it come at the end of
a fine summer’s day, creeping in stealthy-like, and my, if you don’t happen to
see it soon enough, it gets you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
do you mean, it gets you?’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
it may last for days,’ said old Ben. ‘And if you’re lost on them moors, you’re
lost proper, and you never come back. Ah, smile if you like, young sir, but I
knows!’ He went off into memories of long ago, looking down at his pipe. ‘Let’s
see now, there was old Mrs Banks, who went bilberry-picking with her basket on
a summer’s afternoon, and no one ever heard of her again, after the mist came
down. And there was young Victor who played truant and went off to the moors,
and the mist got him too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can see we’d better watch out for the mist if we go riding there,’ said Dick.
‘This is the first I’ve heard of it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
You keep your eyes skinned,’ said old Ben. ‘Look away to the coast-side and
watch there, that’s where it comes from. But there baint many mists nowadays, l
don’t know for why. No, now I think on it, there haven’t been a mist, not a
proper wicked one, for nigh on three years.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
I’d like to know is why was the name changed to Mystery Moor,’ said Henry. ‘I
can understand its being called Misty Moor, but now everyone calls it Mystery,
not Misty.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
now, that must have been about seventy years ago, when I were a bit of a boy,’
said Ben, lighting his pipe and puffing hard. He was enjoying himself. He
didn’t often get such an interested audience as this, five of them, including a
dog who sat and listened too!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
was when the Bartle Family built the little railway over the moor,’ he began,
and stopped at the exclamations of his five listeners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah!
We wanted to know about that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh!
You know about the railway then!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
go on!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
blacksmith seemed to get some trouble with his pipe and pulled at it for an
exasperatingly long time. George wished she was a horse and could stamp her
foot impatiently!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
the Bartle Family was a big one,’ said Ben at last. ‘All boys, but for one
ailing little girl. Big strong fellows they were, I remember them well. I was
scared of them, they were so free with their fists. Well, one of them, Dan,
found a mighty good stretch of sand out there on the moor...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes, we thought there might have been a sand-quarry,’ said Anne. Ben frowned at
the interruption.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
as there were nine or ten good strong Bartles, they reckoned to make a fine do
of it,’ said Ben. ‘They got wagons and they went to and from the quarry they
dug, and they sold their sand for miles around, good, sharp sand it were...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
saw some,’ said Henry. ‘But what about the rails?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
hurry him,’ said Dick, with a frown.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
made a mort of money,’ said Ben, remembering. ‘And they set to work and built a
little railway to carry an injin and trucks to the quarry and back, to save
labour. My, my, that were a nine days’ wonder, that railway! Us youngsters used
to follow the little injin, puffing along, and it were the longing of us all to
drive it. But we never did. Them Bartles kept a big stick, each one of them,
and they whipped the hide off any boy that got too near them. Fierce they were,
and quarrelsome.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
did the railway fall into ruin?’ asked Julian. ‘The rails are all overgrown
with heather and grass now. You can hardly see them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
now we come to that there Mystery you keep on about,’ said Ben, taking an extra
big puff at his pipe. ‘Them Bartles fell foul of the gypsies up on the moor...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
were there gypsies on the moor then?’ said Dick. ‘There are some now!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
ay, there’s always been gypsies on the moor, long as I can remember,’ said the
blacksmith. ‘Well, it’s said them gypsies quarrelled with the Bartles, and it
wasn’t hard to do that, most people did! And the gypsies pulled up bits of the
line, here and there, and the little injin toppled over and pulled the trucks
with it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children could quite well imagine the little engine puffing along, coming to
the damaged rails and falling over. What a to-do there must have been up on the
moor then!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
Bartles weren’t ones to put up with a thing like that,’ said Ben, ‘so they set
about to drive all the gypsies off the moor, and they swore that if so much as
one caravan went there, they’d set fire to it and chase the gypsies over to the
coast and into the sea!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
must have been a fierce family,’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
right there,’ said Ben. ‘All nine or ten of them were big upstanding men, with
great shaggy eyebrows that almost hid their eyes, and loud voices. Nobody dared
to cross them. If they did, they’d have the whole family on their door-step
with sticks. They ruled this place, they did, and my, they were hated! Us
children ran off as soon as we saw one coming round a corner.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
about the gypsies? Did the Bartles manage to drive them off the moor?’ asked
George, impatiently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
you let me go my own pace,’ said Ben, pointing at her with his pipe. ‘You want
a Bartle after you, young sir, that’s what you want!’ He thought she was a boy,
of course. He did something to his pipe and made them all wait a little. Julian
winked at the others. He liked this old fellow with his long, long memories.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now,
you can’t cross the gypsies for long,’ said Ben, at last. ‘That’s a fact, you
can’t. And one day all them Bartles disappeared and never came back home. No,
not one of them. All that was left of the family was little lame Agnes, their
sister.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
exclaimed in surprise and old Ben looked round with satisfaction. Ah, he could
tell a story, he could!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
whatever happened?’ said Henry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
no one rightly knows,’ said Ben. ‘It happened in a week when the mist came
swirling over the moors and blotted everything out. Nobody went up there except
the Bartles, and they were safe because all they had to do was to follow their
railway lines there and back. They went up to the quarry each day the mist was
there, and worked the same as usual. Nothing stopped they Bartles from
working!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
paused and looked round at his listeners. He dropped his voice low, and all
five of the children felt little shivers up their backs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘One
night somebody in the village saw twenty or more gypsy caravans slinking
through the village at dead of night,’ said Ben. ‘Up on the moor they went in
the thick mist. Mebbe they followed the railway; nobody knows. And next
morning, up to the quarry went the Bartles as usual, swallowed up in the mist.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
paused again. ‘And they never came back,’ he said. ‘No, not one of them. Never
heard of again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
what happened?’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Search-parties
were sent out when the mist cleared,’ said old Ben. ‘But never one of the
Bartles did they find, alive or dead. Never a one! And they didn’t find any
gypsy caravans either. They’d all come creeping back the next night, and passed
through the village like shadows. I reckon them gypsies set upon the Bartles in
the mist that day, fought them and defeated them, and took them and threw them
over the cliffs into the roaring sea!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
horrible!’ said Anne, feeling sick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
worrit yourself!’ said the blacksmith. ‘It all happened a mort of time ago, and
there wasn’t many that mourned them Bartles, I can tell you. Funny thing was,
their weakly little sister, Agnes, she lived to be a hale old woman of
ninety-six, and only died a few years ago! And to think them strong fierce
brothers of hers went all together like that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
a most interesting story, Ben,’ said Julian. ‘So Misty Moor became Mystery Moor
then, did it? And nobody ever really found out what happened, so the mystery
was never solved. Didn’t anyone work the railway after that, or get the sand?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
not a soul,’ said Ben. ‘We was all scared, you see, and young Agnes, she said
the railway and the trucks and injin could rot, for all she cared. I never
dared to go near them after that. It was a long time before anyone but the
gypsies set foot on Misty Moor again. Now it’s all forgotten, the tale of the
Bartles, but them gypsies still remember, I’ve no doubt! They’ve got long
memories, they have.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
you know why they come to Mystery Moor every so often?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
They come and they go,’ said Ben. ‘They’ve their own queer ways. They don’t
belong anywhere, them folk. What they do on the moor is their own business, and
I wouldn’t want to poke my nose into it. I’d remember them old Bartles, and
keep away!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
voice came from inside the smithy, where Jim, the blacksmith’s grandson, had
been shoeing the horses. ‘Grandad! You stop jabbering away there, and let the
children come and talk to me! I’ve shod nearly all the horses.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ben
laughed. ‘You go along,’ he said to the children. ‘I know you like to be in
there and see the sparks fly, and the shoes made. I’ve wasted your time, I
have, telling you long-ago things. You go along into the smithy. And just you
remember two things - watch out for that mist, and keep away from the gypsies
on the moor!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was fun in the smithy, working the bellows, seeing the fire glow, and watching
the red-hot shoes being shaped. Jim was quick and clever, and it was a pleasure
to watch him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
been hearing Grandad’s old stories?’ he said. ‘It’s all he’s got to do now, sit
there and remember, though when he wants to he can make a horse-shoe as well as
I can! There, that’s the last one. Stand still, Sultan. That’s right!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
five children were soon on their way back again. It was a lovely morning, and
the banks and ditches they passed were bright gold with thousands of
celandines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
beautifully polished!’ said Anne, picking two or three for her button-hole. It
did look as if someone had polished the inside of each petal, for they gleamed
like enamel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
a queer tale the old man told,’ said Julian. ‘He told it well!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
He made me feel I don’t want to go up on the moor again!’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
be feeble!’ said George. ‘It all happened ages ago. Jolly interesting too. I
wonder if the gypsies who are there now know the story. Maybe their
great-grand-parents were the ones who set on the Bartles that misty day!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
Sniffer’s father looked sly enough to carry out a plan like that,’ said Henry.
‘What about us having a shot at following the way they went, and seeing if we
can make out the patrins that Sniffer told George he would leave?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
idea,’ said Julian. ‘We’ll go this afternoon. I say, what’s the time? I should
think it must be half-past dinner-time!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
looked at their watches. ‘Yes, we’re late, but we always are when we get back
from the blacksmith,’ said George. ‘Never mind, I bet Mrs Johnson will have an
extra special meal for us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
had! There was an enormous plate of stew for everyone, complete with carrots,
onions, parsnips and turnips, and a date pudding to follow. Good old Mrs
Johnson!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
three girls must wash up for me afterwards,’ she said. ‘I’ve such a lot to do
today.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
can’t the boys help?’ said George at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
do all the washing-up,’ said Anne with a sudden grin. ‘You four boys can go out
to the stables!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
gave her a good-natured shove. ‘You know we’ll help, even if we’re not good at
it. I’ll dry. I hate those bits and pieces that float about in the
washing-bowl.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Will
it be all right if we go up on the moors this afternoon?’ asked George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
quite all right. But if you want to take your tea, you’ll have to pack it
yourselves,’ said Mrs Johnson. ‘I’m taking the small children out for a ride,
and there’s one on the leading-rein still, as you know.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were ready to set off at three o’clock their tea packed and everything. The
horses were caught in the field and got ready too. They set off happily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
we’ll see if we are as clever as we think we are, at reading gypsy patrins!’
said George. ‘Timmy, don’t chase every rabbit you see, or you’ll be left
behind!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
cantered up on to the moor, passing the place where the caravans had stood.
They knew the direction they had taken, and here and there they saw
wheel-marks. It was fairly easy to follow their trail, because five caravans
made quite a path to follow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here’s
where they camped first,’ said Julian, riding up to a blackened spot that
showed where a fire had been lighted. ‘We ought to find a message left
somewhere here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
searched for one. George found it. ‘It’s here, behind this tree!’ she called.
‘Out of the wind.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
dismounted and came round George. On the ground was the patrin, the shape of a
cross, the long stick pointing forwards, in the direction they were going.
Other single sticks lay there, to show that a caravan had gone that way, and
beside them were the large and the small leaf, weighted with tiny stones.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
did those leaves show now, oh yes, Sniffer and his dog!’ said Dick. ‘Well,
we’re on the right way, though we’d know that anyhow, by the fire!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
mounted again and went on. It proved quite easy to find and follow the patrins.
Only once did they find any difficulty and that was when they came to a place,
marked by two trees, where there was no apparent sign in the heather of any
caravan marks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
heather’s so jolly thick here that it’s taken the caravans as if it were a
feather-bed, springing up when they had gone, and giving no sign of where they
had passed,’ said Julian. He dismounted and had a good look round. No, there
was no sign.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
go on a little way,’ he said. ‘We may come to a camping place, then we’ll
know.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
they came to no old camping place, and stopped at last in bewilderment. ‘We’ve
lost the trail,’ said Dick. ‘We’re not such good gypsies after all!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
go back to those two trees,’ said George. ‘We can still just see them. If it’s
so easy to lose the way there, there might be a patrin, although there are no
camp-marks. After all, a patrin is left to show the way, in case the ones
following take the wrong route.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
back they rode to the two trees, and there, sure enough, was Sniffer’s patrin!
Henry found it set carefully between the trees, so that nothing could disturb
it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here’s
the cross, and the single sticks, and the leaves!’ she said. ‘But look, the
long stick of the cross points to the east and we went off to the north. No wonder
we found no signs of the caravans!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
set off to the east this time, across the thick, springy heather, and almost at
once found signs of the passing of caravans, twigs broken off the bushes, a
wheel rut on a soft piece of ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’re
right now,’ said Julian, pleased. ‘I was beginning to think it was all too easy
for words! But it isn’t!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
rode for two hours, and then decided to have tea. They sat down in a little
glade of silver birches, with an unexpected copse of pale primroses behind.
Timmy had to make up his mind which to choose, a rabbit-chase, or titbits from
the children’s tea!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
chose both, racing after an imaginary rabbit, and then coming back for a
sandwich!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
know, it’s a lot better for us when Mrs Johnson makes sandwiches of tomato or
lettuce or something like that,’ said Henry. ‘We do get them all then, but when
we have meat or sardine or egg sandwiches Timmy gets as much as we do!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
surely you don’t mind that, Henrietta,’ said George at once. ‘You make Timmy sound
very greedy. After all, you don’t need to give him any of your sandwiches!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now,
Georgina!’ murmured Dick, in her ear,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sorry,
Georgina,’ said Henry, with a grin. ‘I just can’t help giving him a sandwich or
two when he comes and sits down and looks at me so longingly.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, and at once sat down in front of Henry, his tongue out, and his
eyes fixed unblinkingly on her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
sort of hypnotizes me,’ complained Henry. ‘Make him go away, George, I shan’t
be able to keep a single sandwich or bit of cake for myself. Go and stare at
someone else, Timmy, for goodness’ sake!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
looked at his watch. ‘I don’t think we ought to spend too long over tea,’ he
said. ‘I know we’ve got summertime now, and the evenings are nice and light,
but we haven’t reached the gypsy camp yet, and after that we’ve got to go all
the way back. What about starting off again?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said everyone and remounted their horses. They set off through the heather.
Soon they found it unexpectedly easy to follow the caravan route, because the
soil became sandy, and there were many bare patches on which the marks of the
wheels could plainly be seen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Goodness,
if we go to the east much more, we’ll come to the sea!’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
it’s still some miles away,’ said Julian. ‘Hallo, there’s a little hill or
something in the distance. First time we’ve seen anything but complete
flatness!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
wheel-marks led steadily towards the little hill, which, as they came near,
seemed to grow considerably bigger. ‘I bet the caravans are there,’ said
George. ‘That hill would give a nice bit of shelter from the wind that came
from the sea. I believe I can see one!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was right. The caravans were there. They showed up well against the hill, in
their bright colours.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’ve
even got up a washing-line as usual!’ said Anne. ‘Clothes flapping in the
wind!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
go and ask if Clip is all right,’ said Julian. ‘It will be a very good excuse
for going right up to the camp.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
they cantered straight up to the little group of five caravans. Four or five
men appeared as soon as they heard the sound of hooves. They looked silent and
rather forbidding. Sniffer ran out and shouted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo!
Clip’s fine! Quite all right again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
father gave him a push and said something sharp to him. He disappeared under
the nearest caravan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
rode up to Sniffer’s father. ‘Did I hear Sniffer say that Clip was quite all
right?’ he asked. ‘Where is he?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Over
there,’ said the man, with a nod of his head. ‘No need for you to see him. He’s
mended fine.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right, all right! I’m not going to take him away from you!’ said Julian. ‘This
is a nice sheltered place you’ve got, isn’t it? How long are you staying?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
that to do with you?’ said an old gypsy, unpleasantly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nothing,’
said Julian, surprised. ‘Just a polite question, that’s all!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
do you get water?’ called George. ‘Is there a good spring here?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no reply at all. The four or five men had now been joined by others, and
there were three mangy-looking dogs growling round. Timmy was beginning to
growl back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’d
better go before our dogs get at you,’ said Sniffer’s father, sourly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
Liz?’ said George, remembering Sniffer’s dog, but before she got an answer the
three dogs suddenly made an attack on Timmy! They pounced on him and he had
hard work to keep them off. He was far bigger than they were, but they were
nippy little things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Call
off those dogs!’ yelled Julian, seeing that George was dismounting to go to
Timmy’s help. She would get bitten. ‘Do you hear me? Call off those dogs.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sniffer’s
father whistled. The three dogs reluctantly left Timmy and went over to the
men, their tails down. George had reached Tim and had now got her hand on his
collar to stop him from chasing the other three dogs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mount
your horse, whistle Timmy, and we’ll go,’ shouted Julian, not at all liking the
silent, sour-looking gypsies. George did as she was told. Timmy ran beside her,
and they all cantered away from the unpleasant camp.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
men stood watching them in complete silence. ‘What’s up with them?’ said Dick
puzzled. ‘Anyone would think they were planning another Bartle affair!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t!’
said Anne. ‘They’re planning something, all alone out here, far away from
anywhere! I shan’t go near them again.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
thought we were prying and spying,’ said Dick. ‘That’s all. Poor old Sniffer.
What a life he has!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
couldn’t even tell him that we found his patrins useful,’ said George. ‘Oh
well, there’s probably nothing in it, not even an adventure!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Was
she right or wrong? Julian looked at Dick and Dick looked back, his eyebrows
raised. They didn’t know. Oh well, time would tell!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
five of them told Captain and Mrs Johnson about their afternoon’s experience,
as they were having supper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Patrins!’
said Mrs Johnson. ‘So Sniffer told you about those? But I really don’t think
you should visit the gypsy camp. Those particular gypsies are a surly,
bad-tempered lot.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Did
you ever hear the tale of the Big Bartles?’ said Henry, getting ready to relate
it, and add little bits of her own, here and there!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
But it can wait, I’m sure,’ said Mrs Johnson, knowing Henry’s habit of leaving
her food quite uneaten once she began on some marvellous tale. ‘Is it one of
your tales? You can tell it after supper.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
not Henry’s tale,’ said George, annoyed that Henry should get all the limelight
again, and take the blacksmith’s tale for her own. ‘It’s one old Ben told us.
Ju, you tell it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nobody
is to tell it now,’ said Captain Johnson. ‘You came in late for supper, we
waited for you, and the least you can do is to get on with your eating.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
five juniors at the other table were disappointed. They had hoped to hear
another of Henry’s marvellous stories. But Captain Johnson was hungry and
tired.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Old
Ben is a great age, as you said,’ began Henry, after a few mouthfuls. ‘He -’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
another word, please, Henrietta,’ said the captain, curtly. Henry went red and
George grinned, kicking at Dick under the table. Unfortunately she kicked Henry
instead, and the girl glared at her for a whole minute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
dear!’ thought Anne. ‘Just as we’d had such a lovely day! I suppose we’re all
tired and scratchy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
did you kick me'?’ began Henry in a cross voice, as soon as she and George left
the table with the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shut
up, you two,’ said Julian. ‘She probably meant to kick me or Dick, not you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Henry
shut up. She didn’t like Julian to tick her off. George looked mutinous and
went off with Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
yawned. ‘What jobs are there to do, if any?’ he said. ‘Don’t say there’s
washing-up again. I feel I might break a few things.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs
Johnson heard him and laughed. ‘No, there’s no washing-up. The woman has come
in to do it tonight. Have a look at the horses - and see that Jenny the mare is
not with Flash, you know she doesn’t like her for some reason, and will kick
out at her. She must always be kept in another field.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
all right, Mrs Johnson,’ said William, suddenly appearing, stolid and competent
as ever. ‘I’ve seen to that. I’ve seen to everything, really.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
better than any stable-boy, William,’ said Mrs Johnson, smiling at him. ‘I wish
you’d take a permanent job here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wish you meant that,’ said William, earnestly. There was nothing he would have
liked better! He went off looking pleased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think you’d better all go to bed then, as William appears to have done
everything necessary,’ said Mrs Johnson. ‘Any plans for tomorrow?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
yet,’ said Julian, trying to stop a yawn. ‘So if you want anything done, we’ll
do it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
see what tomorrow brings,’ said Mrs Johnson and said good night. The boys said
good night to the three girls and went off to the stable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh,
we’ve forgotten to undress and wash and everything,’ said Julian, half-asleep.
‘What’s the matter with us at this place? I can’t seem to keep my eyes open
after half-past eight!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
next day certainly brought a few things. It brought a letter for Henry that
filled her with disgust. It brought two letters for Mrs Johnson that made her
start fussing and worrying. It brought a telegram for Captain Johnson that sent
him down to the station at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Henrietta’s
letter was from two of her great-aunts. They announced that as they would be
near the stables that day and the following, they would like to fetch her and
take her out with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Blow!’
said Henrietta, ungratefully. ‘Great-Aunts Hannah and Lucy would choose this
very week to come along and see me! Just when Julian and Dick are here, and
everything is such fun. Can’t I phone and say I’m too busy, Mrs Johnson?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Certainly
not,’ said Mrs Johnson, shocked. ‘That would be very rude, Henry, and you know
it. You’re having the whole of the Easter holidays here, and yet you think you
can’t spare two days. As a matter of fact I shall be glad if your aunts do take
you off my hands for a couple of days.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why?’
asked Henry, astonished. ‘Have I been a nuisance?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no, but I’ve had two letters this morning telling me that four children are
coming unexpectedly,’ said Mrs Johnson. ‘They were not supposed to come till
three of the others left this week-end, but there you are! These things happen.
Where I am to put them I really don’t know!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
dear!’ said Anne. ‘Do you think Dick and Julian ought to go home, Mrs Johnson?
You didn’t plan for them, you know, they just came.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I know,’ said Mrs Johnson. ‘But we’re more or less used to that, and I do like
having bigger boys, I must say, they’re such a help. Now let me see. What can
we do?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Captain
Johnson came in, looking hurried. ‘I’ve just had a telegram, dear,’ he said.
‘I’ve got to go down to the station. Those two new horses have arrived. Two
days before I wanted them - what a nuisance!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
is one of those days!’ said Mrs Johnson, desperately. ‘Good gracious, how many
shall we be in the house? And however many horses shall we have? No, I can’t
count this morning. I’m all muddle-headed!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
felt that it was a pity that she and George and the boys couldn’t immediately
pack and go home. After all, poor Mrs Johnson had thought that she and George
would have gone home three or four days ago, and instead of that they had
stayed on and the boys had arrived as well!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
hurried to find Julian. He would know what to do. She found him with Dick,
carrying straw for the stables.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian!
Listen! I want to talk to you,’ said Anne. Julian let the load of straw slip to
the ground, and turned to Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
up?’ he said. ‘Don’t tell me it’s a row between George and Henry again, because
I shan’t listen!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
Nothing like that,’ said Anne. ‘It’s Mrs Johnson. She’s got four children
coming unexpectedly, before the others go. She’s in a great state about it, and
I wondered what we could do to help. You see, she didn’t expect any of us four
to be here this week.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
That’s true,’ said Julian, sitting down on his straw. ‘Let’s think hard.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
easy!’ said Dick. ‘We’ll simply take our tents, some food, and go and camp out
on the moor by some spring. WHAT could be nicer?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes!’ said Anne, her eyes shining. ‘Oh Dick, that’s a marvellous idea! Mrs
Johnson will get rid of us all and Timmy too, then, and we would have a lovely
time all by ourselves!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Killing
quite a lot of birds with one stone!’ said Julian. ‘We’ve got a couple of tents
in our kit, Anne. Very small ones, but they’ll do. And we can borrow rubber
sheets to put on the heather, though it’s as dry as a bone, as far as I can
see!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
go and tell George!’ said Anne, joyfully. ‘Let’s go today, Julian, and be out
of the way before the new children come. Captain Johnson’s got two new horses
coming too. He’ll be very glad to have a few of us out of the way!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
flew off to tell George. George was busy polishing some harness, a job she
liked very much. She listened to Anne’s excited tale. Henry was there too,
looking gloomy. She looked gloomier still at the end.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
too bad,’ she said, when Anne had finished. ‘I could have come with you if it
hadn’t been for these great-aunts of mine. WHY did they have to come just at
this very moment! Don’t you think it’s maddening?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Neither
Anne nor George thought it was maddening. They were secretly very pleased
indeed to think that they could once more go off entirely on their own, with
Timmy, as they had so often done before. But they would have had to ask Henry
if her aunts hadn’t written at this very lucky moment!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
didn’t like to show how delighted she was to think of going off camping on the
moor. She and Anne did a little comforting of poor Henry and then went off to
make arrangements with Mrs Johnson.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
that’s a very bright idea of Dick’s!’ she said in delight. ‘It solves a whole lot
of problems. And I know you don’t mind. You’re thrilled at the chance, aren’t
you! It’s really very helpful. I only wish poor Henry could go too, but she
must go out with her old great-aunts. They adore her!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course she must,’ said George, solemnly. She and Anne exchanged a look. Poor
Henry. But really, it would be very nice to be without her for a little while.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
began to be suddenly very busy. Dick and Julian undid their packs to find out
exactly what was in them. Mrs Johnson looked out rubber sheets and old rugs.
She was a wonder at producing things like that!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>William
wanted to go with them and help to carry the things, but nobody wanted his
help. They just wanted to be off and away by themselves, just the Five and
nobody else! Timmy caught the excitement too and his tail thumped and wagged
the whole morning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’ll
be pretty well loaded,’ said Mrs Johnson, doubtfully. ‘It’s a good thing that
fine weather is forecast, or you’d have to take macs as well. Still, I imagine
you won’t go very far on the moors, will you? You can easily get back to the
stable if you have forgotten anything, or want more food.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were ready at last, and went to find Henry to say good-bye. She stared at them
mournfully. She had changed into a smart little coat and dress. She looked
completely different and very gloomy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
part of the moor are you going to?’ she asked eagerly. ‘Up the railway?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
We thought we would,’ said Julian. ‘Just to see where it goes to. And it’s a
nice straight way to follow. We can’t lose our way if we keep near the
railway!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Have
a good time, Henry,’ said George, with a grin. ‘Do they call you Henrietta?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said poor Henry, putting on a pair of gloves. ‘Well, good-bye. For goodness’
sake don’t stay away too long. Thank goodness you’re all such a hungry lot.
You’ll simply have to come back and get more food in a couple of days!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
grinned and left her, Timmy at their heels. They made their way to the moor,
intending to cut out the part of the railway that ran to Milling Green, and
join it some way before that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
we’re off,’ said George, contentedly. ‘Without that chatterbox of a Henry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She’s
really not too bad,’ said Dick. ‘All the same, it’s fine to be on our own, just
the Famous Five together!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was a very hot day. The five had had their lunch before they started, as Mrs
Johnson said it would be easier to carry that inside than outside!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Even
Timmy carried something. George said that he ought to do his share, and had
neatly fastened a bag of his pet biscuits on his back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
now!’ she said. ‘You’ve got your load too. No, don’t try and sniff the biscuits
all the time, Timmy. You can’t walk with your head screwing round like that.
You ought to be used to the smell of biscuits by this time!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
set off to the railway line, or where they hoped it would be. It took a little
time to discover it running under the heather. Julian was glad. He didn’t want
to walk right into Milling Green to find the beginning of it and then walk all
the way up again!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
found it by tripping over it! ‘Oh!’ she said, ‘here it is! I caught my foot in
a bit of rusty line. Look you can hardly see it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good,’
said Julian, and stepped in between the narrow pair of old, rusty lines. In some
places they had rusted away, and there were gaps. In other places the heather
had grown completely over the lines, and unless the children had known that
they must keep straight forward, they would have lost them completely. As it
was they sometimes missed them and once had to do quite a bit of scrabbling
about in the heather to see if they could feel them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was very hot. Their packs began to feel distinctly heavy. Timmy’s biscuits
began to slide round his body and eventually hung below his tummy. He didn’t
like that, and George suddenly spied him sitting down trying to prise open the
bag with his teeth!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
put down her own pack and adjusted Timmy’s. ‘If only you didn’t keep chasing
rabbits, and making your pack swing about, it wouldn’t slip,’ she said. ‘There
now, it’s all right again, Tim. Walk to heel and it won’t slip any more.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went on and on up the railway lines. Sometimes the rails took a curve round an
unexpected rock. Soon the soil began to look sandy, and the heather did not
grow so thickly. It was easier to see the lines, though in some places the sand
had sifted over them and hidden them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
really must have a rest!’ said Anne, sitting down in some heather. ‘I feel I
want to pant and hang my tongue out like Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wonder how far these lines go,’ said Dick. ‘It’s so very sandy now underfoot
that I feel we must be getting near the quarry!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
lay back in the heather and felt very sleepy. Julian yawned and sat up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
really won’t do!’ he said. ‘If we fall asleep we’ll never want to start off
with our heavy packs again. Stir yourselves, lazy-bones!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all got up again. Timmy’s biscuits had slithered round to his tummy once more,
and George had to put them right again. Timmy stood quietly, panting, his
tongue hanging out. He thought the biscuits were a great nuisance. It would be
much easier to eat them!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sand got deeper and soon there were big sandy patches with no heather or grass
at all. The wind blew the sand up in the air, and the five found that they had
to shut their eyes against it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say! The lines end here!’ said Julian, stopping suddenly. ‘Look, they’re
broken, wrenched out of place, the engine couldn’t go any farther.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
may appear again a bit farther on,’ said Dick, and went to look. But he
couldn’t find any, and came back to look at the lines again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
funny,’ he said. ‘We aren’t at any quarry yet, are we! I quite thought that the
line would run right to the quarry, the trucks would fill up there, and the
engine would pull them back to Milling Green. Where is the quarry? Why do the
lines stop so suddenly here?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
The quarry should be near here, shouldn’t it?’ said Julian. ‘Well, there simply
must be more lines somewhere! Ones that go to the quarry. Let’s look for the
quarry first, though. We ought to see that easily enough!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it wasn’t really very easy to find because it was behind a great mass of thick
tall gorse-bushes. Dick rounded them and stopped. Behind the enormous spread of
bushes was a great pit, a sandy pit, quarried and hollowed for its beautiful
sand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here
it is!’ called Dick. ‘Come and look! My word, there’s been some quarrying here
for sand. They must have taken tons and tons out of it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others came to look. It certainly was an enormous pit, deep and wide. They put
their packs beside it and leapt down. Their feet sank into the fine sand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
sides are pitted with holes,’ said Dick. ‘I bet hundreds of sand-martins nest
here in May!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
are even some caves,’ said George, in surprise. ‘Sand-caves! Well, we can
easily shelter here if we have rain. Some of these caves seem to go quite a
long way back.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
But I’d be a bit afraid of the sand falling in and burying me, if I crawled
in,’ said Anne. ‘It’s quite loose, look!’ She scraped some down with her hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
found the lines!’ called Julian. ‘Here, look. The sand has almost covered them.
I trod on a rail and it was so rotten it broke beneath my foot!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others went to see, Timmy too. He was quite delighted with this place. The
rabbit-holes in it! What fun he was going to have!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
follow these lines,’ said Julian. So they kicked away the sand from the rails
and followed them slowly out of the quarry and towards the ends of the other
broken lines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>About
ten yards from these the lines they were following were wrenched apart. Some
were flung into nearby heather, and could be seen there, bent and rusty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children stared at them. ‘I guess the gypsies did that, when the Bartles were
here years ago,’ said Dick. ‘The day they attacked them perhaps. I say look, whatever’s
that great lump over there, with gorse growing over it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went to see. Timmy saw the lump and couldn’t make it out. He growled warningly
at it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
took up a broken piece of rail and forced back the gorse bush that had grown
over and around the great lump, almost hiding it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘See
what it is?’ he said, startled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all stared. ‘Why, it’s the engine! The little “injin” old Ben the blacksmith
told us about!’ said Dick. ‘It must have run right off the broken lines and
over-turned here, and through the years these great gorse-bushes grew up and
hid it. Poor old engine!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
forced the gorse back a little more. ‘What a funny old-fashioned affair!’ he
said. ‘Look at the funnel, and the fat little boiler. And see, there’s the
small cab. It can’t have had much power, only just enough to puff along with a
few trucks!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
happened to the trucks?’ wondered Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
they would be easy enough to set upright again and put on the rails, and
hand-pushed to Milling Green,’ said Dick. ‘But this engine couldn’t be lifted,
except by some kind of machinery. Not even a dozen men could lift it and set it
on the rails!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
gypsies must have set on the Bartles in the mist, having first broken up the
lines so that the engine would run off and overturn,’ said Julian. ‘They may
even have used the broken rails to attack them with. Anyway, they won the
battle, because not one of the Bartles ever returned.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Some
of the villagers must have gone to see what became of them and have got the
trucks back on the lines and pushed them to Milling Green,’ said George, trying
to reconstruct the long-ago happenings in her mind. ‘But they couldn’t do
anything about the engine.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
about it,’ said Julian. ‘My word, what a shock for the Bartles when they saw
the gypsies creeping out at them from the mist, like shadows!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hope we don’t dream about this tonight,’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went back to the quarry. ‘This wouldn’t be a bad place to camp in,’ said Dick.
‘The sand is so dry and so soft. We could make lovely beds for ourselves. We
wouldn’t need the tents up, either, because the sides of the quarry shelter us
beautifully from the wind.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
Let’s camp here,’ said Anne, pleased. ‘There are quite a lot of nice holes to
store our things in.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
about water?’ asked George. ‘We want to be fairly near it, don’t we? Timmy,
find some water! Drink, Timmy, drink! Aren’t you thirsty! Your tongue looks as
if it is, the way you are hanging it out like a flag!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
put his head on one side as George talked to him. Water? Drink? He knew what
both those words meant! He ran off, sniffing the air. George watched him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
disappeared round a bush and was away for about half a minute. When he came
back George gave a pleased shout.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
found some water! Look - his mouth is all wet! Timmy, where is it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
wagged his tail vigorously, glad that George was pleased with him. He ran round
the bush again and the others followed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
led them to a little green patch and stopped. A spring bubbled up like a small
fountain, dancing a little in the sunshine. The water fell from it into a
little channel it had made for itself in the sand, ran away for a short
distance, and then disappeared underground again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thank
you, Tim,’ said George. ‘Julian, is the water all right to drink here?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
I can see some that is!’ said Julian, pointing to the right. ‘The Bartles must
have put a pipe in that bank, look, and caught another spring there, a much
bigger one. It’s as clear as can be. That will do fme for us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good,’
said Anne, pleased. ‘It’s hardly any way from the quarry. It’s as cold as ice,
too - feel!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
felt, and then they drank from their palms. How cold and pure! The moor must be
full of these little bubbling springs, welling up from underground. That
explained the brilliant green patches here and there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
let’s sit down and have some tea,’ said Anne, unpacking the bag she had
carried. ‘It’s too hot to feel really hungry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no, it isn’t,’ said Dick. ‘Speak for yourself, Anne!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
sat in the sunny quarry, the sand warm to their legs. ‘Far away from
everybody!’ said Anne, pleased. ‘Nobody near us for miles!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
she wasn’t quite right. There was somebody much nearer than she thought!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was Timmy who first knew there was somebody not far off. He pricked up his ears
and listened. George saw him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
is it, Tim?’ she said. ‘Nobody is coming here, surely?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
gave a tiny growl, as if he were not quite sure of himself. Then he leapt up,
his tail wagging, and tore out of the quarry!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
he gone to?’ said George astonished. ‘Gosh, here he is, back again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
he was, and with him was a funny little hearthrug of a dog - yes, Liz! She was
not quite sure of her welcome and crawled up to the children on her tummy,
looking more like a hearthrug than ever!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
leapt round her in delight. She might have been his very best friend, he was so
delighted! George patted the funny little dog and Julian looked thoughtful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hope this doesn’t mean that we are anywhere near the gypsy camp,’ he said.
‘It’s quite likely that the lines might end somewhere near them. I’ve rather
lost my sense of direction.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
goodness, I do HOPE we’re not near their camp!’ said Anne, in dismay. ‘Those
old-time gypsies must have camped pretty near to the Bartles’ quarry before
they attacked them, so perhaps the present camp is near too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
what’s it matter if it is?’ said Dick. ‘Who’s afraid of them? I’m not!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all sat still, thinking hard, Liz licking Anne’s hand. And in the silence they
heard an all-too-familiar sound.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sniff!
Sniff!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sniffer!’
called George. ‘Come on out, wherever you are hiding. I can hear you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
pair of legs stuck out from a great clump of heather at the edge of the quarry,
and then the whole of Sniffer’s wiry little body slithered out and down into
the sand. He sat there, grinning at them, half-afraid to come any nearer in
case they were cross with him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
are you doing here?’ said Dick. ‘Not spying on us, I hope?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said Sniffer, ‘Our camp isn’t very far away. Liz heard you, I think, and ran
off. I followed her.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
blow. We hoped we weren’t near anyone else,’ said George. ‘Does anyone at your
camp know we’re here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
yet,’ said Sniffer. ‘But they’ll find out. They always do. I won’t tell,
though, if you don’t want me to.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
tossed him a biscuit. ‘Well, keep your mouth shut if you can,’ he said. ‘We’re
not interfering with anyone and we don’t want anyone interfering with us. See?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sniffer
nodded. He suddenly put his hand in his pocket and pulled out the red and white
hanky that George had given him. It was still clean and beautifully folded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
dirty yet!’ he said to George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
it ought to be,’ said George. ‘It’s for your sniffs. No don’t use your
coat-sleeve.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sniffer
simply could not understand why he should use a beautiful clean hanky when he
had a dirty coat-sleeve. He put the hanky carefully back into his pocket.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Liz
ran to him and fawned on him. Sniffer fondled the peculiar little creature, and
then Timmy went over and played with them both. The four finished their tea,
threw Sniffer one last biscuit, and got up to put their things away safely. Now
that Sniffer was about, and the gypsy camp near, they didn’t feel it was
terribly safe to leave anything unguarded or unhidden.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Scoot
off, now, Sniffer,’ said Julian. ‘And no spying on us, mind! Timmy will know
immediately you arrive anywhere near, and come hunting for you. If you want to
see us, give a whistle when you get near. No creeping or slipping into the
quarry. Understand?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Sniffer, standing up. He took the hanky from his pocket again, waved it at
George, and disappeared with Liz at his heels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
just going to see exactly how near to the gypsy camp we are,’ Julian said. He
walked to the entrance of the quarry and up on to the moor. He looked in the
direction that Sniffer had gone. Yes, there was the hill in the shelter of
which the gypsies had their caravans. It wasn’t more than a quarter of a mile
away. Blow! Still, it was far enough for the gypsies not to discover them,
unless by chance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Or
unless Sniffer gives the game away,’ thought Julian. ‘Well, we’ll spend the
night here, anyway, and we can move off somewhere else tomorrow if we feel like
it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
felt rather energetic that evening and played a ball game in the quarry, in
which Timmy joined wholeheartedly. But as he always got the ball before anyone
else did they had to tie him up in order to get a game themselves. Timmy was
very cross. He turned his back on them and sulked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
looks like you now, George,’ said Dick, grinning, and got the ball bang on the
side of his head from an angry George!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
wanted much supper. Julian took a little aluminium jug to the spring and filled
it once for everyone. It really was lovely water from that bubbling spring!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wonder how Henry’s getting on,’ said Anne. ‘Spoilt to bits by her great-aunts.
I expect. Didn’t she look odd in proper clothes, gloves and all!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
she ought to have been a boy,’ said Dick. ‘Like you, George,’ he added hastily.
‘Both of you are real sports, plucky as anything.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
do you know Henry’s plucky?’ said George, scornfully. ‘Only by her silly tales!
I bet they’re all made-up and exaggerated.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
changed the subject. ‘Shall we want rugs tonight, do you think?’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Rather!
It may be warm now, and the sand is hot with the sun, but it won’t be quite so
nice when it’s gone down,’ said Anne. ‘Anyway we can always creep into one of
those cosy little caves if we feel chilly. They’re as warm as toast. I went
into one, so I know.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
settled down quite early to sleep. The boys took one side of the quarry, the
girls the other. Tim, as usual, was on George’s feet, much to Anne’s
discomfort.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
on mine too,’ she complained to George. ‘He’s so long, he stretches over my
feet as well. Move him, George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
George moved him, but as soon as Anne was asleep he stretched out again and lay
on both girls’ legs. He slept with one ear open.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
heard a scurrying hedgehog. He heard all the rabbits out for a night-time game.
He heard the frogs in a far-off pool croaking in the night. His sharp ear even
heard the tinkle of the little spring outside the pit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
moved in the quarry. There was a small moon but it gave very little light. The
stars that studded the sky seemed to give more light than the moon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy’s
one open ear suddenly pricked itself right up. Then the other ear stood up too.
Timmy was still asleep but his ears were both listening very hard!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
low, humming sound came slowly over the night. It came nearer and nearer. Timmy
awoke properly and sat up, listening, his eyes wide open now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sound was now very loud indeed. Dick awoke and listened. What was that noise?
An aeroplane? It must be jolly low! Surely it wasn’t about to land on the moor
in the dark!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
woke Julian and they both got up and went out of the quarry. ‘It’s an aeroplane
all right,’ said Dick, in a low voice. ‘What’s it doing? It doesn’t seem to be
going to land. It’s gone round in a low circle two or three times.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
it in trouble, do you think?’ asked Julian. ‘Here it comes again.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look,
what’s that light over there?’ suddenly said Dick, pointing to the east. ‘See,
that sort of glow. It’s not very far from the gypsies’ camp.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know,’ said Julian, puzzled. ‘It’s not a fire, is it? We can’t see any flames
and it doesn’t seem to flicker like a fire would.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think it may be some sort of guide to that plane,’ said Dick. ‘It seems to be
circling round and about over the glow. Let’s watch it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
watched it. Yes, it did seem to be circling round the glow, whatever it was,
and then, quite suddenly it rose in the air, circled round once more and made
off to the east.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
it goes,’ said Dick, straining his eyes. ‘I can’t tell what kind it is, except
that it’s very small.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
can it have been doing?’ said Julian, puzzled. ‘I thought the glow might have
been to guide it in landing, though where it could land here in safety I simply
don’t know. But it didn’t land at all, it just circled and made off’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
would it have come from?’ said Dick. ‘From the coast, I suppose, from over the
sea, do you think?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
simply don’t know,’ said Julian. ‘It beats me! And why should the gypsies have
anything to do with it? Gypsies and planes don’t seem to mix, somehow.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we don’t know that they do have anything to do with the plane, except that we
saw that glow,’ said Dick. ‘And that’s going now, look.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Even
as they watched, the bright glow died completely away. Now the moor lay in
darkness again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Funny,’
said Julian, scratching his head. ‘I can’t make it out. It’s true that the
gypsies may be up to something, the way they come out here secretly, apparently
for no purpose at all, and also they don’t want us snooping round, that’s
clear.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think we’d better try and find out what that glow is,’ said Dick. ‘We could
have a bit of a snoop tomorrow. Or perhaps Sniffer could tell us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
might,’ said Julian. ‘We’ll try him. Come on, let’s get back into the quarry.
It’s cold out here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
quarry struck quite warm to them as they went down into it. The girls were
sound asleep still. Timmy, who had been with them, did not wake them. He had
been as puzzled as Julian and Dick over the low-flying plane, but he had not
barked at all. Julian had<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>been
glad about that, Timmy’s bark might have carried right over to the gypsy camp
and warned it that someone was camping near.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
got back under their rug, keeping close to one another for warmth. But they
soon lost their shivers, and Dick threw off his share of the rug. In a few
minutes they were asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
awoke first and stretched himself out in the warm morning sunshine. Anne sat up
with a little scream. ‘Oh Timmy, don’t! You nearly squashed me to bits. Do that
to George if you must stretch yourself all over somebody!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys awoke then, and went to the spring to splash their faces and bring back a
jugful of water to drink. Anne got the breakfast, and over it the boys told the
girls of the aeroplane in the night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
queer!’ said Anne. ‘And that glow too. It must have been a guide of some sort
to the plane. Let’s go and see where it was. It must have been a fire of some
kind!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Dick. ‘I vote we go this morning, but we’ll take Tim with us in case we
meet those gypsies!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and Dick went to stand where they had stood the night before, trying to see
exactly in what direction the glow had been.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think it was beyond the gypsies’ camp, to the left,’ said Julian. ‘What do you
think, Dick?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
That’s about it,’ said Dick. ‘Shall we go now?’ He raised his voice. ‘We’re
going, George and Anne. Are you coming? We can leave our stuff here, tucked
away in the caves because we shan’t be very long.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
called back. ‘Julian, I think Timmy’s got a thorn in his foot or something.
He’s limping. Anne and I think we’ll stay here with him and try to get it out.
You go, but for goodness’ sake don’t get into trouble with the gypsies!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
shan’t,’ said Julian. ‘We’ve as much right on this moor as they have and they
know it. All right, we’ll leave you two here then with Timmy. Sure you don’t
want any help with his paw?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no,’ said George. ‘I can manage, thank you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two boys went off, leaving Anne and George fussing over Timmy’s paw. He had
leapt into a gorse bush after a rabbit and a thorn had gone right into his left
fore-paw. Then it had broken off, leaving the point in poor Timmy’s pad. No
wonder he limped! George was going to have quite a time trying to ease out the
bit of thorn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and Dick set off over the moor. It was a day like summer, far too warm for
April. There was not a single cloud to be seen in the sky, which was as blue as
forget-me-nots. The boys felt too hot in their pullovers and longed to take
them off. But that would mean carrying them, which would be an awful nuisance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
gypsy camp was not really far away. They soon came near to the curious hill
that stood up from the flatness of the moor. The caravans still stood in its
shelter, and the boys saw that a little group of men were sitting together,
talking earnestly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
bet they’re having a jaw about that aeroplane last night,’ said Dick. ‘And I
bet it was they who set that light or fire, or whatever it was, to guide it. I
wonder why it didn’t land.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
kept in the shelter of big gorse bushes, as they skirted the camp. They were
not particularly anxious to be seen. The dogs, sitting round the group of men,
apparently did not see or hear them, which was lucky.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys made their way towards the place where they thought they had seen the
glow, some way to the left of the camp, and beyond it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Doesn’t
seem to be anything out of the ordinary anywhere,’ said Julian, stopping and
looking round. ‘I was expecting to see a big burnt patch, or something.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wait
- what’s in that dip over there?’ said Dict, pointing to where the ground
seemed to dip downwards. ‘It looks like another old quarry, rather like the one
we’re camping in, but smaller, much smaller. I bet that’s where the fire was!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
made their way to the quarry. It was much more overgrown than theirs was, and
was evidently one that had been worked at an earlier time. It dipped down to
quite a pit in the middle and set there was something unusual. What was it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys scrambled down into the pit-like quarry and made their way to the middle.
They stared at the big thing that was set there, pointing to the sky.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
a lamp, a powerful lamp of some kind,’ said Dick. ‘Like those we see making a
flare-path at an aerodrome, guiding planes in to land. Fancy seeing one here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
did the gypsies get it?’ wondered Dick, puzzled. ‘And why signal to a plane
that doesn’t land? It looked as if it wanted to, circling round low like that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Maybe
the gypsies signalled that it wasn’t safe to land for some reason,’ said
Julian. ‘Or perhaps they were going to give something to the pilot and it
wasn’t ready.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
it’s a puzzle,’ said Dick. ‘I can’t imagine what’s going on. Something is,
that’s certain. Let’s snoop round a bit.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
found nothing else, except a trail that led to the lamp and back. Just as they
were examining it, a shout came to their ears. They swung round - and saw the
figure of a gypsy at the edge of the pit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
are you doing here?’ he shouted, in a harsh voice. He was joined by a few
others, and they all looked threateningly at Julian and Dick as they climbed
out of the pit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
decided to be honest. ‘We’re camping out on the moor for a night or two,’ he
said, ‘and we heard a plane last night, circling low. We also saw a glow that
appeared to be guiding it, and we came along to see what it was. Did you hear
the plane?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mebbe
we did and mebbe we didn’t,’ said the nearest gypsy, who was Sniffer’s father.
‘What of it? Planes fly over this moor any day!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
found that powerful lamp,’ said Dick, pointing back at it. ‘Do you know
anything about that?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nothing,’
said the gypsy scowling. ‘What lamp?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
as far as I can see there’s no charge for looking at it,’ said Julian. ‘Go and
have a squint, if you don’t know anything about it! But I can’t believe that
you didn’t see the light it gave last night! It’s a jolly good place to hide
it, I must say.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
don’t know anything about any lamp,’ said another gypsy, the old one with grey
hair. ‘This is our usual camping-place. We don’t interfere with anything or
anybody - unless they interfere with us. Then we make them sorry for it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys at once thought of the long-ago mystery of the disappearance of the
Bartles. They felt quite uncomfortable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we’re going now, so don’t worry,’ said Julian. ‘We’re only camping for a night
or two, as I said. We won’t come near here again, if you object to us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
saw Sniffer creeping up behind the men, with I.iz, who for some reason of her
own, was walking sedately on her hind-legs. Sniffer pulled at his father’s arm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’re
all right,’ he said. ‘You know our Clip got his leg made better at the stables.
They’re all right!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>All
he got was a savage cuff that sent him to the ground, where he rolled over and
over. Liz dropped down on all fours and went to lick him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here,
I say!’ said Julian, shocked. ‘Leave that kid alone! You’ve no right to hit him
like that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sniffer
set up such a yelling that some of the women left the caravans not far off and
came running to see what was up. One of them began to shout at Sniffer’s father
and he shouted back. Soon there was quite a row going on between the men and
the angry women, one of whom had picked up poor Sniffer and was dabbing his
head with a wet cloth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on, it’s a good time to go,’ said Julian to Dick. ‘What an unfriendly lot they
are, except poor Sniffer, and he was doing his best for us, poor kid.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two boys went off quickly, glad to be away from the men and their dogs. They
were puzzled about everything. The men said they knew nothing about the lamp,
but they must know something about it. Nobody but a gypsy could have lighted it
last night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went back to the girls and told them what had happened. ‘Let’s get back to the
stables,’ said Anne. ‘There’s something queer going on. We’ll be in the middle
of an adventure before we know where we are!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
stay one more night,’ said Julian. ‘I want to see if that plane comes again.
Those gypsies don’t know where we’re camping and though Sniffer knows, I’m
pretty sure he won’t tell. It was plucky of him to try and stick up for us to
his father.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right. We’ll stay,’ said George. ‘I’m not particularly anxious for Timmy to
have that long walk home today. I think I’ve got most of that thorn out of his
pad, but he still won’t put his foot to the ground.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
jolly clever at running about on three legs,’ said Dick, watching Timmy tearing
round the quarry, sniffing as usual for rabbits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
amount of quarrying that Timmy has done in this pit already is colossal!’ said
Julian, staring round at the places where Timmy had tried to get in at some
rabbit-hole and scrabbled out big heaps of sand. ‘He would have been a great
help to the Bartles when they dug out sand! Poor old Tim - your bad foot has
stopped you scraping for rabbits, hasn’t it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
ran over on three legs. He enjoyed all the fussing he got when anything
happened to him. He meant to make the most of his bad foot!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had a very lazy day indeed. It really was too hot to do anything much. They
went to the little spring and sat with their feet in the rivulet it made - it
was deliciously cool! They went and had a look at the old engine again, lying
on its side, half-buried.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
scraped away a lot of the sand that had seeped into the cab. Soon they were all
helping. They uncovered the old handles and levers and tried to move them. But
they couldn’t of course.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
go round to the other side of the gorse bush and see if we can see the funnel
again,’ said Dick, at last. ‘Blow these thorns. I’m getting pricked all over.
Timmy’s very sensible, sitting there, not attempting to examine this old
Puffing Billy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had to cut away some of the gorse before they could examine the funnel
properly. Then they exclaimed in wonder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look!
It’s very like the long funnel that Puffing Billy had, you know, one of the
first engines ever made!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
filled with sand,’ said Dick, and tried to scrape it out. It was fairly loose,
and soon he was able to peer down the funnel quite a long way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Funny
to think of smoke puffing out of this queer old funnel,’ said Dick. ‘Poor old
engine, lying here for years, quite forgotten. I’d have thought someone would
rescue it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you know what the blacksmith told us,’ said George. ‘The Bartle sister that was
left wouldn’t have anything more to do with the railway or the engine or the
quarry. And certainly nobody could move this great thing on their own.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
shouldn’t be surprised if we’re the only people in the world who know where the
old engine is,’ said Anne. ‘It’s so overgrown that nobody could see it except
by accident!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
feel jolly hungry, all of a sudden,’ said Dick, stopping his work of getting
sand off the engine. ‘What about something to eat?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ve
got enough to last for a day or two more,’ said Anne. ‘Then we’ll have to get
something else - or go back to the stables.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
must spend one more night here,’ said Julian. ‘I want to see if that plane
returns again.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right.
We’ll all watch this time,’ said George. ‘It will be fun. Come on, let’s go and
get something to eat. Don’t you think that’s a good idea, Timmy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
certainly did. He limped off at top speed on three legs, though really his
right fore-paw no longer hurt him. Timmy, you’re a fraud!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>No
gypsies came near them that day, not even Sniffer. The evening was as lovely as
the day had been, and almost as warm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
extraordinary!’ said Dick, looking up into the sky. ‘What weather for April!
The bluebells will be rushing out soon if the sun goes on being as hot as
this!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
lay on the sand in the quarry and watched the evening star shine in the sky. It
looked very big and bright and round.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
scrabbled round in the sand. ‘His paw is much better,’ said George. ‘Though I
notice that he still sometimes holds it up.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Only
when he wants you to say “Poor Timmy, does it hurt!” ’ said Dick. ‘He’s a baby,
likes to be fussed!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
talked for a while and then Anne yawned. ‘It’s early, I know - but I believe
I’m going to sleep.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was soon a trek to the spring, and everyone sluiced themselves in the cool
water. There was only one towel between them, but that did very well. Then they
settled down in their sandy beds. The sand was beautifully warm and they did
not bother about putting down the rubber sheets. There could not possibly be
any dampness in that quarry after it had been baked so much by the hot sun!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hope we wake when that plane comes, if it does come,’ said Julian to Dick, as
they lay without any covering in their soft, sandy bed. ‘My goodness, isn’t it
hot! No wonder Timmy’s panting over there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went to sleep at last, but Dick awoke suddenly, feeling much too hot. Phew!
What a night! He lay looking up at the brilliant stars, and then shut his eyes
again. But it was no use, he couldn’t go to sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
sat up cautiously, so as not to awake Julian. I think I’ll just go and have a
squint to see if that big lamp is lighted again, down in that pit by the gypsy
camp, he thought.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went to the edge of the quarry and climbed up. He looked towards the gypsy camp
and gave a sudden exclamation. Yes! he thought. It’s glowing again! I can’t see
the lamp, of course, but its light is so jolly powerful that I can easily see
the glow it makes. It must be very bright, looked down on from the sky. I
wonder if the plane is due to come now that the lamp is lighted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
listened, and yes, he could distinctly hear a low humming noise from the east.
It must be the plane coming again? Would it land this time, and if so, who was
in it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
ran to wake Julian and the girls. Timmy was alert at once, wagging his tail
excitedly. He was always ready for anything, even in the middle of the night!
Anne and George got up too, very thrilled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
the lamp really alight again? And I can hear the plane too now! Oh, I say! This
is exciting! George, Timmy won’t bark and give us away, will he?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
I’ve told him to be quiet,’ said George. ‘He won’t make a sound. Listen, the
plane is coming nearer!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
noise was now loud enough for them to search the starry sky for the plane.
Julian gave Dick a nudge. ‘Look, you can just see it, straight over where the
gypsy camp is!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
managed to pick it out. ‘It’s very small,’ he said. ‘Smaller even than I
thought it was last night. Look, it’s coming down!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it wasn’t. It merely swept low, and then went round in a circle, as it had done
the night before. It rose a little again and then came in low once more, almost
over the boys’ heads.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
something extraordinary happened. Something fell not far from Julian, something
that bounced and then came to rest! It made a thud as it fell, and all four
jumped. Timmy gave a startled whine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thud!
Something else fell. Thud, thud, thud! Anne gave a squeal. ‘Are they trying to
bomb us or something. Julian, what are they doing?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Thud!
Thud! Julian ducked at the last two thuds, they sounded so near. He took hold
of Anne and pulled her down into the quarry, calling to Dick and George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Get
down here, quickly! Force yourselves into the caves somewhere! We shall get
hit!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
ran across the quarry as the plane swooped round in a circle once more and then
again began dropping the things that went ‘thud! thud!’. Some even fell into
the quarry this time. Timmy got the shock of his life when one bounced in front
of his nose and rolled away. He yelped and tore after George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
they were all safely squeezed into the little caves that lined the sides of the
quarry. The plane swept round once more, up and then round, and the
thud-thudding began again. The four could hear that some of the thuds were
actually in the quarry again and they were thankful they were well sheltered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
nothing is exploding,’ said Dick, thankfully. ‘But what on earth is the plane
dropping? And why? This is a most peculiar adventure to have.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
probably a dream,’ said Julian, and laughed. ‘No, not even a dream could be so
mad. Here we are, snuggling into sandy caves in a quarry on Mystery Moor, while
a plane drops something all round us in the middle of the night! Quite mad.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
believe the plane’s going away now,’ said Dick. ‘It’s circled round but hasn’t
dropped anything. Now it’s climbing, it’s going away! The engine doesn’t sound
nearly so loud. Goodness, when we were standing out there at the edge of the
quarry, I almost thought the plane would take my head off; it was so low!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
thought that too,’ said Anne, very glad that there was to be no more swooping
down and dropping dozens of unknown things. ‘Is it safe to go out?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes,’ said Julian, scrambling out of the sand. ‘Come on. We shall easily hear
if the plane comes back again. I want to see what it has dropped!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
great excitement they ran to get the parcels. The stars gave so much light on
that clear night that the four did not even need a torch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
picked up something first. It was a firm, flattish parcel, done up well, sewn
into a canvas covering. He examined it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
name. Nothing,’ he said. ‘This is most exciting. Let’s have three guesses
what’s inside.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Bacon
for breakfast, I hope!’ said Anne at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Idiot,’
said Julian, getting out a knife to slit the string threads that sewed up the
canvas. ‘I guess it’s smuggled goods of some sort. That’s what that plane was
doing, I should think, flying over from France, and dropping smuggled goods in
a pre-arranged place, and I suppose the gypsies pick them up, and take them
away, well hidden in their caravans, to deliver them somewhere. Very clever!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
Julian, is that the explanation?’ said Anne. ‘What would be in the parcels
then, cigarettes?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said Julian. ‘The parcels wouldn’t be so heavy if they only contained
cigarettes. There, I’ve slit the threads at last!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others crowded round to see. George took her torch out of her pocket so that
they could see really well. She flashed it on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
ripped off the canvas covering. Next came some strong brown paper. He ripped
that off too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
came strong cardboard, tied round with string. That was undone as well, and the
cardboard fell to the ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now,
what have we got?’ said Julian, excited. ‘Thin sheets of paper, dozens and
dozens of them packed together. Shine your torch nearer, George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a silence as all the four craned over Julian’s hands.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Whew!
I say! Gosh, do you see what they are?’ said Julian, in awe. ‘American money,
dollar notes. But look what they are, one hundred-dollar notes! And my word
there are scores and scores of them in this one packet.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four stared in amazement as Julian riffled through the packet of notes. However
much would they be worth?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian,
how much is a hundred-dollar note worth in our money?’ asked George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘About
forty pounds I think’ said Julian. ‘Yes, just about that. Gosh, and there are
scores in this one packet, and we know they dropped dozens of the packets too.
Whatever is it all about?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
there must be thousands and thousands of dollars lying around us, here in the
quarry and outside it,’ said George. ‘I say! Surely this isn’t a dream?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I must say it’s a very extravagant kind of dream, if so,’ said Dick. ‘A dream
worth thousands of pounds isn’t very usual. Ju, hadn’t we better get busy
picking up these parcels?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
We certainly had,’ said Julian. ‘I’m beginning to see it all now. The smugglers
come over in a plane from France, say, having previously arranged to drop these
packets in a lonely spot on this moor. The gypsies are in the plot to the
extent that they light the guiding lamp and pick up the parcels.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
see, and then they quietly pack them into their caravans, slip off the moor,
and deliver them to somebody else, who pays them well for their trouble,’ said
Dick. ‘Very smart!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
about it,’ said Julian. ‘But I can’t for the life of me see why dollar notes
have to be smuggled here. They can be brought freely enough into the country -
why smuggle them?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Stolen
ones, perhaps?’ said George. ‘Oh well, its quite beyond me. What a thing to do!
No wonder the gypsies didn’t want us around.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Better
buck up and collect all these parcels and clear off back to the stables with
them,’ said Julian, picking up one near him. ‘The gypsies will be after them,
there’s no doubt about that! We must be gone before they come.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four of them went about looking for the parcels. They found about sixty of
them, and they made quite a heavy load.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
put them somewhere safe, I think,’ said Julian. ‘What about stuffing them into
one of the sand-caves? I don’t very well see how we can carry them like this.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
could put them in the rugs and tie up the ends and carry them like that,’ said
George. ‘It would be mad to leave them hidden somewhere in this quarry. It’s
the first place the gypsies would search.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right. We’ll follow your idea,’ said Julian. ‘I think we’ve about collected all
the packets there are. Get the rugs.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George’s
idea proved to be a good one, Half the parcels were rolled into one rug, and
tied up, and half into the other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
thing the rugs are nice and big,’ said Dick tying his up strongly. ‘Now I can
just about manage mine nicely on my back. You all right, Ju?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
come along, you girls,’ said Julian. ‘Follow behind us. We’ll go down the
railway line. Leave everything else here. We can easily get it another time. We
must leave before the gypsies come.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
began to bark suddenly. ‘That must mean the gypsies are coming,’ said Dick.
‘Come on, quick! Yes I can hear their voices - for goodness’ sake, HURRY!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yes,
the gypsies were certainly coming! Their dogs were with them, barking. The four
children hurried out of the quarry with Timmy at their heels, quite silent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Those
fellows may not know we were camping in the quarry,’ panted Dick. ‘They may
just be coming to find the parcels, and while they are hunting around, we may
be able to get a good start. Buck up!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
set off to where the lines ended, near where the old engine lay half-buried.
The gypsy dogs heard them and set up a yelping and howling. The gypsies stopped
to see what had excited them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
spied shadows moving in the distance, the four children slipping away from the
quarry. One of the men shouted loudly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hey
you - stop! Who are you? Stop, I say!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the five didn’t stop. They were now stumbling between the railway lines, glad
of George’s torch, and Anne’s. The boys could not have held one for it was all
they could do to hang on to the heavy-laden rugs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Quick,
oh quick!’ whispered Anne, but it was impossible to go very quickly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
must be catching us up,’ said Julian, suddenly. ‘Look round and see, George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
looked round. ‘No, I can’t see anyone,’ she said. ‘Julian, everywhere looks
peculiar. What’s happening? Julian, stop. Something queer is happening!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
stopped and looked round. His eyes had been fixed on his feet, trying to see where
he was going without stumbling. Anne had shone her torch down for him but it
was still dificult to get along properly. Julian gazed all round, wondering
what George meant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
he gave a gasp. ‘Gosh! How queer! There’s a mist come up, look. It’s even
blotted out the stars. No wonder it seems so jolly dark all of a sudden.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
mist!’ said Anne, scared. ‘Not that awful mist that sometimes covers the moor!
Oh Julian, is it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and Dick watched the swirling mist in astonishment. ‘It’s come from the sea,’
Julian said. ‘Can’t you smell the salt in it? It’s come just as suddenly as
we’ve been told it comes, and look, it’s getting thicker every minute!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
a good thing we’re on the railway lines!’ said George. ‘What shall we do? Go
on?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
stood and thought. ‘The gypsies won’t come after us in this mist,’ he said.
‘I’ve a good mind to hide this money somewhere, and then walk back to get the
police. If we keep on the lines we can’t go wrong. But we must be sure not to
leave them, or we’ll be completely lost!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
let’s do that,’ said Dick, who was heartily sick already of lugging along his
heavy load. ‘But where do you propose to hide them, Ju? Not in the quarry! We’d
have to walk through this awful mist to do that, and we’d get lost at once.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
I’ve thought of a fine place,’ said Julian, and he lowered his voice. ‘Remember
that old engine, fallen on its side? Well, what about stuffing these packets
all the way down that great long funnel, and then stopping the top of it up
with sand? I bet you anything you like that nobody would find the packets
there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Grand
idea!’ said Dick. ‘The gypsies will be sure we’ve gone off carrying the money,
and they’ll not hunt about for it long, once they find the dropped packets are
all gone. We’ll be half-way home by the time they try to catch us, if they dare
to brave this mist.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
and George thought Julian’s idea was first-rate, a stroke of genius. ‘I’d
never, never have thought of the engine funnel!’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now,
there’s no need for you two girls and Timmy to walk all the way to the engine
with us,’ said Julian. ‘You sit down here on the lines, and wait for us to come
back. We shan’t be long. We’ll walk straight up the railway, find the engine,
pack the money into the funnel, and walk back.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said George, squatting down. ‘Bring the rugs back with you, though. It’s cold
now!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and Dick went off together, with Anne’s torch. George kept hers. Timmy pressed
close against her, astonished at the thick mist that had so suddenly swirled up
and around them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
right. Keep close to us and keep us warm, Tim,’ said George. ‘It’s jolly cold
now. This mist is damp!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
stumbled along, keeping a look-out for the gypsies. He could see nothing of
them, but then, if they had been only two feet away he could not have seen
anything of them in the mist! It seemed to get thicker and thicker.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
know what old Ben meant now, when he said that it had damp fingers, thought
Julian, feeling little touches like fingers on his face, hands and legs as the
mist wreathed itself round him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
nudged him. ‘Here we are,’ he said. ‘The lines are broken here. The engine
should be just over there, a yard or two away.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
stepped cautiously away from the lines. The big gorse-bush could not be seen,
but it could be felt! Julian felt thorns pricking his legs, and knew he was
beside it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shine
your torch here, Dick,’ he whispered. ‘That’s right. There’s the cab of the
engine, see? Now let’s circle the bush, and we’ll come to the funnel.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here
it is,’ said Dick, in a few moments. ‘Look! Now then, let’s do a bit of work,
shoving these packets down. Gosh, what a lot of them there are! I hope the
funnel will take them all.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
spent ten minutes ramming the packets into the wide funnel. Down they went to
the bottom! More and more followed and then, at last, the final one was shoved
in and rammed down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
the lot,’ said Dick, relieved. ‘Now we’ll pack some sand in. Gosh, isn’t this
bush full of prickles! It’s really spiteful!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
packets almost fill the funnel,’ said Julian. ‘Hardly any room for sand. Still,
we can put in enough to hide the money all right. There that’s done. Now pull
this gorse-branch over the top of the funnel. My word, I never knew a bush so
set with spines! I’m scratched to bits!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Can
you hear anything of the gypsies?’ asked Dick, in a low voice, as they prepared
to go back to the lines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
listened. ‘Not a thing,’ said Julian. ‘It’s my belief they’re scared of this
mist, and are lying low till it clears.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
may be in the quarry,’ said Dick. ‘Waiting there in safety. Well, long may they
be there! They won’t get the money now!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on,’ said Julian, and walked round the bush. ‘It’s just about here that we step
out to get to the lines. Take my arm. We mustn’t get separated. Did you ever
see such a mist in your life? It’s the thickest fog I ever knew. We can’t even
see our feet in the light of the torch now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
took a few steps and then felt about for the rails. They couldn’t feel even
one. ‘A bit farther, I think,’ said Julian. ‘No, this way.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
they still couldn’t find the railway lines. Where were the wretched things? A
small feeling of panic came into Julian’s mind. Which way should they step now,
to find the rails? How had they gone wrong?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
both boys were on hands and knees, feeling for the broken rails. ‘I’ve got
one,’ said Dick. ‘No, blow, it isn’t. It’s a bit of wood, or something. For
goodness’ sake, keep close to me, Ju.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
ten minutes’ search, the two boys sat back on their heels, the little torch
between them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Somehow
we’ve just missed those two or three correct steps from the gorse-bush to the
rails,’ said Julian. ‘Now we’re done! I don’t see anything for it but to wait
till the mist clears.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
what about the two girls?’ said Dick, anxiously. ‘Let’s try a bit longer. Look,
the mist is clearing a little there. Let’s go forward and hope we’ll stumble
over the lines soon. If the mist does clear, we shall soon be able to get our
bearings.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
they went forward hopefully, seeing the mist clear a little in front of them,
so that the torch made a longer beam for them to see by. Now and again, when
their feet knocked against something hard, they felt for the rails. But they
could not find even one!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
shout,’ said Julian, at last. So they shouted loudly. ‘George! Anne! Can you
hear us?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
stood and listened. No answer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘GEORGE!’
yelled Dick. ‘TIMMY!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
thought they heard a far-off bark. ‘That was Timmy!’ said Julian. ‘Over there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
stumbled along and then shouted again. But this time there was no bark at all.
Not a sound came out of that dreadful mist, which had now closed tightly round
them again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
be walking in it all night long,’ said Julian, desperately. ‘Why did we leave
the girls? Suppose this frightful fog doesn’t clear by tomorrow? Sometimes it
lasts for days.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
a horrible idea,’ said Dick, lightly, sounding much more cheerful than he felt.
‘I don’t think we need worry about the girls, Ju. Timmy’s with them and he can
easily take them back to the stables across the moor, in the mist. Dogs don’t
mind fogs.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
felt most relieved. He hadn’t thought of that. ‘Oh yes, I’d forgotten old Tim,’
he said. ‘Well, seeing that the girls will probably be all right with Timmy to
guide them, let’s sit down somewhere and have a rest. I’m tired out!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here’s
a good thick bush,’ said Dick. ‘Let’s get into the middle of it if we can, and
keep the damp out of us. Thank goodness it’s not a gorse-bush!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wish I knew if the girls had had the sense not to wait for us any longer, but
to try to find their way back down the lines,’ said Julian. ‘I wonder where
they are now?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
and George were no longer where Julian and Dick had left them! They had waited
and waited, and then had become very anxious indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Something’s
happened,’ said George. ‘I think we ought to go and get help, Anne. We can
easily follow the railway down to where we have to break off for the stable.
Timmy will know, anyway. Don’t you think we ought to go back and get help?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
I do,’ said Anne, getting up. ‘Come on George. Gosh, this mist is worse than
ever! We’ll have to be careful we don’t lose the lines! Even Timmy might find
it hard to smell his way in this fog!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
got up. Anne followed George and Timmy followed behind, looking puzzled. He
couldn’t understand this night-time wandering about at all!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
and George kept closely to the railway lines, walking slowly along, shining the
light of the torch downwards, and following carefully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
a time George stopped, puzzled. ‘This line’s broken here,’ she said. ‘There’s
no more of it. That’s funny, I don’t remember it being as badly broken as this,
The lines simply stop. I can’t see any more.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
George!’ said Anne, peering down. ‘Do you know what we’ve done. We’ve come all
the way up the lines again - instead of going down them, homewards! How could
we have been so mad? Look, this is where they break off; so the old engine must
be somewhere near, and the quarry!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Blow!’
said George, quite in despair. ‘What asses we are. It shows how we can lose our
sense of direction in a mist like this.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can’t see or hear anything of the boys,’ said Anne, fearfully. ‘George, let’s
go to the quarry and wait there till daylight comes. I’m cold and tired. We can
squeeze into one of those warm sand-caves.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right,’ said George, very much down in the dumps. ‘Come along, and for
goodness’ sake don’t let’s lose our way to the quarry!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two girls and Timmy made their way carefully, hoping to come across the lines
that led to the quarry. They were lucky. They went across the gap in the lines
where once long ago the gypsies had wrenched out the rails, and came to where
they began again, and led to the edge of the quarry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here
they are!’ said George, thankfully. ‘Now we’re all right. We’ve only just got
to follow these and we’ll be in the quarry. I hope it will be warmer than here.
Brrrr! This mist is terribly cold and clammy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
came up so suddenly,’ said Anne, shining her torch downwards. ‘I couldn’t
believe my eyes when I looked round and saw it creeping up on us. I...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
stopped suddenly. Timmy had given a low growl. ‘What’s up, Tim?’ whispered
George. He stood quite still, his hackles up and his tail motionless. He looked
steadfastly into the mist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
dear. What can be the matter now?’ whispered Anne. ‘I can’t hear a thing, can
you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
listened. No, there was nothing to hear at all. They went on into the quarry,
thinking that Timmy might have heard a rabbit or hedgehog, and growled at it as
he sometimes did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
heard a sound and ran to the side, lost in the mist at once. He suddenly yelped
loudly, then there was a heavy thud, and no more sound from Timmy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy!
What’s happened! Timmy, come here!’ shouted George, at the top of her voice.
But no Timmy came. The girls heard the sound of something heavy being dragged
away, and George ran after the sound.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy!
Oh Timmy, what’s happened!’ she cried. ‘Where are you? Are you hurt?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
mist swirled round, and she tried to beat against it with her fists, angry that
she could not see. ‘Tim! Tim!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
a pair of hands took her arms from behind and a voice said, ‘Now you come with
me! You were warned not to snoop about on the moor!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
struggled violently, less concerned for herself than for Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Where’s
my dog?’ she cried. ‘What have you done to him?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
knocked him on the head,’ said the voice, which sounded very like Sniffer’s
father. ‘He’s all right, but he won’t feel himself for a bit! You can have him
back if you’re sensible.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
wasn’t sensible. She kicked and fought and wriggled and struggled. It was no
use. She was held in a grip like iron. She heard Anne scream once and knew that
she had been caught too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
George was too tired to struggle any more, she was led firmly out of the quarry
with Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
my dog?’ she sobbed. ‘What have you done with him?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
all right,’ said the man behind her. ‘But if you make any more fuss I’ll give
him another blow on the head. NOW will you be quiet.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was quiet at once. She was taken with Anne across the moor for what seemed like
miles, but was really only the fairly short distance between the quarry and the
gypsies’ camp.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Are
you bringing my dog?’ asked George, unable to contain her fears about Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
Somebody’s got him,’ said her captor. ‘You shall have him back safe and sound,
if you do what you’re told!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
had to be content with that. What a night! The boys gone, Timmy hurt, she and
Anne captured, and this horrible, wreathing mist all the time!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
mist cleared a little as they came near to the gypsy camp. The hill behind
seemed to keep it off. George and Anne saw the light of a fire, and of a few
lanterns here and there. More men were gathered together, waiting. Anne thought
she could see Sniffer and Liz in the background but she couldn’t be sure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
only I could get hold of Sniffer,’ she thought. ‘He would soon find out if
Timmy is really hurt. Oh Sniffer, do come nearer if it’s you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Their
captors took them to the little fire, and made both girls sit down. One of the
men there exclaimed in surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
these are not those two boys! This is a boy and a girl, not as tall as the
others were!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’re
two girls,’ said Anne, thinking that the men might treat George less roughly if
they knew she was not a boy. ‘I’m a girl and so is she.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
got a scowl from George, but took no notice. This was not the time to pretend
anything. These men were ruthless, and very angry. They thought their plans had
gone wrong, all because of two boys. Perhaps when they found they had got two
girls, they would let them go.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
men began to question them. ‘Where are the boys then?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ve
no idea! Lost in the mist,’ said Anne. ‘We all went out to go back home, and
got separated, so George, I mean Georgina, and I went back to the quarry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Did
you hear the plane?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Did
you see or hear it dropping anything?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
didn’t see anything drop, we heard it,’ said Anne. George stared at her
furiously. Why was Anne giving all this away? Perhaps she thought that Timmy
would be given back to them if they proved helpful? George immediately changed
her mind about feeling cross with Anne. If only Timmy were all right!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Did
you pick up what the plane dropped?’ The man rapped out the question so sharply
that Anne humped. What should she say?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes,’ she heard herself saying. ‘We picked up a few queer parcels. What was in
them, do you know?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Never
you mind,’ said the man. ‘What did you do with the parcels?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
stared at Anne, wondering what she was going to say. Surely, surely she wouldn’t
give that secret away?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
didn’t do anything with them,’ said Anne, in an innocent voice. ‘The boys said
they would hide them. So they went off into the mist with them, but they didn’t
come back. So George and I went to the quarry again. That’s when you caught
us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
men talked among themselves in low voices. Then Sniffer’s father turned to the
girls again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
did the boys hide these packets?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
do I know?’ said Anne. ‘I didn’t go with them. I didn’t see what they did with
them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
you think they will still have got them with them?’ asked the man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
don’t you go and find the boys and ask them?’ said Anne. ‘I haven’t seen or
heard of the boys since they left us and went into the mist. I don’t know what
became of them or the parcels!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’re
probably lost somewhere on the moors,’ said the old, grey-haired gypsy. ‘With
the packets! We’ll look for the boys tomorrow. They won’t get home in this!
We’ll fetch them back here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
wouldn’t come,’ said George. ‘As soon as they saw you, they’d run. You’d never
catch them. Any way they’d get back home as soon as the mist cleared.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Take
these girls away,’ said the old gypsy, sounding tired of them. ‘Put them in the
far cave, and tie them up.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
my dog?’ shouted George, suddenly. ‘You bring me my dog!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
haven’t been very helpful,’ said the old gypsy. ‘We’ll question you again
tomorrow, and if you are more helpful, you shall have your dog.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Two
men took the girls away from the fire and over to the hill. A large opening led
into the queer hill. One of the men had a lantern and led the way, the other
man walking behind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
passage led straight into the hill. There was sand underfoot, and it seemed to
Anne as if even the walls were made of sand. How strange!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
hill was honeycombed with passages. They criss-crossed and forked like burrows
in a rabbit-warren. Anne wondered however the men could find their way!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came at last to a cave that must have been right in the heart of the hill, a
cave with a sandy floor, and a post that was driven deeply into the ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ropes
were fastened firmly to it. The two girls looked at them in dismay. Surely they
were not going to be tied up like prisoners!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
they were! The ropes were fastened firmly round their waists and knotted at the
back. The knots were gypsy knots, firm, tight and complicated. It would take
the girls hours to unpick those, even supposing they could manage to reach
right round to their backs!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
you are,’ said the men, grinning at the two angry girls. ‘Maybe in the morning
you will remember where those packets were put?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
go and get my dog,’ ordered George. But they only laughed loudly and went out
of the cave.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was stuffy and hot in there. George was worried to death about Timmy, but Anne
was almost too tired to think.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
fell asleep, sitting up uncomfortably with the ropes round her waist, and the
knots digging into her back. George sat brooding. Timmy - where was he? Was he
badly hurt? George was very miserable indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
didn’t go to sleep. She sat there, worrying, wide awake. She made an attempt to
get at the knots behind her, but it was no use, she couldn’t.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly
she thought she heard a noise. Was that someone creeping up the passage to the
cave? She felt frightened. Oh, if only Timmy were here!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sniff!
Sniff!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gracious
goodness, it must be Sniffer!’ thought George, and at that moment she almost
loved the dirty little gypsy boy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sniffer!’
she called quietly, and put on her torch. Sniffer’s head appeared and then his
body. He was crawling quietly up the passage on all fours.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
came right into the cave, and stared at her and the sleeping Anne. ‘I’ve
sometimes been tied up here too,’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sniffer,
how is Timmy?’ asked George, anxiously. ‘Tell me, quickly!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
all right,’ said Sniffer. ‘He’s just got a bad cut on his head. I bathed it for
him. He’s tied up too, and he’s mad about it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sniffer,
listen, go and get Timmy and bring him to me,’ said George, breathlessly. ‘And
bring me a knife too, to cut these ropes. Will you? Can you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oooh,
I dunno,’ said Sniffer, looking frightened. ‘My father would half kill me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sniffer,
is there anything you want, anything you’ve always wanted?’ said George. ‘I’ll
give it to you if you do this for me. I promise you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
want a bike,’ said Sniffer, surprisingly. ‘And I want to live in a house, and
ride my bike to school.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
see that you have what you want, Sniffer,’ said George, wildly. ‘Only, do, do
go and get Timmy, and a knife! You got here without being seen, you can surely
get back again safely with Timmy. Think of that bike!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sniffer
thought of it. Then he nodded and disappeared down the passage as silently as
he had come.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
waited and waited. Would he bring dear old Timmy to her, or would he be caught?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
sat in the darkness of the cave, hearing Anne’s peaceful breathing nearby,
waiting for Sniffer to come back. She was longing to see Timmy again. Was the
cut on his head very bad?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
thought came into her mind. She would send Timmy back to the stables with a
note! He was very clever, he knew what to do when he had a note tied to his
collar. Then help would come very quickly indeed. Timmy would know his way all
right out of this hill, once he had been in it!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ah,
here was Sniffer coming back again. Was Timmy with him? She heard Sniffer’s
sniff-sniff-sniff, but no sound of Timmy. Her heart sank.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sniffer
appeared cautiously in the cave.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
didn’t dare to take Timmy,’ he said. ‘My father has him tied up too near to
him, and I’d have waked him. But I’ve brought you a knife, look.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thank
you, Sniffer,’ said George, taking the knife and putting it into her pocket.
‘Listen, there’s something important I’m going to do and you’ve got to help.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
scared,’ said Sniffer. ‘I’m real scared.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Think
of that bicycle,’ said George. ‘A red one, perhaps, with silver handles?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sniffer
thought of it. ‘All right,’ he said. ‘What are you going to do?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
going to write a note,’ said George, feeling in her pocket for her note-book
and pencil. ‘And I want you to tie it on to Timmy’s collar, under his chin, and
set him free somehow. Will you do that? He’ll run off back to the stables with
the note, and then Anne and I will be rescued, and you will get the most
beautiful bicycle in the world!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
a house to live in,’ said Sniffer, at once. ‘So’s I can ride my bike to
school?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right,’ said George, hoping that somehow he could have that too. ‘Now, wait a
minute.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
scribbled the note, but she had hardly written more than a few words, when a
sound came up the passage. Someone was coughing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
my father!’ said Sniffer, in fright. ‘Listen, if you cut your ropes and escape,
can you find your way out from here? It’s very twisty and turny.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know. I don’t think I can!’ whispered George, in a panic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
leave patrins for you!’ said Sniffer. ‘Look out for them! Now I’m going to slip
into the cave next door, and wait till my father’s finished talking to you.
Then I’ll go back to Timmy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
slipped out just in time. The lantern shone into George’s cave and Sniffer’s
father stood there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Have
you seen Sniffer?’ he asked. ‘I missed him when I woke just now. If I catch him
in here I’ll whip him till he squeals.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sniffer?
He’s not here,’ said George, trying to sound surprised. ‘Look round the cave
and see!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
man caught sight of the note-book and pencil in George’s hand. ‘What’s that
you’re writing?’ he said suspiciously and took it from her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
you’re writing for help, are you!’ he said. ‘And how do you think you’re going
to get help. I’d like to know? Who’s going to take this note home for you?
Sniffer?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said George, truthfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
man frowned as he looked again at the note. ‘Look here,’ he said, ‘you can
write another note, to those two boys. And I’ll tell you what to say.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes, you will,’ said the man. ‘I’m not going to hurt those boys. I’m just going
to get back those packets from wherever they are hidden. Do you want your dog
back safely?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said George, with a gulp.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
if you don’t write this note you won’t see him again,’ said the man. ‘Now then,
take your pencil and write in that note-book of yours.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
took up her pencil. ‘This is what you must write,’ said the man, frowning as he
thought hard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wait
a minute,’ said George. ‘How are you going to get this note to the boys? You
don’t know where they are! You won’t be able to find them if this mist still
goes on.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
man scratched his head and thought.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
only way to get the note to them is to tie it on my dog’s collar and send him to
find them,’ said George. ‘If you bring him here to me I can make him
understand. He always does what I tell him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
mean he’ll take the note to whoever you tell him to take it?’ said the man, his
eyes gleaming. ‘Well, write it then. Say this:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘
“We are prisoners. Follow Timmy and he will bring you to us and you can save
us.” Then sign your name, whatever it is.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
Georgina,’ said George, firmly. ‘You go and get my dog while I write the note.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
man turned and went. George looked after him her eyes bright. He thought he was
making her play a trick on Julian and Dick, to bring them here so that they
could be threatened and questioned about the packets, and where they were
hidden!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
I’m going to play a trick on him,’ thought George. ‘I’m going to tell Timmy to
take the note to Henry, and she’ll be suspicious and get Captain Johnson to
follow Tim back here, and that will give the gypsies an awful shock! I expect
the Captain will be sensible enough to get the police as well. Aha, I’m playing
a trick too!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
ten minutes’ time Sniffer’s father returned with Timmy. It was a rather subdued
Timmy, with a very bad cut on his head, which really needed stitching. He
pattered soberly across to George, and she flung her arms round his neck and
cried into his thick hair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Does
your head hurt you?’ she said. ‘I’ll take you to the vet when I get back, Tim.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
can get back as soon as we’ve got those two boys here and they’ve told us where
those packets are hidden,’ said the man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was licking George as if he would never stop, and his tail waved to and fro, to
and fro. He couldn’t understand what was happening at all! Why was George here?
Never mind, he was with her again. He settled down on the floor with a thump
and put his head on her knee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Write
the note,’ said the man, ‘and tie it on to his collar, on the top, so that it
can easily be seen.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
written it,’ said George. The gypsy held out a dirty hand for it and read it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
that really your name, Georgina?’ asked the man. George nodded. It was one of
the few times she ever owned to a girl’s name!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
tied the note firmly to Timmy’s collar, on the top of his neck. It was quite
plainly to be seen. Then she gave him a hug and spoke urgently to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Go
to Henry, Tim, go to HENRY. Do you understand, Timmy dear, take this note to
HENRY.’ She tapped the paper on his collar as he listened to her. Then she gave
him a push. ‘Go along. Don’t stay here any longer. Go and find HENRY.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hadn’t
you better tell him the other boy’s name too?’ said the man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no, I don’t want to muddle Timmy,’ said George hastily. ‘Henry, Henry, HENRY!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, and George knew that he understood. She gave him another push.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Go,
then,’ she said. ‘Hurry!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
gave her rather a reproachful look as if to say, ‘You haven’t let me stay with
you very long!’ Then he padded off down the passage, the note showing clearly
on his collar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
bring the boys up here as soon as they come with the dog,’ said the man, and he
turned on his heel, and went out. George wondered if Sniffer was still about
and she called him. But there was no answer. He must have slipped away down the
passages back to his caravan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
woke up then, and wondered where she was. George switched on her torch again
and explained all that had happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
should have wakened me,’ said Anne. ‘Oh blow these ropes. They’re so
uncomfortable.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
got a knife now,’ said George. ‘Sniffer gave it to me. Shall I cut our ropes?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes!’ said Anne, in delight. ‘But don’t let’s try and escape yet. It’s still
night-time and if that mist is about, we’ll only get lost. We can pretend we’re
still tied up if anyone comes.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
cut her own ropes with Sniffer’s exceedingly blunt knife. Then she cut Anne’s.
Oh, what a relief to lie down properly, and not to have to sit up all the time
and feel the knots at the back!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
do remember, if we hear anyone coming, we must tie the ropes loosely round us,’
she said. ‘We will stay here till we know it’s day, and perhaps we can find out
if the mist is still about, or if it’s gone. If it’s gone, we’ll go.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
fell asleep on the sandy floor, both glad to lie down flat. Nobody came to
disturb them, and they slept on and on, tired out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Where
were the boys? Still under the bush, half-sleeping, half-waking, for they were
cold and uncomfortable. They hoped the girls were now safely at home. They must
have gone right down the railway, and made their way back to the stables,
thought Julian, every time he awoke. I do hope they are safe, and Timmy too.
Thank goodness he is with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timmy wasn’t with them, of course. He was padding across the misty moor all by
himself, puzzled, and with a badly-aching head. Why had George sent him to
Henry? He didn’t like Henry. He didn’t think that George did, either. And yet
she had sent him to find her. Very strange!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Still,
George had given him his orders, and he loved her and always obeyed her. He
padded over the heather and grass. He didn’t bother about keeping to the
railway line. He knew the way back without even thinking about it!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was still night, though soon the dawn would come. But the mist was so thick
that even the dawn would not be able to break through it. The sun would have to
remain hidden behind the thick swathes of mist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
came to the stables. He paused to remember which was Henry’s bedroom. Ah yes,
it was upstairs, next to the room that Anne and George had had.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
leapt into the kitchen through a window left open for the cat. He padded
upstairs and came to Henry’s room. He pushed at the door and it opened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
he went and put his paws on her bed. ‘Woof,’ he said in her ear. ‘Woof! Woof!
Woof!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Henry
had been fast asleep and snoring. She awoke with a tremendous jump when she
felt Timmy’s paw on her arm and heard his sharp little bark.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oooh!
What is it?’ she said, sitting up straight in bed and fumbling for her torch.
She was quite panic-stricken. She switched on the torch with trembling fingers
and then saw Timmy, his big brown eyes looking at her beseechingly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why,
Timmy!’ said Henry, in amazement, ‘Timmy! Whatever are you doing here? Have the
others come back? No, they couldn’t have, not in the middle of the night! Why
have you come then, Timmy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, trying to make her understand that he was bringing a message. Henry
put out her hand to pat his head, and suddenly caught sight of the paper tied
to his collar at the back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
this on your collar?’ she said, and reached out for it. ‘Why, it’s paper. Tied
on, too. It must be a message!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
untied the piece of paper and unrolled it. She read it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Henry
was astounded. She looked at Timmy and he looked back, wagging his tail. He
pawed at her arm impatiently. Henry read the note again. Then she pinched
herself to make sure she was not dreaming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oooh,
no, I’m awake all right,’ she said. ‘Timmy, is this note true? Are they
prisoners? And who does “we” mean? George and Anne, or the whole four? Oh,
Timmy, I do wish you could speak!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
wished the same! He pawed energetically at Henry. She suddenly saw the cut on
his head and was horrified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
hurt, Timmy! Oh, you poor, poor thing. Who did that to you? You ought to have
that wound seen to!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
certainly had a very outsize headache, but he couldn’t bother to think about
that. He gave a little whine and ran to the door and back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
I know you want me to follow you, but I’ve got to think,’ said Henry. ‘If
Captain Johnson was here I’d go and fetch him. But he’s away for the night,
Timmy. And I’m sure Mrs Johnson would have the fright of her life if I fetched
her. I simply don’t know what to do.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, scornfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
all very well to say “Woof” like that,’ said Henry, ‘but I’m not as brave as
you are. I pretend I am, Timmy, but I’m not really. I’m afraid of following
you! I’m afraid of going to find the others. I might be caught too. And there’s
a terrible mist, Timmy, you know.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Henry
slid out of bed, and Timmy looked suddenly hopeful. Was this silly girl going
to make up her mind at last?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy,
there’s no grown-up here tonight except Mrs Johnson, and I really can’t wake
her,’ said Henry. ‘She’s had such a very hard, busy day. I’m going to dress,
and then get William. He’s only eleven, I know, but he’s very sensible, and
he’s a boy. He’ll know what to do. I only pretend to be a boy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
dressed quickly in her riding things and then set off to William’s room. He
slept by himself across the landing. Henry walked in and switched on her torch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>William
awoke at once. ‘Who’s there?’ he demanded, sitting up at once. ‘What do you
want?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
me. Henry,’ said Henry. ‘William, a most extraordinary thing has happened.
Timmy has arrived in my room with a note on his collar. Read it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>William
took the note and read it. He was most astonished. ‘Look,’ he said, ‘George has
signed herself Georgina. She wouldn’t do that unless things were very urgent.
She never, never lets herself be called anything but George. We’ll have to
follow Tim and go, at once, too’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
I can’t walk miles in a mist over the moor,’ said Henry, in a panic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
don’t need to. We’ll saddle our horses and go on those,’ said William,
beginning to dress, and sounding very sensible indeed. ‘Timmy will lead the
way. You go and get the horses out. Do buck up, Henry. The others may be in
danger. You’re acting like a Henrietta!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
made Henry cross. She went out of the room at once and down into the yard. What
a pity Captain Johnson happened to be away just that night. He would have
decided everything at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Courage
came to her when she got the horses. They were surprised but quite willing to
go for a nighttime ride, even in this thick mist! William came up in a very
short time with Timmy behind him. Timmy was delighted to have William with him.
He liked him, but he was not very fond of Henry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
ran forward, just in front of the horses, and they followed behind. Both Henry
and William had excellent torches, and kept them shining downwards, so that
they should not miss Timmy. He did go out of sight once or twice, but came back
immediately, when he heard the horses stopping.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Over
the moor they rode. They didn’t follow the railway, of course. Timmy didn’t
need to. He knew the way perfectly!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Once
he stopped and sniffed the air. What had he smelt? Henry and William had no
idea, but Timmy was puzzled by what he had smelt on the misty air.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Surely
he had smelt the smell of the two boys, Julian and Dick? It had come on the air
for a moment or two, and Timmy was half-inclined to follow it and see if the
smell was right. Then he remembered George and Anne and went on through the
swirling mist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys were actually not very far away when Timmy smelt them. They were still in
the middle of the bush, trying to keep warm, and sleep. If only they had known
that Timmy was near, with Henry and William! But they didn’t.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
led the way. Soon they came to the quarry, but did not see it because of the
mist. They went round it, led by Timmy, and rode towards the gypsy camp. Timmy
slowed down, and they took warning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
getting near wherever he wants to take us,’ whispered William. ‘Had we better
dismount and tie the horses up, do you think? Their hooves may give a warning
that we are near.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
Yes, William,’ said Henry, thinking that the boy was really very sensible. They
dismounted quietly and tied the horses to a nearby birch tree.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were quite near the hill in front of which was the gypsy camp. The mist was not
so thick here, and the two suddenly caught sight of a dark, shadowy caravan,
outlined against a campfire, left burning nearby. ‘We’ll have to be very
quiet,’ whispered William. ‘Timmy’s brought us to the gypsy camp on the moor. I
had an idea that he would. The others must be held prisoner somewhere near - be
as quiet as you can.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
watched them dismount. He hung his head, panting, his tail down. His head was
hurting him very much, and he felt decidedly queer and giddy. But he must get
to George, he must!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
led the way to the opening in the hill. William and Henry were most astonished.
They followed Timmy through the maze of passages, wondering how he knew the way
so surely. But Timmy didn’t falter. He only needed to go somewhere once, and
after that he never forgot the way!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was going very slowly now, and his legs felt queer and shaky. He wanted to lie
down and put his aching head on his paws. But no, he must find George. He must
find George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
and Anne were lying in the little cave, asleep. They were uncomfortable, and
the cave was hot, so they were restless, waking up every few minutes. But both
were asleep when Timmy walked slowly into the cave, and flopped down beside
George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
awoke when she heard William and Henry come into the cave. She thought it might
be Sniffer’s father coming back, and she hastily put the ropes round her waist
so that she would look as if she were still tied up. Then she heard Timmy
panting, and switched on her torch eagerly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
showed her Timmy, and Henry and William! Henry was full of amazement when she
saw George and Anne with ropes round their waists. She gaped at them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
Timmy darling, you fetched help!’ said George, putting her arms round his neck.
‘Oh Henry, I’m so glad you’ve come. But didn’t you bring Captain Johnson too?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
He’s away,’ said Henry. ‘But William’s here. We rode, and Timmy guided us.
Whatever’s happened, George?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
awoke just then, and couldn’t believe her eyes when she saw the visitors! There
was a hasty discussion, and then William spoke firmly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
you want to escape, you’d better come now, while the gypsy camp is asleep.
Timmy can guide us out of this rabbit-warren of a hill. We’d never be able to
find our way out alone. Come on!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on, Tim,’ said George, shaking him gently. But poor old Timmy was feeling very
peculiar. He couldn’t see things properly. George’s voice sounded blurred to
him. His head felt as heavy as lead, and somehow his legs wouldn’t carry him,
The blow on his head was taking real effect now, and the hurried journey over
the moor and back was making it worse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
ill!’ said George, in a panic. ‘He can’t get up! Oh Timmy, what’s the matter?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
that cut on his head,’ said William. ‘Its pretty bad, and he’s worn out with
coming to fetch us and running all the way back again. He can’t possibly guide
us back, George. We’ll have to do the best we can by ourselves.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
poor, poor Timmy!’ said Anne, horrified at seeing the dog stretched out quite
limp, on the floor of the cave. ‘George, can you carry him?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think so,’ said George, and she lugged him up in her arms. ‘He’s awfully heavy,
but I think I can just manage him. Perhaps the fresh air will revive him when
we get outside.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
George, we don’t know our way out of here,’ said Anne, fearfully. ‘If Timmy
can’t lead us, we’re lost! We’d end up by wandering miles and miles inside this
hill and never getting out!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we’ll simply have to make a shot at it,’ said William. ‘Come on, I’ll lead the
way. We really MUST go!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went out of the cave and down a passage; the others followed. George carrying
the limp Timmy. But very soon William came to a fork and stopped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
dear - do we go to the left or the right?’ he wondered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
knew. George shone her torch here and there, trying to remember. The beam of
light picked up something on the ground nearby.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was two sticks, one short and one long, in the shape of a cross! George gave an
exclamation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
- a patrin! Left by Sniffer to show us the way out. We have to take the passage
that the long stick points to! Oh, I hope that Sniffer has left patrins at
every corner and every fork!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
took the right-hand way and went on, their torches making long beams in the
darkness, and at every place where they might go wrong, they saw a patrin, a
message left by Sniffer to show them the right way to go.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Another
cross, we go this way,’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here’s
a patrin again, we take this fork!’ said George. And so it went on until they
came safely to the entrance of the hill. How thankful they were to see the
mist. At least it meant that they were in the open air!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
to get to the horses,’ said William. ‘They will each have to carry two of us at
once, I’m afraid.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then, just as they were making their way to where they had left the horses, the
gypsies’ dogs began to bark the place down!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’ve
heard us!’ said William, desperately. ‘Buck up! We’ll be stopped if we don’t
get off at once!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
a voice shouted loudly. ‘I can see you over there, with your torches! Stop at

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>EXCITEMENT
IN THE MORNING<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
dawn was coming now. The mist was no longer full of darkness, but was white,
and thinning rapidly. The four children hurried to the horses, which were
stamping impatiently by the trees. George couldn’t go very fast because of
Timmy. He really was very heavy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly
he began to struggle. The fresh, cool air had revived him and he wanted to be
set down. George put him down thankfully, and he began to bark defiantly at the
gypsies who were now coming out of their caravans, their dogs with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four children mounted hurriedly and the horses were surprised at the double
weight. William swung his horse’s head round and set off with George sitting
behind him. Henry took Anne. Timmy, feeling much better, ran after them, his
legs no longer feeling so shaky.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
gypsies ran too, shaking their fists and shouting. Sniffer’s father was amazed
beyond measure. Why, there were the two girls he had tied up - and that dog he
had sent off to trick the other two boys on the moor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
who were these on horse-back, and how had they found their way to the hill? How
had the prisoners been able to find their way out of the hill, too? That was a
real puzzle to Sniffer’s father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
gypsies tore after the horses, but the dogs contented themselves with excited
barks. Not one of them dared to go after Timmy. They were afraid of him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
horses went off as fast as they dared in the mist, Timmy running in front. He
seemed very much better, though George was afraid it was only the excitement
that now kept him going. She glanced back at the gypsies. They would never
catch up now, thank goodness!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Somewhere
behind the mist the sun was shining. Soon it would disperse the strange fog
that had come up so suddenly from the sea. She glanced down at her watch. Good
gracious, could it really be almost six o’clock in the morning. It was tomorrow
now!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
wondered what had happened to Julian and Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
thought of Sniffer gratefully, and all those patrins he had left in the hill.
They would never have got out but for those. She thought of Henry and William,
and gave William a sudden tight hug round the waist for coming out in the
middle of the night and rescuing them!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
are Julian and Dick, do you suppose?’ she said to William. ‘Do you think they
are still lost on the moor? Ought we to shout, and look for them?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
called back William over his shoulder. ‘We’re going straight back to the
stables. They can look after themselves!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
and Julian had certainly tried to look after themselves, that cold, misty
night, but not very successfully. By the time that their torch showed them that
it was a quarter to five by their watches, they had had enough of the bush they
were in. If only they had known it, Henry and William, with Timmy, were just
then riding over the moor, not a great distance from where they were!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
got out of the bush, damp and stiff. They stretched themselves and looked into
the dark night, still full of mist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
walk,’ said Julian. ‘I can’t bear keeping still in this mist. I’ve got my
compass. If we walk due west we should surely come to the edge of the moor, not
far from Milling Green.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
set off stumbling in the now dim light of the torch, whose battery was getting
low. ‘It will give out soon,’ groaned Dick, giving it a shake. ‘Blow the thing!
It hardly gives us any light now, and we simply must keep looking at the
compass.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
tripped against something hard and almost fell. He snatched the torch from
Dick. ‘Quick, let me have it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
shone it on what had tripped him and gave a delighted exclamation. ‘Look, it’s
a rail! We’re on the railway line again. What a bit of luck!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
should think so!’ said Dick, relieved. ‘This torch is just about finished. Now,
for GOODNESS’ sake don’t let’s lose this railway line. Stop at once if you
can’t feel it with your foot.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘To
think we were so jolly near the line after all, and didn’t know it!’ groaned
Julian. ‘We could have been back at the stables ages ago. I do hope the girls
got back safely and didn’t alarm anyone about us. They’d know we would come
back as soon as it was daylight, anyhow, if we could follow the lines!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
stumbled in at the stables’ entrance about six o’clock, tired out. Nobody was
yet up, it seemed. They found the garden door open, left ajar by William and
Henry, and went up to the girls’ room, hoping to find them in bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the beds were empty of course. They went to Henry’s room, to ask her if she had
heard anything of the girls, but her bed, though slept in, was empty too!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went across the landing to William’s room. ‘He’s gone as well!’ said Dick, in
great astonishment. ‘Where are they all?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
wake Captain Johnson,’ said Julian, who had no idea that the Captain was away
for the night. So they awakened a very startled Mrs Johnson, and almost scared
the life out of her, for she thought they were far away, camping on the moor!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
was even more startled when she heard their tale and realized that George and
Anne were missing. ‘Where are the girls, then!’ she said, flinging on a
dressing-gown. ‘This is serious, Julian. They might be completely lost on the
moor, or those gypsies might have got them! I must telephone my husband, and
the police too. Oh dear, oh dear, why did I ever let you go camping out!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
was in the middle of telephoning, with Julian and Dick beside her, looking very
anxious indeed, when the sound of horses’ hooves came in the yard below.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
goodness me! Who’s that?’ said Mrs Johnson. ‘Horses! Who’s riding them at this
time of the morning!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went to the window and looked down into the yard. Dick gave a yell that
almost made Mrs Johnson fall out of the window!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Anne!
George! Look, there they are, and Timmy too. And gosh, there’s Henry, and
William! What is all this!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
heard the yell and looked up. Tired as she was, she gave a cheerful wave and a
grin. George gave a shout.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
Julian! Oh Dick, you’re back then! We did hope you would be. After you left us
we went back up the lines the wrong way and arrived at the quarry again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
the gypsies took us prisoners’ yelled Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
- but - how do Henry and William come into this?’ said poor Mrs Johnson,
thinking she must really still be asleep. ‘And what’s the matter with Timmy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
had suddenly flopped on the ground. The excitement was over, they were home,
now he could put his poor aching head on his paws and sleep!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was off her horse immediately. ‘Timmy! Darling Timmy! Brave Timmy! Help me,
William. I’ll take him upstairs to my room and see to that cut.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>By
this time all the other children were awake and there was such a pandemonium
going on that Mrs Johnson couldn’t make herself heard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Children
in dressing-gowns and without, children shouting and yelling, children pouring
into the yard and asking questions; William trying to quiet the two horses
which were getting very excited at all this sudden clamour; and all the cocks
round about crowing their heads off! What an excitement!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sun suddenly shone out brilliantly, and the last wisps of mist disappeared.
‘Hurrah! That mist has gone!’ shouted George. ‘The sun’s out. Cheer up, Timmy.
We’ll all be all right now!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was half-carried, half-dragged up the stairs by William and George. George and
Mrs Johnson examined his cut head carefully, and bathed it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
really should have been stiched up,’ said Mrs Johnson, ‘but it seems to be
healing already. How wicked to hit a dog like that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
there was the sound of horse’s hooves again in the yard, and Captain Johnson
arrived, looking very anxious. At almost the same moment a car slid in at the
gates, a police car, with two policemen who had been sent to inquire about the
missing girls! Mrs Johnson had forgotten to telephone again to say they had
arrived.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
dear, I’m so sorry to have bothered you,’ said Mrs Johnson to the police
sergeant. ‘The girls have just arrived back, but I still don’t know what has
really happened. Still, they’re safe, so please don’t bother any more.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wait!’
said Julian, who was in the room, too. ‘I think we shall need the police!
Something very peculiar has been happening up on the moor.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Really,
sir? What’s that?’ said the sergeant, taking out a note-book.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
were camping there,’ said Julian. ‘And a plane came over, very low, guided by a
lamp set in a sandpit by the gypsies.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
lamp set by the gypsies!’ said the sergeant, surprised. ‘But why should they
need to guide a plane? I suppose it landed?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
It didn’t,’ said Julian. ‘It came again the next night, and did exactly the
same thing, swooping low and circling. But this time it dropped packages, sir!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
it did, did it?’ said the sergeant, more interested. ‘For the gypsies to pick
up, by any chance?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
sir,’ said Julian. ‘But the plane’s aim wasn’t very good, and the packets fell
all round us and almost hit us. We ran for shelter, because we didn’t know if
there were any explosives or not!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Did
you pick up any of the packages?’ asked the sergeant. Julian nodded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
we did, and I opened one.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
was in it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Paper
money, dollars!’ said Julian. ‘In one packet alone there were scores of notes
and each note was for a hundred dollars, about forty pounds a time! Thousands
of pounds-worth thrown all around us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sergeant looked at his companion. ‘Ha! Now we know! This explains a lot that
has been puzzling us, doesn’t it, Wilkins?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wilkins,
the other policeman, nodded grimly. ‘It certainly does. So that’s what happens!
That’s how the gang get the dollars over here, from that printing-press in
North France. Just a nice little run in a plane!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
why do they throw the packets down for the gypsies to collect?’ asked Julian.
‘Is it so that they can give them to someone else? Why don’t they bring them
openly into the country? Surely anyone can bring dollars here?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
forged ones, my lad,’ said the sergeant. ‘These will all be forged, you mark my
words. The gang have got a headquarters near London, and as soon as those
packets are handed over to them by one of the gypsies, they will set to work
passing them off as real ones, paying hotel bills with them, buying all kinds
of goods and paying for them in notes that aren’t worth a penny!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Whew!’
said Julian. ‘I never thought of them being forged!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes. We’ve known of this gang for some time, but all we knew was that they had
a printing-press to print the notes in North France, and that somehow the rest
of the gang here, near London, received them and passed them off as real ones,’
said the sergeant. ‘But we didn’t know how they were brought here, nor who took
them to the gang near London.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
now we know all right!’ said Wilkins. ‘My word, this is a pretty scoop,
Sergeant. Good kids these, finding out what we’ve been months trying to
discover!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
are these packages?’ said the sergeant. ‘Did you hide them? Did the gypsies get
them?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
we hid them,’ said Julian. ‘But I guess the gypsies will be hunting all over
the place for them today, so we’d better get on the moors quick, Sergeant.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
did you hide them?’ said the sergeant. ‘In a safe place, I hope!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
very!’ said Julian. ‘I’ll call my brother, Sergeant. He’ll come with us. Hey,
Dick! Come on in here, and you’ll hear a very interesting bit of news!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs
Johnson was amazed to hear that the police wanted Julian and Dick to go out on
the moors again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
they’re tired out!’ she said. ‘They need something to eat. Can’t it wait?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
afraid not,’ said the sergeant. ‘You needn’t worry, Mrs Johnson. These boys are
tough!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
actually I don’t think that the gypsies can possibly find the packets,’ said
Julian. ‘So it wouldn’t matter if we had a bite to eat. I’m ravenous!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right,’ said the big policeman, putting away his note-book. ‘Have a snack and
we’ll go afterwards.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Well,
of course, George, Anne and Henry all wanted to go too, as soon as they heard
about the proposed jaunt over the moors!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What!
Leave us out of that!’ said George, indignantly. ‘What a hope! Anne wants to
come too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
does Henry,’ said Anne, looking at George, ‘even though she didn’t help to find
the packages of notes.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course Henry must come,’ said George at once, and Henry beamed. George had been
very struck indeed with Henry’s courage in coming with William to rescue her
and Anne, and very pleased that she hadn’t boasted about it! But Henry knew
that William was the one mostly to praise, and she had been unexpectedly modest
about the whole affair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was quite a large party that set off after everyone had made a very good
breakfast. Mrs Johnson had set to work cooking huge platefuls of bacon and egg,
exclaiming every now and again when she thought of all that had happened up on
the moors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Those
gypsies! And fancy that plane coming like that - dropping money all over the
place! And the gypsies tying up Anne and George in that hill. I never heard
anything like it in my life!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Captain
Johnson went with the party too. He could hardly believe the extraordinary tale
that the four had to tell, five, with old Timmy! Timmy now had a beautiful
patch on his head, and was feeling extremely important. Wait till Liz saw that!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ten
people set out, including Timmy, for William had been included in the party
too. He tried to guess where Julian had hidden the notes, but he couldn’t, of
course. Julian firmly refused to tell anyone. He wanted it to be a real surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came to the quarry at last, having walked all the way up the old railway line.
Julian stood on the edge of the quarry and pointed out the gypsy camp.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look,
they’re leaving,’ he said. ‘I bet they were afraid we’d spread the news of
their behaviour, after the girls escaped.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sure
enough, the caravans were moving slowly away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wilkins,
as soon as you get back, give word to have every gypsy watched if he leaves the
caravans,’ said the sergeant. ‘One of them is sure to have arranged a
meeting-place to give the gang the packets dropped from the plane, and if we
watch those caravans, and every gypsy in them, we’ll soon be able to put our
hands on the gang that spends the forged notes.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
bet it’s Sniffer’s father,’ said Dick. ‘He’s the ringleader, anyway.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
watched the caravans move away one by one. Anne wondered about Sniffer. So did
George. What had she promised him last night, if he would help them? A bicycle,
and to live in a house so that he could ride it to school! Well, it wasn’t
likely she would ever see the dirty little boy again, but if she did she would
certainly have to keep her word!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now,
where’s this wonderful hiding-place?’ asked the sergeant, as Julian turned from
watching the caravans. He had tried to make out Sniffer and Liz, but the vans
were too far away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Follow
me!’ said Julian, with a sudden grin and led the way back up the lines to where
they broke off. The gorse-bush was there, and the old engine lay on its side as
before, almost hidden.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Whatever’s
that?’ said the sergeant, surprised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
the old Puffing Billy that used to pull the trucks of sand from the quarry,’
said Dick. ‘Apparently there was a quarrel long ago between the owners of the
quarry and the gypsies, and the gypsies pulled up the lines and the engine ran
off and fell over. There it’s been ever since, as far as I can see!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
went round to the funnel-end, and bent back the prickly gorse-branch that hid
it. The sergeant looked on in surprise. Dick scraped the sand out of the top of
the funnel and then pulled out one of the packages. He had been afraid they
would not be there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here
you are!’ he said, and tossed the packet to the sergeant. ‘There are plenty
more. I’ll come to the one we opened in a minute - yes - here it is.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sergeant and Wilkins were amazed to see the packages hauled up from such a
peculiar hiding-place. No wonder the gypsies hadn’t found them. Nobody would
ever have looked down the funnel of the old engine, even if they had spotted
it, half-buried as it was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sergeant looked at the hundred-dollar notes in the opened parcel and whistled.
‘My word, this is it! We’ve seen these before, beautiful forgeries they are! If
the gang had got rid of this lot, a great many people would have suffered. The
money is worth nothing! How many packets did you say there were?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dozens!’
said Dick, and pulled more of them out of the funnel. ‘Gosh, I can’t reach the
ones at the bottom.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Never
mind,’ said the sergeant. ‘Put some sand in to hide them and I’ll send a man to
poke the rest out with a stick. The gypsies have gone and they are the only
people likely to hunt for them. This is a wonderful scoop! You kids have
certainly put us on to something.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
glad,’ said Julian. ‘I say, we’d better collect all the things we left here
yesterday, hadn’t we? We went off in rather a hurry, you see, Sergeant, and
left our things in the quarry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
and George went into the quarry to collect the things they had left there.
Timmy went with them. He suddenly growled, and George stopped, her hand on his
collar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
up, Tim? Ju, there must be somebody here! Is it one of the gypsies, do you
think?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
Timmy stopped growling and wagged his tail. He dragged away from George’s hand
and ran over to one of the little caves in the sandy walls. He looked most
peculiar with the patch on his head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Out
of the cave came Liz! As soon as she saw Timmy she began to turn
head-over-heels as fast as she could. Timmy stared in wonder - what a dog! How
could she turn somersaults like that?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sniffer!’
called George. ‘Come on out. I know you’re there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
pale, worried face looked out of the cave. Then Sniffer’s thin, wiry little
body followed, and soon he was standing in the quarry, looking scared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
got away from them,’ he said, nodding his head towards where the gypsy camp had
been. He went up to George, and gave a sniff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
said I could have a bike,’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
know,’ said George. ‘You shall have one, Sniffer. If you hadn’t left us patrins
in that hill, we’d never have escaped!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
you said I could live in a house and ride my bike to school,’ said Sniffer
urgently. ‘I can’t go back to my father, he’d half-kill me now. He saw those
patrins I left in the hill and he chased me all over the moor for miles. But he
didn’t catch me. I hid.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
do the best we can for you,’ promised Julian, sorry for this little waif.
Sniffer sniffed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
that hanky?’ demanded George. He pulled it out of his pocket, still clean and
folded. He beamed at her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
quite hopeless,’ said George. ‘Listen, if you want to go to school, you’ll have
to stop that awful sniff and use your hanky. See?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sniffer
nodded, but put the hanky carefully back into his pocket. Then the sergeant
came into the quarry and Sniffer fled at the sight of him!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Funny
little thing,’ said Julian. ‘Well, I should imagine that his father will be
sent to prison for his share in this affair, so Sniffer will be able to get his
wish and leave the caravan life to live in a house. We might be able to get him
into a good home.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
I shall keep my word, and take some money out of my savings-bank and buy him a
bicycle,’ said George. ‘He deserves it! Oh, do look at Liz - simply adoring
Timmy and his patch. Don’t look so important, Tim - it’s only a patch on your
cut!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sniffer!’
called Julian. ‘Come back. You needn’t be afraid of this policeman. He is a
friend of ours. He’ll help us to choose a bicycle for you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sergeant looked extremely surprised at this remark, but at any rate it brought
Sniffer back at once!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we’ll go back now,’ said the sergeant. ‘We’ve got what we want, and Wilkins has
already started back to get somebody on to watching the gypsies. Once we find
out who they have to report to about this forged money we shall feel happy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hope Wilkins went along down the railway,’ said Julian. ‘It’s so easy to get
lost on this moor.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
He had the sense to do that, after hearing how you got lost!’ said the
sergeant. ‘It’s wonderful up here, isn’t it, so peaceful and quiet and calm.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
you’d never think that mysteries could happen up here, would you?’ said Dick.
‘Old ones, and new ones! Well, I’m glad we happened to be mixed up in the
newest one. It was quite an adventure!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went back to the stables, to find that it was now almost dinner-time and
that everyone had a very large appetite to match the very large dinner that Mrs
Johnson had got ready. The girls went upstairs to wash. George went into
Henry’s room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Henry,’
she said, ‘thanks most awfully. You’re as good as a boy any day!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thanks,
George,’ said Henry, surprised. ‘You’re better than a boy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
was passing the door and heard all this. He laughed, and stuck his head in at
the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say do let me share in these compliments!’ he said. ‘Just tell me I’m as good
as a girl, will you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
all he got was a well-aimed hair-brush and a shoe, and he fled away, laughing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
gazed out of her bedroom window over the moor. It looked so peaceful and serene
under the April sun. No mystery about it now!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
the same, it’s a good name for you,’ said Anne. ‘You’re full of mystery and
adventure, and your last adventure waited for us to come and share it. I really
think I’d call this adventure “Five Go To Mystery Moor”.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It’s
a good name, Anne. We’ll call it that too!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
