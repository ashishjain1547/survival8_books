<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>My
readers will want to know if Whispering Island is real, set in the great blue
harbour in the story - and if the little cottage on the hills is there still -
and the golf-course in the story - and Lucas, who tells the children about the
island. Yes, the island is real, and lies in the great harbour, still full of
whispering trees. The little cottage on the hills is still there, with its
magnificent view and its old well - and Lucas can be found on the golf-course,
nut-brown and bright-eyed, telling stories of the animals and birds he loves so
much. I have taken them all and put them into this book for you - as well as
the friends you know so well - The Famous Five<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
nicest word in the English language is holidays!’ said Dick, helping himself to
a large spoonful of marmalade. ‘Pass the toast, Anne. Mother, do you feel
down-hearted to have us all tearing about the place again?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course not,’ said his mother. ‘The only thing that really worries me when
holidays come, is Food - Food with a capital F. We never seem to have enough in
the house when all three of you are back. And by the way - does anyone know
what has happened to the sausages that were in the larder?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sausages
- sausages - let me think!’ said Julian, frowning. Anne gave a sudden giggle.
She knew quite well what had happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
Mother - you said we could get our own meal last night, as you were out,’ said
Julian. ‘So we poked about and decided on sausages.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
but Julian - two whole pounds of sausages!’ said his mother. ‘I know <st1:place
w:st="on">Georgina</st1:place> came over to spend the evening - but even so...
!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She
brought Timmy,’ said Anne. ‘He rather likes sausages too, Mother.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
that’s the last time I leave the larder door unlocked, when I go out!’ said her
mother. ‘Fancy cooking those lovely pork sausages for a dog - especially Timmy,
with his enormous appetite! Really, Anne! I meant to have them for our lunch
today.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- we rather thought we’d go and spend the day at Kirrin, with George and
Timmy,’ said Dick. ‘That’s if you don’t want us for anything, Mother.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
do want you,’ said his mother. ‘Mrs Layman is coming to tea, and she said she
wants to see you about something.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
three groaned, and Dick protested at once. ‘Oh Mother - the first day of the
holidays - and we have to be in to tea! It’s too bad - a glorious spring day
like this too!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
- we’ll be in to tea all right,’ said Julian, giving Dick a sharp little kick
under the table, as he saw his mother’s disappointed face. ‘Mrs Layman’s a nice
old thing - she was always giving us little treats when we were little.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
she never forgets our birthdays,’ said Anne. ‘Do you think we could ask George
over too - with Timmy? George will be awfully disappointed if we aren’t with
her the first day of the hols.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
of course you can,’ said her mother. ‘Go and ring her up now, and arrange it.
And don’t forget to put our old Tibby-cat into the shed, with a saucer of milk.
She’s scared stiff of Timmy - he’s so enormous. And please, all of you, TRY to
look clean at tea-time.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
see to Dick and Anne,’ said Julian, with a grin. ‘I must remember to find their
overalls!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
going to phone George now, this very minute,’ said Anne, getting up from the
table. ‘Do you mind, Mother? I’ve finished - and I’d like to catch George
before she takes Tim for a walk, or does some shopping for Aunt Fanny.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Uncle
Quentin will be glad to be rid of George even for a meal,’ said Dick. ‘He fell
over her lacrosse stick yesterday, and wanted to know why she left her fishing
net about! George didn’t know what he was talking about!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Poor
old <st1:place w:st="on">Georgina</st1:place>,’ said his mother. ‘It’s a pity
that both she and her father have exactly the same hot tempers. Her mother must
find it dificult to keep the peace! Ah - here’s Anne back again. Did you get
George on the phone, dear?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
She’s thrilled,’ said Anne. ‘She says it’s just as well we’re not going to
spend the day with her, because Uncle Quentin has lost some papers he was
working on, and he’s turning the house upside down. George said she will
probably be mad as a hatter by the time she arrives this afternoon! Uncle
Quentin even made Aunt Fanny turn out her knitting bag to see if the papers
were there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dear
old Quentin,’ said her mother. ‘Such a truly brilliant scientist - remembers
every book he’s ever read - every paper he’s ever written - and has the finest
brain I know - and yet loses some valuable paper or other almost every week!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
loses something else every day of the week too,’ said Dick, with a grin. ‘His
temper! Poor old George - she’s always in some sort of trouble!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
anyway, she’s jolly glad to be coming over here!’ said Anne. ‘She’s biking
over, with Timmy. She’ll be here for lunch. Is that all right, Mother?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course!’ said her mother. ‘Now - seeing that you had today’s dinner for last
night’s supper, you’d better do a little shopping for me. What shall we have?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘SAUSAGES!’
said everyone, at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
should have thought you were quite literally fed up with sausages, after last
night’s feast,’ said their mother, laughing. ‘All right - sausages. But Timmy
can have a bone - a nice meaty bone. I am NOT going to buy any more sausages
for him, that’s quite certain.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
shall we get some nice cakes for tea as Mrs Layman is coming?’ said Anne. ‘Or
are you going to make some, Mother?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
make a few buns,’ said her mother. ‘And you can choose whatever else you like -
so long as you don’t buy up the shop!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
three went off shopping, cycling along the lane to the village. It was a truly
lovely spring day. The celandines were golden in the ditches, and daisies were
scattered everywhere. Dick burst into song as they went, and the cows in the
nearby fields lifted their heads in surprise, as Dick’s loud voice swept round
them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
laughed. It was good to be with her brothers again She missed them very much
when she was at school. And now - they would have almost a whole month together
- with their cousin George too. She was suddenly overwhelmed with joy, and
lifted up her voice and joined Dick in his singing. Her brothers looked at her
with affection and amusement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
old Anne,’ said Dick. ‘You’re such a quiet little mouse, it’s nice to hear you
singing so loudly.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
am NOT a quiet little mouse!’ said Anne, surprised and rather hurt. ‘Whatever
makes you say that? You just wait - you may get a surprise one day!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- we may!’ said Julian. ‘But I doubt it. A mouse can’t suddenly turn into a
tiger! Anyway, one tiger’s enough. George is the tiger of our family - my word,
she can put out her claws all right - and roar - and ramp and rave!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
laughed at the picture of George as a tiger. Dick wobbled as he laughed and his
front wheel touched Anne’s back wheel. She turned round fiercely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘LOOK
OUT, IDIOT! You nearly had me over! Can’t you see where you’re going? Be
sensible, can’t you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hey,
Anne - whatever’s the matter?’ said Julian, amazed to hear his gentle little
sister lashing out so suddenly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
laughed. ‘It’s all right. I was just being a tiger for a moment - putting out
my claws! I thought Dick and you might like to see them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
well!’ said Dick, riding beside her, ‘I’ve never heard you yell like that
before. Surprising - but quite pleasing! What about you showing old George your
claws sometime when she gets out of hand?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Stop
teasing,’ said Anne. ‘Here’s the butcher’s. For goodness sake go and get the
sausages and be sensible. I’ll go and buy the cakes.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
baker’s shop was full of new-made buns and cakes, and smelt deliciously of
home-made bread. Anne enjoyed herself choosing a vast selection. ‘After all,’
she thought, ‘there will be eight of us - counting Timmy - and if we’re all
hungry, cakes soon disappear.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys were very pleased to see all the paper bags.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Looks
like a good tea today,’ said Dick. ‘I hope the old lady - what’s her name now -
Layman - who’s coming to tea today, has a good appetite. I wonder what she’s
going to tell us about.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Did
you buy a nice meaty bone for Timmy?’ asked Anne. ‘He’ll like that for his
tea.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
bought such a beauty that I’m pretty sure Mother will say it’s good enough to
make soup from,’ said Dick, with a grin. ‘So I’ll keep it in my saddlebag till
he comes. Dear old Tim. He deserves a jolly good bone. Best dog I ever knew!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
been on a lot of adventures with us,’ said Anne, bicycling beside the boys, as
the road was empty. ‘And he seemed to enjoy them all.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
So did we!’ said Dick. ‘Well - who knows? An adventure may be lying in wait for
us these hols too! I seem to smell one in the air!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
don’t!’ said Anne. ‘You’re just making that up. I’d like a bit of peace after a
hectic term at school. I worked jolly hard this last term.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- you were top of your form, and captain of Games - so you deserve to have the
kind of holiday you like,’ said Julian, proud of his young sister. ‘And so you
shall! Adventures are OUT! Do you hear that, Dick? We keep absolutely clear of
them. So that’s that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
it, Ju?’ said Anne, laughing. ‘Well - we’ll see!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
and Timmy were waiting for Julian, Dick and Anne, when they arrived home. Timmy
was standing in the road, ears pricked, long tail waving. He went quite mad
when he saw their bicycles rounding the corner, and galloped towards them at
top speed, barking madly, much to the horror of a baker’s boy with a large
basket.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy disappeared into the nearest garden at top speed, yelling ‘Mad dog, mad
dog!’ Timmy tore past, and forced the three to dismount, for they were afraid
of knocking him over.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dear
Timmy!’ said Anne, patting the excited dog. ‘Do put your tongue in - I’m sure
it will fall out some day!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
ran to each of them in turn, woofing in delight, licking everyone, and
altogether behaving as if he hadn’t seen them for a year!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
that’s enough, old boy,’ said Dick, pushing him away, and trying to mount his
bicycle once more. ‘After all, we did see you yesterday. Where’s George?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
had heard Timmy barking, and had now run out into the road too. The three
cycled up to her, and she grinned happily at them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo!
You’ve been shopping, I see. Shut up barking, Timmy, you talk too much. Sorry
you couldn’t come over to Kirrin Cottage - but I’m jolly glad you asked me to
come to you - my father still hasn’t found the papers he’s lost, and honestly
our place is like a mad-house - cupboards being turned out - even the kitchen
store-cupboard! and I left poor Mother up in the loft, looking there - though
why Father should think they might be there, I don’t know!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Poor
old George - I can just see your father tearing his hair, and shouting - and
all the time he’s probably put the papers into the waste-paper basket by
mistake!’ said Dick, with a chuckle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gracious
- we never thought of that!’ said George. ‘I’d better phone Mother at once, and
tell her to look. Bright idea of yours, Dick.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you go and phone, and we’ll put our bikes away,’ said Julian. ‘Take your nose
away from that bag of sausages, Timmy. You’re in disgrace over sausages, let me
tell you. You’re suspected of eating too many last night!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
did eat rather a lot,’ said George. ‘I took my eye off him, and he wolfed quite
a few. I say, who’s this Mrs Layman who’s coming to tea? Have we got to stay in
and have tea with her? I hoped we might be going off for a picnic this
afternoon.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nothing
doing, old thing,’ said Dick, ‘Mrs Layman is apparently coming to talk to us
about something. So we have to be in - with clean hands, nice manners, and
everything. So behave yourself, George!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
gave him a friendly punch. ‘That’s unfair,’ said Dick. ‘You know I can’t punch
you back. My word, you should have seen Anne this morning, George - yelled at
me like a tiger howling, and showed her teeth, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
be an idiot, Dick,’ said Anne. ‘He called me a mouse, George - he said we’d one
tiger - you - and that was enough in the family. So I went for him - put out my
claws for a moment, and gave him such a surprise. I rather liked it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
old Anne!’ said George, amused. ‘But you’re not really cut out to be a tiger,
and rage and roar, you know.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
could be, if I had to,’ said Anne, obstinately. ‘One of these days I’ll
surprise you all. You just wait!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right. We will,’ said Julian, putting his arm round his sister. ‘Come on, now -
we’d better get indoors before Timmy gets some of the cakes out of the bags.
Stop licking that bag, Tim - you’ll make a hole in it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
can smell the cherry buns inside,’ said Anne. ‘Shall I give him one?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘NO!’
said Julian. ‘Cherry buns are wasted on him, you know that. Don’t you remember
how he chews the bun part and spits out the cherries?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, exactly as if he agreed. He went to sniff at the bag with his bone
inside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'That’s
your dinner, Tim,’ said Anne. ‘Plenty of meat on it, too. Look there’s Mother
at the window, beckoning. I expect she wants the sausages. NO, Timmy - the
sausages are NOT for you. Get down! Good gracious, I never in my life knew such
a hungry dog. Anybody would think you starved him, George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
they’d think wrong, then,’ said George. ‘Timmy, come to heel.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
came, still looking round longingly at the various bags that the others were
now taking from their saddle-bags.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went indoors, and deposited the goods on the kitchen table. The cook opened
the bags and looked inside, keeping a sharp eye on Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Better
take that dog of yours out of my kitchen,’ she said. ‘Funny how sausages always
disappear when he’s around. Get down, now - take your paws off my clean table!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
trotted out of the kitchen. He thought it was a pity that cooks didn’t like
him. He liked them very much indeed - they always smelt so deliciously of
cooking, and there were always so many titbits around which he longed for, but
was seldom offered. Ah well - he’d trot into the kitchen again when Cookie had
gone upstairs for something! He might perhaps find a few bits and pieces on the
floor then!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo,
Georgina dear!’ said her aunt, coming into the kitchen, Timmy following her in
delight. ‘Timmy, go out of the kitchen. I don’t trust you within a mile of
sausages. Go on - shoo!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
‘shooed’. He liked Anne’s mother, but knew that when she said ‘Shoo!’ she meant
it. He lay down on a rug in the living-room, with a heavy sigh, wondering how
long it would be before he had that lovely meaty bone. He put his head on his
paws, and kept his ears pricked for George. He thought it most unfair that
George shouldn’t be shooed out of the kitchen too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
for goodness sake, keep out of my way while I cook the lunch,’ said Cook, to
the children milling round her kitchen. ‘And shut the door, please. I don’t
want that great hungry dog sniffing round me all the time, making out he’s
starving, when he’s as fat as butter!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
NOT!’ said George, indignantly. ‘Timmy has never been fat in his life. He’s not
that kind of dog. He’s never greedy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
he must be the first dog ever born that wasn’t greedy,’ said Cookie. ‘Can’t
trust any of them! There was that pug-dog of Mrs Lane’s - crunched up lumps of
sugar whenever it could reach a sugar-bowl - and that fat poodle next door -
came and knocked over the cream that the milkman left outside the back door -
deliberated knocked it over, mark you - and then licked up every drop. Ha - his
mistress tried to make out he didn’t like cream - but you should have seen his
nose - covered in cream up to his eyes!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
looked in at the kitchen door, his nose in the air, for all the world as if he
were deeply offended at Cookie’s remarks. Julian laughed. ‘You’ve wounded his
pride, Cookie!’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
wound him somewhere else, too, if he comes sniffing round me when I’m cooking,’
said Cookie. That made George give one of her scowls, but the others couldn’t
help laughing!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
morning went very pleasantly. The five went down to the beach, and walked round
the high cliffs, enjoying the stiff breeze that blew in their faces. Timmy
raced after every seagull that dared to sit on the smooth sand, annoyed that
each one rose up lazily on great wings, as soon as he almost reached it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were all hungry for their dinner, and not one single morsel was left when they
had finished! Cookie had made a tremendous steamed pudding, with lashings of
treacle, which was, as usual, a huge success.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wish
I had a tongue like Timmy’s and could lick up the lovely treacle left on the
bottom of the dish,’ said George. ‘Such a waste!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
certainly won’t be able to eat any tea, I’m sure of that!’ said her aunt. But,
of course, she was wrong. When teatime came, they all felt quite ready for it,
and were most impatient when Mrs Layman was late!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
tea looked lovely, laid on a big table, over a white lace cloth. The children
sat and looked at it longingly. When would Mrs Layman arrive?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
begin to feel I’m not going to like Mrs Layman,’ said George, at last. ‘I can’t
bear looking at those cream cakes when I’m hungry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
front door bell rang. Hurrah! Then in came a cheerful, smiling old lady,
nodding to everyone, very pleased to see such a nice little party waiting for
her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
is Mrs Layman, children,’ said Julian’s mother. ‘Sit down, Mrs Layman. We’re
delighted to have you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I’ve come to ask the children something,’ said Mrs Layman. ‘But we’ll have tea
first, and then I’ll say what I’ve come to say. My, my - what a wonderful tea!
I’m glad I feel hungry!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
else was hungry too, and soon the bread and butter, the sandwiches, the buns,
the cakes and everything else disappeared. Timmy sat quietly by George, who
slipped him a titbit now and again, when no one was looking. Mrs Layman chatted
away. She was a most interesting person, and the children liked her very much.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
now,’ she said, when tea was finished, ‘I’m sure you must be wanting to know
why I asked to come to tea today. I wanted to ask your mother, Julian, if there
was any chance of you three - and this other boy here - what’s his name -
George? would you like to help me out of a difficulty.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
pointed out that George was a girl, not a boy, and that George was short for
Georgina. George, as usual, was pleased to be taken for a boy. They all looked
at Mrs Layman, listening to her with interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
like this,’ she said. ‘I’ve a dear little house up on the hills, overlooking
the harbour - and I’ve a grandson staying with me there - Wilfrid. Well, I have
to go to look after a cousin of mine, who’s ill - and Wilfrid can’t bear to be
left alone. I just wondered if your mother would allow you children to share
the little house with Wilfrid - and well - keep him company. He feels a bit
scary being on his own. I’ve a good woman there, who comes in to cook and clean
- but poor Wilfrid’s really scared of being in such a lonely place, high up on
the hill.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
mean that lovely little house with the wonderful view?’ said Julian’s mother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
It’s rather primitive in some ways - no water laid on, only just a well to use
- and no electricity or gas - just candles, or an oil lamp. Maybe it sounds too
old-fashioned for words - but honestly the view makes up for it! Perhaps the
children would like to come over and see it, before they decide?’ Mrs Layman
looked earnestly round at everyone, and nobody knew quite what to say.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- we’ll certainly come and see it,’ said Julian’s mother. ‘And if the children
feel like it, well, they can stay there. They do like being on their own, of
course.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Julian. ‘We’ll come and see it, Mrs Layman. Mother’s going to be busy with
a bazaar soon - she’ll be glad to get us out of the way - and, of course, we do
like being on our own!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs
Layman looked extremely pleased. ‘Tomorrow, then?’ she said. ‘About ten
o’clock. You’ll love the view. Wonderful, wonderful! You can see right over the
great harbour, and for miles around. Well - I must be going now. I’ll tell
Wilfrid you children may be keeping him company. He’s such a nice lad - so
helpful. You’ll love him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
had his doubts about the nice helpful Wilfrid. He even wondered if Mrs Layman
wanted to get away from Wilfrid, and leave him to himself! No - that was too
silly. Anyway, they’d soon see what the place was like, tomorrow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
would be fun to be on our own again,’ said George, when Mrs Layman had gone. ‘I
don’t expect this Wilfrid would be any bother. He’s probably just a silly kid,
scared of being left alone - though apparently there is a woman there! Well -
we’ll go tomorrow! Maybe the view will make up for dear Wilfrid!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Next
day the children prepared to go and see the cottage belonging to Mrs Layman.
‘You coming too, Mother?’ asked Julian. ‘We’d like your advice!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
no, dear,’ said his mother. ‘I’ve rather a lot to do - there’s a meeting on at
the Village Hall, and I promised to go to it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
full of good works, Mother,’ said Julian, giving her a hug. ‘All right, we’ll
go by ourselves. I daresay we shall know at once whether we’d like to stay in
the cottage - or not. Also, we MUST know what this Wilfrid is like! It’s a
quarter to ten, and George is already here, with Timmy. I’ll call the others
and we’ll get our bikes.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
the four were on their bicycles, with Timmy, as usual, running alongside, his
long tongue out, his eyes bright and happy. This was Timmy’s idea of perfect
happiness - to be with the four children all day long!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went along a road that ran on the top of a hill. They swung round a corner -
and there, spread far below them, was a great sea-vista that included a wonderful
harbour, filled with big and little ships. The sea was as blue as the
Mediterranean, quite breathtaking. Anne jumped off her bicycle at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
must just feast my eyes on all this before I go a yard further!’ she said.
‘What a panorama! What miles of sea and sky!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
put her bicycle against a gate and then climbed over and stood by herself,
gazing down at the view. Dick joined her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
suddenly a voice shouted loudly ‘FORE! FORE!’ A small white thing came whizzing
through the air and landed just by Anne’s foot. She jumped in surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
a golf-ball,’ said Dick. ‘No, don’t pick it up. Whoever’s playing with it, has
to come and hit it from exactly where it fell. Good thing you weren’t hit,
Anne. I didn’t realize that this gate led on to a golf-course!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
ought to have a walk over it,’ said Anne. ‘Just look at those gorse bushes over
there, absolutely flaming with yellow blossom - and all the tiny flowers
springing up everywhere - speedwell and coltsfoot and daisies and celandines -
beautiful. And oh - what a view!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- and if Mrs Layman’s cottage has a view anything like this, I’d certainly like
to stay there!’ said Dick. ‘Think of getting out of bed in the morning and
seeing this enormous view out of the window - the harbour - the sea beyond -
the hills all round - the great spread of sky...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
ought to be a poet, Dick!’ said Anne, in surprise. The golfers came up at that
moment, and the children stood aside and watched one of them address the ball,
and then strike it easily and strongly. The ball soared through the air, and
landed far away on a smooth green fairway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
shot!’ said the man’s partner, and the two sauntered off together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Funny
game, really,’ said Anne. ‘Just hitting a ball all round the course.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wish
I had some clubs!’ said Dick. ‘I’m sure I could hit some smashing shots!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
if that cottage is anywhere near the golf-course, perhaps you could pay to have
a lesson,’ said Anne. ‘I bet you could hit a ball as far as that man!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others were now yelling for them to come back, so they went to fetch their
bicycles. Soon they were all riding along the road again. ‘We have to look for
a small white gate, with “Hill Cottage” painted on it,’ said George. ‘On the
hillside facing the sea.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
it is!’ cried Anne. ‘We’ll pile our bicycles together against the hedge, and go
in at the gate.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
left their bicycles in a heap and went through the gate. Not far to their left
stood a funny old cottage, its back to them, its front looking down the steep
hill that ran towards the great harbour and the sea beyond.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
like a cottage out of an old fairy-tale,’ said Anne. ‘Funny little chimneys -
rather crooked walls - a thatched roof, all uneven - and what tiny windows!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
walked down a little winding path that led to the cottage. They soon came to a
well, and leaned over it to see the water deep down. ‘So that’s the water we’d
have to drink!’ said Anne, wrinkling up her nose. ‘And we’d have to let down
the bucket by winding this handle - and down it would go on the rope! Do you
suppose the water is pure?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
seeing that people must have drunk it for years on end - the ones living in
that cottage, anyway - I should imagine it’s all right!’ said Julian. ‘Come on
- let’s find the front door of the cottage - if it has one!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
had one wooden door, hung rather crooked, with an old brass knocker. It faced
down the hill, and was flanked on each side by small windows. Two other small
windows were above. Julian looked at them. The bedrooms would be very small, he
thought - would there really be room for them all?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
knocked at the door. Nobody came to open it. He knocked again, and then looked
for a bell, but there wasn’t one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘See
if the door is unlocked,’ said Anne. So Julian turned the handle - and at once
the door gave under his hand! It opened straight into a room that looked like a
kitchen-living-room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
gave a shout. ‘Anyone at home?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no answer. ‘Well - as this is obviously the cottage we were meant to see,
we’d better go in,’ said Julian and in they all went.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was old, very old. The carved wooden furniture was old too. Ancient oil lamps
stood on two tables in the room, and in a recess there was an oilstove with a
saucepan on top. A narrow, crooked stairway made of wood curved up to the floor
above. Julian went up, and found himself in a long, darkish room, its roof
thatched with reed and held up by black beams.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
place must be hundreds of years old!’ he called down to the others. ‘I don’t
think it’s big enough for us four and the others too - the cook and that boy
called Wilfrid.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Just
as he finished calling down the stairs, the front door was flung open and
someone came in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
are you doing here?’ he shouted. ‘This is my cottage!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
went quickly down the stairs, and there, facing them all, stood a boy of about
ten, a scowl on his brown face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Er
- are you Wilfrid, by any chance?’ asked Dick, politely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
I am. And who are you? And where’s my aunt? She’ll soon chuck you out!’ said
the boy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
your aunt Mrs Layman?’ asked Julian. ‘If so, she asked us to come and see her
cottage, and decide if we’d like to keep you company. She said she had to go
away and look after a sick friend.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I don’t want you!’ said the boy. ‘So clear off. I’m all right here alone. My
aunt’s a nuisance, always fussing round.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
thought there was a cook too,’ said Julian. ‘Where is she?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She
only comes in the morning, and I sent her off,’ said Wilfrid. ‘She left me some
food. I want to be alone. I don’t want you. So clear off’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
be a fathead, Wilfrid,’ said Julian. ‘You can’t live all alone here. You’re
just a kid.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
shan’t be living all alone. I’ve plenty of friends,’ said Wilfrid, defiantly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
CAN’T have plenty of friends here in this lonely place, with only the hills and
sky around you,’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I have!’ said Wilfrid. ‘And here’s one - so look out!’ And, to the horror of
the two girls, he put his hand into his pocket, and brought out a snake!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
screamed, and tried to hide behind Julian. Wilfrid saw her fright and came
towards her, holding the snake by its middle, so that it swayed to and fro, its
bright little eyes gleaming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
be scared, Anne,’ said Julian. ‘It’s only a harmless grass-snake. Put the
creature back into your pocket, Wilfrid, and don’t play the fool. If that snake
is the only friend you have, you’ll be pretty lonely here by yourself!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
plenty of friends, I tell you!’ shouted Wilfrid, stuffing the snake back into
his pocket. ‘I’ll hit you if you don’t believe me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no, you won’t,’ said Dick. ‘Just show us your other friends. If they’re kids
like you, it’s just too bad!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Kids?
I don’t make friends with kids!’ said Wilfrid, scornfully. ‘I’ll show you I’m
speaking the truth. Come out here on the hillside, and see some of my other
friends.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all trooped out of the little cottage, on to the hillside, amazed at this
fierce, strange boy. When they were in the open, they saw that he had eyes as
bright blue as the speedwell in the grass, and hair almost as yellow as the
celandines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sit
down and keep quiet,’ he ordered. ‘Over there, by that bush. And don’t move a
finger. I’ll soon make you believe in my friends! How dare you come here,
doubting my word!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all sat down obediently beside the gorse-bush, puzzled and rather amused. The
boy sat down too, and drew something out of his pocket. What was it? George
tried to see, but it was half-hidden in his right hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
put it to his mouth, and began to whistle. It was a soft, weird whistle that
grew loud and then died away again. There was no tune, no melody, just a kind
of beautiful dirge that pulled at the heart. Sad, thought Anne, such a sad
little tune - if you could call it a tune!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Something
stirred a little way down the hill - and then, to everyone’s astonishment, an
animal appeared - a hare! Its great ears stood upright, its big eyes stared
straight at the boy with the curious little pipe. Then the hare lollopped right
up to Wilfrid - and began to dance! Soon another came, but this one only
watched. The first one then seemed to go mad, and leapt about wildly, utterly
unafraid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
tune changed a little - and a rabbit appeared! Then another and another. One
came to Wilfrid’s feet and sniffed at them, its whiskers quivering. Then it lay
down against the boy’s foot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
bird fiew down - a beautiful magpie! It stood nearby, watching the hare,
fascinated. It took no notice of the children at all. They all held their
breath, amazed and delighted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then Timmy gave a little growl, deep down in his throat. He didn’t really mean
to, but he just couldn’t help it! At once the hares, the rabbits and the magpie
fled, the magpie squawking in fright.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wilfrid
faced round at once, his eyes blazing. He lifted his hand to strike Timmy - but
George caught his fist at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let
go!’ yelled Wilfrid. ‘That dog scared my friends! I’ll get a stick and whip
him. He’s the worst dog in the world, he’s...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then something strange happened. Timmy came gently over to Wilfrid, lay down,
and put his head on the angry boy’s knee, looking up at him lovingly. The boy,
his hand still raised to strike, lowered it, and fondled Timmy’s head, making a
curious crooning noise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy!
Come here!’ ordered George, amazed and angry. To think that her dog, her very
own dog, should go to a boy who had been about to strike him!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
stood up, gave Wilfrid a lick, and went to George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy watched him, and then spoke to them all. ‘You can come and stay in my
cottage,’ he said, ‘if you’ll bring that dog too. There aren’t many dogs like
him - he’s a wonderful dog. I’d like him for one of my friends.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then,
without another word, Wilfrid sprang up and ran away down the hill, leaving
four most astonished people - and a dog who whined dismally because the boy had
gone. Well, well, Timmy - there must indeed by something about that boy, if you
stand looking after him as if you had lost one of your very best friends!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Five stared after Wilfrid in silence. Timmy wagged his tail and whined. He
wanted the boy to come back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
thank you, Timmy, old thing,’ said Anne, patting the big dog on the head. ‘We
certainly wouldn’t have had this lovely little cottage, with its incredible
view, if you hadn’t made friends with Wilfrid. What a funny boy he is!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Jolly
queer, I think!’ said George, still amazed at the way that Timmy had gone to
Wilfrid, when the boy had been about to strike him. ‘I’m not sure that I like
him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
be an ass, George,’ said Dick, who had been very much impressed by the boy’s
handling of the hares, the rabbits and the magpie. ‘That boy must have a
wonderful love for animals. They would never come to him as they did, if they
didn’t trust him absolutely. Anyone who loves animals as he does must be pretty
decent.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
bet I could make them come to me if I had that pipe,’ said George, making up
her mind to borrow it if she could.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
went back into the cottage. She was delighted with it. ‘It must be very very
old,’ she thought. ‘It stands dreaming here all day long, full of memories of
the people who have lived here and loved it. And how they must all have loved
this view - miles and miles of heather, great stretches of sea - and the
biggest, highest, widest sky I’ve ever seen. It’s a happy place. Even the
clouds seem happy - they’re scurrying along, so white against the blue!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
explored the cottage thoroughly. She decided that the room above, under the
thatch, should be for the three boys. There were two mattresses - one small,
one larger. ‘The little one for Wilfrid - the big one for Dick and Julian,’ she
thought. ‘And I and George can sleep down in the living-room, with Tim on
guard. I wonder if there are any rugs we could sleep on. Ah - wait a bit - this
couch is a pull-out bed - just right for us two girls! Good!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
enjoyed herself thoroughly. This was the kind of problem she liked - fixing up
this and that for the others! She found a little larder, facing north. It had a
few tins in it, and a jug of milk, slightly sour. It also had two loaves of
extremely stale bread, and a tin of rather hard cakes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mrs
Layman doesn’t seem to be a very good housekeeper for herself and Wilfrid,’
thought Anne, seriously. ‘We’ll have to go down to the village and put in a
stock of decent food. I might get a small ham - the boys would like that.
Goodness - this is going to be fun!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
came to the door to see what she was doing. When he saw her happy, serious
face, he chuckled. ‘Acting “mother” to us, as usual?’ he said. ‘Deciding who’s
going to sleep where, and which of us is to do the shopping, and which the
washing-up? Dear old Anne - what should we do without you when we go off on our
own?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
love it,’ said Anne, happily. ‘Julian, we need another rug or two, and a
pillow, and some food. And...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we’ll have to go back home and collect a few clothes and other things,’ said
Julian. ‘We can shop on the way back, and get whatever we want. I wonder if
that woman that Mrs Layman spoke about will be coming in to help?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- Wilfrid said he sent her off,’ said Anne. ‘And I think perhaps as the cottage
is so small, it might be better if we managed it ourselves. I think I could do
a bit of cooking on that oil-stove in the corner - and anyway we can pretty
well live on cold stuff, you know - ham and salad and potted meat and fruit. It
would be easy enough for any of us to pop down to the village on our bikes, to
fetch anything we needed.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Listen!’
said Julian, cocking his head to one side. ‘Is that somebody calling us?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yes
- it was. When Julian went outside, he saw Mrs Layman at the gate that led on
to the hillside where the cottage stood. He went over to her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
LOVE the cottage!’ he said. ‘And if it’s all right, we’d like to move in today.
We can easily pop home and bring back anything we want. It’s a glorious old
place, isn’t it - and the view must be the finest anywhere!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
that harbour is the second biggest stretch of water in the whole world,’ said
Mrs Layman. ‘The only stretch that is any bigger, is Sydney Harbour - so you
have something to feast your eyes on, Julian!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘My
word, yes,’ said Julian. ‘It’s amazing - and so very blue! I only wish I could
paint - but I can’t. At least - not very well!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
about Wilfrid?’ said Mrs Layman, anxiously. ‘Is he behaving himself? He’s -
well - he’s rather a dificult boy at times. And he can be very rude. He hasn’t
any brothers to rub off his awkward corners, you see.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
don’t you worry about Wilfrid!’ said Julian, cheerfully. ‘He’ll have to toe the
line, and do as he’s told. We all do our bit, when we’re away together. He’s a
wonder with animals, isn’t he?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- yes, I suppose he is!’ said Mrs Layman. ‘Though I can’t say I like pet
snakes, or pet beetles, and owls that come and hoot down the chimney at night
to find out if Wilfrid will go out and hoot back to them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
laughed. ‘We shan’t mind that,’ he said. ‘And he’s managed to get over what
might have been our biggest difficulty - he has made friends with our dog,
Timmy. In fact, he informed us that if Timmy stayed, we could all stay - but
only if Timmy stayed!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mrs
Layman laughed. ‘That’s so like Wilfrid,’ she said. ‘He’s an odd boy. Don’t
stand any nonsense from him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
shan’t,’ said Julian, cheerfully. ‘I’m surprised he wants to stay on with us,
actually. I should have thought he would rather go home, than be with a lot of
strangers.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
can’t go home,’ said Mrs Layman. ‘His sister has measles, and his mother
doesn’t want Wilfrid to catch it. So you’ll have to put up with him, I fear.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
he’ll have to put up with us!’ said Julian. ‘Thanks very much for letting us
have the cottage, Mrs Layman. We’ll take great care of everything.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
know you will,’ said the old lady. ‘Well, goodbye, Julian. Have a good time.
I’ll get back to my car now. Give Wilfrid my love. I hope he doesn’t fill the
cottage with animals of all kinds!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
shan’t mind if he does!’ said Julian, and waited politely until Mrs Layman had
disappeared, and he could hear the noise of a car starting up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went back to the cottage and stood outside, looking down at the amazing view.
The harbour was full of boats, big and little. A steamer went busily along,
making for a great seaside town far away on the other side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
came to join Julian. ‘Glorious, isn’t it?’ she said. ‘We’re so very high up
here that it seems as if we can see half the world at our feet. Is that an
island in the middle of the harbour, Ju?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- and a well-wooded one too!’ said Julian. ‘I wonder what it’s called - and who
lives there. I can’t see a single house there, can you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
called to Anne. ‘Anne! George and I are going to fetch our bikes and ride down
to the village. Give us your shopping list, will you? Julian, is there anything
special you want us to pack for you at home, and bring back, besides your
night-things and a change of clothes?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- don’t go off yet!’ called Julian, hurrying into the cottage. ‘I’ve made a
list somewhere. I think I’d better go with you. There will be food and other
things to bring back - unless Mother would bring everything up by car this
afternoon.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- that’s a good idea,’ said Dick. ‘We’ll go to Kirrin Cottage first and get George’s
things - and then home to get ours. I’ll leave all the shopping with Mother,
and all our luggage, so that she can pop up here in the car with it. She’ll
love the view!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
stay behind and tidy up the cottage, and find out how the stove works,’ said
Anne, happily. ‘I’ll have everything neat and tidy by the time Mother comes
this afternoon, Dick. Oh, here’s Julian with the list. Why don’t you go off on
your bike with George and Dick, Julian? I’ll be quite happy here, messing
about.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
I’m going to,’ said Julian, putting his list into his pocket. ‘Look after
yourself, Anne! We’ll take Timmy with us, to give him a run.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Off
went the three, Timmy loping behind, very glad of the run. Anne waited till
they were out of sight, then went happily back to the cottage. She was almost
there when she heard someone calling her. She turned and saw a fresh-faced
woman waving.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
Sally!’ she called. ‘Do you want any help with the cooking and cleaning?
Wilfrid told me not to come any more, but if you want me, I will.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
I think we can manage, Sally,’ said Anne. ‘There’s so many of us now, we can do
all the jobs. Did you sleep here?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no, miss!’ said Sally, coming up. ‘I just came in to help, and then went back
home. You tell me if you want me any time, and I’ll gladly come. Where’s that
monkey of a Wilfrid? He spoke to me very rudely this morning, the young
varmint. I’ll tell his grandmother of him - not that that’s much good! He just
laughs at her! Don’t you stand any nonsense from him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
won’t,’ said Anne, smiling. ‘Where do you live, in case we do want you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Just
the other side of the road, in the small wood there,’ said Sally. ‘You’ll see
my tiny cottage when you go by the wood on your bikes.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
disappeared up the hill and across the road there. Anne went back happily to
her household tasks. She cleaned out the little larder, and then found a pail
and went to the well. She hung the pail on the hook at the end of the rope, and
then worked the old handle that let the pail down to the water, swinging on the
rope. Splash! It was soon full, and Anne wound it up again. The water looked
crystal clear, and was as cold as ice - but all the same Anne wondered if she
ought to boil it!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Someone
came quietly behind her - and jumped at her with a loud howl! Anne dropped the
pail of water, and gave a scream. Then she saw it was Wilfrid, dancing round
her, grinning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Idiot!’
she said. ‘Now you just go and get me some more water.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
that big dog?’ demanded Wilfrid, looking all round. ‘I can’t see him. You can’t
any of you stay here unless you have that dog. I like him. He’s a wonderful
dog.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
gone down to the village with the others,’ said Anne. ‘Now will you please pick
up that pail and get more water?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
I won’t,’ said Wilfrid. ‘I’m not your servant! Get it yourself!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Very
well, I will. But I’ll tell George, who owns Timmy, how rude you are - and you
may be quite sure that Timmy won’t be friends with you,’ said Anne, picking up
the pail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
get the water, I’ll get the water!’ shouted Wilfrid, and snatched the pail.
‘Don’t you dare to tell George or Timmy tales of me. Don’t you dare!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
off he went to the well and filled the pail. Well! What a time they were all
going to have with such a very peculiar boy! Anne didn’t like him at all!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

IS MOST ANNOYING - AND ANNE IS MOST SURPRISING!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wilfrid
brought back the pail to Anne, and dumped it down. ‘Like to see my pet
beetles?’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
thank you,’ said Anne. ‘I don’t like beetles very much.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you ought to!’ said Wilfrid. ‘I’ve two very beautiful ones. You can hold them
if you like. Their tiny feet feel very queer when they walk all over your
hand.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t mind beetles, but I don’t WANT them walking over my hand,’ said poor
Anne, who really was a bit afraid of what she called ‘creepy-crawly’ things.
‘Do get out of my way, Wilfrid. If you had any manners, you’d carry that pail
indoors for me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
haven’t any manners,’ said Wilfrid. ‘Everybody tells me that. Anyway, I don’t
want to carry your pail, if you don’t want to see my beetles.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
go away!’ said Anne, exasperated, picking up the pail herself. Wilfrid went to
a little thick bush and sat down by it. He put his face almost on the grass,
and looked under the bush. Anne felt uncomfortable. Was he going to call his
beetles out? She couldn’t help putting down her pail, and standing still to
watch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>No
beetles came out from under the bush - but something else did. A very large,
awkward-looking toad came crawling out, and sat there, looking up at Wilfrid with
the greatest friendliness. Anne was amazed. How did Wilfrid know the toad was
there? And why in the world should it come out to see him? She stood and stared
- and shivered, because she really did not like toads. ‘I know they have
beautiful eyes, and are intelligent, and eat all kinds of harmful insects, but
I just can’t go near one!’ she thought. ‘Oh goodness - Wilfrid’s tickling its
back - and it’s scratching where he’s tickled it - just like we would!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
and say how do you do to my pet toad,’ called Wilfrid. ‘I’ll carry your pail
for you then.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
picked up her pail in a hurry, afraid that Wilfrid might whistle up a few
snakes next. What a boy! How she wished the others would come back! Why,
Wilfrid might own a boa constrictor - or have a small crocodile somewhere -
or... but no, she was being silly! If only the others would come back!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
her horror the toad crawled right on to Wilfrid’s hand, and looked up at him
out of its really beautiful eyes. That was too much for Anne. She fied into the
cottage, spilling half the water as she went.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wish I was like George,’ she thought. ‘She wouldn’t really mind that toad. I’m
silly. I ought to try and like all creatures. Oh my goodness, look at that
enormous spider in the corner of the sink! It’s sitting there, looking at me
out of its eight eyes! Wilfrid, Wilfrid - PLEASE come and get this spider out
of the sink for me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wilfrid
sauntered in, fortunately without the toad. He held his hand out to the spider
and made a curious clicking, ticking noise. The spider perked up at once, waved
two curious little antennae about, and crawled across the sink to Wilfrid’s
hand. Anne shuddered. She simply couldn’t help it! She shut her eyes, and when
she opened them, the spider had gone and so had Wilfrid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
suppose he’s now teaching it to dance, or something!’ she thought, trying to
make herself smile. ‘I can’t think how insects and animals and birds like him.
I simply can’t bear him. If I were a rabbit or bird or beetle, I’d run miles
away from him. What’s this curious attraction he has for creatures of all
kinds?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wilfrid
had completely disappeared, and Anne thankfully went on with her little jobs.
‘I’ll tidy up the loft where the boys will sleep,’ she thought. ‘I’ll wash this
living-room floor. I’ll make a list of the things in the larder. I’ll clean
that dirty window over there. I’ll... good gracious, what’s that noise?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was the sound of magpies chattering noisily - a harsh but pleasant noise. Anne
peered out of the little cottage window. Well, what a sight! There stood
Wilfrid in front of the window, a magpie on each outstretched hand - and one on
the top of his head! It stood there, chattering loudly, and then turned round
and round, getting its feet mixed up in the boy’s thick hair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
out here and I’ll tell one of my magpies to sit on your head too!’ shouted
Wilfrid. ‘It’s such a nice feeling. Or would you like a young rabbit to cuddle?
I can call one for you with my little pipe!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t want a magpie on my head,’ said Anne, desperately. ‘For goodness sake get
a nice little baby rabbit. I’d like that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wilfrid
jerked the magpies off his hands and shook his head violently so that the third
one flew up, squawking cheerfully. He then sat down and pulled out his queer
little whistle-pipe, as Anne called it. She watched, fascinated, as the strange
little dirgelike tune came to her ears. She found her feet walking to the door.
Good gracious - could there be some peculiar kind of magic in that pipe that
made her go to Wilfrid, just as the other creatures did?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
stopped at the door, just as a baby rabbit came lollopping round a tall clump
of grass. It was the funniest, roundest, dearest little thing, with a tiny
bobtail and big ears.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
went straight to Wilfrid and nestled against him. The boy stroked it and
murmured to it. Then he called to Anne softly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- here’s the baby rabbit you asked for. Like to come and stroke it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
went softly over the grass, expecting the rabbit to bolt at once. Wilfrid
continued to fondle it, and the little thing looked at him with big, unwinking
eyes. Anne bent down to stroke it - but immediately it leapt in fright and fled
into the grass.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
dear - why did it do that?’ said Anne, disappointed. ‘It was quite all right
with you! Wilfrid, how do you get all these creatures to come to you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shan’t
tell you,’ said Wilfrid, getting up. ‘Is there anything to eat in the cottage?
I’m hungry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
pushed Anne aside and went into the cottage. He opened the larder door, and
took down a tin. There was a cake inside and he cut off a huge piece. He didn’t
offer Anne any.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Couldn’t
you have cut me a piece too?’ said Anne. ‘You really are a rude boy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
like being rude,’ said Wilfrid, munching his cake. ‘Especially to people who
come to my cottage when I don’t want them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
don’t be so silly!’ said Anne, exasperated. ‘It isn’t your cottage - it belongs
to your grandmother. She told us so. Anyway, you said we could stay if Timmy
stayed too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
soon make Timmy my dog,’ said Wilfrid, taking another bite. ‘You’ll see! Soon he
won’t want that girl George any more - and he’ll follow at my heels all day and
night. You’ll see!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
laughed scornfully. Timmy following at this boy’s heels? That could never
happen! Timmy loved George with all his doggy heart. He would never desert her
for Wilfrid no matter how much he whistled on pipes, or put on his special
croony voice. Anne was absolutely certain of that!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
you laugh at me, I’ll call up my grass snake and my adder!’ said Wilfrid,
fiercely. ‘Then you’ll run for miles!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no I won’t!’ said Anne, hurrying into the cottage. ‘Just watch yourself run!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
picked up the pail of water, went out with it, and threw it all over the
astonished Wilfrid! Somebody else was most astonished too - and that was
Julian, who had arrived back before the others, anxious not to leave Anne alone
in the cottage for too long.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
came just in time to see Anne drenching Wilfrid, and stared in the utmost
amazement. Anne behaving like that? Anne looking really fierce - quiet,
peaceful Anne! What in the world had happened?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Anne!’
he called. ‘What’s the matter? What’s Wilfrid been doing?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
- Julian!’ said Anne, glad to see him, but horrified that he had come just
then. Wilfrid was drenched from head to foot. He stood there, gasping,
taken-aback, bewildered. Why, Anne had seemed such a quiet, frightened little
thing - scared even of a spider!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
girl!’ said Wilfrid, half-choking, shaking the water off himself. ‘That bad,
wicked girl! She’s like a tiger! She sprang at me, and threw the water all over
me! I won’t let her stay in my cottage!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy was so angry, so wet, so taken-aback, that Julian had to laugh! He roared
in delight, and clapped Anne on the back. ‘The mouse has turned into a tiger!
Well, you said you might one day, Anne - and you haven’t lost much time! Let me
see if you’ve grown claws!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
took Anne’s hands and pretended to examine her nails. Anne was half-laughing,
half-crying now, and pulled her hand away. ‘Oh Julian! I shouldn’t have soaked
Wilfrid - but he was SO IRRITATING I lost my temper, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right, all right - it’s quite a good thing to do sometimes,’ said Julian. ‘And
I bet young Wilfrid deserved all he got. I only hope the water was icy cold!
Have you a change of clothes here, Wilfrid? Go and get into them, then.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy stood there, dripping wet, and made no effort to obey. Julian spoke again.
‘You heard what I said, Wilfrid. Jump to it! Go and change!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy looked so wet and miserable that Anne felt suddenly sorry for what she had
done. She ran to him and felt his wet shoulders. ‘Oh, I’m sorry!’ she said. ‘I
truly am. I don’t know why I turned into a tiger so suddenly!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wilfrid
gave a little half-laugh, half-sob. ‘I’m sorry too,’ he mumbled. ‘You’re nice -
and your nose is like that baby rabbit’s - it’s - it’s a bit woffly!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
ran into the cottage and slammed the door. ‘Let him be for a while,’ said
Julian, seeing that Anne made a move to go after him. ‘This will do him good.
Nothing like having a pail of cold water flung over you to make you see things
as they really are! He was really touched when you said you were sorry. He’s
probably never apologized to anyone in his life!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
my nose like a rabbit’s?’ said Anne, worried.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
yes - just a bit,’ said Julian, giving his sister an affectionate pat. ‘But a
rabbit’s nose is very nice, you know - very nice indeed. I don’t think you’ll
have much trouble with Wilfrid after this little episode. He didn’t know that
you had the heart of a tiger, as well as a nose like a rabbit’s!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wilfrid
came out of the cottage in about ten minutes, dressed in dry clothes, carrying
his wet ones in a bundle. ‘I’ll hang those out on the bushes for you, to dry in
the sun,’ said Anne, and took them from him, smiling. He suddenly smiled back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thanks,’
he said. ‘I don’t know how they got so wet! Must have been pouring with rain!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
chuckled and smacked him gently on the back. ‘Rain can do an awful lot of good
at times!’ he said. ‘Well, Anne, we’ve brought you back a whole lot of goods
for your larder. Here come the others. We’ll carry everything in for you - with
Wilfrid’s help too!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was fun storing all the shopping away. Anne enjoyed it more than anyone, for
she really was a most domesticated little person.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
real home-maker!’ said Dick, appreciatively, when he saw how neat and
comfortable she had made the loft, where the three boys were to sleep. ‘Just
about room for the three of us, plus all the baggage in the corner! And how
good the larder looks!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
looked at her well-stored larder, and smiled. Now she could give her little
‘family’ really nice meals. All those tins! She read the names on them. ‘Fruit
salad. Tinned pears. Tinned peaches. Sardines. Ham. Tongue.’ A new cake in that
round tin, big enough to last for at least three days. Biscuits. Chocolate
wafers - good old Julian - he knew how much she loved those - and George did,
too!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
felt very happy, as she arranged all her goods. She no longer felt guilty at
drenching poor Wilfrid. Indeed she couldn’t help feeling a little thrill when
she remembered how she had suddenly turned into a tiger for a minute or two! It
was fun to be a tiger for once. ‘I might even be one again, if the chance
arose,’ thought Anne. ‘How surprised Wilfrid was - and Julian too. Oh dear - poor
Wilfrid. Still, he’s much nicer now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
indeed he was! He was most polite to both the girls, and, as Dick said, he
didn’t ‘throw his weight’ about nearly so much. They all settled down very well
together in the little cottage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had most of their meals out-of-doors, sitting on the warm grass. It was rather
a squeeze indoors, for the cottage really was very small. Anne enjoyed herself
preparing the meals, with sometimes a little help from George - and the boys
carried everything out. Wilfrid did his share, and was pleased when he had a
clap on the back from Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was glorious sitting out in the sun, high up on their hill. They could look
down on the harbour, watch the yachts and the busy little boats, and enjoy the
wonderful views all round.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was very curious about the island that lay in the middle of the harbour.
‘What’s it called?’ she asked Wilfrid. But he didn’t know. He did know,
however, that there was a queer story about it. ‘It belonged to a lonely old
man,’ he said. ‘He lived in a big house in the very middle of the wood. The
island was given to his family by a king - James the Second, I think. This old
man was the very very last one of his family. People kept wanting to buy his
island, and he had some kind of watchmen to keep people from landing on it.
These watchmen were pretty fierce - they had guns.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh
- did they shoot people who tried to land, then?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- they shot just to frighten them off, not to hurt them, I suppose,’ said
Wilfrid. ‘Anyway, a lot of sightseers had an awful fright when they tried to
land. BANG-BANG! Shooting all round them! My granny told me that someone she
knew, who had a lot of money, wanted to buy part of the island - and he had his
hat shot right off when his boat tried to land!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
there anyone there now?’ asked Julian. ‘I suppose the old fellow is dead? Has
he a son or anyone to follow him?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t think so,’ said Wilfrid. ‘But I don’t know an awful lot about it. I tell
you who does, though - one of the groundsmen on the golf-course, called Lucas.
He was once one of the watchmen who kept visitors away from the island.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
might be rather interesting to talk to him,’ said Dick. ‘I’d rather like to
walk over the golf-course, too. My father plays a good game of golf, and I know
something about it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
let’s go now,’ said George. ‘Timmy is longing for a good long walk, even though
he ran all the way down to the village and back today! Walk, Timmy? Walk?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof-woof,’
said Timmy, and leapt up at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Walk?
Of course he was ready for a walk! He leapt all round George, pretending to
pounce at her feet. Wilfrid tried to catch hold of him, but couldn’t. ‘I wish
you were my dog,’ he told Timmy. ‘I’d never let you out of my sight.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
ran up to him then, and gave him a loving lick. It was astonishing how he
seemed to like Wilfrid. Nobody could understand it. As George said, ‘Timmy is
usually so particular about making friends! Still, Wilfrid is nicer than he
was!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
Five, with Wilfrid too, went up the hill, crossed over the road that ran along
the top, and climbed over a stile. They found themselves on one of the fairways
of the golf-course, not far from a green, in which stood a pole with a bright
red flag waving at the top.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wilfrid
knew very little about the game of golf, but the others had watched their
parents play many a time. ‘Look out - someone’s going to pitch his ball on this
green,’ said Julian, and they stood by the hedge to watch the man play his
ball. He struck it beautifully with his club, and the ball rose, and fell right
on to the green. It rolled to within about a foot of the hole in which the
flag-pole stood.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
ran forward a few steps, as he always did when a ball rolled near him. Then he
remembered that this was golf, and he must never, never touch a ball on the
fairway or on the green.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
players passed by, and went on with their game. Then they disappeared, to play
off another tee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
let’s see if we can find Lucas now,’ said Wilfrid, crossing the fairway to
where he could get a good look over the course. ‘You’ll like him. There’s not
much he doesn’t know about the animals and birds here. I think he’s a wonderful
man!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wilfrid
stood on the slope of a hill and looked all round. ‘There he is!’ he said,
pointing to where a man was trimming up a ditch. ‘See? Down there. He’s using
his bill-hook to make things tidy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went down the hill towards the ditch at the bottom. ‘I bet there’s an awful lot
of balls in that ditch,’ said Wilfrid. ‘Hey, Lucas! How are you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Afternoon,
young sir,’ said the groundsman, turning towards them. His face was as brown as
a well-ripened nut, and his arms and shoulders were even browner. He wore no
shirt or vest, and his dark, deep-set eyes twinkled as they took in the five
children and the dog.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
held out a brown hand to Timmy, who licked it gravely, wagging his tail. Then
Timmy smelt Lucas all over and finally lay down with his head on the man’s
feet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ha!’
said Lucas to Timmy, and gave a loud, hearty laugh. ‘Think I’m a-going to stand
here all afternoon, do you? Well, I aren’t. I got work to do, ole dog, so git
up! You’re a right good-un, you are, a-laying on my foot, so’s I can’t move a
step! Want me to stop and have a rest, don’t you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Lucas,
we came to ask you something,’ said Wilfrid. ‘About the island in the harbour.
What’s its name - and does anyone live there now?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
can see it from that little cottage almost at the top of the hill on the other
side of the road,’ said Dick. ‘It looks awfully quiet and lonely.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
so it is,’ said Lucas, sitting down on the bank of the ditch. Timmy at once sat
up beside him, sniffing him with pleasure. He put his arm round the dog, and
began to talk, his bright eyes going from one to other of the children. He was
so friendly, and so completely natural that the children felt he was an old,
old friend. They sat down too, sniffing the smell of the gorse bushes nearby.
‘They smell like coconut,’ thought Anne. ‘Yes - just like coconut!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
now,’ said Lucas, ‘that island’s always been a mystery-place. It’s called
Wailing Island by some folks because the wind makes a right queer wailing noise
round some of its high cliffs. And others call it Whispering Island because
it’s full of trees that whisper in the strong winds that always blow across it.
But most of us call it Keep-Away Island - and that’s the best name of all, for
there’s never been any welcome there, what with the dark cliffs, the cruel
rocks, and the dense woods.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Lucas
paused, and looked at the listening faces around him. He was a born
story-teller, and knew it. How often Wilfrid had listened to his tales of the
birds and animals he met during his work on the course! Lucas was one of the
few people that the boy admired and loved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
go on, Lucas!’ said Wilfrid, touching the man’s bare, warm arm. ‘Tell us about
the rich old man who hated everyone, and bought the island years ago.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
telling the story my own way,’ said Lucas, with great dignity. ‘You sit patient
now, or I’ll start my ditching again. Sit like this dog, see - he don’t even
twitch a muscle, good dog that he is. Well now, about this rich old man. He was
so afraid of being robbed that he bought that lonely island. He built himself a
great castle right in the middle of the thick woods. Cut down about a hundred
trees, to make room for it, so the story goes, and brought every single stick
and stone from the mainland. Did you see the old quarry on this here
golf-course, as you came along to me?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
we did,’ said Julian, remembering. ‘I felt sorry for anyone who sent a
golf-ball there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
young sir, out of that quarry came the great stones that the old man used for
his castle,’ said Lucas. ‘’Tis said that big, Hat-bottomed boats had to be made
to ferry the stones across to the island - and to this day the road through
this golf-course is the one made by horses dragging the great stones down to
the water’s-edge.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Were
you alive then?’ said Wilfrid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Bless
you, boy, no, of course not,’ said Lucas, with a great chuckle of a laugh.
‘Long afore my time, that was. Well, the stone house - or castle - whatever you
like to call it - was built. And the old man brought to it all kinds of
treasures - beautiful statues, some of gold, it was said, but that I
disbelieve. Ah, many’s the queer tale I’ve heard of what that rich old man took
over to Whispering Island - a great bed made of pure gold, and set with
precious stones - a necklace of rubies as big as pigeons’ eggs - a wonderful
sword with a jewelled handle worth a king’s fortune - and other things I
disremember.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
paused and looked round. Julian asked him a quick question. ‘What happened to
all these things?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
now, he fell foul of the king of the land, and one morning what did he see
landing on the shores of his island but ships of all kinds,’ said Lucas,
enjoying the rapt attention of his audience. ‘A lot of them were sunk by the
wicked rocks but enough men were left to storm the queer stone castle in the
wood, and they killed the old man and all his servants.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Did
they find the treasures the old fellow had collected?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Never
a one!’ said Lucas. ‘Never a one. Some say it was all a tale - the old man
never did bring any wonders there - and some say they’re still there, on
Whispering Island. Meself, I think it’s all a yarn - but a good yarn at that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who
owns the island now?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
an old fellow and his wife went to live there-maybe they paid rent to the Crown
for it, maybe they bought it - but they didn’t care for anything except for the
birds and the animals there,’ said Lucas, picking up his curved bill-hook
again, and hacking lightly at some briars. ‘They wouldn’t allow nobody there,
and it was they who kept the gamekeepers with guns to frighten away sightseers.
They wanted peace and quiet for themselves, and for all the wildlife on the
island - and a fine idea too. Many a time when I was there with the other
keepers - three of us there were - many a time I’ve had rabbits gambolling over
my feet, and snakes gliding by me - and the birds as tame as canaries.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’d
love to go there,’ said Wilfrid, his eyes shining. ‘I’d have a good time with
all the wild creatures! Can anyone go there now?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said Lucas, getting up. ‘Not a soul has lived in the old stone castle since the
old man and his wife fell ill and died. The place is empty. The island belongs
to a great-nephew of the old couple now, but he never goes there. Just keeps a
couple of men on the island to frighten off visitors - pretty fierce they are,
so I’ve been told. Well, there you are, that’s the story of Whispering Island -
not very pleasant - a bit grim and ugly. It belongs to the birds and the beasts
now, and good luck to them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thank
you for telling us the story,’ said Anne, and the old countryman smiled down at
her, his eyes wrinkling, and his brown hand patting her cheek.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
be off to my hedging and ditching again,’ he said, ‘and I’ll feel the sun warm
on my bare back, and hear the birds a-singing to me from the bushes. That’s
happiness enough for anyone - and pity it is that more folks don’t know it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children walked round the golf-course together, after talking to old Lucas. ‘We
must keep out of the way of anyone playing,’ said Dick, ‘or we might get hit on
the head with a ball! Hey, Timmy, what are you doing in the bracken?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
came out with something in his mouth. He dropped it at George’s feet. It was a
golf-ball, fairly new. George picked it up. ‘What do we do with this?’ she
said. ‘There’s no golfer near us. It must be a lost ball.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
all balls lost on golf-courses should be taken in to the pro,’ said Julian. ‘By
right they belong to him if found on the course.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
a pro?’ asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
professional golfer - a man who’s very very good at the game, and is in charge
of a golf-course,’ explained Julian. ‘Well I’m blessed - here comes old Tim
again with another ball. Timmy, we ought to hire you out to golfers who keep
losing their balls - you’d save them no end of trouble!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was pleased to be patted and praised. He set off into the rough again at once,
sniping here and there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Anyone
would think that golf-balls smelt like rabbits or something, the way Timmy
sniffs them out!’ said Anne, as Timmy ran up with yet another ball. ‘My word,
golfers must be jolly careless, losing so many balls!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went on round the course, which was set with great stretches of gorse, full of
brilliant blossom. A baby rabbit fled from the bracken as Timmy nosed there for
balls. Timmy chased it, and the frightened little creature dodged this way and
that, trying to escape. ‘Let it go, Tim, let it go!’ yelled George, but Timmy
was much too excited to pay any attention.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wilfrid
suddenly bent down as the rabbit raced near him, and gave a curious low
whistle. The rabbit swerved, came straight towards him, and leapt into his
arms, lying there trembling. Timmy jumped up to it at once, but George dragged
him away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘NO,
Timmy. Sorry, but NO, you can’t have the little thing. Down! DOWN, I say!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
gave George a disgusted look, and pattered off into the bracken, nosing for
balls again. He was very cross with George. Rabbits were meant to be chased,
weren’t they? Why did George have to spoil his fun?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
stared at Wilfrid. The rabbit was still nestling in his arms, and he was making
a curious noise to it. The tiny thing was trembling from head to tail. Everyone
watched it, glad that it was safe. They were all silent, astonished at the way
that Wilfrid had rescued the little creature. How had the rabbit known that
Wilfrid’s arms were ready to save it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
took it to the bracken, dropped it gently, and watched it race like lightning
to the nearest burrow. Then he turned and patted Timmy, who stood silently by,
watching.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sorry,
Tim,’ he said. ‘It’s so little, and you’re so big!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Tim, exactly as if he understood, and he gave Wilfrid’s hand a quick lick.
Then he pranced round the boy, barking, as if he wanted a game, and Wilfrid
raced off with him at top speed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others followed, impressed once again by Wilfrid’s uncanny way with animals. He
was such a horrid little boy in some ways - so rude, so mannerless, so selfish
- then how was it that animals liked him so much? George frowned. She thought
it was all wrong that animals should love Wilfrid and go to him - why, even
Timmy was all over him! If she wasn’t careful he would spend more time with Wilfrid
than with her! That would never do!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
found five more balls, and soon Julian’s pockets were heavy with them. They
made their way to the small club-house in the distance, meaning to give in the
balls. It was set in a little dip, and looked friendly and welcoming. They all
went in at the door, and Julian walked over to the pro, who was checking some
score-cards. He emptied his pockets of balls and grinned. ‘A present from our
dog!’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘My
word - did he find all those?’ said the pro, pleased. ‘Not bad ones, either.
I’ll stand you all some lemonade or orangeade - which will you have?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all had orangeade, and the pro sent a packet of biscuits to Timmy, who was
waiting patiently outside. He was delighted!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’re
staying in that little cottage up on the hillside,’ said Dick. ‘Do you know
it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Course
I do!’ said the pro. ‘My grandmother lived there once upon a time. You’ve a
wonderful view there, haven’t you? One of the finest in the world, I reckon!
You can see Whispering Island from there, too. Ought to be called “Mystery
Island”! It’s said that folks have gone there, and never come back!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
happened to them?’ asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
well - maybe it’s all a tale!’ said the pro. ‘There’s supposed to be priceless
things there, packed away somewhere - and collectors from all over the world
have come here, and tried to get over to that island - not to steal, you
understand, but just to see if they could find anything worth-while and buy it
for museums - or maybe for their own collections. It’s said there are statues
in the wood, white as snow - but that I never did believe!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
didn’t the collectors ever come back?’ asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
said that a lot of them didn’t,’ said the pro, ‘but that may be all silly
tales. But I do know that two men came down here from some museum in London,
and hired a boat to go across. They took a white flag with them so that the two
keepers wouldn’t shoot at them - and after that nobody heard a word about them.
They just disappeared!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- what could have happened to them?’ asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nobody
knows,’ said the pro. ‘Their boat was found miles out to sea, drifting - and
empty. So the police reckoned a mist came down, they lost direction, and ended
by drifting way out to sea.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
did they jump out of their boat, and try to swim back - and get drowned?’ asked
Dick. ‘Or did a passing steamer or yacht save them?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
weren’t picked up, that’s certain,’ said the pro. ‘Else they’d have arrived
safely back at their homes, sometime or other. But they didn’t. No - I reckon
the poor fellows were drowned. Of course, maybe they were shot by the keepers,
when they tried to land, and their boat was set adrift!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Didn’t
the police do anything?’ asked Julian, puzzled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes - they went across to the island in the coastguard patrol boat,’ said the
pro. ‘But the keepers swore they’d seen nobody arriving, and that they were the
only people on the place. The police landed and searched everywhere, and they
found nothing except the great white castle-like house in the woods and
hundreds of wild animals, so tame that they’d sit and watch you as you walked
by.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
very mysterious,’ said Julian, getting up. ‘Well, thanks for the welcome
orangeade, and for your information! We’d already heard a bit from a groundsman
of yours - Lucas - a real old countryman, and a born story-teller!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah,
Lucas - yes, he knows that island well,’ said the pro. ‘He was once one of the
keepers, I believe! Well - come and see me again some time - thanks for the
balls. It isn’t everyone who’s honest enough to come and give them in when they
find them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all said good-bye and went out. Timmy pranced along in joy. Sitting down
outside the clubhouse didn’t suit him at all!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Did
you enjoy your biscuits, Tim?’ asked George, and he ran up and gave her hand a
quick lick. What a question! He always enjoyed biscuits! He ran off into the
bracken and began to nose about there again, hunting for balls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others went to walk up the hill, talking about the island. ‘I wonder what
really did happen to those two collector men who were never heard of again,’
said Anne. ‘Funny that their boat was found adrift and empty.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
must have been drowned, of course,’ said Dick. ‘I wonder if anything is left of
the old treasures that were once taken there. No - there wouldn’t be - the
police would have made a very thorough search!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wish we could go to the island!’ said George. ‘I don’t expect the keepers would
shoot at us, would they? They might even let us on, to make a change for them -
they must be so bored with only themselves to talk to.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
very wishful thinking, George,’ said Julian. ‘We are CERTAINLY not going near
the island, so put that right out of your head.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- I knew it was impossible, really,’ said George. ‘But wouldn’t it be a grand
adventure if we managed to get on the mysterious Whispering Island and explore
it without the keepers knowing!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
such a grand adventure if we were all peppered with shot from the keepers’
guns!’ said Dick. ‘Anyway, we wouldn’t find anything of interest - the
treasures must have been removed long ago. The only possible things of interest
would be the very tame wild creatures there! Wilfrid would go mad with joy -
wouldn’t you Wilfrid?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’d
like it very much,’ said the boy, his eyes shining. ‘What’s more, I might hire
a boat myself and row round the island to see if I could spot any animals
there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’ll
do nothing of the sort!’ said Julian, at once. ‘So don’t try any silly tricks,
see?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
shan’t promise!’ said Wilfrid, irritatingly. ‘You just never know!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes, I do know! You’re just trying to sound big!’ said Julian. ‘Come along
quickly, everyone - it’s past our dinner-time, and I’m ravenous! What’s for
lunch, Anne?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
open a tin of tongue,’ said Anne, ‘and there’s plenty of bread left, and lettuce,
which I left in water. And tomatoes. And heaps of fruit.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sounds
good!’ said George. ‘Dinner, Timmy, dinner!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And,
hearing that welcome word, Timmy shot up the steep hill at top speed, his tail
waving joyously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wish
I was a dog and could tear up a hill like that!’ said Anne, panting. ‘Give me a
push, Julian! I’ll never get to the top!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was waiting for the children at the top of the hill, his tail waving, his mouth
open as he panted. He picked something up, as the children came, threw it into
the air, and caught it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Another
golf-ball, Timmy?’ said Dick, as Timmy threw the ball into the air again with a
toss of his big head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
- it’s too big for that,’ said George. ‘Drop it, Timmy. What have you found?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
dropped the ball at George’s feet. It was bigger than a golf-ball, and had a
hole right through it. ‘Oh, it’s one of those balls that children throw up and
try to catch on a stick,’ said George. ‘Somebody must have dropped it. All
right, Tim, you can have it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
won’t swallow it, will he?’ said Wilfrid, anxiously. ‘It’s not awfully big -
and I once saw a dog swallow something by mistake, that he threw into the air
to catch.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy’s
much too sensible to swallow any ball,’ said George. ‘You needn’t worry about
him. Anyway, I can do any worrying necessary. He’s my dog.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right, all right, all right!’ said Wilfrid. ‘Miss High-and-Mighty can look
after her own dog. Fine!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
looked round at him furiously and he made a face at her. Then he whistled to
Timmy - yes, he actually dared to whistle to him!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nobody
whistles for my dog except me,’ said George. ‘And anyway, he won’t come to
you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But,
to her surprise and horror, Timmy did go to Wilfrid, and pranced all round him,
expecting a game. George called him sternly, and he looked at her in surprise.
He began to trot over to her when Wilfrid whistled again, and obediently Timmy
turned as if to go to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
caught hold of the dog’s collar, and aimed a punch at the whistling boy. It
missed him, and he danced round, laughing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Stop
it now, you two,’ said Julian, seeing George’s look of fury. ‘I said STOP IT!
Wilfrid, go on ahead, and keep going. George, don’t be an ass. He’s only
teasing you to make you lose your temper. Don’t please him by losing it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
said nothing more, but her eyes blazed. Oh dear! thought Anne, now we shan’t
have any peace! She won’t forgive Wilfrid for making Timmy go to him! Blow
Wilfrid - he really is a little pest at times.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were all very hungry for their lunch and very pleased with everything that Anne
provided. Dick went into the little cottage to help her, because George
insisted on keeping her hand on Timmy’s collar all the time, in case Wilfrid
should entice him to his side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
making some of his peculiar noises now,’ said Dick to Anne. ‘Noises that
animals can’t seem to resist! I don’t wonder that George has got Timmy tightly
by the collar! I’m not a dog, but I find those little whiny noises Wilfrid is
making very curious indeed, and I’d love to go nearer!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I hope we’re not going to have black looks from George from now on,’ said Anne.
‘Wilfrid’s an awful little idiot at times, and MOST irritating - but he’s not
bad underneath, if you know what I mean.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I don’t really,’ said Dick, cutting some tomatoes in half. ‘I think he’s a
badly brought-up little pest - and if I were a dog, I’d bite him, not fawn on
him! Have I cut up enough tomatoes, Anne?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
gracious, yes!’ said Anne. ‘However many do you think we’re going to eat -
forty or fifty? Look, you open this tin for me, Dick. I do so hate opening
tins. I nearly always cut myself.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
you ever open one again, then,’ said Dick. ‘I’m the official tin-opener from
now on! Dear old Anne, whatever should we do without you! You take everything
on your shoulders, and we just let you! George ought to help more. She’s a girl
like you - but she never gets the meals or anything. I’ll tick her off one of
these days.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
don’t,’ said Anne, in alarm. ‘I like doing things on my own. George would only
break things or upset them. She’s as ham-handed as a boy when it comes to
washing up or setting out crockery though she means well.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
boys are ham-handed, are they?’ said Dick, pretending to be offended. ‘When
have I ever broken anything, I’d like to know? I’m as careful as any girl, when
I handle crockery!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Alas
for Dick! The glass he was holding suddenly slipped from his hand, fell to the
floor, and broke! Anne looked at him and gave a sudden delighted giggle. ‘Old
Ham-hand!’ she said. ‘Can’t pick up a glass without dropping it! Look, take out
this tray for me, and for goodness sake don’t drop that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all had a delicious lunch, and ate practically everything. Wilfrid sat a little
away from everyone, scattering crumbs around as he ate. Birds of all kinds were
soon round him, even hopping on to his hands. A magpie flew down to his left
shoulder. Wilfrid greeted it like an old friend. ‘Hallo, Maggie Pie! How’s the
family? I hope Polly Pie has recovered from her cold. And is Peter Pie’s bad
leg better? And what about old Granpa Pie - does he still chase you young
ones?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
magpie put its glossy head on one side and chattered back to him in
bird-language, which Wilfrid appeared to understand. He stroked the bird’s
gleaming breast, and fondled it lovingly. George deliberately didn’t watch. She
turned her back on Wilfrid and the magpie, and talked to Timmy. The others
couldn’t help being amused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
magpie put Wilfrid’s conversation to an end very suddenly. The boy was about to
put half a tomato into his mouth when the bird bent down its head and snatched
away the tomato with its powerful beak. Then it rose quickly into the air on
its big wings, making a noise exactly as if it were laughing!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
roared with laughter except the surprised Wilfrid. ‘He’s gone to take your
tomato to Polly Pie, I should think,’ said Anne, and that made everyone laugh
again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
have another tomato now, please,’ said Wilfrid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sorry.
You’re unlucky. They’re all gone,’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was lovely sitting up on the hillside, watching the boats in the harbour, and
seeing the beautiful, white-sailed yachts bending to and fro in the strong wind
that blew there. They could all see Whispering Island quite clearly, and
noticed that no boats went anywhere near it. Clearly everyone knew that men
might be there, watching for intruders.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
might be badgers there,’ said Wilfrid, suddenly. ‘I’ve never been really close
to a badger.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
shouldn’t think anyone but you would want to be!’ said George. ‘Smelly things!
There’s one thing - you can’t call one with your whistle-pipe - there aren’t
any here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wilfrid
- get out your pipe and make the little rabbits come again,’ said Anne,
suddenly. ‘While we’re all sitting here quietly. Would they come?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
I think so,’ said Wilfrid, and felt in his pocket. He felt in another pocket,
and looked worried. Then he stood up and patted himself all over, looking
really distressed. He stared round at the others, anguish on his face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
gone,’ he said. ‘I must have lost it! It’s gone! I’ll never have another like
it, never.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
it must be in one of your pockets,’ said Dick, touched by the look on the boy’s
face. ‘Here, let me feel.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
no - the pipe wasn’t there. Wilfrid looked as if he were about to burst into
tears. He began to hunt all round, and everyone helped him. No - not quite
everyone. George didn’t. Dick glanced at her, and frowned. George was pleased
that the precious pipe was lost. How she must dislike poor Wilfrid! Well, he
was dislikeable at times, no doubt about it - but he was so distressed now that
surely nobody could help feeling sorry for him!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
got up and began to clear away the remains of the meal. She carried plates and
glasses to the hut, and after a while Anne followed her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
sorry for poor old Wilfrid, aren’t you?’ she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
I’m not,’ said George, shortly. ‘Serves him right! I hope he never finds his
silly pipe. That will teach him not to try and get Timmy away from me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
don’t be silly! He only does it for fun!’ said Anne, shocked. ‘Why do you take
things so seriously, George? You know Timmy loves you better than anyone in the
world and always will. He’s your dog and nobody, nobody else’s! Wilfrid’s only
teasing you when he tries to get Timmy to go to him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy
goes, though,’ said George, desperately. ‘And he shouldn’t. He shouldn’t.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
can’t help it, I think,’ said Anne. ‘Wilfrid has some peculiar attraction for
animals - and that little whistle-pipe of his is like a magic call to them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
glad it’s gone!’ said George. ‘Glad, glad, glad!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Then
I think you’re silly and unkind,’ said Anne, and walked off, knowing that she
could do nothing with George in this mood. She worried a little as she went.
Did George know where the pipe was? Had she found it - and hidden it - or
destroyed it? No - no! George could be difficult and unkind at times, but she
wasn’t mean. And what a mean thing it would be, to destroy the beautiful little
pipe, with its magic trills!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
went back to the others, meaning to try and comfort Wilfrid - but he wasn’t
there. ‘Where’s he gone?’ asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘To
look for his precious whistle-pipe,’ said Dick. ‘He’s really heartbroken about
it, I think. He says he’s going to walk back the way we came from the
golf-course, and then he’s going to walk everywhere there that we walked this
morning, and hunt and hunt. He’s even going down to the club-house to see if he
dropped it there. He’ll never find it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Poor
old Wilfrid!’ said Anne, tender-hearted as ever. ‘I wish he’d waited for me.
I’d have gone with him. He’s awfully upset, isn’t he? Won’t he be able to call
the wild animals to him any more?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
no idea,’ said Dick. ‘Er - I suppose old George doesn’t know anything about it?
Perhaps that’s a mean thing to say - but George might have found it and kept it
just for a joke.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
No, I don’t think she’d do that,’ said Anne; ‘It would be a very poor joke.
Well - we’ll just have to hope Wilfrid finds it. What are you going to do this
afternoon? Sleep, by the look of you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- sleep out in the warm sun here, till three o’clock,’ said Julian. ‘Then I’m
going for a walk - down to the harbour. I might even have a bathe.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
all go,’ said Dick, sleepily. ‘Oh how lovely it is to feel lazy - and warm -
and well-fed - and sleeeeeeeepy! So long, everyone! I’m asleep!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

up in our room, chucked into a corner,’ said Dick, sleepily. ‘Gosh, I was sound
asleep. I really thought I was in my bed, when I awoke!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
went to fetch the bath-towels and the bathing things. She called back to the
boys. ‘I’ve got everything. Buck up, Julian, don’t go to sleep again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right!’
said Julian, sitting up and stretching himself. ‘Oh this sun - it’s GLORIOUS!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
poked Dick with his toe. ‘Get up! We’ll leave you behind if you snore again.
George, good-bye - we’re going!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
sat up, yawning, and Timmy stood over her and licked her cheek. She patted him.
‘All right, Timmy, I’m ready. It’s so warm that I’m LONGING for a dip - and
you’ll love it too, Tim!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Carrying
their bathing-things they made their way down the hill, and across a stretch of
moorland to the edge of the sea, Timmy running joyously behind them. Beyond lay
Whispering Island, a great tree-clad mass, and all around and about little
boats plied, and yachts sailed in the wind, enjoying themselves in the great
harbour which stretched far beyond the island to a big seaside town on the
opposite coast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four went behind some rocks, and stripped off their clothes, emerging three
minutes later in their scanty bathing things. Anne raced to the edge of the
water, and let it lap over her toes. ‘Lovely!’ she said ‘It’s not a bit cold! I
shall enjoy my swim!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof!’
said Timmy and plunged into the water. He loved the sea too, and was a fine
swimmer! He waited for George to come in and then swam to her. She put her arms
round his neck and let him drag her along with him. Dear Timmy! How strong he
was, thought George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had a wonderful time in the water. Further out the waves were big, and curled
over like miniature waterfalls, sweeping the children along with them. They
yelled in joy, and choked when the water splashed into their mouths. It was an
ideal day for bathing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
they came out, they lay on the sand in the sun, Timmy beside George, keeping
guard as usual. It was really warm. George sat up and looked longingly out to
sea, where the wind was whipping up the waves tremendously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wish
we had a boat!’ she said. ‘If we were back home, I could get out my own boat,
and we could go out in the cool breeze and get dry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
pointed lazily to a big notice not far off. It said ‘BOATS FOR HIRE. INQUIRE AT
HUT.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
good!’ said George. ‘I’ll go and inquire. I’d love a good row!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
slipped on her sandals, and went to the hut to which the sign pointed. A boy of
about fifteen sat there, staring out to sea. He looked round as George came
along.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Want
a boat?’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
please. How much?’ asked George. ‘For four of us - and a dog.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Fifty
pence an hour,’ said the boy. ‘Or a pound a day. Or three pounds a week. Better
to take it by the week if you’re staying here. It works out very cheap then.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
went back to the boys and Anne. ‘Shall we take the boat by the week?’ she said.
‘It’ll cost three pounds. We could do lots of rowing about, and it would be
fun.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Dick. ‘Anyone got any money?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
some in my pocket, but not enough, I’m afraid,’ said Julian. ‘I’ll go and fix
up the boat for us to have tomorrow - we’ll take it for a whole week. I can
easily bring the money with me in the morning.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boat-boy was very obliging. ‘You can have the boat today and onwards, if you
like, you needn’t wait till tomorrow,’ he said. ‘I know you’ll bring me the
money all right! So, if you’d like to have it this afternoon, it’s up to you.
Choose which boat you like. They’re all the same. If you want to take it out at
night too, and do some fishing, you can - but tie it up safe, won’t you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course,’ said Julian, going to look at the boats. He beckoned to the others,
and they all came over.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Any
boat we like, day or night!’ said Julian. ‘Which do you fancy? Starfish -
Splasho - Adventure - Sea-gull - Rock-a-bye? They all look good, sound little
boats to me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’d
like “Adventure”, I think,’ said George, thinking that that particular little
boat looked sturdy, deari and sound. ‘Nice name - and nice little boat!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
Adventure it was! ‘And a jolly good name for any boat of ours!’ said Dick,
pushing it down to the sea with Julian. ‘Whooooosh! There she goes! Steady my
beauty - we want to get in! Chuck in all our clothes, George! We can dress when
we feel cold.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
they were all in the boat, bobbing about on the waves. Julian took the oars and
pulled out to sea. Now they were in the full breeze - and a spanking one it was
too! ‘I’m certainly not hot any more!’ said George, pulling her bathing-towel
round her shoulders.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
tide was running out, and pulled the boat strongly out to sea. Whispering
Island suddenly seemed very much nearer! ‘Better look out!’ said George,
suddenly. ‘We don’t know if a keeper’s on guard somewhere on the shore of the
island. We’re getting pretty near.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the out-going tide swept the boat on and on towards the island, so that very
soon they could see a sandy shore. Dick then took one oar, and Julian the
other, and they tried to row against the tide and take the boat back into
calmer water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was no good. The tide was far too strong. Very soon the boat was quite near the
shore of the island and then an enormous wave flung them right up the sand, and
left the boat grounded as it went back again. It slid over to one side, and
they all promptly fell out!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Whew!’
said Julian. ‘What a tide! I’d no idea it ran so strongly, or I’d never have
brought the boat out so far.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
shall we do!’ said Anne, rather scared. She kept looking all round for a keeper
with a gun. Suppose they got into real trouble through coming right on to the
island?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think we’ll have to stay on the island till the tide turns, and we can row back
on it,’ said Julian. ‘I can’t think why that boat-boy didn’t warn us about the
tide. I suppose he thought we knew.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
pulled the boat a little further up on the firm sand, took out their bundle of
clothes, and hid them under a bush. They walked up the beach towards a wood,
thick with great trees. As they neared them, they heard a strange, mysterious
sound.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Whispering!’
said George, stopping. ‘The trees are really whispering. Listen! It’s just as
if they were talking to one another under their breath! No wonder it’s called
Whispering Island!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t like it much,’ said Anne. ‘It almost sounds as if they’re saying nasty
things about us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shooey,
shooey, shooey, shooey!’ said the trees, nodding towards one another as the
wind shook them. ‘Shooey, shooey!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Just
the noise of whispering!’ said George. ‘Well - what do we do now? We’ll have to
wait an hour or two till the tide turns again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shall
we explore?’ said Dick. ‘After all, we’ve got Timmy with us. No one is likely
to attack us if they see him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
can shoot him, can’t they, if they have guns?’ said George. ‘If he growled one
of his terrifying growls, and ran at them, showing his teeth, they’d be scared
to bits, and fire at him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think you’re right,’ said Julian, angry with himself for landing them all into
what might be serious trouble. ‘Keep your hand on Timmy’s collar, George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
know what I think?’ said Dick suddenly. ‘I think we ought to try and find the
guards, and tell them the tide swept us on to the island quite by accident - we
couldn’t stop the boat surging on! We’re not grown-ups, come to snoop around,
so they’re sure to believe us - and we’d be safe from any chasing or shooting
then.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all looked at Julian. He nodded. ‘Yes - good idea. Give ourselves up, and ask
for help! After all, we hadn’t any real intention of actually landing - the
tide simply threw the boat into that sandy cove!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
they walked up to the back of the cove and into the wood, whose whispering was
very loud indeed, once they were actually among the trees. No one was to be
seen. The wood was so thick that it was in parts quite difficult to clamber
through. After about ten minutes very hard walking and clambering, Julian came
to a stop. He had seen something through the trees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others pressed behind him. Julian pointed in front, and the others saw what
looked like a great grey wall, made of stone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
old castle, I imagine!’ Julian whispered, and at once the trees themselves
seemed to whisper even more loudly! They all made their way to the wall, and
walked alongside it. It was a very high wall indeed, and they could hardly see
the top! They came to a corner and peeped round. A great courtyard lay there -
quite empty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Better
shout, I think,’ said Dick, beginning to feel rather creepy, but before they
could do that two enormous men suddenly came down a flight of great stone
steps. They looked so fierce, that Timmy couldn’t help giving a blood-curdling
growl. They stopped short at once, and looked all round, startled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
noise came from over there,’ said one of the men, pointing to his left - and,
to the children’s great relief, both swung off in the wrong direction!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’d
better get back to the cove,’ whispered Julian. ‘I don’t at all like the look
of those men - they look proper thugs. Quiet as you can, now. George, don’t let
Timmy bark.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
made their way back beside the stone wall, through the whispering trees, and
there they were, at the cove.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’d
better row back as quickly as we can,’ said Julian. ‘I think something’s wrong
here. Those men looked like foreigners. They certainly weren’t game-keepers. I
wish we hadn’t come.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ju
- where’s our boat?’ said Dick, in a shocked voice. ‘It’s gone. This can’t be
the right cove!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others stared round. Certainly there was no boat! They must have come to the
wrong cove.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
looks the same cove to me,’ said George. ‘Except that the sea has come in a bit
more. Do you think it took our boat away - gosh, look at that big wave sweeping
right in - and sucking back!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘My
word, yes! Our boat could easily have been dragged out on a wave like that!’
said Julian, very worried. ‘Look out - here comes another!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
is the same cove!’ said Anne, looking under a bush at the back. ‘Here are our
clothes, look! We hid them here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Take
them out quickly!’ called Julian, as another big wave swept right in. ‘What an
idiot I am! We should have pulled our boat as far up as we could.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
cold now,’ said Anne. ‘I’m going to dress. It will be easier to carry a
bathing-suit than a heap of clothes!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
idea!’ said Dick, and they all promptly dressed, feeling warmer at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
might as well leave our bathing-things under the bush where we left our
clothes,’ said George. ‘At least we’ll know it’s the same cove, if we find them
there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
thing is - what are we going to do now?’ said Julian, worried. ‘No boat to get
back in - and why on earth did we choose one called Adventure! We might have
known something would happen!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
went to the mouth of the cove and looked out over the waves, hoping that he
might see their boat bobbing somewhere. ‘I could swim out to it if so,’ he
thought, ‘and bring it in. No - there’s not a sign of a boat! I could kick
myself for being so careless!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
came up, looking worried. ‘I suppose it’s too far to swim back to the mainland,
isn’t it?’ he said. ‘I could have a shot - and get another boat and come back
for everyone.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
Too far,’ said Julian. ‘The tide’s too strong for any swimmer at the moment.
We’re certainly in a fix!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
can’t signal, I suppose?’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
with?’ asked Julian. ‘You could wave a shirt for an hour and it wouldn’t be
seen from the mainland!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- we must think of something!’ said Dick, exasperated. ‘What about trying to
find a boat here? Surely those men must have one to get to and fro.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course!’ said Julian, clapping Dick on the back. ‘Where are my brains? They
seem to be going soft or something! We could snoop round and about tonight, to
see if there’s a boat anywhere. They may have two or three. They’d have to get
food from the mainland at times.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two girls and Timmy came up then, and Timmy whined. ‘He doesn’t seem to like
this island,’ said George. ‘I think he smells danger!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
bet he does!’ said Dick, putting his hand on Timmy’s firm head. ‘I’m jolly glad
he’s with us. Can you girls think of any good ideas - we can’t!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
could signal,’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
good. A signal from here couldn’t be seen,’ said Dick. ‘We’ve already thought
of that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- if we lighted a fire here on the beach tonight, when the tide’s out, surely
that would be seen?’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
and Julian looked at one another. ‘Yes!’ said Julian. ‘If we lighted it on a
hilly bit it would be better still - on that cliff up there, for instance.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wouldn’t
the guards see it?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’d
have to chance that,’ said Julian. ‘Yes - we could do that. Good idea, Anne. I
say - we’re going to get jolly hungry, aren’t we? Anyone got anything to eat?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
two bars of chocolate - a bit soft now though,’ said George, digging into the
pocket of her shorts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
I’ve some peppermints,’ said Anne. ‘What about you boys? You always take
barley-sugars about with you, Dick - don’t say you haven’t any just when we
could all do with them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
a new packet!’ said Dick. ‘Let’s all have one now!’ He pulled the packet from
his pocket and handed it round. Soon they were all sucking barley-sugars. Timmy
was given one too, but his was gone in a flash!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wasted
on you, Tim, absolutely wasted!’ said Anne. ‘Crick-crack, swallow - that’s all
a barley-sugar means to you! Why can’t dogs suck a sweet as we do! They never
seem to suck anything. No, Timmy, don’t go sniffing into Dick’s pocket for
another!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was disappointed. He went snuffling round the cove, and then, scenting a rabbit
smell, he followed it with his nose to the ground. The children didn’t notice
that he had disappeared, but went on talking, trying to solve their very real
difficulty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>No
boat. No food. No way of getting help except by signalling in some way. Not
very funny, thought Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then, very suddenly, a loud sound broke the silence - CRACK!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
jumped up at once. ‘That was a gunshot,’ said Dick. ‘The keepers! But what were
they shooting at?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
Timmy?’ cried George, looking all round. ‘Tim, Tim, where are you TIM!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone’s
heart went cold. Timmy! No, the shot couldn’t have been meant for old Timmy!
Surely the keepers wouldn’t shoot a dog!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was nearly mad with dread. She clutched at Dick, tears streaming down her
cheeks. ‘Dick! It couldn’t be Timmy, could it? Oh Timmy, where are you? TIMMY!
Come to me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Listen!
Listen a minute, George!’ said Dick, as shouts came from the distance. ‘I
thought I heard Tim whine then. Isn’t that him coming through the bushes?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was the noise of rustling as some creature pressed through the last year’s old
bracken fronds - and then Timmy’s head appeared, his bright eyes looking for
them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
Timmy, darling Timmy, I thought you’d been shot!’ cried George, hugging the big
dog. ‘Did they shoot at you? Are you hurt anywhere?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
bet I know why he was shot at,’ said Dick. ‘Look what he’s got in his mouth -
half a ham! Drop it, you robber, you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
stood there, the ham in his mouth, wagging his tail joyously. He had felt
hungry, and was sure the others did too - so he had gone a hunting!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
did you get that, you bad dog?’ said Julian. Timmy wished he could tell him. He
would have said ‘Well, I went sniffing after a rabbit - and I came to a shed
stored with tins of food - and one was open with this piece of ham inside,
waiting for me. And here it is!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
dropped the ham at George’s feet. It smelt extremely good. ‘Well, thanks, old
fellow,’ said Julian. ‘We could do with some of that - though we’ll have to pay
for it when we meet the owner, whoever he is!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian
- he has been shot at!’ said George, in a trembling voice. ‘Look - his tail’s
bleeding, and some fur is gone.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘My
word, yes!’ said Julian, examining Timmy’s tail. ‘Good gracious - those fellows
mean business. I really think I’d better find them and tell them we’re here, in
case they take a pot-shot at us too!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
let’s go now - all of us,’ said Dick. ‘They probably thought Timmy was a wolf
or a fox or something, slinking through the trees. Poor old fellow!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was not at all disturbed. He was so proud of finding and bringing back the ham
that he even wagged his wounded tail!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
quite certain that no animals or birds will be tame and friendly on this island
now,’ said Anne. ‘They’ll have been scared stiff by the game-keepers potting at
this and that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
right,’ said Julian. ‘It rather makes me think that the fellows on the island
are no longer merely gamekeepers, put in to preserve the wild life, and to
frighten sight-seers away - but real, fierce guards of some kind. Like those
two horrible men we saw in the courtyard!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
what are they guarding then?’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
what I’d very much like to find out,’ said Julian. ‘And I think perhaps I’ll
snoop round a bit and see what I can discover. When it’s getting dark, though,
not now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wish we hadn’t come,’ said Anne. ‘I wish we were safe in our cottage with Wilfrid.
I wonder if he’s found his whistle-pipe. Goodness, it seems ages since we hired
that boat!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Can’t
we go quietly through the woods and explore a bit?’ asked George. ‘Or walk
round the shore to see if there’s a boat anywhere? I’m getting bored, sitting
here, talking.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- I suppose old Tim would give us warning at once if he heard anyone near,’
said Julian, who was also longing to stretch his legs. ‘We’ll go in single
file, like Indians, and make as little noise as we can. Timmy can go ahead. He’ll
give us instant warning if we come near any of the keepers.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all stood up, and Timmy looked at them, wagging his nicked tail. ‘I’ll look
after you,’ said his two bright eyes. ‘Don’t be afraid!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
made their way carefully and quietly through the whispering trees. ‘Sh, sh, sh,
shoo, shooey,’ said the leaves above their heads, as if warning everyone to go
as quietly as possible. And then suddenly Timmy stopped and gave a low, warning
growl. They all stood still at once, listening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
could hear nothing. They were in a dense part of the wood, and it was dark and
sunless. What was Timmy growling at? He took a step forward, and growled softly
again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
went forward too, as silently as he could. He stopped suddenly and stared. What
in the world was that strange figure, gleaming out of the shadows? His heart
began to beat loudly. The figure stood there, silently, an arm out-stretched as
if pointing at him!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
thought it moved and he took a step backwards in fear. Was it a ghost or
something? It was so very very white and shone so queerly. The others, coming
up behind, suddenly saw it too and stopped in fright. Timmy growled again, and
all the hackles on his neck rose up. What was THIS?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
stood absolutely still, and Anne gave a gulp. She took hold of Dick’s arm, and
he held it tightly against him. And then George gave a very small laugh. To
everyone’s horror she went forward, and touched the hand of the gleaming
figure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
do you do?’ she said. ‘It is so nice to meet a well-mannered statue!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Well!
A statue! Only a statue! It had looked so real standing there, and yet so
ghostly. Everyone heaved a sigh of relief, and Timmy ran forward, and sniffed
at the statue’s flowing robes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
around you,’ said Julian. ‘The wood’s full of statues just here - and aren’t
they BEAUTIFUL! I hope they don’t suddenly come alive - they really look as if
they might!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Eleven<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
STRANGE DISCOVERY<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children were astonished to see so many gleaming statues, standing in the
darkness of the wood. They wandered round them, and then came to a large shed.
They peeped inside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
here!’ said Dick, excited. ‘Long, deep boxes, strong as iron! And see what’s in
these two!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all came to look. In the first, packed in what looked like sawdust, was a
beautifully carved statue of a boy. The next box seemed to be entirely full of
sawdust, and Anne had to scrape quite a lot away to see if anything was packed
there too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
a little stone angel!’ she said, scraping sawdust from a quaint little face, a
small crown and the tips of small wings. ‘Lovely! Why are these statues being
packed away like this?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Use
your brain!’ said Dick. ‘It’s obvious that they’re works of art - and are
probably very old. They’re being packed to send away in some boat or ship - to
be transported somewhere where they’ll fetch a lot of money - America,
probably!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Did
they come from the old castle, do you think?’ asked George. ‘It’s quite near. I
expect this shed belongs to it. But how was it that the police didn’t find them
in the castle when they searched? They must have gone there, and looked into
every corner! And what about the statues in the wood outside - why haven’t they
been packed away?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Too
big, probably,’ said Julian. ‘And too heavy. A small boat wouldn’t be strong
enough to take great things like that. But those little statues are quite
perfect for transporting - they don’t weigh as much as the big ones - and they
aren’t marked by the weather, through standing in rain, sun and snow! Not a
mark on them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
right,’ said Anne. ‘I noticed that those big ones outside were green here and
there, and some had bits knocked off them. I wish we could get inside the
castle and see the things there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
man at the golf-club, the one we took those lost balls to - he said something
about statues as white as snow, standing in this wood - do you remember?’ said
Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
They must have stood there for some time,’ said Julian. ‘I don’t feel they can
be very valuable, else they would be put carefully indoors, under cover. But
these little beauties - I guess they’re worth a lot of money!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who
do you suppose packed them in here?’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Maybe
those big men we saw,’ said Julian. ‘Even small statues like these need someone
very strong indeed to carry them here to this shed, and pack them like this.
Then, of course, they would have to be carried to some boat - or ship -
probably to a boat first, and then rowed out to a waiting ship. But I don’t
think those guards are the men behind all this - someone with great knowledge
of old things must be the ringleader. He probably heard the old legend of the
island, came to have a look round, and made quite a lot of interesting
discoveries!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where?’
asked George. ‘In the castle?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Probably
- though carefully hidden away!’ said Julian. ‘For all we know there may be
scores of really valuable old treasures hidden there still. That sword with a
jewelled handle, for instance! And the bed made of gold, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘To
think they might all be quite near us somewhere on Whispering Island!’ said
Anne. ‘Wouldn’t I love to be able to say I’d slept on a bed of pure gold!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I think you’d find it jolly hard,’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
suddenly gave a small whine, and licked George’s hand. ‘What is it?’ she said.
‘What do you want, Timmy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Perhaps
he’s hungry,’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thirsty,
more likely!’ said Julian. ‘Look at his tongue hanging out!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
poor Tim - you haven’t had a drink for hours!’ said George. ‘Well - where on
earth can we get you one? We’ll have to look for a puddle, I’m afraid. Come on!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
left the shed where the beautiful little statues were lying in their sawdust,
and went out into the sunshine. Everywhere was dry. Julian felt worried.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
shall all be thirsty soon!’ he said. ‘I wonder where we can get some water?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Would
it be too dangerous to go near the castle and see if there’s a tap anywhere?’
asked George, ready to face almost anything to get her dog a drink!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
it would,’ said Julian, in a very decided voice. ‘We’re not going near any of
those men with guns. They might have been told to shoot on sight, and that
wouldn’t be very pleasant. We’d be peppered all over with shot!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
- what’s that round thing over there - like a little circular wall?’ said Dick,
pointing to something behind the shed where the statues lay in their boxes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went over to it - and Anne guessed what it was at once! ‘A well! An old
well!’ she said. ‘Look, it has an old wooden beam over the top, with a pulley
to wind and unwind a bucket. 1s there a bucket - let’s hope so! We can let it down
to the water and fill it for Timmy then.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
put his paws on the rim of the wall and sniffed. Water! That was what he wanted
more than anything. He began to whine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right, Timmy - we’ll send the bucket down,’ said George. ‘It’s still on the hook!
Julian, this handle’s awfully stiff - can you turn it to let down the bucket?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
tried with all his strength - and quite suddenly the rope loosened, and the
bucket gave a sudden jerk and jump. Alas - it jerked right off the hook, and
with a weird, echoing jangling sound, fell from the top to the bottom of the
well - landing in the water with a terrific splash!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Blow,
blow, blow!’ said Julian, and Timmy gave an anguished howl. He peered down at
the lost bucket, now on its side in the water at the bottom of the well,
gradually filling itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’ll
probably sink below the water now,’ said Julian, with a groan. ‘Is there a
ladder down the well? - if so I could shin down and get the bucket.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
there wasn’t, though it looked as if there had been at some time, for here and
there were staples in the brick side of the well-wall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
can we do?’ asked Anne. ‘Can we possibly pull up the bucket?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
- I’m afraid we can’t,’ said Dick. ‘But wait a minute - I could shin down the
rope, couldn’t I, and pick the bucket out of the water. And easily get up
again, because George and Julian could turn the well-handle, and pull me up
that way!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Righto.
Down you go then,’ said Julian. ‘The rope’s good and strong, not frayed or
rotten. We’ll wind you and the bucket up all right!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy sat on the side of the well-wall, and reached out for the rope. He swung
himself on to it, and swayed there a moment or two, looking down the long, dark
hole below him, with the water at the bottom. Then down he went, hand-over-hand,
just as he so often did at school in the gym.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
came to the bottom, reached down, took hold of the bucket-handle, and filled
the bucket full. The water felt as cold as ice to his hand. ‘All right. Pull me
up!’ he shouted, his voice sounding very hollow and strange as it rose up
through the well-walls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
was heavy to pull up. Julian and George turned the handle valiantly, but it was
slow work. Gradually Dick came up nearer and nearer to the top. When he was
half-way they heard him give an exclamation, and call out something; but they
couldn’t make out what it was and went on winding the groaning rope, slowly but
surely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
reached down and took the bucket from Dick as soon as his head appeared at the
top. Timmy fell on it with excited barks, and began to lap vigorously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Didn’t
you hear me yelling to you to stop when I was halfway up?’ demanded Dick, still
swinging on the rope. ‘Don’t let go that handle. Hang on to it for a minute.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
the excitement?’ asked Julian, in surprise. ‘Why did you yell to us? We
couldn’t make out what you said.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
swung himself to one side, caught hold of the well-top, and hauled himself up,
so that he could sit on the well-wall. ‘I shouted because I suddenly saw
something jolly peculiar as I came up the well,’ he said. ‘And I wanted to stop
and see what it was!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- what was it?’ asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t quite know. It looked awfully like a little door! An iron door,’ said
Dick. ‘I say, don’t let Timmy drink all that water-he’ll be ill. We’ll let the
pail down again in a minute and get some more for ourselves.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Go
on about what you saw,’ said George. ‘How could there be a door in the side of
a well going deep down into the earth?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I tell you, there was one,’ said Dick. ‘Look, Timmy’s gone and upset the pail
now! Let’s send it down on the pulley to be filled again, and I’ll go down on
the rope again too. But when I come up and you hear me shout ‘Stop!’ just STOP
winding, see?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here’s
the bucket for the hook,’ said Julian. ‘I’ll be careful not to jerk it off this
time. Ready?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Down
went Dick and the bucket again - splash went the bucket and filled with water
once more. Then up came Dick again, wound up by Julian and George as before. As
soon as they heard him shout ‘STOP’ they stopped their winding and peered down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
saw Dick peering hard at the side of the well-wall, and pulling at it with his
fingers. Then he shouted again. ‘All right. UP WE go!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
hauled him up to the top, and he clambered off the rope, swung himself on to
the well-wall and sat there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
It is some kind of opening in the well-wall - it is a door - and it has a bolt
this side to undo, but it was too stiff for my fingers. I’d have to go down and
jiggle it about with my knife before I could loosen it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
door in a well! But where on earth would it lead to?’ said Julian, astonished.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
what we’re going to find out!’ grinned Dick, rather pleased with himself. ‘Who
would ever think of putting a door in the side of a well? Somebody did - but
WHY? Very cunning - and mysterious - and unguessable. I rather think I’ll go
straight down again and see if I can’t open that door - and discover what it
leads to!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
DO, Dick, do!’ said George. ‘If you don’t, I will!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hang
on to the rope. Down I go again!’ said Dick. And down he went, much to Timmy’s
surprise. The others looked down anxiously. Gould Dick open the well-door? What
would he find behind it? Quick, Dick, quick - everybody’s waiting for you!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Twelve<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
GREAT SURPRISE - AND A SHOCK FOR GEORGE<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
soon as Dick shouted ‘STOP’ Julian and George hung on to the rope to stop it
going down any further. Dick was swinging just opposite the strange door. He
began to feel round it, and to jiggle it. It had no lock, apparently, but there
was a bolt on his side. He tried to push back the bolt - and suddenly it came
away from the door, and dropped down into the well. It had rusted so much that
it could not even hold to the door, once it was handled!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
door felt loose, now the bolt was gone. Dick ran his hands round it, trying to
loosen it further, and banged it with his fist. Rust fell off it, and Dick’s
hands were soon brown with the old old rust.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
saw a little knob at the top of the door and gave it a tug. Ah - the door felt
looser now. He ran his knife all round the edges, scraping away all the rust he
could find. Then he managed to get his strongest knife-blade in between the
door-edge and the well-wall, and used it as a lever to force the door open.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
opened slowly and painfully, with creaks and groans. It was about eighteen
inches high and not quite so much wide. Dick pulled it back with difficulty and
then peered through the hole.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
could see nothing at all but black darkness - how very disappointing! He
fumbled in his pocket to see if he had a torch. Yes - good! He shone it through
the little door, his hand trembling with excitement. What would he see?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
torch was small and not very powerful. The light fell first of all on a face
with gleaming eyes, and Dick had such a shock that he almost fell down the
well. The eyes seemed to glare up at him in a very threatening manner! He
switched his torch to the right - and yet another face gleamed up at him. ‘A
queer face,’ thought Dick. ‘Yellow as can be! YELLOW! YELLOW! I believe that
face is made of gold!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
hand was trembling even more, he shone his torch here and there through the
opening, catching first one yellow face in its light, and then another. The
faces had yellow bodies too, and their eyes glinted very queerly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
believe - yes, I really do believe - that I’ve found the hiding-place of the
golden statues!’ thought Dick. ‘And those gleaming eyes must be precious
jewels. My word, I did have a shock when I saw them all looking at me! Whatever
is this place they’re in?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘DICK!
What can you see? Do tell us!’ yelled Julian, and poor Dick almost fell off the
rope when the shouts echoed round him. ‘Pull me up!’ he shouted. ‘It’s too
extraordinary for words. Pull me up and I’ll tell you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
before a minute had passed, he was standing by the others, his eyes gleaming
almost as brightly as the eyes of the golden statues, his words tumbling over
one another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
door leads into the place where all the treasures are hidden. The first thing I
saw was a golden statue staring at me - brilliant eyes in a yellow face - a
golden face, real gold! There are dozens of them. I don’t think they liked me
much - they glared so! Thank goodness they didn’t say a word - though I half
expected them to. My word, what a hiding-place - right down under the earth!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
must be another entrance to it,’ said Julian, thrilled to hear such
extraordinary news. ‘The well door must be a secret one. Statues couldn’t be
pushed through it. My word, what a find, Dick.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
all go down in turn and look through the door!’ said George. ‘I can’t believe
it. I think I must be dreaming it. Quick, let me go down!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
by one they all went down on the rope and looked through the door. Anne came
back rather scared. She had felt very queer when she had seen the silent
statues looking at her. ‘I know they’re not really looking, it’s only that
their eyes gleam,’ she said. ‘But I kept expecting one or other to take a step
forward and speak to me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- the next thing to do is to climb down through the door, and see exactly where
the statues are, underground,’ said Julian. ‘And find out the opening they were
brought in by. There must be a door the other end of their room, through which
they were brought. What a hiding-place, though! No wonder the police could find
nothing in the way of statues or other treasures.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
might find the golden sword there, with the jewelled handle!’ said Anne. ‘And
the golden bed.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
had hardly finished speaking when there came a loud noise from behind them.
Timmy was barking his head off! Whatever was the matter?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sh!’
said George, fiercely. ‘You’ll bring the guards here, you idiot! Stop it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
stopped barking and whined instead. Then he ran off towards the wood, his tail
waving happily. ‘Who in the world is he going to meet?’ said George, amazed.
‘Someone he knows, by the look of his tail!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others all followed Timmy, who raced along towards the cove where they had
landed - and lost - their boat. And there, in the cove, was another boat! A
small one, to be sure, but still, a boat - and by it, fondling Timmy, was
Wilfrid! Wilfrid! What an amazing thing!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘WILFRID!
How did you get here - did you hire that boat? Did you come all by yourself?
Did you...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wilfrid
grinned round in delight, thrilled at the surprise he was giving everyone.
Timmy licked him without stopping, and George didn’t even seem to notice!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,’
he said, ‘you didn’t come back, so I guessed something was wrong - and when the
boat boy told me you’d taken one of his boats, and it had been reported tossing
about, empty on the water near the island, I guessed what had happened - I
said, ‘Aha! they didn’t make the boat fast when they got to the island - and
now they’re marooned there! You were pretty mean to go without me - but I
guessed you’d be pleased to see me, if I borrowed a boat and came over!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
was so pleased that she gave the boy a hug. ‘Now we can go back whenever we
want to,’ she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
we don’t want to, at the moment,’ said Dick. ‘We’ve made some startling
discoveries, Wilfrid - and I’m jolly pleased you’ll be able to share in them!
Er - what have you got in your pocket'' Something keeps poking its head out at
me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
that’s only a baby hedgehog,’ said Wilfrid, taking it out gently. ‘It got
trodden on - by a horse I think - so I’m just caring for it for a day or two.’
He put it back into his pocket. ‘But I say - go on - tell me what you’ve found.
Not the lost treasures, surely?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes!’
said Anne. ‘We saw them when we went down a well near the castle.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gracious
- did somebody throw them into the water there?’ said Wilfrid, amazed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said Dick, and told him about the curious door in the side of the well-wall.
Wilfrid’s eyes nearly fell out of his head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
am glad I came!’ he said. ‘I nearly didn’t. I thought you wouldn’t really want
me - and I knew George wouldn’t be pleased, because of Timmy. I can’t help him
coming round me - and anyway he’d feel hurt if I pushed him off.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
came nosing round him at that moment, with his ball. He wanted Wilfrid to throw
it for him. But Wilfrid didn’t notice the ball. He just patted the soft head,
and went on talking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
boat boy wasn’t very pleased when he heard that the boat you hired was loose on
the sea. He said you’d hired it for a week, and there it was, back the same
day, wet and empty! His cousin brought it in. No damage done.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
make it up to him when I see him,’ said Julian. ‘I haven’t paid him for the
hire of it either, but he knows I will, when I get back. I had no idea that the
sea would throw up waves here whose backwash would drag out an unmoored boat.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
ought to have taken me with you,’ said Wil-frid, grinning. Timmy, tired of
trying to make him throw his ball, went off to George, who was only too pleased
to. She threw it into the air, and Timmy leapt up and caught it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
very suddenly he made a horrible noise and rolled over, kicking as if he were
in great pain. ‘What’s the matter, Timmy?’ cried George, and rushed to him.
Wilfrid ran too. The dog was choking, and his eyes were almost starting out of
his head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
ball’s stuck in his throat!’ cried Wilfrid. ‘I knew it was dangerous! I told
you it was! Cough it up, Timmy, cough it up. Oh, you poor, choking thing! Oh
Timmy, Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy was beside himself with fear that the dog would choke, as he had once seen
another dog do, and as for George, she was wild with terror. Poor Timmy’s eyes
looked terrible as he choked and choked, trying to get the ball out of his
throat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’ll
choke to death,’ cried Wilfrid. ‘Julian, force his mouth open, and hold it. I
must try to get out the ball. Quick!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was growing weaker, and it was not too difficult to force his mouth wide open.
Wilfrid could see the ball down the dog’s throat - the ball with the hole in
the middle. He put his small hand into the dog’s big mouth, and forced his
fore-finger into the hole in the ball. His finger-joint stuck there - Wilfrid
gently drew back his hand - and the ball came too, on his finger! There it was,
with his finger still stuck in the hole! Timmy began to breathe again, great
panting breaths, while George stroked his head and cried for joy that he was
all right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
shouldn’t have given you that ball, I shouldn’t!’ she said. ‘It was too small
for a big dog like you - and you will throw them up into the air and catch
them. Oh Timmy, Timmy, I’m very very sorry. Timmy, are you all right?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wilfrid
had gone off but now came back with some water from the pail. He dipped his
hand in it and let drops of water drip into the dog’s mouth. Timmy swallowed it
gratefully. His throat was sore, but the water was cool and soothing. George
let Wilfrid do this without a word. She looked rather white and shaken. Why -
Timmy might be dead by now if Wilfrid hadn’t put his finger into that hole in
the ball, and drawn it out!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thank
you, Wilfrid,’ she said, in a low voice. ‘You were very clever.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thank
goodness the ball had a hole through it,’ said Wilfrid, and he put his arms
round Timmy’s neck. The dog licked him gratefully. Then he turned and licked
George too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
says he belongs to both of us now,’ said George. ‘I’ll share him with you. You
saved his life.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thanks,’
said Wilfrid. ‘I’d love to have just a bit of him - he’s the nicest dog I
know!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
feel hungry again,’ said George, who always had a very good appetite indeed.
‘We’ve finished all that ham, haven’t we? I had to give old Timmy some. What
about a barley sugar, Dick?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Two
more left for each of us - just ten,’ said Dick, counting. ‘Sorry, Timmy, old
thing - none for you this time. Have one, everybody? We’ll have five left
then!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
I quite forgot to tell you,’ said Wilfrid, taking a barley sugar. ‘I brought
some food in my boat! I didn’t think you’d taken any, and I guessed you’d soon
be jolly hungry!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
a marvel, Wilfrid!’ said Julian, wondering why he had ever disliked the boy.
‘What have you brought?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
and see,’ said Wilfrid, and they all went over to the boat, Timmy walking as
close to the boy as he could. Higgledy-piggledy in the boat was a pile of tins,
a large loaf of bread, and a pound package of butter, looking rather soft.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gracious!’
said Anne, in delight. ‘How in the world did you carry all these from the
cottage to your boat? Look, everyone, Wilfrid has even brought some, plates and
spoons!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
put everything into a sack, and carried them over my shoulder,’ said Wilfrid,
enjoying everyone’s delighted surprise. ‘I fell over going down the hill to the
shore, and all the tins rolled out, and simply shot down the slope!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
laughed at the thought of the tins rolling at top speed down the hill. Anne
slipped her arm through Wilfrid’s and gave it a squeeze.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
did jolly well,’ she said, and Wilfrid beamed at her, astonished and pleased at
everyone’s warm friendliness. Timmy went up to the boat and began sniffing at
the bread. Then he turned and barked as if to say ‘Is there anything here for
me?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wilfrid
understood at once. ‘Oh yes, Timmy!’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
brought a special tin of dogmeat for you - here you are - a large tin of
Waggomeat!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
recognized the tin at once, and barked joyfully. He pawed Wilfrid as if to say
‘Come on, then - open it! I’m hungry!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Anyone
got a tin-opener?’ said George. ‘It would be too dreadful if we couldn’t open
the tins!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gosh
- I never even thought about that!’ said Wilfrid. ‘What an ass I am!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
all right. I’ve a thing on my pocket-knife that’s supposed to open tins,’ said
Dick, taking out a very large closed knife. ‘I’ve never bothered to use it - so
let’s hope it will work the trick. Chuck me a tin, Wilfrid.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wilfrid
threw him the tin of Waggomeat. With everyone watching very anxiously indeed,
Dick opened a peculiar-looking tool in his knife, and gashed the point into the
top of the tin. It worked!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘First
time I’ve ever used it,’ said Dick, running the gadget round the tin-top.
‘Three cheers for the man who thought of including it in a knife!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Will
Timmy be able to swallow yet?’ asked George, anxiously. ‘His throat must still
be hurting him where that wooden ball choked him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
Timmy will be able to judge that for himself,’ said Julian. ‘If I know anything
about him, not even a sore throat will stop him from wolfing half that tin!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was right. As soon as Wilfrid scraped out a third of the meat with his knife on
to a flat stone nearby, Timmy was wolfing it in great gulps!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nothing
much the matter with your throat now, Tim!’ said Anne, patting him. ‘Dear old
Tim. Don’t ever choke again. I simply couldn’t bear it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
have a meal ourselves now,’ said George. ‘We’ll open more of those tins. We
don’t need to be stingy about them because we can leave in Wilfrid’s boat at
any time, and get back to the mainland.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
they had opened a tin of tongue, two tins of fruit, and a large tin of baked
beans. They cut the big loaf into six pieces (one for Timmy, of course) and
then sat down at the back of the cove to feast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Best
meal I ever had in my life!’ said Dick, enjoying himself. ‘Tasty food - fresh
air - sea nearby - sun on our heads - and friends sitting all round me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof!’
said Timmy, at once, and gave Dick a very wet lick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
says he couldn’t agree more,’ said Anne, with a laugh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
sun’s going down,’ said George. ‘What are we going to do? Go back to the
mainland in Wilfrid’s boat - or stay here for the night?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Stay
here,’ said Julian. ‘Nobody knows we’re here, and I want to snoop round a bit
tonight, when those men can’t see me. There’s a lot of things that puzzle me.
For instance, how on earth do they send away the things from here - such as
those packed statues we saw? It must mean that a fairly big vessel comes along
to collect them, I suppose. And I’d like to know how many men there are on the
island - presumably the guards we saw, with guns - and the men who have found
that underground cave, where everything was hidden. Then we’ll go back, tell
the police, and leave things to them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Couldn’t
Wilfrid take the two girls back to the mainland, then come back with the boat?’
said Dick. ‘I don’t think we ought to let them run any risk.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before
Julian could reply, George spoke quickly - and crossly. ‘We’re staying here -
though Anne can go back if she wants to. But Timmy and I are staying with you
boys, so that’s that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right, all right, no need to shout!’ said Dick, pretending to cover his ears.
‘What about you, though, Anne? You’re the youngest, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
staying,’ said Anne. ‘I’d be worried stiff all night if I left you on the
island. And I certainly don’t want to miss any excitement!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Julian. ‘We all stay then. Wilfrid, did you know that Timmy has his nose
in the pocket where you keep your hedgehog?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
They’re just making friends,’ said Wilfrid. ‘Anyway, the hedgehog’s only a baby
- his quills won’t prick Timmy’s nose, they’re still too soft. He’s a dear
little thing. I thought I’d call him Spiky.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wuff,’
said Timmy, quite agreeing. He was sitting between George and Wilfrid, very
happy indeed, for both fondled him and patted him at the same time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think I’ll take a walk round the island,’ suddenly announced Wilfrid. ‘Timmy,
like to come with me?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
got up at once, but George pulled him down. ‘Don’t be an ass, Wilfrid,’ she
said. ‘Timmy’s been shot at once, by the men here - and I’m not going to risk
it again - besides, we don’t want them to know we’re here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’d
be very careful,’ persisted Wilfrid. ‘I wouldn’t let them spot me. They didn’t
spot me coming over in the boat.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
sat up very suddenly. ‘How do we know they didn’t?’ he said. ‘I never thought
of that! They might have a telescope - they might keep watch all the time -
they might even have seen us in our boat! After all, they can’t risk being
spied on!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t think they could have seen us,’ said Dick. ‘They would have made a
search.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
jolly sure they didn’t see me,’ boasted Wilfrid. ‘They’d have been waiting for
me on the shore, if they had.’ He got up and looked all round. ‘I think I’ll go
for my walk now,’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘NO!
You are DEFINITELY not to go for a walk, Wilfrid,’ said Julian, and lay back in
the sun again. It was sinking now, but still very bright. Dick began to think
of the night, and how he and Julian would snoop round and find the way into
that strange place underground where those golden statues stood silently in the
darkness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
he fell fast asleep, and only awoke when Anne gave him a friendly punch. He sat
up and began a long and leisurely conversation with his sister - and then Anne
suddenly looked all round.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
Wilfrid?’ she said. They all sat up then, and looked startled. Wilfrid was
nowhere to be seen!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
must have slipped away without a sound!’ said Dick, angrily. ‘The little idiot.
He’s been gone quite a long time! He’ll get caught, as sure as can be. Good
thing Timmy didn’t go with him - he might have been caught too - and shot!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
put her arms round Timmy in fear.‘Timmy would never go with Wilfrid if I wasn’t
there too,’ she said. ‘What a little fathead he is! I say - those men will
guess there’s someone else on the island with Wilfrid, won’t they? They might
even make him tell all he knew - and where the boat is, and everything!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
shall we do?’ said Anne. ‘We’d better go after him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy
will track him for us,’ said George, getting up. ‘Come on, Tim. Find Wilfrid.
Find that silly disobedient boy Wilfrid!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
understood at once. He put his nose to the ground, found Wilfrid’s scent, and
began to walk away. ‘Not too fast, Timmy,’ said George, and he at once slowed
down. George looked round at the little place among the bushes where they had
been sitting. ‘Had we better take a tin or two with us?’ she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
Good idea,’ said Julian. ‘You just never know!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
and Dick took a couple of tins each, stuffed uncomfortably into their pockets.
Blow Wilfrid!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
must have gone in this direction,’ said Dick. ‘I never spotted him slinking
away, the little nuisance! I’m surprised Timmy didn’t make a sound! Track him,
Tim, track him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Listen!’
said Anne, suddenly, and she stopped. ‘Listen!’ They all listened - and didn’t
at all like what they heard. It was Wilfrid’s voice, yelling in fright.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let
me go! Let me go!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then a stern, loud and threatening voice came ‘Who are you with? Where are
they? You’re not alone, we’re certain of that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Quick
- we must hide!’ said Julian, angry and worried. ‘Dick, look about for a good
place and I will too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
good,’ said Dick. ‘They’ll beat everywhere for us. Better climb trees.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
idea!’ said Julian. ‘Anne, come with me. I’ll give you a shove up. Hurry,
everybody! Hurry!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Fourteen<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>WILFRID
HAS AN ADVENTURE ON HIS OWN<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
about Timmy? He can’t climb,’ said George, fearfully. ‘He might be shot.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Put
him under a bush and tell him to sit, sit, sit!’ said Julian, urgently. ‘He
knows perfectly well what that means. Go on, George, quick.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
took Timmy by the collar and led him to a very thick bush. She pushed him under
it. He turned himself round, poked his nose out of the leaves, and looked at
her in surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sit,
Timmy! Sit, and keep quiet!’ said George. ‘Sit, sit, sit - and keep quiet.
Understand?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, very quietly, and withdrew his nose, so that nothing of him could
be seen at all. He knew perfectly well what George meant. Clever old Timmy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
was giving Anne a shove up a tree with drooping branches thick with leaves.
‘Get as high as you can,’ he said, in a low voice. ‘And then stay put till you
hear me call you. Don’t be afraid. Old Timmy’s down here to protect you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
gave him rather a small smile. She was not like George, fearless and always
ready to rush into trouble. Anne was all for a peaceful life - but how could
she have that if she was one of the Five!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys and George were now high up in trees, listening to the shouting going on.
Apparently Wilfrid was not going to give away his friends - one up to him!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
did you get here?’ a man was shouting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘In
a boat,’ said Wilfrid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who
was with you?’ shouted another man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nobody.
I came alone,’ said Wilfrid, perfectly truthfully. ‘I wanted to visit the
island. I’m an animal-lover and I heard that all the wild creatures here were
tame.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
likely story that!’ sneered a man’s voice. ‘Huh! Animal-lover!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right then - look what I’ve got here in my pocket,’ said Wilfrid, and
apparently showed the man his baby hedgehog. ‘He was trodden on by a horse -
and I’ve been looking after him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Very
well - you can go back to your boat, and row away,’ said the man. AT ONCE! mind.
And don’t look so scared. We shan’t hurt you. We’ve business of our own here,
and we don’t want strangers round - not even silly little kids with hedgehogs
in their pockets!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wilfrid
took to his heels and fled. He felt lost now. He would never find the others -
or the cove where his boat was. WHY had he disobeyed Julian? Had the others
heard the men shouting at him? Which way should he go?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
had entirely lost his sense of direction and had no idea whether to go to the
left or the right. He began to panic. Where could the others be? He must find
them, he must! He ran through the trees, wishing that Timmy was with him. Then
he stopped. Surely this was quite the wrong way? He turned and went in a
different direction. No, this couldn’t be right either, he didn’t recognize a
thing!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
thought he heard voices in the distance. He stood and listened. Could it be the
others? If only George would tell Timmy to find him! But she wouldn’t, in case
he was shot at. Was that noise voices - or was it just the wind? Perhaps it was
the others looking for him. Wilfrid rushed off towards the distant sound. But
alas, it died down. It was only the wind!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
trees thinned out into bushes - and then Wilfrid suddenly saw the sea in the
distance! Good! If he could get to it, he could walk round the shore till he
came to his cove. He would know where he was then. He began to run towards the
blue sea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Through
the bushes he went, and came out at last on to what seemed to be a very high
cliff. Yes - there was the sea, below and beyond. If only he could scramble
down the cliff he could bear to the right and at last come to his cove. He came
to the edge of the cliff and looked down - and then he started back in fear.
What was that noise - that awful, dreadful noise? It was like a giant wailing
and wailing at the top of his voice, the wailing going up and down in the wind.
Wilfrid found his knees were shaking. He simply didn’t dare to go on. He sat
down and tried to get his breath, putting his hands over his ears to keep out
the horrible wailing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then he suddenly remembered something and heaved a sigh of heartfelt relief.
‘Of course - these must be the Wailing Cliffs we were told about!’ he thought
thankfully. ‘We heard about the Whispering Wood - and it does whisper - and the
Wailing Cliffs - and they do wail! At least, it’s really the wind, of course.
But goodness, what a queer, strange sound!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
sat for a while longer, then, feeling much bolder, he went to the edge of the
great cliff, and looked over. He stared down in surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
somebody down there - three or four people! Mustn’t let them see me - they must
belong to the men on the island! What are they doing down there?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
lay down and peered over. Four men were there - but, as Wilfrid watched, they
disappeared. Where had they gone? He craned over the cliff to see. ‘There must
be caves in the cliff, I suppose,’ he said to himself. ‘That’s where they’ve
gone! Gosh, I wish this wailing would stop. I shall start wailing myself in a
minute!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
some time voices came faintly up to him, as he lay watching, and he saw two men
coming out on to the rocks below again. What were they carrying? A long, deep
box - why, it looked exactly like one of the boxes in which the others had seen
those beautiful little statues, packed in sawdust!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
that’s how they get them away from here - take them down through some passage
in the cliffs - to a waiting boat. Where’s the boat, thought I can’t see one.
Not arrived yet, perhaps.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
watched with intense interest as the men carried out box after box and piled
them on a great flat rock that abutted on a stretch of fairly calm water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Big
boxes - little ones - my word, those men have been busy lately!’ thought
Wilfrid, wishing and wishing and wishing that the others were with him. ‘I
wonder what’s in them. Not the bed of gold, that’s certain. I bet it would be
far too big to put into a boat. Have to be pulled to pieces first! Hallo - here
comes another box - a small one this time. Good gracious, they’ll soon need a
steamer to take all these!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Almost
as he said the words, he saw a small steamer in the far distance! ‘Well!
There’s the steamer, just as I said! I bet the boat will appear soon, and be
loaded - and then chug off to the waiting steamer!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the steamer came no nearer, and no boats appeared. ‘Waiting for the tide, I
expect,’ thought Wilfrid. ‘Goodness, what will the others say when I tell them
all this! They won’t believe me! And I bet they won’t scold me for going off by
myself!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
decided to go back and find the others and tell them what he had seen. He set
off trying to remember the way. Surely he must be near the place where he had
left them? And then quite suddenly, someone leapt out from behind a tree and
caught hold of him!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let
me go, let me go!’ shouted Wilfrid, in a panic. And then he gave a cry of
relief, as he suddenly saw Timmy running towards him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy!
Save me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timmy didn’t come running to save him. He stood there, looking up at him,
rather puzzled, while poor Wilfrid went on struggling, really frightened!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
Wilfrid heard a giggle. A GIGGLE? Who in the world could be giggling just then?
He forced himself to look round - and saw Dick and Anne, doing their best not
to laugh, and George holding her sides. His captor let go of him and began to
laugh too. It was Julian!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say - this is too bad! You gave me a most awful fright,’ said Wilfrid. ‘I’ve
already been captured once this afternoon. Whatever do you think you’re doing?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
have you been, Wilfrid?’ said Julian, rather sternly. ‘I forbade you to go for
a walk - and you went.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
know. I went off by myself- and a man caught me and scared me. Then I ran away
and lost myself. I couldn’t find any of you,’ said poor Wilfrid. ‘But my word,
I saw something very very interesting on that walk of mine!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What?’
asked Julian, at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
sit down, and I’ll tell you,’ said Wilfrid. ‘I feel quite shaky. You really
were beasts to jump on me like that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Never
mind, Wilfrid,’ said Anne, feeling sorry for the boy, who really did look
rather shaken. ‘Now go on, tell us everything that happened.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wilfrid
sat down. He was still trembling a little. Everything seemed to have happened
at once. He began to tell the others about the Wailing Cliffs, and all he had
seen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all listened with intense interest. ‘So that’s the other way to the underground
treasure-chamber - through a passage in the clips!’ said Julian. ‘I never
thought of that! My word, that’s something to know. I vote we go and explore
the cliffs ourselves, when there’s nobody about.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
it had better be in the evening,’ said Wilfrid. ‘Just in case we were spotted
climbing down the cliffs to find the passage - if there is one, and I think
there must be! Those men might be on the watch, now they know there’s someone
on the island. I bet they guess I’m not the only one - even though I told them
I came alone.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
vote we have something to eat,’ said George. ‘We can talk over everything then.
It’s ages since we had a meal. Let’s go and open some more tins, and plan what
we’re going to do tonight. This is getting too exciting for words. Isn’t it,
Timmy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
agreed Timmy. Too exciting, he thought. Yes - and dangerous, too. He’d keep
close to George that evening, as close as ever he could! If she went into
danger, Timmy would be close by her side!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
five children talked and talked, as they opened more tins and had a most
peculiar meal of ham spread with fruit salad and beans. They finished up with
another barley sugar each. George gave hers to Timmy who disposed of it with a
crick-crack-swallow!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Have
we all got torches?’ asked Julian. ‘I know it will be bright moonlight tonight,
but as we shall presumably be getting down - or up - dark caves, we shall want
torches.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yes
- they each had a torch. Wilfrid, for some reason, had two, rather small, but
quite efficient.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
the plan going to be, Ju?’ asked George, and Timmy gave a little whine, as if
to say, ‘Yes, tell us.’ He sat by George, listening earnestly, with Wilfrid on
the other side of him. At times he sniffed at the baby hedgehog still in the
boy’s pocket, and apparently quite happy there. Wilfrid had been busy catching
insects for it, much to Timmy’s interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
propose that we go to the cliffs - the Wailing Cliffs - as soon as it’s twilight,
and make our way down,’ said Julian. ‘There is probably some kind of pathway
down, I should think - even if only a rabbit-path. I’ll lead the way down, of
course. Anne and Wilfrid are to come between me and Dick, with George and Timmy
behind.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right!’
said everyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
are, of course, to make as little noise as possible,’ said Julian. ‘And do try
not to send stones hurtling down the path or cliff just in case anyone’s about!
When we get down to the rocks, we’ll let Wilfrid go ahead, because he saw where
the men went in and out earlier on.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wilfrid
felt suddenly important. My word - it was like planning an exploration! He
suddenly remembered something - the wailing noise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hope the girls won’t be scared when they hear the awful wailing noise,’ he
said. ‘It’s only the wind screaming in and out of the holes and corners of the
great cliffs.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
made a scornful noise. ‘Who’s scared of the wind!’ she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy
might be,’ said Julian, smiling. ‘We know what makes the wailing. He doesn’t!
You may have to hold him when it begins, George. He’ll be a bit restive.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
won’t!’ said George. ‘Timmy’s not afraid of anything in the world!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes, he is,’ said Dick, at once. ‘I know something that scares him dreadfully -
makes him put his tail down and flop his ears.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
do not!’ said George, angrily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
haven’t you seen him when you speak sharply to him?’ said Dick, with a chuckle.
‘He goes all shaky in the legs!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
laughed except George. ‘He does not,’ she said. ‘Nothing scares Timmy, not even
me. So shut up, Dick.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
may be that it would be best for only one or two of us to go right into the
depths of the caves,’ went on Julian. ‘If so, the rest must wait in hiding.
Just keep on the look-out for any signal from me. I don’t expect we shall see a
soul down there tonight, but you never know. If there is a way through the
cliffs to that underground chamber where we saw the golden statues, we shall be
in real luck. We shall then be absolutely certain how things can be taken in
and out.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Taken
in? But I thought they had been there for ages,’ said Dick, ‘and were probably
only taken out to sell. Smuggled out.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I think it may be more than that,’ said Julian. ‘It might even be a central
clearing-ground for a great gang of high-class thieves, who would hide valuable
stolen goods there till it was safe to sell them. However, that’s only
guessing!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think somebody’s discovered the underground chamber, full of that rich old
man’s treasures, and is taking them out bit by bit,’ said Dick. ‘Anyway,
whatever it is, it’s awfully exciting. To think we know so much!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
because we went down the well to get some water!’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Put
on your sweaters,’ said Julian. ‘It may be freezing cold in the wind that rages
round those cliffs!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
longing to start!’ said George. ‘It’s an adventure, this - do you hear that,
Timmy? An adventure!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Anything
more, Julian?’ asked Anne. Julian always sounded so very grown-up when he gave
them a plan of campaign. She felt very proud of him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
the lot,’ said Julian, ‘except that we’ll have some sort of a meal before we go
this evening. Wilfrid will have to lead the way for us, as he’s the only one
who knows it - but when we come to the cliff, I’ll lead you down. Can’t have
anyone missing a footstep and rolling headlong, frightening any robber or
smuggler!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
you hear that, Timmy?’ said George, and Timmy whined, and put a paw on George’s
knee as if to say: ‘It’s a pity you haven’t sure feet like mine, with rubber
pads beneath, so that your footing is always sure!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
patted his paw. ‘Yes - you’ve fine sure feet, Tim. I wish I could buy some like
them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
time seemed to go very very slowly after that. Everyone was eager to start, and
kept looking at their watches! The sun left a bright glow in the sky, so they
would probably start more or less in daylight, which would, however, soon fade
into twilight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had another meal, but strangely enough, nobody felt very hungry! ‘We’re too
excited!’ said Julian, giving Timmy a biscuit. Timmy was the only one who
didn’t seem at all excited. As for George, she fidgeted and fidgeted until
everyone was quite tired of her!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
last they started off. Wilfrid led them at first, as he knew the way. Actually
he found that he didn’t really know it - it was the loud wind that guided him,
just as it had done before. ‘Awfully like far-off voices shouting to one
another,’ he said, and everyone at once agreed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
they came near to the cliff, the sound gradually changed into the mournful
wailing noise that gave the cliffs their name.
‘EEEE-ee-OOOOO-oo-EEEEEEEEAH-OOO!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
very nice,’ said Anne, shivering a little. ‘It sounds as if someone is crying
and sobbing and howling!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
name for this place - Wailing Cliff’ said Dick. ‘I say - what a wind up here! I’m
glad my hair’s my own! It would certainly be blown off if it weren’t! Hang on
to old Timmy, George - he’s more blowable than we are - not so heavy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
put her hand on Timmy’s collar at once. How DREADFUL if Timmy were to be blown
over the cliff! He gave her a grateful lick. He didn’t like the wind here very
much - it had a truly miserable voice!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came to the edge of the cliff and looked down cautiously, in case anyone should
be on the rocks below. But, except for some big gulls preening their feathers
there, there was no sign of life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
boats about - no steamer - nothing,’ said Dick. ‘All clear, Julian!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
had been looking for a good path down the cliff. There didn’t seem to be a
continuous one. ‘We’ll have to go so far - then climb down a bit - then walk
along that ledgy bit, see - then climb down that slanting rock - the great big
one - and get down on to the more level rocks. OK everyone?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
let Timmy go first,’ said George. ‘He is so sure-footed and will know the best
way. Go on, Timmy - lead us down!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
understood at once and went in front of Julian. He took the first little path
down the cliff, slid down the next bit, walked along the ledge that Julian had
pointed out, and then stood and waited for everyone. He gave a little bark as
if to say, ‘Come along. It’s easy! Follow me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all followed, some more carefully than others. George and Wilfrid were least
careful, and poor Wilfrid lost his footing and slid quite a long way on his
behind. He didn’t like it at all, and looked quite scared!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Watch
your feet, now, Wilfrid,’ said Julian. ‘It’s getting a bit dark, so don’t try
any funny tricks. You tried to jump over that big stone instead of stepping
over carefully. I really don’t want to send Timmy down to the bottom of the
cliff to pick up your pieces!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
last they were all down the cliff, and on the rocks below. The tide was out, so
that waves did not splash up and soak them. Anne suddenly slipped into a pool
and made her shoes wet, but that didn’t matter. They were only rubber ones.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
- exactly where did you see those men, Wilfrid?’ asked Julian, stopping on a
big flat rock. Wilfrid jumped beside him, and pointed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘See
the cliff over there? See that funny rock shaped rather like a bear? Well,
that’s where I saw the men. They went by that rock, and disappeared.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Julian. ‘Now, no more talking please - though this wailing sound would
drown almost anything. Follow me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went over the rocks towards the big bear-like one that Wilfrid had pointed to.
The others followed, a little tide of excitement welling up inside them. Anne
caught hold of Wilfrid’s hand, and squeezed it. ‘Exciting, isn’t it?’ she said,
and Wilfrid nodded eagerly. He knew he would have been scared stiff by himself
- but with the others it was an adventure - a really exciting adventure!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came to the bear-like rock. Near it was a dark place in the cliff - a way in?
‘That’s where the men came out, Julian,’ said Wilfrid, keeping his voice low.
‘Do we go in there?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
do,’ said Julian. ‘I’m going in first and I’m going to stand quite still and
listen, as soon as I get the sound of the wind and sea out of my ears. If I
hear nothing I’ll whistle, see? Then you can all come in too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right!’
said everyone, thrilled. They watched as Julian went to the dark slit-like
opening. He paused and looked inside. It was so dark that he knew they would
all need their torches! He switched on his powerful one and shone it into the
passage. He saw a ditch that ran slanting upwards for some way, and on either
side, a rocky ledge, not too rough. Water ran down the rocky ditch and bubbled
out beside him, to join the sea over the rocks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
just going into the cliff tunnel a little way, to see if I can hear anything or
anyone,’ he said. ‘Wait here.’ He disappeared inside the dark opening and
everyone waited in impatient excitement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
gull suddenly swooped down close to their heads. ‘Ee-ooo, ee-ooo, EEE-OOO!’ it
screeched and made them all jump violently. Wilfrid almost fell off his rock,
and clutched at George. Timmy growled, and looked up angrily at the seagull.
Silly bird, frightening everyone like that!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
came a low whistle, and Julian appeared again, his torch switched on. ‘All
clear,’ he said. ‘I can’t hear a sound inside the opening, and I’ve been some
way along. It’s not hard going. There’s a funny little stream flowing down, and
a ledge either side we can walk on. Very convenient! Now, no talking please -
and be careful even of your whispers - every sound seems to be magnified in
here. Keep hold of Timmy, George, in the steepest places.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
gave a little whine of surprise when George took him inside the cliff. At once
his whine was magnified all round them, and everyone jumped. Timmy didn’t like
it at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
took firm hold of Timmy’s collar. ‘You’re to keep close by me,’ she whispered,
‘and you’re not to make a sound. This is an adventure, Timmy - a big adventure
- and you’re in it as much as any of us. Come along!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
there they go, all of them, climbing up the dark passage into the cliff! What
will they find - what will they see? No wonder their hearts beat fast and
loudly, no wonder Timmy keeps close to George. An adventure? He must be on
guard then - anything might happen in an adventure!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was very dark inside the cliff. The children’s torches made bright streaks
everywhere, and were very useful indeed for seeing the safest places to tread.
As Julian had told the others, there was a curious little stream flowing down
the middle of the steep passage, with uneven ledges on each side of it. It had
worn this little channel for itself during the many many years it had flowed
down inside the cliff!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
probably water draining from the surface of the cliffs,’ said Julian in a low
voice, picking his way carefully. ‘Be careful here - the ledges are very
slippery!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oooh!’
said Wilfrid, treading on a slippery bit, and finding one of his feet in
ice-cold water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
echo took up the noise at once. ‘OOOOH-OOOOOOH-OOOOOH!’ Poor Wilfrid’s little
‘Oooh’ echoed up and down and all round them! It was very weird indeed and
nobody liked it. Anne pressed close to Julian, and he squeezed her arm
comfortingly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sorry
about my Oooh,’ said Wilfrid, in a low voice. ‘My oooh, oooh, oooh!’ said the
echo at once, and George simply couldn’t help giving a giggle, which at once
repeated itself a score of times!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
really will have to be quiet now,’ came Julian’s serious voice, almost in a
whisper. ‘I have a feeling we’re coming to some big opening. There’s suddenly a
great draught blowing down this steep passage - I can feel it round my head.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others felt it too, as they climbed higher up the steep passage, trying to
avoid the tiny stream that splashed down its worn channel. It made a nice
little noise - very cheerful, Anne thought - and gleamed brightly in the light
of their torches.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
wondered how in the world anyone could take crates or boxes down such a steep
dark passage! ‘It’s wide enough, I suppose,’ he thought. ‘But only just - and
the bends in it must be very awkward for boxes to get round! I do hope we don’t
meet anyone round a bend, carrying a crate or two! My word - the draught is
quite a wind now. There must be an opening somewhere.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ju
- we’ve not only gone upwards, we’ve gone a good way forward too,’ whispered
Anne. ‘Wasn’t the old castle somewhere in this direction?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- I suppose it would be,’ answered Julian, stopping to think. ‘Gosh - I wonder
if this passage comes up in one of its cellars! An old castle like that would
have huge cellars - and probably a dungeon or two for prisoners! Let me think -
we must have left the cliff behind now - and yes - I think we may be heading
for the castle. Why didn’t I think of that before!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
then - the well-wall must run down beside the castle foundations!’ said Dick,
in much too loud a voice. The echo made everyone jump violently, and Julian
stopped climbing and hissed at Dick. ‘Whisper, can’t you, idiot! You nearly
made me jump out of my skin!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Skin,
skin, skin!’ said the echo, in a peculiar whisper that made George want to
laugh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sorry!’
whispered back Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think you may be right about the well-wall running down beside the foundations
of the castle,’ Julian said, whispering again. ‘I never thought of that. The
castle wasn’t very far from the well. It would probably have enormous cellars
spreading underground.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
wall in the well that that queer little door was in, was terrifically thick,’
said Dick. ‘I bet I was looking into one of the castle cellars, when I peeped
through it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
was all very interesting. Julian thought about it as they went on and on
through the endless passage. It ran more or less level now, and was easy to
walk through, for it was much wider.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think this part of the passage was man-made,’ said Julian, stopping and facing
the others, his face bright in the light of their torches. He went on in a loud
whisper, ‘Up through the cliff the passage was a natural one, awfully dificult
to climb - but here it’s quite different - look at these old bricks here -
probably put there to strengthen the tunnel.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- a secret way from the castle to the sea!’ said Dick, almost forgetting to
keep his voice down, in his excitement. ‘I say - isn’t it thrilling!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
began to feel even more excited - all except Timmy, who didn’t much like dark,
secret passages, and couldn’t imagine why Julian was taking them for such a
gloomy and peculiar walk. He had splashed solemnly through the stream the whole
time, finding the stone ledges much too slippery for his paws.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
draught grew stronger and was very cold indeed. ‘We’re coming near to the
opening where the draught comes from,’ whispered Julian. ‘All quiet, now,
please!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were as quiet as possible, and Anne began to feel almost sick with excitement.
Where were they coming to? Then suddenly Julian gave a low exclamation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here
we are! An iron gate!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all tried to crowd round Julian to see. The gate was a big strong one, with
criss-cross bars of iron. They could easily see between the bars, and they
shivered in the draught that swept through the great gate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
shone his torch through the bars, his hand shaking in excitement. The bright
ray of light ran all round what looked like a stone room - quite small - with a
stout, nail-studded door at the far end. This door was wide open, and it was
through this that the steady draught blew.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
is a cellar - or a dungeon, more likely!’ said Julian. ‘I wonder if the gate is
locked.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
shook it - and it swung open quite easily, as if it had been well-oiled! Julian
stepped into the dungeon flashing his torch all round the dark and dismal
little place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
shivered. ‘It’s cold as ice, even on this warm day!’ he said. ‘My word, I
wonder how many poor, miserable prisoners have been kept down here in the
cold!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
- here’s a staple in the wall,’ said Dick, standing beside him, examining the
half-hoop of iron, deeply embedded in the stone wall. ‘I suppose the unhappy
prisoner was tied up to this, to make his punishment even worse.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
shivered. ‘How could people be so cruel?’ she said, her vivid imagination
seeing wretched men here, with perhaps only crusts of bread to eat, water to
drink, no warmth, no bed, only the stone floor!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Perhaps
some of them escaped out of the gate, and went down the cliff-passage,’ she
said, hopefully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
- it’s much more likely that the passage was used to get rid of the prisoners,’
said Dick. ‘They could be dragged down to the sea and drowned - and nobody
would ever know.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
tell me things like that,’ said Anne. ‘It makes me feel I shall hear groans and
cries. I don’t like this place. Let’s go.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hate it too,’ said George. ‘And Timmy’s tail is right down. I feel as if this
horrid dungeon is full of miserable memories. Julian, do let’s go.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
walked over to the nail-studded door, and went through the doorway. He looked
out on to a stone paved passage, with stone walls and ceiling. He could see
other doors iron-barred, along a dismal stone passage. He came back to the
others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- these are the castle dungeons,’ he said. ‘I expect the castle cellars are
somewhere near too - where they stored wine and food and other things. Come on
- let’s explore. I can’t hear a sound. I think this place is absolutely empty.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all followed Julian down the stone passage, looking in at each miserable
dungeon as they passed. Horrible! Dirty, damp, cold, bare - poor, poor
prisoners of long ago!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
the end of the passage was another iron-barred door, but that too was wide
open. They went through it and came out into an enormous cellar. Old boxes were
there, old worm-eaten chests, broken chairs, loose papers that rustled as their
feet touched them - the kind of junk that can be found in a thousand cellars!
It all smelt rather musty, though, as Julian said, the draught that blew
everywhere took away some of the smell.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came to some stone steps and went up them. At the top was another great door,
with an enormous bolt on it. ‘Fortunately the bolt is our side,’ said Julian,
and slid it out of its socket. He was surprised that it went so smoothly - he
had expected it to be rusted and stiff. ‘It’s been oiled recently,’ he said,
shining his torch on it. ‘Well, well - other people have been here not long
ago, and used this door. We’d better go quietly in case they are still here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne’s
heart began to beat loudly again. She hoped there was no one waiting round a
corner to jump out at them! ‘Be careful, Julian,’ she said. ‘Somebody may have
heard us! They may be waiting to ambush us. They...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right, Anne - don’t worry!’ said Julian. ‘Old Timmy would give us a warning
growl if he heard a single foot-step!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
good gracious - at that VERY moment Timmy did give a growl - an angry, startled
growl that made everyone jump, and then stand still, holding their breath.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
looked round at Timmy, who was growling again. His head was down and he was
looking at something on the floor. What was it? Dick swung down his torch to
see. Then he gave a small laugh. ‘It’s all right. We don’t need to be scared
yet. Look what Timmy’s growling at!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all looked down - and saw a great fat toad, its brilliant eyes staring steadily
up at them. As they exclaimed at it, it turned aside, and crawled slowly and
clumsily to a little damp spot in the corner of the wall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
never seen such a big toad in my life!’ said Anne. ‘It must be a hundred years
old! Goodness, Timmy, you made me jump when you suddenly growled like that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
toad squatted down in its corner, facing them. It seemed to glare at poor
Timmy. ‘Come away, Tim,’ said Dick. ‘Toads can ooze out a very nasty-smelling,
nasty-tasting stuff. Never bite a toad!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
had now gone through the door at the top of the steps. He gave a loud
exclamation - so loud that the others rushed to him in alarm, wondering what
was exciting him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look!’
said Julian, shining his torch into the dark space beyond. ‘See where we’ve
come to! Did you ever see such a store-house of wonders!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
Seventeen<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>IN
THE TREASURE CHAMBER<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian’s
torch shone steadily into the vast room, which seemed to have no end! The
others shone their torches too, and Timmy pressed between their legs to see
what the excitement was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
a sight! They were actually in the enormous chamber that the boys had seen
through the opening, in the well-wall! What a place it was - absolutely vast,
thought Anne, awed at the size, the height and the great silence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
are the golden statues!’ said Dick, going over to a group of them. ‘Wonderful!
Queer faces they have, though - not like ours. And look how their slanting eyes
gleam when we shine our torches on them. Makes them look as if they’re almost
alive, and looking at us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
suddenly gave a cry and rushed over to something. ‘The golden bed!’ she said.
‘I wished I could lie on one - and now I shall!’ And with that she climbed on
to a vast four-poster bed, with a great canopy, now rotting to pieces.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
bed gave a mournful creak, and the part that Anne was lying on, suddenly
subsided. The canopy collapsed and Anne disappeared in a cloud of dust. The bed
had, quite literally, fallen to pieces! Poor Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others helped her up and Timmy looked at the clouds of dust in surprise. What
was Anne doing, making such a dust! He sneezed loudly, and then sneezed again.
Anne sneezed too. She scrambled quickly out of the collapsed bed and dusted herself
down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
has a gold, carved head-piece, and gold legs and end-piece,’ said Dick, shining
his torch on it. ‘What a monster of a bed, though - I should think six people
could sleep in it at once! What a pity it has been lost here so long - all the
hangings fell to pieces as soon as Anne climbed on the bed-part! What a dust!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no doubt about it, there were priceless treasures in this vast, underground
cellar. The children could not find the sword with the jewelled handle, nor the
necklace of rubies, which Julian thought were probably locked away in one of
the chests. But they found many other wonderful things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
in this chest - this beautiful carved chest!’ called Anne. ‘Gold cups and
plates and dishes. Still bright and clean!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
look what’s in here!’ shouted George. ‘Wrapped up in stuff that falls to pieces
when I touch it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
crowded round a great enamelled box. In it was a set of animals carved out of
some lovely green stone. They were absolutely perfect, and, when Anne tried to
stand them up, each of them stood as proudly as once they did many many years
ago when little princes and princesses played with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’re
made of green jade,’ said Julian. ‘Beautiful! Goodness knows how much they’re
worth! They should be in some museum, not mouldering away in this cellar.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
didn’t those collectors take these - and the golden statues - and all the other
things?’ wondered Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
that’s obvious,’ said Julian. ‘For one thing this is a secret cellar, I should
think, and nobody would be able to get into it unless they knew the secret way
to it. There’s probably a sliding panel, or hidden door that leads to it,
somewhere in the castle above. It’s very old, and ruined in many parts - and
some of the walls have fallen in - so I suppose it was pretty impossible to get
to the cellars, even if the secret way was known!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- but what about the way we came up,’ said Dick. ‘From the sea - up the cliff
passage!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- I don’t know exactly why that hasn’t been used before,’ said Julian, ‘though
I could make a guess! Did you notice that great heap of fallen rocks near the
entrance to the cliff passage? I should think that that part of the cliff fell
at one time, and hid the passage completely - blocked it up. Then maybe a storm
came, and the sea shifted some of the rocks - and lo and behold, there was the
secret passage - open again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
somebody found it - somebody perhaps who had heard the old legends about the
castle of Whispering Island!’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
collector of old things, do you think?’ asked George. ‘What about those two men
on the island - the ones we saw in the courtyard - do you suppose they know of
this entrance?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
probably,’ said Julian. ‘And it’s likely they were put on guard, in case anyone
else found it, and came to rob the secret chamber. The things here are
priceless! Those men are not there to guard the animals on the island, as they
were in the old lady’s day. She had genuine keepers, like that nice old man
Lucas, who told us about this island the other day.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
think these men are in somebody’s pay then - somebody who knows about this
great chamber under the castle, and wants to get the centuries-old treasures?’
said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Julian. ‘And what’s more I don’t believe that the real owner of the island
- the great-nephew of the old lady who owned it, even knows they’re here, or
that anyone is taking things from his island. For all we know he may live in
America or Australia, and not care tuppence about his island!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
extraordinary!’ said Anne. ‘If I owned an island like this, I’d live here and
never leave it. And all the animals and birds would be protected as they once
were, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dear
Anne - what a pity it isn’t yours!’ said Julian, ruffling her hair. ‘But now,
the thing is - what are we going to do about all this? We’ll talk about it when
we’re back at the cottage. My word, it’s getting late! It will be pitch dark
outside, unless the moon is up and the sky is clear of clouds!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
come on then, let’s go,’ said Dick, making for the great nail-studded door.
Then, as Timmy suddenly gave a blood-curdling growl, he stopped in fright. They
had shut the door - but now it was opening. Somebody was coming into the great
underground chamber! Who could it be?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Quick
- hide!’ said Julian, and he pushed the two girls behind a great chest. The
others were near the golden bed and they crouched behind it at once, Dick’s
hand on Timmy’s collar. He had managed to stop the dog from growling, but was
afraid that Timmy would begin again at any moment!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
man came into the room - one of the two big fellows that the children had seen
in the courtyard. He didn’t seem to have heard Timmy growling, for he sauntered
in, whistling lightly. He shone his torch all round, and then called loudly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Emilio!
Emilio!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no answer at all. The man yelled again, and then an answer came from beyond
the door, and hurrying footsteps could be heard. Then in came the other big
rough fellow, and looked round, shining his torch. He lighted an oil lamp on a
box, and switched off his torch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Always
you sleep, Emilio!’ growled the first man. ‘Always you are late! You know the
boat comes tonight to take the next batch of' goods - have you the list? We
must wrap them up quickly and take them to the shore. That little statue has to
go, I know!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went over to the statue of a boy, whose eyes gleamed with emeralds. ‘Well,
boy?’ said the man, ‘you’re going out into the world! How’ll you like that
after being in the dark so long? Don’t glare at me like that, or I’ll box your
ears!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Apparently
the golden boy went on glaring, for the man gave his head a sharp smack. The
other fellow came over and shifted a long, deep box over from the wall to the
little golden statue. Then he began to wrap it up carefully, rolling material
round and round it from head to foot while the golden boy stood patiently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
time is Lanyon coming for it?’ asked Emilio. ‘Have I time to wrap another?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- that one over there,’ said the first fellow, pointing. Emilio went whistling
over to it, passing the chest behind which the girls were hiding. They crouched
right to the floor, afraid of being seen. But Emilio was sharp-eyed, and
thought he saw something move as he passed by the chest. He stopped. What was
that poking out by the side of the chest - a foot? A FOOT!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Emilio
rushed round the chest, his torch switched on again. He gave a loud shout.
‘Carlo! There’s someone here! Come quickly!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Carlo,
the second man, dropped what he was holding and raced round to Emilio, who had
now pulled the girls roughly to their feet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
are you doing here? How did you get in?’ shouted Emilio.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
shot out from his hiding-place at once, followed by Dick and Wilfrid. George
was doing all she could to hold back Timmy, who was now deafening everyone with
his angry barks. He did his best to get away from George, but she was afraid he
might fly at Emilio’s throat. The two men were full of amazement to see the
five children and Timmy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Keep
that dog back or I’ll shoot him,’ said Carlo, producing a gun. ‘Who are you?
What do you mean by coming into this place?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
came by boat - but the boat got washed out to sea,’ said Julian. ‘We’ve been
camping on the island. We just - er - wandered into this place by mistake.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘By
mistake! Well, I can tell you that you’ve certainly made the biggest mistake in
your life!’ said Carlo. ‘You’ll have to stay here for quite a long time - till
our job’s done, at any rate!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
your job?’ asked Julian, bluntly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wouldn’t
you like to know?’ said Carlo. ‘Well - one part of it is to guard the island,
and keep off strangers! Now, we’ve jobs to do tonight and tomorrow, and I’m
afraid you’re going to have a miserable time! You’ll stay down here in this old
cellar till we come back again - and what will happen to you after that, I
don’t know, because I’ll have to tell my employer you’ve been spying down here.
I wouldn’t be surprised if he doesn’t hand you over to the police - or lock you
up down here for a month, on bread and water!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
growled very fiercely indeed, and tugged hard to get away from George and fly
at this hateful man. She hung on to him for all she was worth, though how she
longed to let him leap at the man and get him on the ground!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Better
go, Carlo, or we’ll miss that boat out there,’ said Emilio, grumpily. ‘We’ll
deal with these kids when we get back!’ He shouldered the box into which he had
put the wrapped statue, and started for the door. Carlo followed him, backing
all the time to make sure that George did not set Timmy on to him. He shut the
great door with a loud bang, and shot the bolt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
say anything for a minute in case they are listening outside the door,’ said
Julian. So they all stood in silence, Anne’s knees trembling a little. Oh dear
- how unlucky to be caught like this!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Relax!’
said Julian, at last. ‘You all look so stiff and tense!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I should think so!’ said Dick. ‘I don’t particularly want to stay shut up here
till those men deign to come back and do a bit more stealing. Suppose they
never came back! We’d be here for keeps!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
Dick!’ said Anne, and to everyone’s surprise, she began to laugh. ‘We can
easily escape!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
- through that locked and bolted door?’ said Dick. ‘Not a hope!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
we can easily escape!’ said Anne, and George suddenly brightened up and nodded
her head, smiling. ‘Oh yes - of course! Don’t look so solemn, Dick! Look up
there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
looked up to where Anne was pointing. ‘What am I supposed to look at?’ he said.
‘The old stone wall?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
- just there - over the top of that tall chest,’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
looked - and then a large smile came over his face. ‘WHAT an idiot I am! That’s
the old iron door in the side of the old well-wall, isn’t it - the opening I
looked through! It looks just like an ordinary ventilation hole from down here
- and I don’t really believe anyone would ever notice it except us, who know
what it is. I see what you’re getting at, Anne!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
old Anne!’ said George, realizing what Anne had in mind. ‘Of course - we’ve
only got to climb up to that hole in the wall, open the door there, and then go
up the well - and we’re safe!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
But it’s easier said than done,’ said Julian, soberly. ‘We’ve got to get hold
of the rope, and climb right up it to the top - not very easy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Suppose
the rope’s at the top, with the bucket hanging on the hook?’ said Anne. ‘We’d
never reach it then!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
think of something!’ said Julian. ‘Anyway, it’s our only hope of escape. Now -
we’ll push that huge, high chest or wardrobe or whatever it is, right over
against the wall, under thit opening into the well - and then we’ll haul a
table on top of that - there’s a sturdy little one over there. Come on! We’ll
be through that opening in no time, and up the well. What a shock for dear
Emilio and Carlo when they come back, and find that the birds have flown!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Eighteen<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
MOST EXCITING TIME!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was quite a job pushing the heavy chest over towards the stone wall of the
castle. It took all of them, shoving with all their might, to do it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
seem to be making an awful noise with the chest scraping over the floor,’
panted Dick. ‘I hope we’re not heard!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
wished he could help. He kept jumping up and pressing his paws on the side of
the chest, but Dick stopped him. ‘You’re getting in the way,’ he said. ‘You go
and sit near the door and warn us if you hear those men coming.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
Timmy ran to the door and sat there, his head cocked to one side, listening,
while the others went on shoving the heavy chest along. At last it was in
position. Then came the job of hoisting a stout little wooden table on top.
Julian climbed up to the top of the chest to take the table from Dick, but just
couldn’t manage it, it was so heavy and solid. So Wilfrid climbed up beside
him, and between the two of them they pulled up the little oblong table, and
set it firmly on top of the chest. Julian stood on it - and found he could
easily reach the little iron door, that led into the old well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good,’
he said, and he gave the door a hard shove. It shook a little, but didn’t
budge. He gave it another hard push. ‘What’s up?’ said Dick, climbing up beside
Julian. ‘It must open - the bolt’s not there any more - it fell off into the
well. I expect it’s rusted a little again. We’ll both shove it together.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls watched the boys anxiously, dreading every moment to hear the two men
returning. Together the boys pushed at the iron door - and it groaned and then
gave way, swinging open inside the well-wall! To the boys’ delight, there was
the rope, hanging near them!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ve
done it!’ Dick called down softly to the girls. ‘We’ll come down and help you
up to the table here - then we’ll try our luck up the well.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls were soon on the chest top. There wasn’t room for everyone on the table,
and the boys were debating what to do next.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
go up the rope, Julian,’ said Dick. ‘You can climb up to the top and get out
and look around and make sure there’s no one about. Then Wilfrid can climb up -
do you think you can, Wilfrid?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course,’ said the boy. ‘Then I can help Julian to wind up the girls!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right!’
said Dick. ‘I’ll stay here with the girls, and help each of them on to the
rope, first Anne - and you two can wind the rope up, with her on it. Then
George can go - and I’ll follow last of all and shut the well-door.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
when the men come they won’t know how in the world we got out of the treasure
chamber!’ said Anne, grinning. ‘What a shock for them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘When
you’ve all gone up safely, I’ll climb in myself and shut the door,’ said Dick.
‘Ready, Ju? I’ll shine my torch for you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
nodded. He squeezed through the old iron door, reached out for the rope, and
swung on it for a moment. Then up he went, hand-over-hand, till he reached the
top, a little out of breath, but delighted to be out in the open air and the
bright moonlight. It seemed almost as light as day!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
called down the well. ‘I’m at the top, Dick, and all’s well. Moon’s out, and
all is quiet.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
next, Wilfrid,’ said Dick. ‘Can you get hold of the rope all right, do you
think? For pity’s sake don’t fall into the water. My torch will give you plenty
of light.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
worry about me! It’s just like being on the ropes at gym in school,’ said
Wilfrid, scornfully. He swung his legs into the opening, leapt at the rope,
hung on, and began to climb up just like a monkey.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian’s
voice came down the well again, echoing hollowly, sounding rather queer.
‘Wilfrid’s safely up. Now send Anne - we’ll wind up the rope for her, so that
she doesn’t need to climb, only to hang on.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Through
the opening went Anne, and sat on its ledge. ‘Can you swing the rope a bit,
Julian?’ she called. ‘It’s rather far for me to jump.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
gracious! For goodness sake be careful!’ called Julian, in alarm. ‘Tell Dick to
help you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the well-wall opening was so small that Dick couldn’t even look through it
while Anne was sitting there. ‘Don’t jump till you’ve got firm hold of the
rope, Anne,’ he told his sister, anxiously. ‘Is Ju swinging it to and fro? Can
you see it clearly? It’s so dark in the well, and my torch isn’t too good now!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I can see it,’ said Anne. ‘It bumped against my legs then, and I just missed
getting it. Here it comes again - I’ve got it! I’m going to hold on to it
tightly and drop off the ledge. Here I go!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
sounded very much braver than she felt. She let herself drop off the ledge, and
there she swung on the thick rope, with the black water far below! ‘Wind me up,
Ju!’ she called, and held on as the two boys at the top exerted all their
strength. Dick saw her disappear up the well, and heaved a sigh of relief. Now
for George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
climbed down from the table and chest and looked for George and Timmy, shining
his torch everywhere. To his utmost surprise he couldn’t see them! He called
softly. ‘Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
small, stifled whine came from somewhere. Dick frowned. ‘George - where are
you? For goodness sake buck up and come out from where you’re hiding. Those men
might come back at any time! Don’t play the fool.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
dark curly head poked out from behind a large box near the door, and George
spoke in a very fierce voice. ‘You know Timmy can’t hang on to a rope! He’d
fall and be drowned. I think you are all horrid to forget that he can’t climb.
I’m staying here with him. You go on up the well.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Certainly
not!’ said Dick at once. ‘I shall stay here with you. I suppose it’s no use
asking you to let me stay with Tim, while you climb up?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
the slightest use. He’s my dog, and I’m jolly well sticking by him,’ said
George. ‘He’d never desert me, I’m sure of that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
knew George only too well when she was in one of her determined moods. Nothing,
absolutely nothing, would make her change her mind!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right, George - I expect I’d feel the same if Timmy was mine,’ said Dick. ‘I’m
staying here with you, though!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said George. ‘We’ll be all right, Tim and I.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
ran to the chest and table that he had used to get up to the opening in the
well-wall, and climbed quickly to the top. He swung himself through, sat on the
edge of the opening and called up the well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian?
Are you there? Listen - George won’t leave Timmy because he can’t climb up the
rope. So I’m staying with her!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>No
sooner had he said these words, than he heard someone unlocking the door of the
room they were in! Timmy growled so fiercely that Dick’s heart jumped in fear.
Suppose Tim leapt at those men - and one of them had a gun!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
heard the noise of the key turning in the door, and quick as lightning she went
behind a pile of boxes with Timmy. ‘Go for them, Timmy, just as soon as you
can!’ she said. ‘Get them down before they can hurt you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, understanding every word. He stood beside George, ears cocked,
showing his teeth in a snarl. The door opened, and a man came in, carrying a
lantern. ‘I’ve brought you a light,’ he began - and then Timmy leapt at him!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Crash!
Down went the lantern and the light went out. Down went the man too, shouting
in fear as the big dog leapt on his chest, his hairy face so close that the man
could feel the dog’s hot breath. The man’s head struck against the edge of a
chest, and he was suddenly still and silent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Knocked
out, I do believe!’ said Dick to himself, and very cautiously shone his torch
round. Yes - there was the man on the floor, eyes closed, unmoving!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was at the open door, looking out, Timmy by her side. ‘Dick! I’m taking Timmy
down the secret way through the cliffs. I’ll be perfectly safe with him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
must tell Julian,’ said Dick. ‘He’s still at the top of the well, expecting you
and Timmy. You go as quickly as you can - and be careful. Timmy will look after
you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
disappeared at top speed, her shoes making no sound. She looked anxious but not
afraid. ‘Good as a boy!’ thought Dick, for the hundredth time. ‘Every bit as
good as a boy. Doesn’t turn a hair! Now I’d better get back to that opening in
the well, and tell Julian that George and Timmy have gone down the secret way.
That man is still knocked out, thank goodness!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was soon on top of the chest and table, and peering through the hole. He could
see the light from Julian’s torch far away at the top, the light flashing on
and off as if signalling. Dick called up ‘Julian!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
so you’re still there,’ said Julian, sounding very relieved. ‘Anything
happened?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Dick. ‘I’ll tell you in a minute. Swing the rope a bit, Ju.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
rope swung near Dick, and he caught it, and was just about to swing himself
into the well when he heard a noise. He looked back into the vast room, which
was now in darkness, for he had switched off his torch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Someone
came in hurriedly. ‘What’s happened? Why didn’t you...’ Then he stopped as the
light from the lantern he carried picked out the figure of the man on the
floor. He gave an exclamation and knelt down by him. Dick grinned to himself -
what about a nice little shock for this fellow? He reached down to the sturdy
little table, gave it a shove that sent it hurtling down to the floor, and then
swung himself into the well on the rope. He was just in time to see the table
fall with a crash by the man with the lantern, and to hear him shout in fear -
and then Julian and Wilfrid hauled him up the well, still grinning to himself.
‘Bit of a shock for those men!’ he thought. ‘George and Timmy disappeared - and
the rest of us gone most mysteriously! Pull, Julian, pull! I’ve a nice little
story to tell you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
soon he was up on the well-wall, telling the others what had happened. They
laughed in delight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
old George! Good old Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George
knows the way down the cliff passage all right - and if she didn’t Timmy would
take her safely,’ said Julian. ‘We’ll go down on the rocks and meet her, I
think. She should be all right because the moon’s out now, and everything is as
light as day!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
off they all went through the wood, laughing when they thought how puzzled and
mystified those men must be!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the meantime, George was hurrying down the secret way through the cliffs. Timmy
ran first in front and then behind, his ears pricked for any possible pursuer
or danger. He could hear no one. Good! Both he and George were glad to hear the
babbling of the funny little underground stream as it ran swiftly down towards the
sea. ‘It’s a nice friendly sound, Tim,’ said George. ‘I like it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Once
or twice they slipped from the wet ledges into the water, and George felt a bit
afraid of falling and breaking her torch. ‘It wouldn’t be much fun if we had to
go down this passage in the pitch dark!’ she told Timmy, and he gave a little
woof of agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
that bright light?’ said George, suddenly, stopping in the passage. ‘Look, Tim
- awfully bright. Is it someone coming with a lantern?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
gave a loud bark and rush in front. He knew that lantern all right! It was the
one that somebody sometimes hung in the sky, and that George called the Moon.
Didn’t she know?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
soon did know, of course, and cried out in delight. ‘Oh, it’s the moon, of
course, dear old moon. I’d forgotten it was a moonlight night tonight. I wonder
where the others are, Timmy. You’ll have to smell them out!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
already knew where they were! He had caught their scent on the wind. They
weren’t very far away! He barked joyously. Soon they would all be together
again!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
and George came out of the tunnel in the cliff and found themselves on the
rocks. The sea was splashing over them, and the waves gleamed brightly in the
bright moonlight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
saw something moving in the distance. She put her hand on Timmy’s collar.
‘Careful, Tim,’ she said. ‘Is that someone coming over there? Stay by me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timmy disobeyed for once! He leapt away and splashed through pools, over
seaweed, over slippery rocks, barking madly. ‘Timmy!’ called George, not
recognising who was coming. ‘TIMMY! COME BACK!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then she saw who were coming over the rock in the bright moonlight, picking
their way through the slippery seaweed. She waved and shouted joyfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here
I am! I’ve escaped all right!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
a joyful meeting that was! They all sat down on a convenient rock and talked
nineteen to the dozen, telling each other what had happened. And then a big
wave suddenly came up and splashed all over them!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Blow!’
said Julian. ‘Tide’s coming in, I suppose. Come on - let’s get back to
Whispering Wood.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
gave a most enormous yawn. ‘I don’t know what the time is,’ she said. ‘And it’s
so bright everywhere that I’m not sure if it’s day or night. All I know is that
I’m suddenly most awfully SLEEPY.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
glanced at his watch. ‘It’s very late,’ he said. ‘Long past our bedtime. What
shall we do - risk sleeping here on the island - or find Wilfrid’s boat and row
across to the mainland - and have a nice long, peaceful snooze in that dear
little cottage?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
don’t let’s stay on the island!’ said Anne. ‘I’d never go to sleep! I’d be
afraid those men would find us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
be silly, Anne,’ said George, trying not to yawn. ‘They wouldn’t have the
remotest idea where to look for us! I honestly don’t fancy looking for
Wilfrid’s boat, rowing all the way to the mainland, and then climbing up that
steep hill to the cottage!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- all right,’ said Anne. ‘But oughtn’t somebody to be on guard - oughtn’t we
each to take turn?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
so fussy, Anne?’ asked George. ‘Timmy would hear anyone!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
suppose he would,’ said Anne, giving way. ‘We’ll stay here then.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were all very tired. The boys pulled up armfuls of old dry bracken and spread
it in a sheltered patch of grass, where bushes surrounded them, and sheltered
them from the wind. It was not far from the cove where Wilfrid’s boat lay. They
snuggled into the bracken.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nice
and cosy!’ said George, yawning. ‘Ohhh! I’ve never felt so sleepy in my life!’
And in three seconds she was sound asleep! Wilfrid dropped off at once too, and
Dick and Julian were soon giving little gentle snores.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
was still awake. She felt nervous. ‘I’d dearly like to know if those men are
safely underground!’ she thought. ‘I can’t imagine that they are very pleased
at us getting away - they’ll know we’ll go to the mainland as soon as we can,
and tell everyone what we have found! I should have thought they would try to
stop us leaving. They must hnow we have a boat!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
lay and worried, keeping her ears open for any strange sound. Timmy heard her
tossing and turning and crept over to her very quietly, so as not to wake
George. He lay down beside Anne, giving her a loving lick as if to say, ‘Now,
you go to sleep, and I’ll keep watch!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
still Anne didn’t fall asleep. Still she kept her ears wide open for any
unusual sound - and then, quite suddenly, she heard something. So did Timmy. He
sat up, and gave a very small growl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
strained her ears. Yes - it was certainly voices she could hear - low voices,
that didn’t want to be heard. It was the men coming to find Wilfrid’s boat!
Once they had that, the children couldn’t get away from Whispering Island!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
ran a little way from the bushes, and looked round at Anne as if to say,
‘Coming with me?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
got up quietly and went to Timmy. He ran on in front, and she followed. She
really must see what was happening, then if it was anything important, she
could run back and rouse everyone. Timmy was taking her to the cove where
Wilfrid had left his boat, hauled high up on the sand, for fear of big waves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were both as quiet as they could be. Timmy growled a little when he heard the
voices again, much nearer this time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
men had come quietly round the island in their own boat, to set Wilfrid’s boat
adrift. Anne saw them pushing Wilfrid’s boat down the sand towards the sea.
Once it was adrift, she and the others would be prisoners on the island! She
yelled at the top of her voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
stop that! It’s OUR boat!’ And Timmy began to bark his head off, prancing round
the men, and showing his big white teeth. The barking awoke all the others and
they leapt up at once. ‘That’s Timmy!’ shouted Julian. ‘That’s Timmy barking!
Come on, quickly - but be careful!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
ran at top speed to the cove. Timmy was still barking madly - and someone was
yelling. It sounded like Anne. ANNE - no, no, it couldn’t be quiet little
Anne!’ thought Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it was! For when the four arrived at the cove, there was Anne yelling to Timmy
to bite the men, and dancing about in a rare old temper!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
DARE you come and take our boat! I’ll tell Timmy to bite you! And he will too!
Get them, Tim, get them! How DARE you take our boat! Bite them, Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
had already bitten both the men, who were now rowing away in their own boat at
top speed. Anne picked up a stone and sent it whizzing after them. It struck
their boat and made them jump.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
jumped too when she turned and saw Julian, George, Wilfrid and Dick. ‘I’m so
glad you’ve come!’ she said. ‘I think Timmy and I have frightened them off. The
beasts!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Frightened
them off! You’ve scared them stiff!’ said Julian, hugging his sister. ‘You even
scared me! Good gracious - the mouse has certainly turned into a fearsome
tiger! I can almost see smoke coming out of your nostrils.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
tiger? Did I really sound like a tiger?’ said Anne. ‘I’m glad! I hated you all
thinking I was a mouse. You’d better be careful now, I might turn into a tiger
again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
men were now out of sight, and Timmy sent a volley of barks after their
vanished boat. What chance had any men against a dog and a tiger? WOOF!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian
- why can’t we row back to the mainland now?’ demanded Anne. ‘I’m so hungry and
there’s nothing to eat here now. And I wasn’t really very comfortable in that
brackeny bed. I’m longing to sleep in a proper bed. I’ve a good mind to take
that boat of Wilfrid’s and row myself back, if you don’t want to come.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
couldn’t help laughing at this new fierce Anne. He put his arm round her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
believe it’s dangerous to say no to a tiger,’ he said. ‘So you shall have your
way, Anne. I’m awfully hungry too - and I bet the others are.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And,
in five minutes time, the six of them were out on the sea, Julian taking one
oar, and Dick the other, ‘Swish-swash - swish-swash’ went the oars, and the
boat rocked as it sped along.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
bet if those men spot us out on the sea in a boat, going across to the
mainland, they will feel pretty uncomfortable!’ said Julian. ‘They’ll know
we’ll be going to the police first thing tomorrow. My word - this has been
quite an adventure, hasn’t it! I shall be glad of a little peace now!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Well
- you’ll soon have it, Julian! That little cottage is waiting for you all, with
its glorious view over the Harbour and Whispering Island. You’ll have quite a
bit of excitement tomorrow, of course, when the police take you back to the
island in their boat, and you show them the old well, the vast
treasure-chamber, the secret passage, and all the rest. You’ll be there when
all the men are rounded up, you’ll watch them chugging off, prisoners, in the
police boat, amazed that the Famous Five should have defeated them. What an
adventure! And what a relief when all the excitement is over, and you lie
peacefully on the hillside, with the little cottage just behind you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
for a real lazy time!’ said Anne, when the Five had seen the last of the police.
‘Let’s all go out on the hill in the sunshine, and have orangeade and biscuits
and fruit salad - and Wilfrid shall play his magic pipe and bring his furred
and feathered friends to see us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Has
he found his pipe then?’ said Dick, pleased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
He took the well-bucket to get some water to drink - and lo and behold the pipe
was in the bottom of the bucket!’ said Anne. ‘He thinks it must have fallen
there the last time he went to fetch water from the well - and nobody noticed
it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
good!’ said George, thankfully. ‘Wilfrid, what about playing a tune on your
little pipe? I’m so glad it’s found. I’d like to hear it again.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wilfrid
was pleased. ‘All right,’ he said. ‘I’ll see if my friends here still remember
me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
sat down on the hillside a little away from the others and began to blow down
the pipe - and out came the strange little tune! At once the birds in the trees
around turned their heads. In the bushes the lizards raised themselves, put
their quaint heads on one side and listened. Rabbits stopped their play. The
big hare bounded up the hill, its great ears taking in every note. A magpie
flew down to the boy’s foot and sat there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Wilfrid
didn’t stir. He just went on playing as the creatures came to listen. Timmy
listened too, and went to the boy, pressing against him, licking his ear. Then
he went back to George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We’ll
leave them all there in the sunshine, quiet and peaceful, watching the little
creatures that Wilfrid can always bring around him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
is lying back, looking at the April sky, glad that their adventure ended so
well. Dick is looking down at Whispering Island, set in the brilliant blue
harbour. Anne is half asleep - quiet little Anne who can turn into a tiger if
she has to!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
George, of course, is close to Timmy, her arm round his neck, very happy
indeed. Good-bye, Five - it was fun sharing in your grand adventure!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
