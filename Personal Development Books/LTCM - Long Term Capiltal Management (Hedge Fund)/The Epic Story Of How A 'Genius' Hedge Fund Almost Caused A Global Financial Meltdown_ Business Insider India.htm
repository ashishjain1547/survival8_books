  The Epic Story Of How A 'Genius' Hedge Fund Almost Caused A Global

dominoes falling

Christian Charisius/Reuters

Twenty years ago, one bond-trading hedge fund grew from launch to over
$100 billion in assets in less than three years. It saw yearly returns
of over 40 percent. It was run by finance veterans, PhDs, professors,
and two Nobel Prize winners. Everyone on Wall Street wanted a piece of
their profits.

But by 1998, that firm was primed to expose America's largest banks to
more than $1 trillion in default risks. The demise of the firm,
Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), was swift and sudden. In less than
one year, LTCM had lost $4.4 billion of its $4.7 billion in capital.

The entire story is recounted in Roger Lowenstein's book, /'/*When
Genius Failed
<http://www.amazon.com/When-Genius-Failed-Long-Term-Management/dp/0375758259>',*
with details on the specific strategies and financial theories employed
by Long-Term. It's an absolute must-read for anyone working on Wall
Street, so we've summarized the basics for you in ten slides.

This story has all the players - the Federal Reserve, which finally
stepped in and organized a bailout, and all the major banks that did the
heavy lifting: Bear Stearns, Salomon Smith Barney, Bankers Trust, J.P.
Morgan, Lehman Brothers, Chase Manhattan, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley,
and Goldman Sachs.

In desperate need of a $4 billion bailout, the crumbling firm was at the
mercy of the banks it had once snubbed and manipulated.

      The idea for LTCM began with John Meriwether, who ran bond
      arbitrage at Salomon Brothers. He resigned from that bank after an
      employee was discovered deliberately deceiving the U.S. Treasury.

The idea for LTCM began with John Meriwether, who ran bond arbitrage at
Salomon Brothers. He resigned from that bank after an employee was
discovered deliberately deceiving the U.S. Treasury.
//////////

The groundwork for Long-Term Capital Management began when John
Meriwether joined the investment bank Salomon Brothers in 1974.

Meriwether set up a bond arbitrage group within Salomon, and began
hiring intellectuals to build formulas predicting market prices and
finding outliers. The strategy was to buy or sell bonds when prices
deviated from the norm, then wait for prices to converge again to make a
profit.

The Arbitrage Group became known within Salomon for its clique-y
culture, its confidence, and its substantial profits. Soon Meriwether
was put in charge of all bond trading. Bond arbitrage started to spread
across the financial industry. When Meriwether was forced to resigned
after an oversight failure with one of his employees, he built his new
hedge fund around these same principles.


      Meriweather set up his own hedge fund for arbitrage using
      mathematical models to predict prices. Stocked with industry
      veterans and respected academics, the firm launched in 1994 with
      $1.25 billion in capital.

//////////

By the 1990s, the number of hedge funds in the U.S. had exploded,
arriving at about 3,000 hedge funds from only about 200 in 1968. But
Meriwether had high expectations for his hedge fund that would set it on
an entirely different level.

First, he wanted to raise capital of $2.5 billion. Second, LTCM's asking
fees would be 25 percent of profits on top of an annual two percent
charge on assets. Third, investors were required to keep their capital
in for a minimum of three years. These standards were incredibly
uncommon for a hedge fund to demand.

To justify these, Meriwether recruited respected academics who would
bring credibility for the nascent firm, including Robert C. Merton,
Myron Scholes, and David Mullins, then vice chairman of the Federal
Reserve. Despite numerous rejections from investors including Warren
Buffet, LTCM began to pick up speed, even adding foreign investors who
did not traditionally deal with hedge funds.

By February 1994, Long-Term Capital launched with the largest amount of
funding ever at $1.25 billion.


      In two years, LTCM had risen to over $140 billion in assets. The
      firm guarded their trades to the extreme, refusing to give details
      to any banks or investors.

guarded their trades to the extreme, refusing to give details to any
banks or investors.
//////////

In the first year, Long-Term made almost no mistakes, earning 28 percent
when most other bond investors were losing money. Run by a team of
all-star partners with record-level funding, Long-Term Capital
Management was the new firm that everyone wanted to do business with.

Long-Term's edge came from its experience reading models and a secure
base of financing. The team was skilled in finding pairs of trades,
hedging their bets, and leveraging smaller profits for a bigger payout.
People didn't really think of Long-Term as a hedge fund, but as a
financial technology investment company.

However, Long-Term was very secretive about its operations, to the point
where banks found it extremely frustrating to work with them. Partners
rarely gave specifics on what strategies they were employing, and
scattered trades between banks to avoid giving away too much information
to any proprietary desk. Long-Term usually gave a broad overview of
models and the economy, but not much else. The partners even bought back
photos used in Business Week to erase themselves completely from the media.

The partners were also known to be condescending and conceited, always
putting their own interests first. But since Long-Term was flourishing,
no one needed to know exactly what they were doing. All they knew was
that the profits were coming in as promised.


      Critics of Long-Term were worried about the dependency its models
      had on a completely rational market. If the markets did not behave
      as they did in the past, Long-Term could lose millions on its
      highly leveraged trades.

in the past, Long-Term could lose millions on its highly leveraged trades.
//////////

Not everyone believed that Long-Term's models were the be-all end-all to
investing.

*Seth Klarman*, general partner at Baupost Group, had turned down a
stake in Long-Term. He believed not accounting for "outlier" events and
increasing leverage was incredibly reckless. Any serious mistake on
Long-Term's part would wipe out a huge amount of its capital.

*Mitchell Kapor *and LTCM partner Eric Rosenfeld created and sold a
statistics program together for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Afterwards, Kapor took a finance course with Merton at MIT, but saw
quantitative finance as a faith, rather than science. Seeing the
potential for disaster in these models, Kapor opted for the software
industry instead.

*Paul Samuelson*, the first financial economist to win a Nobel Prize,
was a mentor to Merton while at MIT. Since the conception of LTCM,
Samuelson was concerned about what would happen if extraordinary events
affected the market, and moved it out of its ideal predictability.

*Eugene Fama*, Schole's thesis advisor, found in his research that
stocks were bound to have extreme outliers, which couldn't be explained
by random distribution. Real-life markets are inherently more risky than
models, because they are subject to discontinuous price changes. He
became even more concerned when Long-Term eventually moved into equity.

Nonetheless, Long-Term wouldn't stop growing. By 1996, the firm had over
100 employees and $140 billion in assets. That year they brought in
total profits of $2.1 billion. In 1997, Merton and Scholes were awarded
the Nobel Prize in economic science for their model in determining
derivative values.


      With everyone on Wall Street moving into bond arbitrage, Long-Term
      began exploring equity arbitrage, swaps, volatility, and global
      markets.

//////////

Soon, everyone began catching onto Long-Term's bond arbitrage strategy.
Each time Long-Term moved toward a trade, others would jump in, driving
down the spread and effectively reducing opportunities for profit. It
was time to expand.

The team started exploring equity and merger arbitrage. Partner Victor
Haghani was dabbling in finding paired-share trades in related stocks.
Another partner, Larry Hilibrand, began betting on company mergers to
create and close spreads in stocks. Both began taking enormously
leveraged positions in these bets.

Equity arbitrage was inherently more risky than bond arbitrage, because
spreads could vary from four percent to 10 percent. LTCM was leaving its
area of expertise, and entering a world that took others years to
understand and predict.

At one point, Long-Term had $40 million riding on each percentage point
change of volatility in both the U.S. and Europe. It started investing
in Brazilian bonds, Russian bonds, and Danish mortgages. Long-Term had
more capital than it knew what to do with. It returned $2.7 billion
funds to outside investors, and continued to pour money into new markets.


      The fall of Asian markets led to Long-Term's first big loss, which
      would snowball from there. Following the crisis, everyone began
      backing out of risky investments.

//////////

In 1997, Thailand's financial defaults triggered a market crash in Asia,
with one falling after another: Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia,
South Korea. The International Monetary Fund tried to smooth things
over, but it was running into some problems. Russia became the next
country to fall.

Amid the global panic, investor sentiment began to change. Banks began
to withdraw from more risky, illiquid investments. Craving safety,
people flocked to Treasury bonds, causing spreads to widen. Volatility
in the U.S. market began to rise. Long-Term was losing money on every
bet it made.

Another deep concern for LTCM was that Salomon, which played a large
role in its positions, began liquidating its assets after consistently
mediocre returns. With Salomon's fall, other firms were abandoning
arbitrage trades. Long-Term lost 14 percent in the first half of 1998,
its biggest loss yet.

Still, no one saw any real cause for alarm. Meriwether knew the firm had
to have an unprofitable month at some point. Everyone was losing money
in the current environment, and Long-Term still had $128 billion in assets.


      Russia soon followed Asia's decline, and Long-Term lost $553
      million in one day. Unfortunately, Long-Term had such large
      positions in its trade that it was impossible to sell.

//////////

The bad news came when many of Wall Street's executives were away on
vacation. In August 1998, Russia defaulted on its debt. Three days
later, markets all over the world started sinking. Investors began
pulling out left and right. Swap spreads were at unbelievable levels.
Everything was plummeting.

In one day, Long-Term lost $553 million, 15 percent of its capital. In
one month it lost almost $2 billion.

The firm held on to the belief that spreads would converge again, but
had to start selling to avoid more catastrophic losses. Unfortunately,
no one was buying, especially in such large quantities as Long-Term had.
No one was willing to provide more funding to the floundering firm either.

After being turned down by a series of hedge fund managers, banks, and
other investors, LTCM was down to $500 million in assets, and barely
able to clear trades. Banks began preparing for the possibility of default.


      In only a few weeks, Long-Term was facing $1 trillion in default
      risks. Meriwether tried to raise more money from investors to save
      their positions, but no one was willing to lend.

//////////

If Long-Term defaulted, about fifty other counterparties would also be
in trouble. More than $1 trillion was at risk. UBS, who had taken on the
risk of buying a warrant from Long-Term at the height of its glory, was
facing a huge downfall.

By now, everyone knew about all of Long-Term's trades. Their secrets
were out in the open, which meant everyone knew they were in dire
trouble too. All the while, Long-Term was still taking hits like crazy.
In 1998, it lost almost $3 billion on swaps and volatility trades alone.
The market was no longer following their models, and the partners were
finally out of moves.

Finally, Bear Stearns stopped clearing Long-Term's trades. All efforts
to raise capital were failing. Long-Term had approached Warren Buffet,
George Soros, and several banks, looking to raise more money. It was
then that the Federal Reserve agreed to step in.


      If Long-Term went bankrupt, the entirety of Wall Street was facing
      exposure and huge losses. Finally, the Federal Reserve worked
      together with Wall Street's major banks to put together a $3.65
      billion bailout package.

package.
//////////

The entire market was exposed to losses in the scenario that LTCM went
bankrupt. No one cared much what happened to the firm, but needed to
figure out how to protect their own assets. And so the biggest banks on
Wall Street met with New York Federal Reserve President William
McDonough to discuss a bailout plan.

The debate was a messy process, with negotiations falling through left
and right. Bear Stearns completely refused to take part in any of it.
Eventually, eleven of the banks agreed to put in $300 million, Lehman
$100 million, and two French banks at $125 million each, for a total
$3.65 million bailout. The executives hoped that this would help lower
risk, return capital to the fund's investors, and potentially reverse
losses.

Even after a deal was reached, the agreement was threatened several more
times by demands from both the individual banks and Long-Term's partners
themselves. Even though their firm was going under, they were still
reluctant to admit defeat. Finally, the deal was signed, the partners
relinquished control, and LTCM started to stabilize.


      In the aftermath of Long-Term's crash, most partners went on to
      start new hedge funds and financial firms.

//////////

The bailout required that Long-Term's partners stay on with the firm for
awhile, since they had the most experience and expertise with their own
disastrous trades. As bad as Long-Term's demise was, the partners mostly
thought of it as a trade gone bad. Soon, they were ready to move onto
the next one.

*John Meriwether *continued on to start JWM Partners LLC, another hedge
fund that shut down in the 2008 financial crisis. He then launched a
third
<http://www.businessinsider.com/john-meriwether-is-really-launching-a-third-hedge-fund-2009-10>
in 2010 called JM Advisors Management, all of which use the same
investment strategy from his time at LTCM and Salomon.

*Eric Rosenfeld,* Long-Term's manager and co-founder, joined Meriwether
in starting JWM Partners. Rosenfeld also previously worked at Salomon
with Meriwether and left to join LTCM with him. After JWM, Rosenfeld
became president at Paloma Partners, then began his own hedge fund
Quantitative Alternatives LLC
<http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aCz8EcJBd5RA&refer=home>
in 2007.

*Larry Hilibrand *and *Victor Haghani *also joined Meriwether in JWM
Partners after LTCM's collapse.

A year after LTCM, *Robert Merton *joined J.P. Morgan as a senior
advisor and managing director until 2001. He then cofounded
<http://www.forbes.com/profile/robert-merton/> a specialized investment
bank, Integrated Finance Limited in 2002, which eventually merged with
Marakon Associates. Merton left the company in 2008. In 2010 he rejoined
the finance faculty at MIT after 22 years teaching at Harvard Business
School.

*Myron Scholes *moved to San Francisco and began lecturing at Stanford
shortly after LTCM. He started another hedge fund, Platinum Grove Asset
Management
<http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?sid=aWQVwbD5Hfxw&pid=newsarchive>,
in 1999. He retired from the fund in 2011
<http://www.businessinsider.com/ltcm-myron-scholes-retiring-2011-2>.
Most recently, Scholes joined Janus Capital as the new chief investment
strategist <http://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20140708-905477.html> in
July 2014.
