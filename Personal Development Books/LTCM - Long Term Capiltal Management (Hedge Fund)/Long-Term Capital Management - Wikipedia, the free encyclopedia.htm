*Long-Term Capital Management L.P.* (*LTCM*) was a hedge fund
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund> management firm^[1]
<#cite_note-FinancialHistory-1> based in Greenwich
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich,_Connecticut>, Connecticut

recruited several Salomon bond traders—Larry Hilibrand
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Hilibrand> and Victor Haghani
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Haghani> in particular would wield

Leahy, James McEntee, Robert Shustak, and David W. Mullins Jr.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_W._Mullins_Jr.>

The company consisted of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a company
incorporated in Delaware <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware> but
based in Greenwich, Connecticut
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich,_Connecticut>. LTCM managed
trades in Long-Term Capital Portfolio LP, a partnership registered in
the Cayman Islands <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayman_Islands>. The
fund's operation was designed to have extremely low overhead; trades
were conducted through a partnership with Bear Stearns
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Stearns> and client relations were
handled by Merrill Lynch
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrill_Lynch>.^[9] <#cite_note-9>

Meriwether chose to start a hedge fund to avoid the financial regulation
imposed on more traditional investment vehicles, such as mutual funds
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund>, as established by the
Investment Company Act of 1940
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_Company_Act_of_1940>—funds
which accepted stakes from 100 or fewer individuals with more than $1
million in net worth each were exempt from most of the regulations that
bound other investment companies.^[10] <#cite_note-10> In late 1993,
Meriwether approached several "high-net-worth individuals
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-net-worth_individual>" in an effort
to secure start-up capital for Long-Term Capital Management. With the
help of Merrill Lynch, LTCM secured hundreds of millions of dollars from
business owners, celebrities and even private university endowments
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_and_university_endowments_in_the_United_States>
and later the Italian central bank. The bulk of the money, however, came
from companies and individuals connected to the financial industry.^[11]
<#cite_note-11> By 24 February 1994, the day LTCM began trading, the
company had amassed just over $1.01 billion in capital.^[12]
<#cite_note-12>


    Trading strategies[edit
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Long-Term_Capital_Management&action=edit&section=2>]

The core investment strategy of the company was then known as involving
convergence trading <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_trading>:
using quantitative models to exploit deviations from fair value in the
relationships between liquid securities across nations and asset
classes. In fixed income the company was involved in US Treasuries,
Japanese Government Bonds, UK Gilts, Italian BTPs, and Latin American
debt, although their activities were not confined to these markets or to
government bonds <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_bond>.^[13]
<#cite_note-13>


      Fixed Income Arbitrage[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Long-Term_Capital_Management&action=edit&section=3>]

Fixed income securities pay a set of coupons at specified dates in the
future, and make a defined redemption payment at maturity. Since bonds
of similar maturities and the same credit quality are close substitutes
for investors, there tends to be a close relationship between their
prices (and yields). Whereas it is possible to construct a single set of
valuation curves for derivative instruments based on LIBOR-type fixings,
it is not possible to do so for government bond securities because every
bond has slightly different characteristics. It is therefore necessary
to construct a theoretical model of what the relationships between
different but closely related fixed income securities should be.

For example, the most recently issued treasury bond
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security#Treasury_bond>
in the US - known as the benchmark - will be more liquid than bonds of
similar but slightly shorter maturity that were issued previously.
Trading is concentrated in the benchmark bond, and transaction costs are
lower for buying or selling it. As a consequence, it tends to trade more
expensively than less liquid <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity>
older bonds, but this expensiveness (or richness) tends to have a
limited duration, because after a certain time there will be a new
benchmark, and trading will shift to this security newly issued by the
Treasury <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_the_Public_Debt>. One
core trade in the LTCM strategies was to purchase the old benchmark -
now a 29.75-year bond, and which no longer had a significant premium -
and to sell short <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_selling> the
newly issued benchmark 30-year, which traded at a premium. Over time the
valuations of the two bonds would tend to converge as the richness of
the benchmark faded once a new benchmark was issued. If the coupons of
the two bonds were similar, then this trade would create an exposure to
changes in the shape of the yield curve: a flattening would depress the
yields and raise the prices of longer-dated bonds, and raise the yields
and depress the prices of shorter-dated bonds. It would therefore tend
to create losses by making the 30-year bond that LTCM was short more
expensive (and the 29.75-year bond they owned cheaper) even if there had
been no change in the true relative valuation of the securities. This
exposure to the shape of the yield curve could be managed at a portfolio
level, and hedged out by entering a smaller steepener in other similar
securities.


      Leverage and Portfolio Composition[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Long-Term_Capital_Management&action=edit&section=4>]

Because the magnitude of discrepancies in valuations in this kind of
trade is small (for the benchmark Treasury convergence trade, typically
a few basis points), in order to earn significant returns for investors,
LTCM used leverage <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)> to
create a portfolio that was a significant multiple (varying over time
depending on their portfolio composition) of investors' equity in the
fund. It was also necessary to access the financing market in order to
borrow the securities that they had sold short. In order to maintain
their portfolio, LTCM was therefore dependent on the willingness of its
counterparties in the government bond (repo) market to continue to
finance their portfolio. If the company was unable to extend its
financing agreements, then it would be forced to sell the securities it
owned and to buy back the securities it was short at market prices,
regardless of whether these were favourable from a valuation perspective.

At the beginning of 1998, the firm had equity of $4.72 billion and had
borrowed over $124.5 billion with assets of around $129 billion, for a
debt-to-equity ratio
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-equity_ratio> of over 25 to
1.^[14] <#cite_note-14> It had off-balance sheet
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-balance_sheet> derivative positions
with a notional value of approximately $1.25 trillion, most of which
were in interest rate derivatives
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate_derivative> such as
interest rate swaps <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate_swap>.
The fund also invested in other derivatives
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_(finance)> such as equity
options <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_option>.


      UBS Investment[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Long-Term_Capital_Management&action=edit&section=5>]

Under prevailing US tax laws, there was a different treatment of
long-term capital gains, which were taxed at 20.0 percent, and income,
which was taxed at 39.6 percent. The earnings for partners in a hedge
fund was taxed at the higher rate applying to income, and LTCM applied
its financial engineering expertise to legally transform income into
capital gains. It did so by engaging in a transaction with UBS (Union
Bank of Switzerland) that would defer foreign interest income for seven
years, thereby being able to earn the more favourable capital gains
treatment. LTCM purchased a call option on 1 million of their own shares
(valued then at $800 million) for a premium paid to UBS of $300 million.
This transaction was completed in three tranches: in June, August, and
October 1997. Under the terms of the deal, UBS agreed to reinvest the
$300 million premium directly back into LTCM for a minimum of three
years. In order to hedge its exposure from being short the call option,
UBS also purchased 1 million of LTCM shares. Put-call parity means that
being short a call and long the same amount of notional as underlying
the call is equivalent to being short a put. So the net effect of the
transaction was for UBS to lend $300 million to LTCM at LIBOR+50 and to
be short a put on 1 million shares. UBS's own motivation for the trade
was to be able to invest in LTCM - a possibility that was not open to
investors generally - and to become closer to LTCM as a client. LTCM
quickly became the largest client of the hedge fund desk, generating $15
million in fees annually.


      Diminishing Opportunities and Broadening of Strategies[edit
      <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Long-Term_Capital_Management&action=edit&section=6>]

LTCM attempted to create a splinter fund in 1996 called LTCM-X that
would invest in even higher risk trades and focus on Latin American
markets. LTCM turned to UBS to invest in and write the warrant for this
new spin-off company.^[15] <#cite_note-15>

LTCM faced challenges in deploying capital as their capital base grew
due to initially strong returns, and as the magnitude of anomalies in
market pricing diminished over time. In Q4 1997, a year in which they
earned 27%, LTCM returned capital to investors. They also broadened
their strategies to include new approaches in markets outside of fixed
income : many of these were not market neutral - they were not dependent
on overall interest rates or stock prices going up (or down) - and they
were not traditional convergence trades. By 1998, LTCM had accumulated
extremely large positions in areas such as merger arbitrage
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_arbitrage> (betting on differences
between a proprietary view of the likelihood of success of mergers and
other corporate transactions would be completed and the implied market
pricing) and S&P 500 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500> options
(net short long-term S&P volatility). LTCM had become a major supplier
of S&P 500 vega <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vega_(finance)>, which
had been in demand by companies seeking to essentially insure equities
against future declines.^[16] <#cite_note-16>


    Downturn[edit

The value of $1,000 invested in LTCM,^[17] <#cite_note-17> the Dow Jones
Industrial Average
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average> and
invested monthly in U.S. Treasuries at constant maturity.
Main articles: 1997 Asian financial crisis
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_financial_crisis> and 1998
Russian financial crisis
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Russian_financial_crisis>

Although periods of distress have often created tremendous opportunities
for relative value strategies, this did not prove to be the case on this
occasion, and the seeds of LTCM's demise were sown before the Russian
default of 17 August 1998. LTCM had returned $2.7 bn to investors in Q4
of 1997, although it had also raised a total in capital of $1.066bn from
UBS and $133m from CSFB. Since position sizes had not been reduced, the
net effect was to raise the leverage of the fund.

Although 1997 had been a very profitable year for LTCM (27%), the
lingering effects of the 1997 Asian crisis continued to shape
developments in asset markets into 1998. Although this crisis had
originated in Asia, its effects were not confined to that region. The
rise in risk aversion had raised concerns amongst investors regarding
all markets heavily dependent on international capital flows, and this
shaped asset pricing in markets outside Asia too.^[18] <#cite_note-18>

In May and June 1998 returns from the fund were -6.42% and -10.14%
respectively, reducing LTCM's capital by $461 million. This was further
aggravated by the exit of Salomon Brothers from the arbitrage
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage> business in July 1998. Because
the Salomon arbitrage group (where many of LTCM's strategies had first
been incubated) had been a significant player in the kinds of strategies
also pursued by LTCM, the liquidation of the Salomon portfolio (and its
announcement itself) had the effect of depressing the prices of the
securities owned by LTCM and bidding up the prices of the securities
LTCM was short. According to Michael Lewis
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lewis> in the New York Times
article of July 1998, returns that month were circa -10%. One LTCM
partner commented that because there was a clear temporary reason to
explain the widening of arbitrage spreads, at the time it gave them more
conviction that these trades would eventually return to fair value (as
they did, but not without widening much further first).

Such losses were accentuated through the 1998 Russian financial crisis
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Russian_financial_crisis> in August
and September 1998, when the Russian government defaulted on their
domestic local currency bonds.^[19] <#cite_note-19> This came as a
surprise to many investors because according to traditional economic
thinking of the time, a sovereign issuer should never need to default
given access to the printing press. There was a flight to quality,
bidding up the prices of the most liquid and benchmark securities that
LTCM was short, and depressing the price of the less liquid securities
that they owned. This phenomenon occurred not merely in the US Treasury
market but across the full spectrum of financial assets. Although LTCM
was diversified the nature of their strategy implied an exposure to a
latent factor risk of the price of liquidity across markets. As a
consequence, when a much larger flight to liquidity occurred than they
had anticipated when constructing their portfolio, their positions
designed to profit from convergence to fair value incurred large losses
as expensive but liquid securities became more expensive, and cheap but
illiquid securities became cheaper. By the end of August, the fund had
lost $1.85 billion in capital.

Because LTCM was not the only fund pursuing such a strategy, and because
the proprietary trading desks of the banks also held some similar
trades, the divergence from fair value was made worse as these other
positions were also liquidated. As rumours of LTCM's difficulties
spread, some market participants positioned in anticipation of a forced
liquidation. Victor Haghani, a partner at LTCM, said about this time "it
was as if there was someone out there with our exact portfolio,... only
it was three times as large as ours, and they were liquidating all at once."

Because these losses reduced the capital base of LTCM, and its ability
to maintain the magnitude of its existing portfolio, LTCM was forced to
liquidate a number of its positions at a highly unfavorable moment and
suffer further losses. A vivid illustration of the consequences of these
forced liquidations is given by Lowenstein (2000).^[20]
<#cite_note-Lowenstein_2000-20> He reports that LTCM established an
arbitrage position in the dual-listed company
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-listed_company> (or "DLC") Royal
Dutch Shell <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Dutch_Shell> in the
summer of 1997, when Royal Dutch traded at an 8%-10% premium relative to
Shell. In total $2.3 billion was invested, half of which was "long" in
Shell and the other half was "short" in Royal Dutch.^[21] <#cite_note-21>

LTCM was essentially betting that the share prices of Royal Dutch and
Shell would converge because in their belief the present value of the
future cashflows of the two securities should be similar. This might
have happened in the long run, but due to its losses on other positions,
LTCM had to unwind its position in Royal Dutch Shell. Lowenstein reports
that the premium of Royal Dutch had increased to about 22%, which
implies that LTCM incurred a large loss on this arbitrage strategy. LTCM
lost $286 million in equity pairs trading
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairs_trade> and more than half of this
loss is accounted for by the Royal Dutch Shell trade.^[22] <#cite_note-22>

The company, which had historically earned annualised compounded returns
of almost 40% up to this point, experienced a flight-to-liquidity
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight-to-liquidity>. In the first three
weeks of September, LTCM's equity tumbled from $2.3 billion at the start
of the month to just $400 million by September 25. With liabilities
still over $100 billion, this translated to an effective leverage ratio
of more than 250-to-1.^[23] <#cite_note-23>

Witter <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley_Dean_Witter>, and
Salomon Smith Barney
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salomon_Smith_Barney>—met on the 10th
floor conference room of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York>
(/pictured/) to rescue LTCM.

Long-Term Capital Management did business with nearly everyone important
on Wall Street. Indeed, much of LTCM's capital was composed of funds
from the same financial professionals with whom it traded. As LTCM
teetered, Wall Street feared that Long-Term's failure could cause a
chain reaction in numerous markets, causing catastrophic losses
throughout the financial system.

After LTCM failed to raise more money on its own, it became clear it was
running out of options. On September 23, 1998, Goldman Sachs
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs>, AIG
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_International_Group>, and
Berkshire Hathaway <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway>
offered then to buy out the fund's partners for $250 million, to inject
$3.75 billion and to operate LTCM within Goldman's own trading division.
The offer was stunningly low to LTCM's partners because at the start of
the year their firm had been worth $4.7 billion. Warren Buffett
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett> gave Meriwether less than
one hour to accept the deal; the time lapsed before a deal could be
worked out.^[24] <#cite_note-24>

Seeing no options left, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York>
organized a bailout of $3.625 billion by the major creditors to avoid a
wider collapse in the financial markets.^[25] <#cite_note-25> The
principal negotiator for LTCM was general counsel James G. Rickards
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_G._Rickards>.^[26] <#cite_note-26>
The contributions from the various institutions were as follows:^[27]
<#cite_note-27> ^[28] <#cite_note-28>

  * $300 million: Bankers Trust
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankers_Trust>, Barclays
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays>, Chase
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Manhattan_Bank>, Credit Suisse
    First Boston
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_Suisse_First_Boston>, Deutsche
    Bank <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank>, Goldman Sachs
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs>, Merrill Lynch
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrill_Lynch>, J.P.Morgan
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase>, Morgan Stanley
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley>, Salomon Smith Barney
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salomon_Smith_Barney>, UBS
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS_AG>
  * $125 million: Société Générale
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale>
  * $100 million: Paribas <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paribas>,
    Credit Agricole <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_Agricole>^[29]
    <#cite_note-eml.berkeley.edu-29>
  * Bear Stearns <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Stearns> and Lehman
    Brothers <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman_Brothers>^[29]
    <#cite_note-eml.berkeley.edu-29> declined to participate.

In return, the participating banks got a 90% share in the fund and a
promise that a supervisory board would be established. LTCM's partners
received a 10% stake, still worth about $400 million, but this money was
completely consumed by their debts. The partners once had $1.9 billion
of their own money invested in LTCM, all of which was wiped out.^[30]
<#cite_note-30>

The fear was that there would be a chain reaction as the company
liquidated its securities to cover its debt, leading to a drop in
prices, which would force other companies to liquidate their own debt
creating a vicious cycle
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuous_circle_and_vicious_circle>.

The total losses were found to be $4.6 billion. The losses in the major
investment categories were (ordered by magnitude):^[20]
<#cite_note-Lowenstein_2000-20>

  * $1.6 bn in swaps <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swap_(finance)>
  * $1.3 bn in equity volatility
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)>
  * $430 mn in Russia and other emerging markets
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_markets>
  * $371 mn in directional trades in developed countries
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_countries>
  * $286 mn in Dual-listed company
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-listed_company> pairs (such as
    VW, Shell)
  * $215 mn in yield curve <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_curve>
    arbitrage <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage>
  * $203 mn in S&P 500 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500> stocks
  * $100 mn in junk bond <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junk_bond> arbitrage
  * no substantial losses in merger
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merger> arbitrage

Long-Term Capital was audited by Price Waterhouse
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_Waterhouse> LLP. After the bailout
by the other investors, the panic abated, and the positions formerly
held by LTCM were eventually liquidated at a small profit to the
rescuers. Although termed a bailout, the transaction effectively
amounted to an orderly liquidation of the positions held by LTCM with
creditor involvement and supervision by the Federal Reserve Bank. No
public money was injected or directly at risk, and the companies
involved in providing support to LTCM were also those that stood to lose
from its failure. The creditors themselves did not lose money from being
involved in the transaction.

Some industry officials said that Federal Reserve Bank of New York
involvement in the rescue, however benign, would encourage large
financial institutions to assume more risk, in the belief that the
Federal Reserve would intervene on their behalf in the event of trouble.
Federal Reserve Bank of New York actions raised concerns among some
market observers that it could create moral hazard
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard> since even though the Fed
had not directly injected capital, its use of moral suasion to encourage
creditor involvement emphasized its interest in supporting the financial
system .^[31] <#cite_note-31>

LTCM's strategies were compared (a contrast with the market efficiency
aphorism that there are no $100 bills lying on the street, as someone
else has already picked them up) to "picking up nickels in front of a
bulldozer"^[32] <#cite_note-32> — a likely small gain balanced against a
small chance of a large loss, like the payouts from selling an
out-of-the-money naked call option.


    Aftermath[edit
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Long-Term_Capital_Management&action=edit&section=9>]

After the bailout, Long-Term Capital Management continued operations. In
the year following the bailout, it earned 10%. By early 2000, the fund
had been liquidated, and the consortium of banks that financed the
bailout had been paid back; but the collapse was devastating for many
involved. Mullins, once considered a possible successor to Alan
Greenspan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Greenspan>, saw his future
with the Fed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System>
dashed. The theories of Merton and Scholes took a public beating. In its
annual reports, Merrill Lynch observed that mathematical risk models
"may provide a greater sense of security than warranted; therefore,
reliance on these models should be limited."^[33] <#cite_note-33>

After helping unwind LTCM, Meriwether launched JWM Partners
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JWM_Partners>. Haghani, Hilibrand, Leahy,
and Rosenfeld signed up as principals of the new firm. By December 1999,
they had raised $250 million for a fund that would continue many of
LTCM's strategies—this time, using less leverage.^[34] <#cite_note-34>
With the credit crisis of 2008, JWM Partners LLC was hit with a 44% loss
from September 2007 to February 2009 in its Relative Value Opportunity
II fund. As such, JWM Hedge Fund was shut down in July 2009.^[35]
<#cite_note-35>

In 1998, the chairman of Union Bank of Switzerland
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Bank_of_Switzerland> resigned as a
result of a $780 million loss incurred from the short put option on
LTCM, which had become very significantly in the money due to its
collapse.^[1] <#cite_note-FinancialHistory-1>
