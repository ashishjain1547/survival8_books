SECTION III - ANALYSIS PROGRAM SEGMENTS
---------------------------------------

1) Here is the structure declaration of a doubly
linked list

struct dlink {
int nodeid;
struct dlink *next;
struct dlink *prev;
} dlink_t;

A pointer of the head of the linked list is maintained
as a global variable,
whose definition is
dlink_t *head;

The funtion remove_element(dlink_t *rp), needs to
remove the node pointed to
the rp and adjust the head.

The first node's prev and the last node's next are
NULL.

remove_element(dlink_t *rp)
{
rp->prev->next = rp->next;
rp->next->prev = rp->prev;
if( head == rp)
head = rp->next;

Which of the following statement is true about the
function remove_element

A) It work when head is the same as rp
B) It does not work when rp is the last element on the
list
c) It sets the head of the list correctly
D) It works in all cases

Answer :B

2) Consider the following function written in c:

#define NULL 0

char *
index(sp,c)
register char *sp,c;
{
do {
if(*sp == c)
return (sp);
} while (*sp++);
return NULL;
}

The first argument sp, is a pointer to a C string. The
second
argument, c, is a character. This function scarches
for the character
c, in the string. If it is found a pointer to that
location is returned
else NULL is returned.
This function works
a) Always
b) Always, but fails when the first byte contais the
character c
c) works when c is a non NULL character only
d) Works only when the character c is found in the
string
