enough time.
for each question the conditions and the
statements are given first study them carefully ,a
flowchart will be given with some condition boxes and
some processing box with some of them not filled we
have to fill these incomplete cells depending upon the
condition and statements given. they are simple also
the time is enough so do it with cool mind .in the set
we were given the 2nd question was a bit tough.so if u
are finding it tough do it after completing all other.

a)one of the question was depending upon the salary
we have to classify the person in class A,B,C and this
process was to be repeated for 100 employees

b) another was given the marks of 100 student we
have to find the rollno. of student who have got the
highest ,the lowest andthe average marks of student in
the class. just like the cincept of sorting.

conditions were given depending upon the condition we
have to classify the item in diffrent group if none of
the condition was satisfied it

same as the previous draw u don't get the points.
This game u have to represent in flow chart.
ii)There was another similar to this .In this u have to find out the
drawing of the balls in some particular picks.


**********************************************************************
*
overall the main thing is time managment and
presence of mind.be cool and do the paper,each section
have limited time after the alloted time we cannot
switch back neither we can move ahead to next section
if we complete a section earlier. there is no negative
marking but don't try to color all the questions
,don't spent too much time for any question ,for each
section just turn the page scan the page for the
questions u think that u can do without making much
calculation, after completing the scanning of one page
immediately switch to next page of same section,
complete the entire section like this now if u have
time switch back to previous pages do not spent more
than a minute in any question .try to perform average
in each section, don't leave any part almost
untouched,here very few people were able to do much in
number section.also there may be some upper cutoff.so
take care of it too.
**********************************************************************
*
the next section is interveiw section, technical and
personal interveiw both were combined in one.from some
of them they were asking there favourite subjects and
then were asking question from it from some of us they
asked from the project we have done .be honest and
just represent what u are, don't pretend to be this
and that take care while describing ur positive and
negative points.and last BEST OF LUCK.
