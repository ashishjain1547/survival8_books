  JUNO ONLINE SERVICES VISITED IITK ON 10TH AUG, the written test
consists of 3
sections. aptitude, c skill_set, and the last section one algorithm. i
have
listed the sections in reverse order..

  in the interview they asked some C funda, Kernighan & Ritche will 
help. also
some Communication Networks related questions for EE guys..
 

section C:

  sometimes in cryptography when using RSA algorithm, it is required to

store 'big integers'(more than alloted space for integers), suggest a

suitable method by which big integers can be stored , also device an

algorithm for adding of such numbers..

section B:

(Q) i=j=0;
       k=l=1;
       i=( j==(k=0));
      printf("%d%d%d",i,j,k);
    
      what is the 0/p ?
              Ans:  1    0     0

(Q)  x=printf("%d",x=22);
      what is the value of x ?
        Ans:  x value become 2 , because it returns the number of

character it printed.

(Q) some struct..

    *str++ -> P  (p is a pointer)
          there was some structure i didn't remined it.
    Q: it points what?
       Ans:  it points to pointer and then increments str.

(Q)int a=b=10;
     main( )
      {
      int a=15;
      a++;
      b++;
      }
   printf("%d%d",a,b);
what is the output.
Ans:   a=10
             b=11

(Q) printf("%d%f",10,10);

`      Ans: misbehaviour of output because  corresponding to %d ,10

will get print, but corres. to %f ,10 will not get print because it is

int and there may be either a garbage value or any statement.

(Q) # define  HELLO  "world";
        char *s= "HELLO" ;
        printf("%s",s)
 
          what is the output?
           Ans:  HELLO

(Q)

    main()
    { extern i=2;
      do{ 
          auto int i=4;
          printf("%d",i);
          }while(i--);

       printf("%d",i);
     }

    what will be printed?

    Ans. 444-1

  (Q)
      some function and three variables r given f1,f2,f3

      ans .. 3581321 (fibonacci sequence)

  (Q)
       given 4 functions which implements string length..

       find the correct form.. ans (b).

  (q).

       two for loops given,
 
          for(i=0;i<n;i++)

          for(i=0;i<n;++i)

        ans. both r same...


   (q)
          union
          { int a;
            float b;
          }z;

          z.a=2;
          z.b=12.0;
          printf("%d %f",z.a,z.b);

          what will be printed?

          ans.. garbage value, 12
          

  Section A:

(q).out of 52 well shuffled cards if 4 cards r taken one after the

other what is the    probability of all cards belong to the same suit.

(Q).second derivative of log(sinx)w.r.t. x

(Q).if two persons have a probability of death witjin 1 year of p,q

respectively.what is the probability that only one will be alive at the

end of the year?

(Q) max sinx(1+cosx))=?

(Q) .two lines of a ||gram r 2i+4j-5k and 2i+2j+3k then what is the

unit vector ||to the diagonal vector.

some simple problems on probabailty, simple trigonometry, on work

done(like A can do a piece of work in n days.., B.., A and B..), i'll

get the exact figures..
