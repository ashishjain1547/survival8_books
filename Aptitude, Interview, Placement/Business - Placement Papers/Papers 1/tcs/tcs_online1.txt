	 this is recent TCS talent test paper.


 this time tcs has given 8 sets (code A to codeH)of
papers,in each
set verbal part is quite different,and aptitude is
almost similar
with change of numericals.

model is
verbal--10 synonyms, 10 antonyms,1 comprehension,1
selecting
         suitable words
reasoning--- GRE verbal reasoning type 4 paragraphs
aptitude---- 34 questions of fillup the blanks

here iam sending answers for only codeD and F papers.
for others iam just
sending verbal questions.
