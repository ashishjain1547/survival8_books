                    In the paper I am sending,there r
about 40 vocabulary questions.But
                    this year's paper has only 20 of
them.Time 5 min.Marks 10.Do only
                    15 or 16 bits correctly.


                     Quantitative aptitude:I am
sending 15 questions.In the latest paper we got,
                      there r only 10 of them r
present.Time 10 min.Marks 20.Do all the
                      problems correctly.


                      Reasoning:All answers r
given.Remember them.In the exam, u willnot be
                      having time to read the
passages.So remember the answers.
                      I dont remember twohe passages
(R and Q).U can read these passages
                      in the exam and answer
them.Remember: don't answer all questions.Write
                      7 or 8 incorrect answers.Time 45
min.Total 70 questions and Marks 70.


                      Your ultimate aim is to get 75
to 85 marks.Because if u get high marks,
                      they may assune that u know the
paper beforehand and u may be disqualified.
                      So don't get morethan 90 marks.


                               WISH U ALL THE BEST.

                   &gt; &gt; Reasoning
                   &gt; &gt; ----------
                   &gt; &gt; A.
                   &gt; &gt; my father had no brothers but
his 3 sisters are all married and each has 2
                   &gt; &gt; children.my grandfather has 2
sons.
                   &gt; &gt; 1.mu father was an only child  
  F
                   &gt; &gt; 2.3 of my aunts have sons      
  C
                   &gt; &gt; 3.i have six cousins on my
mother's side   C
                   &gt; &gt; 4. i have only one uncle   F
                   &gt; &gt;
                   &gt; &gt; B.
                   &gt; &gt; Senior managers in a leading
company said that new japanese investment
                   &gt; &gt; in india was transforming the
car industry and warned that jobs were
                   &gt; &gt; under threat from japanese
competition. they stated that increasing
                   &gt; &gt; competition would be coupled
with an in evitable downturn i the car market
                   &gt; &gt; and the recent rise in interst
rates whaich had already hit demand.
                   &gt; &gt; 5.some senior managers said
that more people will want to buy new cars in
                   &gt; &gt; the future.  F
                   &gt; &gt; 6.managers told workers that
japanese workers are taking jobs away from
                   &gt; &gt; indian workers in the car
industry.  F
                   &gt; &gt; 7.the managers issued their
warning after a rise in interest rates.  T
                   &gt; &gt; 8.the increased rate of the
interest will mean that japanese firms will
                   &gt; &gt; cease to operate in this
country.  C
                   &gt; &gt;
                   &gt; &gt; C.Researchers in mumbai have
found that certain types of gallstones can be
                   &gt; &gt; dissolved by injecting them
with a gasoline additive in the form of ether
                   &gt; &gt; the ether is injected through a
tube directly into a tube directly into
                   &gt; &gt; the gallbladder.the one day
treatment works only on cholesterol-based
                   &gt; &gt; stones.not those composed
largely o calcium.however as the clolesterol
                   &gt; &gt; stones are by far the most
common typefor millions of gallstones
                   &gt; &gt; sufferers the treatment should
offer a welcome alternative tosurgery
                   &gt; &gt; the commonest option in nost
hospitals.
                   &gt; &gt; 9.injecting ether into the
gallbladder dissolves most gallstones   T
                   &gt; &gt; 10.surgery is the only
treatment for calcium stones   T
                   &gt; &gt; 11.hundreds of peoplecontains
calcium stones    C
                   &gt; &gt; 12.calcium stones will be cured
in one day  F
                   &gt; &gt;
                   &gt; &gt; D.organising the home can be
perceived as conferring power so large
                   &gt; &gt; numbers of women are unwilling
to let go of chores,even when they have
                   &gt; &gt; careers.a survey found that,out
of 65 new marriages not one single wife
                   &gt; &gt; expected her husband to share
work equally.according to the family policy
                   &gt; &gt; studies center 81% working
wives return home to do all th cooking.The
                   &gt; &gt; average male has nearly half as
much more tfree time at weekends
