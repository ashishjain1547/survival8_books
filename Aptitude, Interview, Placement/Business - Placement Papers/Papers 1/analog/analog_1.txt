Here is ADI full paper............
 
Ist part Analytical Questions (All subjective)   5 Q   45 min 
1) One number of five digit is given if we append 9 before the number
 it will become 4 times when append 9 at end . WHAT  IS NUMBER?
2) 6 MONKS  6 cannible( can eat monks if C> M any time 
any where) One boat . boat can sustain at most 3 persons. Trivial 
question....
3) Two inputs in a block are going (N1 and N2) two outputs (Max and 
min of that). If U have 4 numbers than how u use this as a building
 block to sort 4 numbers.
4) Two men B1 and B2 and two women G1 and G2 are their. One is killed
 who is victim we have to find this.....with given condition...........
Cond1) B1's  sister argues G1's husband after killing. Condn two 
sister argues twice with Victim's spouse after killing.
5) A to E five persons are their. 100 rs to be distributed some cond 
given U have to find how A will get max profit tough question carries
 8 marks...

Technical Part contains 50 marks  time 1 hour 
1st part match the following.
Questions 10 all basics topics........ 
1) static (wrt dynamic circuits)
2) Electromigration
3) Hot electron
4) Tr in Saturation
5) Latch-up
6) Seq. Ckt.
7) CLM
8) FIR filter.
9) ...
10) ...
2nd part contains 15 question all subjective drawing circuits simple 
all are from moris mano very-very easy so U have to score high..........(Objective)
1) Dynamic circuits.......with feedback   called HALF LATCH.
2) inv with PMOS and NMOS exchanged 
3) which circuit is having smallest fall delay . options 1) NAND both
 input connected 2) NOR  both input connected 3) NAND with one input
 at VDD  4) nor with one input at GND
4) question on microprocessor
6) question on DMA
7) Network simple question on charge sharing
8) Implement following statement with logic gates  if(a==b) {y=p} else{y=q}
9) One complicated ckt with two inputs and one output and VDD and 
no GND and is XNOR.
10) Current mirror simple question current is I2 = 2I1 answer.
11) NAND and NOR equivalent to the inverter with same rise and
fall time.

3rd section............... 10 question more marks ..........
1) Layout routing
2) Capacitance from layout
3) Fringing and area capacitance calculation
4) Sheet resistance is given u have to calculate total resistance.
5) Microprocessor question with 3-stage pipeline instruction. 
Easy question
6) Simple circuit with glitch in that how to remove it and draw 
the waveforms. K map has given.
7) Implemet ckt with AND/OR/INV .
Other questions were easy Best of luck to all of U. 

Interviews were based on projects and some simple digital ckts....................
Some device physics band banding and how capacitance varies with High and low frequency. 
Basics of microe or VLSI.
