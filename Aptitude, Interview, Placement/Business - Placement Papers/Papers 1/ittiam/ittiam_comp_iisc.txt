 20 tech 30 app
tech ican remember
but non tech i cant,
some question on digital also asked.


in apptitude see problems on profit loss, chainl rule,set(a - some b some,
a and b in some then a and b in none.)some question on relations some quetions
on  placing of someople at possible places,. ...


1.in around people have to take seats there are N people. so what is the probabilty of A and B sit Together.
a)1/N+1  b)2/N+1......

2.one question asked on double linked list there are three nodes T is poniting to middle one.if T  should be removed what is the code for it . some three libe code is give in opytions.

3.given a diagram there is 0-9 address line, 0-16 data line and two one line
and one line . how many address lines can be formed. 

4.one threaded binary tree is given and some node in it is given and asked to give the root of it some three codes are given i think answer is all the above i think.



 
5)int *(p)();
  what is the meaning of this statement.
 
6)what laplace transform of the function
   f(i)=1 given at range
       =0 others
7)what is the Z transformer of impulse fuction
 
8)the probability of ouccurance of A,Band C are 0.55,0.35,and0.15 then 
what is the huffman coding given to A.


9)a question on cahehit ratio. asked to give effective access time easy one
every one can solve it answer is 4.94.

 then what will be the the nature of voltage acros -|>|---, --|(--- etc
  
11)   the sum of series going from  k= 0 to infinete for the
       function 1-k/2^k.
      (actually it is given in sigma symbol. that sum of)

12)  given a 1...N nodes how many trees are there for whic there
     preorder and post order traversals are equal.

13) sequence of numbers  given asked to insert in a binary tree.
    then what is the root of it.


these are the 13 out of 20 technical questions i remembered.

Some more Questions
*********************
here r some questions i remembered from ittiam test
(the questions r not exact but may give u some idea):-
comp sci section...
          *>how many binary search trees r there for which postorder and
inorder travrsals r same?
          *>for a microprocessor, some address pins r given...u have 2
find the addressing capability?
          *>numbers 1 to 9 (not in that order) given, u have to find root
if they r inserted in a bin search tree?
          *>implementation of x-or gate using combination of or,and and
not gates?
          *>2 men sit adjacent to each other in a circular queue of n
people.how many combinations possible?ANS:2/(n-1).
          *>Z-transform of impulse function.
          *>Laplace transform of pulse.
          *>for AND gate, one input has freq F,other has 2F,what will b
o/p freq?
          *>two c prog given of fib series.ANS:same o/p
          *>a few more questions on c prog

i remember 2 passages-they were picked straight from BARRON's:
          *>allan,parker,white,black,braun etc. sitting arrangement:
3-4questions
          *>a,b,c,d,e interview combinations, c can give only 1 int, all
others 2,
            :3-4questions.
            do these from barron's, they were the same.
