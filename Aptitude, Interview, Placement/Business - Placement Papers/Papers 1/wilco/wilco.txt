 
Written Test 

The written test is of two parts:

Section A : Aptitude Test
Section B : C Test

The aptitude was a mixture of verbal, analytical and quantitative questions. It is based on a
pattern similar to the GRE tests and questions found in R.S Agarwal

The c section tests your knowlege in pointers and basic C concepts.

 


 

APTITUDE SECTION

Q1. Mr. Shah decided to walk down the escalator of a tube station. He found

Interview 
----------

 The interview is basically a technical inteview with stress on C again.  Programs can be
given on the spot such as reversal of a string implemented using data structures (like nodes)
to test your knowledge and understanding of C concepts. Also questions on DBMS, OS and
Data Structures can be asked. For further details please take a look at our Interview section.
