&gt;
&gt; For questions 6-10, read the passage and answer the
&gt; questions that
&gt; follow:
&gt;
&gt; At a time when impressive breakthroughs in
&gt; technology
&gt; are providing new
&gt; and better products and services, when improved
&gt; communications are
&gt; transforming thw world into a global village, and
&gt; when democracies are
&gt; sprouting in former communist lands, we are
&gt; simultaneously witnessing
&gt; events that makie us questioin whether so much
&gt; progress is indeed
&gt; "progress".
&gt; For example, we see reports of widespread bribery by
&gt; Italina and
&gt; Japanese government officials, exorbitant salaries
&gt; for
&gt; executives in North
&gt; America, extensive environmental pollution in
&gt; eastern
&gt; Europe, and other  instances of immoral or morally questionable
conduct
&gt; in our
&gt; organizations. In many otherwise prospeous and
&gt; afluent
&gt; cities, we see an increase
&gt; in the numbers of homeless people. Even those who
&gt; are
&gt; fortunate enough
&gt; to have a job find that work is not only not an
&gt; opportunity for growth,
&gt; but a source of anxiety and insecurity.
&gt; In the popular media as well as in academic
&gt; journals,
we see great
&gt; interest in the proposition that business and other
&gt; organizations leaders
&gt; need to become more responsible not just ot their
&gt; stock jolders but also
&gt; to other stake holders- consumers, employees,
&gt; suppliers,government, and
&gt; locla communites.
&gt; Put simply, the quality of life and perhaps the
&gt; survivial of society
&gt; depend on the moral caliber of its members. This
&gt; moral
caliber, however,
&gt; is largely determined by people in leadership
&gt; positions. The way
&gt; leaders function in their positions of influence
&gt; directly contributes to
&gt; strengthening pr weakening the moral fiber or
&gt; society.
&gt; The lives of Buddha,
&gt; Mohammed, Lao-Tzu, Gandhi and Socrates attest to
&gt; their
&gt; salutary
&gt; influence in their own way as well as for all time.
&gt; A human being functions not just through the
&gt; physical body but also
&gt; through the use of the intellect and the will. The
&gt; intellect penetrates
&gt; those deep levels of reality that are spiritual in
&gt; nature but that the
&gt; physical senses and processes cannot access. It does
&gt; this through
&gt; abstract concepts and ideas that help to make sense
&gt; of acts in the light of spiritual knowledge. It helps
&gt; us
&gt; to make moral
&gt; choices in living a spiritually guided life.
&gt; How do we describe the concept of spirituality and
&gt; its
&gt; place in that
&gt; domain? Spirituality is difficult to define in a
manner that is
&gt; universally acceptablke because religious beliefs
&gt; and
&gt; rites differ widely age to
&gt; age and from one society to another. However, if we
&gt; analyze the
&gt; spiritual experience per se and its behavioral
&gt; manifestations among
&gt; individuals of different religious backgrounds,
&gt; there
; is much accord on the
&gt; understanding and appreciation of the essence of
&gt; spirit at three levels:
&gt; cognitive, affective, and outward behavior.
&gt; At a cognitive level,spiritual experience represents
&gt; a
&gt; realization
&gt; that,a t the core of human existence, there is set
&gt; of
&gt; virtues and vices.
&gt; Virtues - prudence, justice, fortitude, and
&gt; temperance- are good habits
that enable us to stirve toward relizng our full
&gt; potential. Ideally, the
&gt; goal of human life is to live these values and
&gt; overcome the vices.
&gt; At an affective or emotional level, the spiritual
&gt; experience represents
&gt; a complete trust and dependence on such virtues. In
&gt; its most sublime,
&gt; the spiritual experience represents a complete
identification with these
&gt; values,or with an individual embodying these values,
&gt; tha aim being to
&gt; achieve some forme of enduring blissful state of
&gt; existence.
&gt; How is the spiritual experience expressed in outward
&gt; behavior? What are
&gt; the sources of the norms andd principles within the
&gt; spiritual domain?  Response to such questions generally come from
&gt; prescriptions of moral
&gt; observance of the laws. It is not a question of an
&gt; act
&gt; being legal or
&gt; illegal, but whether the act is good or evil. A
&gt; morally good act is
&gt; necessarily an expression of a spirtual act.
&gt; The ability to distinguish between morally good and
&gt; evil acts is
critical to the formation of character. Knowing
&gt; ehtical principles alone is
&gt; of little value unless we make an effort to
&gt; habitually
&gt; incorporate these
&gt; principles in our behaviour.
&gt; In the final analysis, the reward of the spiritual
&gt; experience is that
&gt; it enables each individual to grow and fully realize
&gt; the tremendous
&gt; potential unique to that person. If a good moral
&gt; character is of the
&gt; and give meaning to th; essence of every human being, thern with
much
&gt; greater
&gt; reason does it become
&gt; so of leaders who, in the words of Stanford
&gt; management
&gt; professor Harold
&gt; Leavitt, by their "vision, values, and
e ; determination,
&gt; add soul to the
&gt; organization".
&gt;
&gt; 6. The author does not consider the progress made as
&gt; 'progress' as
&gt; there is
1]widespread corruption. 2]environmental pollution.
&gt; 3]widespread poverty. 4]all of the above.
&gt;
&gt; 7. The author draws the analogy of Buddha and Gandhi
&gt; to emphasize that
&gt;
&gt; 1]organizational leaders need to be more
&gt; responsible.
&gt; 2]a society is known by its leader(s).
&gt; 3]the quality of a society is determined by the
&gt; quality of its
&gt; leader(s).
4]survival of the leader is determined by its
&gt; society.
&gt;
&gt; 8. According to the passage
&gt;
&gt; 1]academic journals advocate progress in society.
&gt; 2]there is extensive environmental pollution in
&gt; Japan.
&gt; 3]affluent cities witness the greatest number of
&gt; homeless people.
&gt; 4]breakthroughs in technology have transformed the
&gt; world into a global
&gt; village.

9. If a person follows certain values as principles,
&gt; then he is
&gt; appreciating the essence of spirit at the
&gt;
&gt; 1]cognitive level. 2]emotional level.
&gt; 3]social level. 4]both 2&amp;3.
&gt;
&gt; 10. The author is likely to agree with all of the
&gt; following except
&gt;
&gt; 1]knowledge of ethical values will lead to the full
&gt; realization fo
&gt; one's potential. 2]spiritual acceptance of values by the
individuals
&gt; of
&gt; the society will
&gt; lead to its progress.
&gt; 3]a morally good act is an expression of
&gt; spirituality.
&gt; 4]man functions through both body and mind.
&gt;

&gt; Questions 14-15 are based on the following:
The inhabitants of Kya-Kya island always answer any
&gt; question with two
&gt; sentences; one of which is true and the other is
&gt; false.
&gt;
&gt; 14. You are looking for Venkat's house and you meet
&gt; three people-
&gt; Anand, Ravi and Som. You ask them "Which is Venkat's

Anand says:Venkat's house is No.9, I am his
&gt; neighbour.
&gt; Ravi says:Anand is not my neighbour.Anand and Som
&gt; live
&gt; in the same
&gt; house.
&gt; Som says:Venkat's house is not No.9. Anand is Ravi's
&gt; neighbour.
&gt; There are only two houses and four people in
&gt; Kya-Kya.
&gt; Two people live

&gt; Questions 16-17 are based on the following:

&gt; The average life expectancy for the United States
&gt; population as a whole
&gt; is 73.9 years, but children born in Hawaii will live
&gt; an average of 77
&gt; years, and those born in Louisiana,71.7 years. If a

&gt; Louisianian's
&gt; life.
&gt; 2]The governor of Louisiana has falsely alleged that

&gt; live longer than 77
&gt; years.
&gt;
&gt; 17. Which of the following, if true, would most
&gt; significantly
&gt; strengthen the conclusion drawn in the passage?
&gt;
&gt; 1]As population density increases in Hawaii,life

expectancy figures for
&gt; the state are likely to be revised downward.
&gt; 2]Environmental factors tending to favor longevity
&gt; are
&gt; abundant in
&gt; Hawaii and less numerous in Louisiana.
&gt; 3]Over the last decade, average life expectancy has
&gt; risen at a higher
&gt; rate for Louisianians than for Hawaiians.

&gt;
&gt; Nursery "Hara Bara" plans to undertake a project of
&gt; planting 100
&gt; sunflower plants daily for the next 100
&gt; weeks.Further,15% of the remaining
&gt; plants die within 4 weeks of plantations.If a plant
survives till the end
&gt; of 4th week it becomes available for sale, and the
&gt; company sells it
&gt; iommediately at the beginning of the next week at a
&gt; fixed price of Rs.35
&gt; per plant.
&gt;
&gt; 18. Total number of plants sold by the end of 10
&gt; weeks
&gt; is
&gt;
&gt; 1]4760 2]2730 3]4550 4]2856
&gt;

&gt; is
&gt;
&gt; 1]1666.0 2]1592.5 3]1246.0 4]None of these.
&gt;
&gt; 20. Revenue generated by the nursery by the end of
&gt; 50th week is what
&gt; proportion of total revenue generated by the
&gt; project?
&gt;
&gt; 1]48.2% 2]46% 3]50% 4]53%
&gt;
&gt; 21. A pesticide available in the market reduces the
&gt; number of plants
&gt; dying within 4 weeks of plantation by 25%. If each
&gt; bottle of pesticide
&gt; costs Rs.770 and lasts for seven days and the
nursery
&gt; starts using it
&gt; only on the plants planted after the 50th week, the
&gt; net income (in
&gt; Rs.'000s) from the project (net of pesticide
&gt; expenses)
&gt; is:
&gt;
&gt; 1]1592.5 2]1725.5 3]2106.5 4]None of these.
&gt;
&gt; 22. Forty percent of the members of a singles club
are
&gt; men. Eighty
&gt; percent of he single men and 90 percent of the
&gt; single
&gt; women own
&gt; automobiles. A car is found in the parking lot. What
&gt; is the probability that hte
&gt; car belongs to a woman?

&gt; second contains a
&gt; silver coin in each drawer. But the third contains a
&gt; gold coin in one and a
&gt; silve coin in the other. A box is chosen, one of its
drawers opened and
&gt; a gold coin found. What is the probability that the
&gt; other contains a
&gt; silver coin?
&gt;
&gt; 1]1/2 2]1/3 3]1/6 4]1/4
&gt;
&gt; Questions 24-25 are based on the following:
&gt;
&gt; The fewer restricitons there are on the advertising
&gt; of
&gt; legal services,
&gt; the more lawyers there are who advertise their
&gt; services, and the
&gt; lawyers who advertise a specific service usually
&gt; charge less for that service
&gt; than lawyers who do not advertise. Therefroe, if the
&gt; state removes any
&gt; of its current restrictions, such as the ones
against
&gt; advertisements
&gt; that do not specify fee arrangements, overall
&gt; consumer
&gt; legal costs will
&gt; be lower than if the state retains its current
&gt; restrictions.
&gt;
&gt; 24. If the statements are true, which of the
&gt; following
&gt; must be true?
&gt;
&gt; 1]Some lawyers, who now advertise will charge more
&gt; for
&gt; specific
&gt; services if they do not have to specify fee
&gt; arrangements in the
&gt; advertisements.
&gt; 2]More consumers will use legal services if there
are
&gt; fewer
&gt; restrictions on the advertising of legal services.
&gt; 3]If the restriction against advertisements that do
&gt; not specify fee
&gt; arrangements is removed more lawyers will advertise
&gt; their services.
&gt; 4]If more lawyers advertise, lawyers who do not
&gt; advertise will also
&gt; charge less than they currently charge for those
&gt; services.
&gt;
&gt; 25. Which of the following. if true, would most
&gt; seriously weaken the
&gt; argument concerning overall consumer legal costs?
&gt;
&gt; 1]The state has recently removed some other
&gt; restrictions that had
&gt; limited the advertising of legal services.

3]Most lawyers who now specify fee arrangements in
&gt; their advertisements
&gt; would continue to do so even if the specifications
&gt; were not required.
&gt; 4]Most lawyers who advertise specific services do
&gt; not
&gt; lower their fee
&gt; for those services when they begin to advertise.
&gt;
&gt; 26.In a certain election only 2/5th of the voters
&gt; promised to vote for
&gt; P and the rest for Q. However on the day of
&gt; elections,
&gt; 15 voters went
&gt; back on their promise to P and voted for Q.
&gt; Similarly
&gt; 25 voters went
&gt; back on their promise to Q and voted for P, P lost
&gt; the
election by two
&gt; votes. The number of votes in the election is
&gt;
&gt; 1]90 2]110 3]130 4]None of these.
&gt;
&gt; 27. A bath has two taps and a waste pipe. One of the
&gt; taps on the
&gt; ownwould fill the bath in ten minutes, the other
&gt; would
&gt; take a quarter of an
&gt; hour, the waste pipe can empty a full bath in
&gt; exactly
&gt; seven and half
&gt; minutes. Now if we start with an empty bath with
&gt; both
&gt; taps fully on, when
&gt; (if ever) will the bath be full if the waste pipe is
&gt; left open?
&gt;

&gt; 1]15 min 2]44 min 3]22.5 min 4] 30 min
&gt;
&gt; Questions 28-30 are based on the following
&gt; From exactly seven people- R,S,T,U,X,Y and Z- a
&gt; group
&gt; of exactly four
&gt; must be selected in accordance with the following
&gt; conditions:
&gt; If R is selected, T must also be selected.
&gt; If S is selected, U must also be selected.
&gt; If X and Y are both selected, T cannot be selected.
&gt;
&gt; 28. If X and Y are both selected together, which of
&gt; the following must
&gt; also be selected?
&gt; 1]R 2]S 3]U 4]Z

&gt; 29. If S and Z are both selected, each of the
&gt; following could also be
