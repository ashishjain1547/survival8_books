25 apti+ 25 tech in 1 hour
less emphasis on tech

TECH:
1) c-question
static int a[5]={10,20,30,40,50};
int j;
for(j=0;j<=4;j++);
{
if(j<=4)
{
a[i]=a[j]*a[j];
printf("%d",a[i]);
}
}

what is the o/p
Ans) no o/p  (as semiclon is given after for loop 3rd
line of the
program).

2)bit-byte-field-record
arrange in smallest to biggest
Ans) field-bit-byte-record

3)a type similar to above question
Ans) record.

4)2-3 extremely cheap operating system and network
question.
5)2-3 extremely vague DBMS questions.
6)2-3 very very easy c++ questions.


APTI:(For apti go through rs agarwal)
1) two questions on time discount and interest and
stuff like
that.(questions from rs agarwal only)
2)two hands of watch meet every 64 min. does the watch
go slow or
fast.
3)two pipes can  fill a tank in 4&5 hrs
respectively.one can empty in
2 hrs .If the tanks are opened in order 1,2,3 .m
respectively ,when
the cistern will be empty.
options--3p.m,4p.m,5p.m,6a.m,7a.m
Ans)5p.m
4)a garrisson of 2000 men has provision for 54 days d
of 15 days a
reinforcement of men arrive and it is found that now
the provision
will last for 20 days more.Find the no. of men arrived

Ans)1900(check inrs agarwal).
5)one question from alligation and mixture(r.s
agarwal).
6) two or three questions at least had 5-7 steps given
for a
procedure ,the steps had to be arranged in alogical
oredr.There was a
simple catch in each but was easy.
e.g. to print ur name in reverse
1)print the 'i'th alphabet
2)count the no. of alphabets
3)If i=0 end
4)i--
5)goto 3
options like
a)3,2,4,5,1
b)2,1,4,5,3
c)1,4,2,3,5
d)none

-similar questions for calcuylating average,checking
greater etc.
-there was one flow chart of fibinacci series.
-loop for fibonacci.
-some simple C loops written in words to be traced
basically just
watch out for the catch.
i=j
k=(z+i)/(z+j)
l=3*i(j*3)
m=(3*(3+i)/(j*(3+j)
if i=3=j initially
a)all are same
b)one is different
c)all are different
d)none

7)Some simple computer based questions(objective)
-function of CPU
-what is ram etc.
-what is buffer.

8) some vague Data base questions (nobody understood
that)
