	 1.  A person was collecting end pieces of Cigerettes.	He was 	managed to 
	collect 49     pieces.	We need 7 such pieces to make new one.	So 	how many 
	Cigerettes he can     make?						       
	  (2 marks)

new office in another city using 3 assistants and 2	programmers of the 
present strength.  To do so, they planned    to seperate certain individuals 
who do not function well    together.  The following guide lines were 
established to	   set up the new Office.   a.	Programmers A and C are 
constantly finding fault with	     one and another and should not be sent as 
a team	     to the new office.      b.  C and E function well alone but not 
as a team, They       should be seperated.    c.  D and G have not bbeen on

rounding off	ans: exp: x+0.59.  To check the given number m is prime or 
not, it    is enough to check the division factors from 2 to ans: 
sqrt(m)____10  A 3by3 matrix is to be determined from the following logic.    
State true of False. Whether the logic works. If false	  write the necessary 
corrections    a11+a12+a13=magic-total	  loop1:  Do i=2,3

loop 2. 	printf("the matrix is magic")	      printf("t he matric is 
not a magic")	  Ans: The diagonals are not checked.	 After loop2 the 
following two statements should be added.    if(a11+a22+a33#magic-total) go to 
failure    if(a31+a22+a13# magic-total) go to failure11. A logic is given to 
determine the change given to the     customers in a shop. Tell whether the 
logic is false or true?    and tell the reason?   int change;	
i=50,25,10,5,2,1   change=change-i   if(change>=0) printf("change to be 
given"i);   else   change=change+i;   end do loop   ans:  The logic doesnot 
work for change less than 50	     as change takes -ve value and the loop is 
ended	      without giving change12.	A program is used to change Octal to 
decimal. If n is     no of digits and are entered into the program. The digits 
    are entered from minimum to maximum.    int oct;	dec=0;	  do i=1 to n  
  input=oct;	dec = (exp)    end do what is the expression to be written?  
ans:  dec = dec+(8**(i-1)*oct)13.  The logic below is bound to go into endless 
loop for some	  compilers, state the reason?	       do(x<=4.0)     
printf("%d%c",x,sin(x))     x = x+0.1	  end do     ans: X should be in 
radians,x cannot take other than -phi to phi	 therefor for x>3.14 will hang 
for some compilers.14.	The program given below is to print the radius and 
area	 of a circle.  For large values of n, the execution is found	  to 
take long time. State reasons? How do you reduce the time     of execution.    
 int r,n     do     pi=3.14159	   else     ..	  .	    .	  ans:
