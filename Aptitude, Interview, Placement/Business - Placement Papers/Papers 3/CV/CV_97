1.There are 45 questions which includes unix , c & apptitude,in 35 mts.

2.People sayvthat cut of will be around 38-40 questions.All questions
are objective type only.

There wont be any technical (about software)questions in software.

4.here are some of the questions,

1.|x-a| = a-x solve.
ans.x<=a

2.There is a six letterword UGANDA.How many ways u can arrange the letters
in the word in such a way that both A's are together.
ans.120

3.If two cards are taken one after another without replacing from a pack of
cards.what will be the probability for 2 cards to be drawn?
ans.1/13 x1/17

4.51x53x.....x59

ans.99!x25!/2 power 24x 49!x5!

5.The ratio of boys to girls is 6:4.60% of the boys and 40% of girls take
lunch in the canteen.What % of class takes lunch?
ans.52%

6.& 7. 2 simple problems from data sufficency(refer 1 or 2 test from ims)


data sufficiency:
           a) only statement a is sufficient
           b) only statement b '
           c) both are necessary
           d) both are not sufficient
  7) Anna is the tallest girl
   a) anna is taller than all boys
   b) one ther similarly appers you have to study it cartefully and the choose the right answer
8) Zulus always speak truth and hulus always speak lies.There are three persons A,B,and C. A met B and says "Iam zulu or iam hutus. We don't know what he exactly said then B meets C and says to C that A is a Zulu .Then C replies " No ,A is a hutu.
q) How many zulus are there? (ans 2)
 who must be a Zulu ? and B (check)
A father F has 5 sons p,q,r,s,t Not necessarily in this order. Two are of the same age The eldest and youngest cannot be twins. T is elder to r and younger to q and s has three older brothers 
q 1) who are twins
  2) who is the oldest and youngest
  3)who is the one having equal number of youngers and elders
8) There are 7 people who take a test among which M is worst. R is disqualified , P and S abtain same marks , T scores less than S and Q scores less than P , N scores higher than every one.
N P S T Q R M ( may be correct  it)
and some questions will come on this 

UNIX & C
	unix commands:-fork,tar,chmod,yacc,find,compress,make
	questionukku fork thaan answer ana quetion tariyathu.
	similarly hexa decimala larnthu octhal-0 etho matiratirukku
	oru quetion athukku answer 23.

C:-know about calloc,exit(),pointer and arrays,pointer to functions(5 th
chapter in K & R c book.(pointer fn. arguments thro'pointer)
some protype functions like swap,sinfunction in math.h



  NOTE: Above paper we get before our test. They given all above quetions 
and some of missing we are writing below. If any repeated skip that.

-pointer arithmatic
-what is the value of "i"?
i=Strlen("BLUE") + strlen ("purple")/strlen("red")-strlen("green")
ans:-1

i=2
printf("%ld%ld2%ld",i,i++,i--,i++);
answer check care fully may be 2223 

what is the output of the following statements(string)
printf("what is /0 the output"):
ans.what is

3) some problem appears like this 
  main()
{ 
  int i,a[10];
   int *x
   i = &a[6] - a;
 printf("%d", i)
;
} 
answers are given as 1 , 6 , not compiled , machine dependent
answer is 6;
4) 
  another program apperas like this
main()
{ 
   int *x , y=2;
   int * fun(int* );
   x = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int));
   fun(x,&y);
   printf("%d%d",x,y);
}
  
int* fun(int *a, int *b)
{ 
   *a = (*b)++;
  return;
}
 Program exactly i doesn,t know but the stress is on *a = (*b)++
  but for me answers are not tallied i think the answer now is 2,3;
 but in answers it is not given;
 5)
 another programme
  struct pt
{ int x;
  int y; }

   struct
  { pt ptr;
    int xtr}lt,*lptr=&lt;
he will give some accessing methods of data
but the correctone is
   lptr->ptr.x;
7)some problem is there which says some jumps but the correct one is 
setjump and longjump
you study the jumps and clarify it;
8) 
ne problem like this
 c prototype for math function
ans is external double sin(double);
8) one problem on variables apperars  answer is "file" dam shure
  that is actually the scope of external static variabl;
9) child procees-> fork ( this is given in c programmes)
10) for parsing another problem ans is lex and yacc;
11) for backups and archieves ans is tar;
12) onebit on redirection of std error
   ans may be $command >outfile 2>&1 check it;
13)
 what is 
  int* p(char (*s)[]);
ans there is c you read it from schaum series;
14) what for chmod 654
    rw-rw-r--  check it
15)
one small c programme that appears like this 
   main()
{ char *s = "hellow"
  char *m = " how are you";
  strcat(s,m);
  pritnf("%s",s) ;
} 
  do this and note;

16) you read stdin, stdout, stderr files and how to redirect that files.
