                   NOVEL  NETWORK PAPER
        *********************************************

The paper consists os three sections.
1. aptitude 15 questions 20 min.
2. system concepts 20 questions 20 min.
3. 'c'   15 questions 20 min.

NOTE:::::

I'm sendin the questions, somany have no answers. U do check the
answers  for all the given questions also.

All questions are MULTIPLE CHOICES ONLY.

U do try to cover the related topics to get some understanding.
In interview They are asking C C++ Operating system concepts
and Networks.
They will ask about Ur interesting subjects, U try to have good
grip on those intresting subjects.

They selected 11 out of 55 students.
 They asked about c c++ project work and OS,NETWORKS.
But they selected only 2 , one from CS and another is BTech ECE.


SECTION 1 is main factor selection to the interview


--------------------------------------------------------------
In the interveiw you should be very active .And should be frank to say 
no also.One CS student said that he don't know NETWORK and he hasn't 
taken NETWORKS subject.But he has selected.
      OK  BEST OF LUCK.


section 1::::;

*. GRE book test paper 3 section 5
question no. 8 to 12     (ships WXYZ starting on dec. 23rd..........)

    iii. both of U R telling truth??
    iV. both of U lieing??
    V. --------------


    they gave  a. b. c. d. and asking about which sequencing is sufficient to
    find the gate for liberty??
    ( I can't give exact thing)

    They have given some 3or 4 questions on this

* 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
section 3::

1.Max value of SIGNED int 
    a. b. c. d.
2.One questin is given, long one, to find the answer U should be 
femiliar
 with the operation as follows

 int *num={10,1,5,22,90};
 main()
 {
 int *p,*q;
  int i;
  p=num;
  q=num+2;
  i=*p++;
  print the value of i, and q-p, and some other operations are there.
  }
  how the values will change??
3. One pointer diff is given like this:
  int *(*p[10])(char *, char*)
  asked to find the    meaning.
4. char *a[4]={"jaya","mahe","chandra","buchi"};
   what is the value of    sizeof(a)/sizeof(char *)
   a. 4 b.bytes for char c-- d.--
( we don't know the answer)

5. void fn(int *a, int *b)
   {
    int *t;
    t=a;
    a=b;
    b=t;
    }
    main()
    {
     int a=2;
     int b=3;
     fn(&a,&b);
     print the values os a and b;
     }
     what is the output--- out put won't swap, the same values remain.

     a. error at runtime
     b. compilation error
     c.2 3
     d. 3 2
6. 
#define scanf "%s is a string"
main()
{
 printf(scanf,scanf);

 what is the output.

 ANS : %s is string is string

7. i=2+3,4>3,1;
   printf("%d"i);

   ans is 5 only.
8. char *p="abc";

    b. aabbcc123
    c. abcabc123
    d. infinate loop ( this may be correct)
9. printf("%u",-1)
what is the value?
a. -1 b. 1 c. 65336 d.  --


(maxint value-1   I think, check for the answer)

10. #define void int
    int i=300;
   void  main(void)
    {
     int i=200;
     {
      int i=100;
      print the value of i;
      }
      print the value of i
      }
      what is the output?


      may be 100 200
11.

   x=x<<2;
   printf("%d ",x);


   ANS=8;
12.
     
int a[]={0,0X4,4,9};     /*some values are given*/

int i=2;

printf("%d %d",a[i],i[a]);

 what is the value???   (may be error)

 13.
     some other program is given , I can't remember it
     U can get it afterwads,

     the answer is 3 3, so U can check this in the exam. itself.
