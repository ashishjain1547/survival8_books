dear gaurav,
sorry for being late.
here are some questions from cisco(m.tech.)
 tech.--24, apti.--20
1.on cmos power( formula- P=CV*Vf
2. lowest noise margin in which logic family--
  a)TTL b)CMOS c)biCMOS d)all have same
3.if CMOS has tr(rise time)=tf.find Wp/Wn.
  given beta(n)=2*beta(p)
4.gm of a transistor is proportional to 
  a)Ic b)Vt c)1/Vt d)none
5. if A and B are given in 2's complement find A-B
  in decimal.
6. set up time,hold time ,clock to Q delay time (very important)
7.3 questions on opamp (transfer function)(2 marks each)
8.2 questions on sequence detector (2 marks each)
9.logic function boolean expressions(true/false)
  (3 question-1 mark each)probabily all false
10.in I/O mapped how do you represent memory(1 mark)
11.the design of FSM(finite state machine) will--
   a)increase time of design
   b)increase delay
   c)increase power
   d)all of the above
12. K-map minimization
13.phase locked loop(PLL) 1 question
