		1) YOU SHOULD LEARN POINTERS(they may ask in I.W)
		2)****SHOULD LEARN C++(this is very very IMP,Based
			on this only I got job.One more thing is
			CLASS,INHERATENCI&POLYMORPHISM is sufficient)
		3)YOU SHOULD PREPARE ONE FEM PROJECT AND TELL THEM
		  THAT AS YOUR OWN WORK(This will increase chance
			to 99%)

          OK HARI 3 MORE QUES ARE THERE.I HOPE YOU CAN SOLVE EASILY.
            NOW I have only 3 C ques. I am sendins them in immediate 
            mail. Any whey I will try to send remaining 7 C ques
		before 20th.

		

	C QUESTIONS:WHAT IS THE OUT PUT FOR FOLLOWING PROGRAMMS
1)main()
{
char a[2];
*a[0]=7;
*a[1]=5;
printf("%d",&a[1]-a)
ANS:
   ans may be 1.(illegal initialization)
2)
#include<stdio.h>
main(){
char a[]="hellow";
char *b="hellow";
char c[5]="hellow";
printf("%s %s %s ",a,b,c);
printf(" ",sizeof(a),sizeof(b),sizeof(c));
}
(ans is     hellow,hellow,hellow
              6,2,5   )
3)
#include<stdio.h>
main()

float value=10.00;
printf("%g %0.2g %0.4g %f",value,value,value,value)
}
(ans is 10,10,10,10.000000)
4)
#include<stdio.h>
void function1;
int i-value=100;
main()
{
 i-value=50;
function1;
printf("i-value in the function=",i-value);
printf("i-value after the function=",i-value);
}
printf("i-value at the end of main=",i-value);
functioni()
i-value=25;


THIS IS ROUGH IDEA OF THE PROGRAM
   ANS ARE
1)i-value in the function=25;
2)i-value after the function=50;
3)i-value at the end of the main=100;

5)
  main()
{
funct(int n);
{
switch(n)
  case1:
        m=2;
  		break;
  case2:
	m=5;
		break;
  case3:
	m=7;
		break;
  default: 
	m=0;
}
THIS IS ROUGH IDEA:
    (ANS:Out put is m=0)
