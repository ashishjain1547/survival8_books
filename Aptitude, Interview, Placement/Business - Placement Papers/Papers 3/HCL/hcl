    
    Here HCL came yesterday. They are taking students in 3 streams at 
present.
    one:
        Application software
            - Open to Computer Science and Non-computer science 
students
            - Written test of 1 hour duration consisting of 4 sections
              
              
System software:
            - Open to all
            Written test of 90 minutes duration
            
    * Computer awareness section
        -Questions from Computer Science (network, windows, OLE, 
Internet, OSI)
    * C Prgramming fundamentals (c/c++/java) (Comparision of c and 
java)
    * Analysis of program code (c/c++/java) (only one question from 
java)
    * General aptitude (quantitative aptitude, analytical ability)
    
*********************************************************************
Questions from systems:
Section 1:
1. Piggy backing refers to....
2. OSI emulation layer ?
3. Parity error checking is used for.........?
4. In a 20 Mhz computer, the time taken for a 3clock cycle 
instruction is:........
ans: 120 ns (check)
5. convert 0xFFE into radix 7
6. Internet IP address is unique for..
ans: domain of the node (check)

Section 2:
1. Comparision of java and C
     The feature present in C but not in java
     (a) recursion (b)Passing variable arguments (c).... (d)...
Programs
1.
main()
{
int y = 10;
if(y++ == 10 && y++ != 10 && y++ > 11)
 printf("%d",y);
else
 printf("2y = %d",2*y);
}     
2.
void funca(p)
int *p;
{
 *p += 20;
}

void funcb(m)
int *m;
{
 int n;
 m = &n;
 *m += 10;
}

main()
{
 int var = 25;
 int *varp;
 varp = &var;
 funca(varp);
 *varp += 10;
 funcb(varp);
 printf("%d...%d",var,*varp);
}
3.
main()
{
static int *p = 100;
char *q = p;
p++;
q++;
printf("%d...%d",p,q);
}
/* don't run it. Its a Java program  */
/* find the error if any */
class A
{
 static final int var = 10;
 private :
      int obj1;
 public  :
          char obj2[]="some string";
      func()
      {
       var = 15;
       system.out.obj1;
       system.out.obj2;
      }
}
choices:
1) There is no semicolon at the end of the class
2) The variable var cann't be changed after declaration
3) Class A has not been declared as of public type
4) string can not be printed directly
ans: ?
5.
/* declare  static int i; globally
 1) the variable is available for all the functions after its 
declaration
 2) the variable is not available for other than the current program
 3) .....
 4) .....
*/

static int i;
main()
{
void fun1();
printf("%d\n",i);
fun1();
}

void fun1()
{
printf("%d\n",i);
}

Aptitude:
    GRE book, page no. 300 range, anlaytical ability question
        A causes B or C but not both....
