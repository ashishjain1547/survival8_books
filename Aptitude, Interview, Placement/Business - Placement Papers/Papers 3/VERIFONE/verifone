Verifone Interview.
****************************:-

Here, we had three single man panels. They are seeing the subjects 
taken and asking questions in that mainly. They didn't go deep into
any subject and they were just  asking overview. When they catch any
new word they are asking about it. 
      
These are some of the questions asked to us.(not to a single person.)

what is a kernel,shell.

what is binary search, traversal, hashing etc.
given a scenario what is the  suitable data structure.
write a code to count the no. of 1's in a binary rep. of a number.
memory taken for char *, int * etc.
char *cp; int *ip; cp++,ip++ - what is the result.
compare the no. of bytes in unix and Dos for long char short int.
how to make programs portable on unix and Dos under such circumstances.
in c++, what is a constructor, destructor etc. 
what is friend etc.
  


what is waterfall model, prototype model etc.

1 bit of stopping data is to be transferred. what should be done.
     options were like 
	 a) send directly
	 b) send after encoding 
		  etc.
22. There are three processes A, B, C. A sends data to B. B removes the
header stores it and sends the data to C. C returns it to B. B receives the
message, identifies the message and adds the header that was stored and 
sends to A.B receives the messages from C such that atmost 'm' messages  
B
are pending.
