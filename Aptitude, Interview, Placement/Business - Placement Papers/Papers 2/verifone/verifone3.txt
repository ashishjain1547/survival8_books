there will be 45 qstns. 15+5+5+5+5+5+5.
section: electronics:
1.a logic ckt is given and asked to identify the configuration.
ans: XOR.
2.multi vibrator with nor gates is given 
ans: astable multi sqr wave opt.
3.4 stage ripple counter with delay(f/f) 10msec. How much time it takes 
for a state to change. 4*10=40.
4.impedence of a p'lel resonant circiut at resonance:R.
5.serial to parellel conversion is done by ans:shift register.
5.if the address bus id 20bits.then the memory space is 1Mb.
6.filtering can be done with:capacitor,iductor,both,none.
7.the config that is worst effected by low CMMR
ans:Non inverting amplifier.
8.two progs are given. one satrts counting frm 0 to MAX and the other 
stars frm MAX to 0. which one executes fast.may be Max to 0.Think of.it 
should be.

another 6 qstns are there. simple.

Networks:
1.
the fctn of datalink layer is:bit stuffing.
2.which of the following is not fctn of datalink layer: Encription.
3.voltage levels of rs232x:+12,-12.
4.which of the following is not used for client/server.
RPC,TCP/IP,MESSAGEQs None ans:may be none.
5.

database:
1. which of the following is true.
ans:the primary key in DataBAse design is very important.
2. SQL is a Non procedural query langauge.
3.
4
5.
compiler/algo/ds:
1.Data structure used to impliment a menu: doubly linked circular linked 
list.
2. some regular expression is given:WaW'.may be it is context free grammar.
3.,4,5.
os:
1.the feature of real time os is: fast context swithing.
2.os impliments protection with the help of hardware(like virtual 
addressing in 386/286 etc).

C:
some small c progs are given asked to tell the function/errors etc.
one of the qstn(last in the paper) is an invalid statement.
finish of all these very fast and think about those others. they are 
simple only.


Interview:
depends on the member.(Mr.Deep if he comes asks archirect of 586/486/386/286
etc. otherwise DS,OS,C,TCP/IP . they hv taken 21(18btechs+3mtechs).
ok if u hv any queries ask immediately.
ok
all the best.
