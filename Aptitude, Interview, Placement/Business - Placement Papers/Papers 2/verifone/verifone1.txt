there will be 45 qstns.  

>>>> 15(elec) + 5(netw) + 5(os) + 5(compilers and algos)
	       + 5(database and misc.) + 5(datastructures) + 5(c progs).

Section: ELECTRONICS:

1.A logic ckt is given and asked to identify the configuration.
ANS: XOR.

2.multi vibrator with nor gates is given 
ANS: astable multi sqr wave opt.

3.4 stage ripple counter with delay(f/f) 10msec. How much time it takes 
for a state to change. 
ANS:4*10=40.

4.impedence of a parallell resonant circiut at resonance:

i)capacitor,ii)inductor,iii)both,iv)none.
ANS:both.

7.two progs are given. one satrts counting frm 0 to MAX and the other 
stars frm MAX to 0. which one executes fast.
ANS:may be Max to 0.Think of it. 

8.problem using three registers.
ANS: register A is multiplied by 11.

9.the config that is worst effected by low CMMR
ANS:Non inverting amplifier.


---- Another 6 questions are there. simple.


Networks:
--------
1.which is not used for error correction : 
ANS :bit stuffing.

2.which of the following is not fctn of datalink layer: 
ANS : Encryption.

3.voltage levels of rs232c:
ANS :+12,-12.

4.which of the following is not used for client/server.
     i)RPC,ii)TCP/IP,iii)MESSAGEQs,iv)None 
ANS: none.

5.


Database:
--------
1. which of the following is true.
ANS:the primary key in DataBAse design is very important.
2. ANS : SQL is a Non procedural query langauge.
3. ANS : Time for insertion is more than time for modification.
4  
5.

Compiler/algo/ds:
----------------
1.Data structure used to impliment a menu:
ANS :doubly linked circular linked list.
2. some regular expression is given:WaW'.
ANS : may be it is context free grammar.
3.
4.
5.




OS:
--
1.the feature of real time os is: 
ANS:fast context swithing.

2.ANS:os impliments protection with the help of hardware(like virtual 
addressing in 386/286 etc).




C programming:
-------------
some small c progs are given asked to tell the function/errors etc.
one of the qstn(last in the paper) is an invalid statement.
finish of all these very fast and think about those others. they are 
simple only.

1.int a=2,b=3,c=4;
printf("a=%d,b=%d\n",a,b,c);
ANS:2,3

2.for(i=1;i<10;++i,printf("%d",i));+-
ANS:compiling error.

3.whole logic is given in func s but they are working properly.
the main logic is :

char *string;

string=malloc(5*sizeof(char));
strcpy(string,"hello");
printf("%s",string);       /* func to print */

ANS:hello and some extra characters until uccerence of \0 .

4. in a system integer takes 3bytes and char takes 1byte .......
struct smthing{
int a;
char b[4];
};


ANS:sizeof struct smthing is 7 bytes.

5. 


Interview:
It depends on the member.
1.Mr.Deep asks archirect of 586/486/386/286 etc. otherwise DS,OS,C,TCP/IP. 
2.Mr.Abhik asks about compiler design and TCP/IP.



Suggestions in attempting :

aptitude test:
1.attempt easy questions first.

technical test :

1.Attempt C programs first.
2.Network,os,datastuctures,compilers etc.
3.Electronics and electrical.
