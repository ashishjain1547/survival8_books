<H2>	INTERVIEW QUESTION BANK</H2>

<P>
Here is a set of questions that I have with me which software guys
have asked at interviews in the past, most of them are actually from
Microsoft but a few have been pulled together from other places too.
Sadly the solutions are not listed here but you could try and discuss
them with your friends. If someone is willing to send me the solutions
(a good number, not just one) then I can add them to this page. I have
collected these from friends and would welcome any additions from you.
Mail them to <A HREF="mailto:kiran@usc.edu">kiran@usc.edu</A>

<P>
<A HREF="#appqs">Go here for some questions specific to Application
Programming</A>(VB, VBScript, HTML, ASP, ADO etc.) <BR>
<P>

<H3>Puzzles, Riddles and Others</H3>

<P>
   0. Classic: If a bear walks one mile south, turns left and walks
      one mile to the east and then turns left again and walks one mile
      north and arrives at its original position, what is the color of
      the bear.
<P>
   ANS. The color of the bear is trivial. The possible solutions to it
       are interesting. In addition to the trivial north pole and
       circle near north pole solutions, there is an additional circle
       near south pole solution. Think it out. 
<P>
*  1. Given a rectangular (cuboidal for the puritans) cake with a rectangular
      piece removed (any size or orientation), how would you cut the remainder
     of the cake into two equal halves with one straight cut of a knife?
<P>
   ANS. Join the centers of the original and the removed rectangle. It works
      for cuboids too!
  <P>
   2. There are 3 baskets. one of them have apples, one has oranges
      only and the other has mixture of apples and oranges. The labels 
      on their baskets always lie. (i.e. if the label says oranges, 
      you are sure that it doesn't have oranges only,it could be a 
      mixture) The task is to pick one basket and pick only one fruit 
      from it and then correctly label all the three baskets. 
<P>
   3. You have 8 balls. One of them is defective and weighs less than 
      others. You have a balance to measure balls against each other. 
      In 2 weighings how do you find the defective one?
<P>
   4. Why is a manhole cover round? 
<P>      
       HINT. The diagonal of a square hole is larger than the side of
       a cover!
<P>
       Alternate answers: 1. Round covers can be transported by one
       person, because they can be rolled on their edge. 2. A round
       cover doesn't need to be rotated to fit over a hole. 
<P>
   5. How many cars are there in the USA? 
<P>      
   6. You've got someone working for you for seven days and a gold bar
      to pay them. The gold bar is segmented into seven connected
      pieces. You must give them a piece of gold at the end of every
      day. If you are only allowed to make two breaks in the gold bar,
      how do you pay your worker?  
<P>
   7. One train leaves Los Angeles at 15mph heading for New York. 
      Another train leaves from New York at 20mph heading for Los
      Angeles on the same track. If a bird, flying at 25mph, leaves
      from Los Angeles at the same time as the train and flies back
      and forth between the two trains until they collide, how far 
      will the bird have traveled?  
<P>
  HINT. Think relative speed of the trains.
<P>
   8. You have two jars, 50 red marbles and 50 blue marbles. A jar will 
     be picked at random, and then a marble will be picked from the
     jar. Placing all of the marbles in the jars, how can you maximize
     the chances of a red marble being picked? What are the exact odds
     of getting a red marble using your scheme?  
<P>
  9. Imagine you are standing in front of a mirror, facing it. Raise
  your left hand. Raise your right hand. Look at your reflection. When
  you raise your left hand your reflection raises what appears to be
  his right hand. But when you tilt your head up, your reflection does
  too, and does not appear to tilt his/her head down. Why is it that
  the mirror appears to reverse left and right, but not up and down?  
<P>

  10. You have 5 jars of pills. Each pill weighs 10 gram, except for 
      contaminated pills contained in one jar, where each pill weighs
      9 gm. Given a scale, how could you tell which jar had the
      contaminated pills in just one measurement?  
<P>
     ANS. 1. Mark the jars with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
<BR>          2. Take 1 pill from jar 1, take 2 pills from jar 2, take 3
             pills from jar 3, take 4 pills from jar 4 and take 5 pills
             from jar 5.
   <BR>       3. Put all of them on the scale at once and take the measurement.
      <BR>    4. Now, subtract the measurment from 150 ( 1*10 + 2*10 + 3*10
             + 4*10 + 5*10)
         <BR> 5. The result will give you the jar number which has
             contaminated pill.
<P>
  11. If you had an infinite supply of water and a 5 quart and 3 quart
      pail, how would you measure exactly 4 quarts?  
<P>
  12. You have a bucket of jelly beans. Some are red, some are blue,
      and some green. With your eyes closed, pick out 2 of a like
      color. How many do you have to grab to be sure you have 2 of the
      same?  
<P>
   13. Which way should the key turn in a car door to unlock it? 
<P>
   14. If you could remove any of the 50 states, which state would it
       be and why? 
<P>
   15. There are four dogs/ants/people at four corners of a square
       of unit distance. At the same instant all of them start running
       with unit speed towards the person on their clockwise
       direction and will always run towards that target. How long
       does it take for them to meet and where?
<P>
   HINT. They will meet in the centre and the distance covered by them
   is independent of the path they actually take (a spiral).
<P>

<H3>Algorithms and Programming</H3>

<P>
 1. Given a rectangular (cuboidal for the puritans) cake with a rectangular
    piece removed (any size or orientation), how would you cut the remainder
    of the cake into two equal halves with one straight cut of a knife ?
<P>
 2. You're given an array containing both positive and negative integers and
    required to find the subarray with the largest sum (O(N) a la KBL).  
    Write a routine in C for the above.
<P> 
 3. Given an array of size N in which every number is between 1 and N, 
    determine if there are any duplicates in it.  You are allowed to destroy
    the array if you like. [ I ended up giving about 4 or 5 different solutions 
    for this, each supposedly better than the others ].
<P> 
 4. Write a routine to draw a circle (x ** 2 + y ** 2 = r ** 2) without making
    use of any floating point computations at all.  [ This one had me stuck for
    quite some time and I first gave a solution that did have floating point
    computations ].
<P> 
 5. Given only putchar (no sprintf, itoa, etc.) write a routine putlong that
    prints out an unsigned long in decimal.  [ I gave the obvious solution of
    taking % 10 and / 10, which gives us the decimal value in reverse order.  
    This requires an array since we need to print it out in the correct order.
    The interviewer wasn't too pleased and asked me to give a solution which
    didn't need the array ].
<P> 
 6. Give a one-line C expression to test whether a number is a power of
    2. [No loops allowed - it's a simple test.]
<P> 
 7. Given an array of characters which form a sentence of words, give an
    efficient algorithm to reverse the order of the words (not characters)
    in it.
<P> 
 8. How many points are there on the globe where by walking one mile south,
    one mile east and one mile north you reach the place where you started.
<P>
 9. Give a very good method to count the number of ones in a 32 bit number.
    (caution: looping through testing each bit is not a solution).
<P>
 10. What are the different ways to say, the value of x can be either a 0
     or a 1. Apparently the if then else solution has a jump when written
     out in assembly. 
	if (x == 0)
		y=0
	else 
		y =x    

	There is a logical, arithmetic and a datastructure soln to the above
	problem.
<P>
 11. Reverse a linked list.
<P> 
 12. Insert in a sorted list
<P> 
 13. In a X's and 0's game (i.e. TIC TAC TOE) if you write a program for
     this give a gast way to generate the moves by the computer. I mean this
     should be the fasteset way possible. The answer is that you need to store
     all possible configurations of the board and the move that is associated
     with that. Then it boils down to just accessing the right element and
     getting the corresponding move for it. Do some analysis and do some more
     optimization in storage since otherwise it becomes infeasible to get
     the required storage in a DOS machine.
<P> 
 14. I was given two lines of assembly code which found the absolute value
     of a number stored in two's complement form. I had to recognize what the
     code was doing. Pretty simple if you know some assembly and some fundaes
     on number representation.
<P>
 15. Give a fast way to multiply a number by 7. 
<P>
 16. How would go about finding out where to find a book in a library. (You 
     don't know how exactly the books are organized beforehand).
<P>
 17. Linked list manipulation.
<P> 
 18. Tradeoff between time spent in testing a product and getting into the 
     market first.
<P>
 19. What to test for given that there isn't enough time to test everything
     you want to.
<P> 
 20. First some definitions for this problem:
    a) An ASCII character is one byte long and the most significant bit
       in the byte is always '0'.
    b) A Kanji character is two bytes long. The only characteristic of a
       Kanji character is that in its first byte the most significant bit
       is '1'. 
<P>
     Now you are given an array of a characters (both ASCII and Kanji) and,
     an index into the array. The index points to the start of some character.
     Now you need to write a function to do a backspace (i.e. delete the 
     character before the given index).
<P>
 21. Delete an element from a doubly linked list.
<P>
 22. Write a function to find the depth of a binary tree.
<P>

     in a system. What would be a foolproof method of avoiding deadlocks in 
     the system.

<BR>
<BR>     recursive reverse(ptr)
<BR>       if (ptr->next == NULL)
<BR>        return ptr;  
<BR>       temp = reverse(ptr->next);
<BR>       temp->next = ptr;
<BR>       return ptr;
<BR>     end
<BR>

<P>
 76. I was a c++ code and was asked to find out the bug in that. The bug
     was that he declared an object locally in a function and tried to
     return the pointer to that object.  Since the object is local to the
     function, it no more exists after returning from the function. The
     pointer, therefore, is invalid outside.

Interesting observations and answers:

<P>
   1. Can be done in O(n) time and O(1) extra space. Scan array from
      1 to n. Remember the best subarray seen so far and the best
      subarray ending in i.
 
<P>
   2. [Is there an O(n) time solution that uses only O(1) extra
      space and does not destroy the original array?]

<P>
   3. Compute cumulative counts of integers in the auxiliary array.
      Now scan the original array, rotating cycles!
      [Can someone word this more nicely?]

<P>
   4. Can be done in O(k) time i.e. without initializing the 
      auxiliary array!

<P>
   5. If numbers are in 2's complement, an ordinary looking loop
      like for(i=total=0;i<n;total+=array[i++]); will do.
      No need to check for overflows!

<P>
   6. Write a routine to reverse a character array.
      Now call it for the given array and for each word in it.

<P>
   7. "Expected time" should ring a bell.
      To compute a random permutation, use the standard algo of
      scanning array from n downto 1, swapping i-th element with
      a uniformly random element <= i-th.
      To compute a unformly random integer between 1 and k (k < n),
      call rand_n() repeatedly until it returns a value in the
      desired range.

<P>
   8. Scan array in pairs. Remember largest-so-far and smallest-so-far.
      Compare the larger of the two strings in the current pair with
      largest-so-far to update it. And the smaller of the current pair
      with the smallest-so-far to update it.    For a total of <= 3n/2
      strcmp() calls.   That's also the lower bound.

<P>

                  node * reverse (node *) ;
<P>
   5. Given a singly linked list, find the middle of the list.
<P>
Hints and Answers
<P>
   0. If the list is circular and there are no references to the nodes
      in the list from anywhere else!
      Just copy the contents of the next node and delete the next node.
      If the list is not circular, we can delete any but the last node
      using this idea. In that case, mark the last node as dummy!
<P>
   1. (a) Start reversing the list. If you reach the head, gotcha! there
          is a loop!
<P>          But this changes the list.  So, reverse the list again.
<P>
      (b) Maintain two pointers, initially pointing to the head. Advance
          one of them one node at a time. And the other one, two nodes
          at a time. If the latter overtakes the former at any time,
          there is a loop!
<P>
          p1 = p2 = head;
<P>
          do {
<BR>               p1 = p1->next;
<BR>               p2 = p2->next->next;
<BR>          } while (p1 != p2);
<P>
   2. Start reversing the list. Do this again, printing the contents.
<P>
   3. [Yet to think about]
<P>
   4. node * reverse (node * n)
<BR>      {
<BR>         node * m ;
<BR>
<BR>         if (! (n && n -> next))
<BR>           return n ;
<BR>         
<BR>         m = reverse (n -> next) ;
<BR>         n -> next -> next = n ;
<BR>         n -> next = NULL ;
<BR>         return m ;
<BR>      }
<P>
    5. Use the single and double pointer jumping. Maintain two
       pointers, initially pointing to the head. Advance one of them
       one node at a time. And the other one, two nodes at a time. When
       the double reaches the end, the single is in the middle. This
       is not asymptotically faster but seems to take less steps than
       going through the list twice.

*  1. You, a designer want to measure disk traffic i.e. get a histogram
      showing the relative frequency of I/O/second for each disk block.
      The buffer pool has b buffers and uses LRU replacement policy.
      The disk block size and buffer pool block sizes are the same.
      You are given a routine          int lru_block_in_position (int i)
      which returns the block_id of the block in the i-th position in the
      list of blocks managed by LRU.  Assume position 0 is the hottest.
      You can repeatedly call this routine.

      How would you get the histogram you desire?
<P>
Hints and Answers
<P>
   1. Simply do       histogram [lru_block_in_position (b-1)] ++ 
      at frequent intervals...  The sampling frequency should be close
      to the disk I/O rate. It can be adjusted by remembering
      the last block seen in position b. If same, decrease frequency;
      if different, increase, with exponential decay etc.
      And of course, take care of overflows in the histogram.
