(Interview 1) p n
(===========) N
() N
(1. Asked me about my graphics Project. Be prepared with any project that u have) N
(written in ur resume as part of ur curriculam . ) N
() N
(2. Detect loops in a list . May be u might be asked to write code related to) N
(it.) N
() N
(3. He went further and asked me like, say there is a list and there is a loop) N
(starting from some where in the middle . Then i was asked to find the lenght of) N
(the handle . ) N
() N
(Interview 2) N
(===========) N
() N
(1. Asked me to explain my ME Project . ) N
() N
(2. Say there is a list of \(n-1\) integers and they are in the range 1 to n .) N
(Then find the integer missing in the list .) N
() N
(3. Say there are some students and some courses offered in a college . Then) N
(there will be many relations between the two sets . Like each student takes) N
(many courses . ) N
(    Asked me to represent the data-structure for the given prob. I was asked) N
(many Q's on the data-structure and asked me for the best possible) N
(data-structure which would be efficient for answering any kind of Querry) N
(related to the Prob.) N
() N
(4 . Asked me to write linked reversal code and the recurssive version of the) N
(prob.) N
() N
(Interview 3) N
(===========) N
() N
(1. Given 6 pencils how will u construct 4 equilateral Triangles . { Hint :) N
(Think of a three dimensional structure }) N
() N
(2 . There is an Array of structures . The structure contained Name of Employee,) N
(salary  & Employee ID . Say u are asked to sort the array then u will have to) N
(move the data in array up and down . So if u treat it as a database then lot of) N
(data movement is needed . To avoid such a kind of thing say u contruct a new) N
(array which only contains the indexes of the array of structures in sorted form) N
(. This way u don't have to move data . Like say there is an array of the) N
(follwing structures ) N
(            ) N
(            {[x,200,100],[a,100,2],[y,300,25]}) N
() N
(            And now say u are to get the contents of the database sorted by) N
(names then the new array will be {1,0,2}.) N
() N
(   Now say there are duplicate names in the database then u have to sort on the) N
(bases of Employee ID which is unique . ) N
() N
(They asked me to code for such a kind of prob . They ask for optimization at) N
(every line and every expression of the code . ) N
() N
(3. Asked me about Merge sort . And now say there is an array A of sorted ) N
(elements and another array B of sorted array of elements  and say B is of size) N
(\(A+B\) . Now write a code for filling \(A+B\) with all sorted elements of A and B) N
(.) N

(Interview 4) p n
(===========) N
() N
(1. Asked me about something about my self and why i wanted to join MS . ) N
() N
(2. Say there is a circular list of integers . Say it is sorted . say u are) N
(given a node ptr at some where in between . U don't know whcih way the list is) N
(sorted \(like the ptr going right could be the element > or < the current , but) N
(the list is sorted \). Now u have to insert a node in this kind of a circular) N
(list .) N
() N
(2. A puzzle was asked which needs to be drawn . There are 8 Airports say . say) N
(there is a flight from,) N
() N
(             1-->4  & 1-->6 \(the graph is non-directional\)) N
(             4-->7  & 4-->1 ) N
(             6-->3  & 6-->1) N
(             5-->2  & 5-->8) N
(             2-->7  & 8-->3) N
(             4-->7 ) N
() N
(     There are 4 persons L1,L2,W1 & W2 . L1 and L2 are at Airport 2 and 4) N
(respectively . W1 and W2 at 8 and 6 resp. Now L1 should be placed at 8 or 6 and) N
(L2 should be placed at the position one among 8 or 6 \(like say if L1 is) N
(positioned at 8 then L2 should be at 6 and the otherway round\) . Similarly W1) N
(should be placed at 2 or 4 . And W2 should be at the positon where W1 is not\() N
(Again like if say W1 has been placed at 2 then W2 should be at 4\). Now in how) N
(many hops of plane traversal will u do this exchange of places . It is simply) N
(like L1 & L2 exchanging positions with W1 & W2 .) N
() N
(I think have written all the Q's ) N
(===============================================================================) N
() N
(Anyone going for the interview please go through the book "How to solve it by) N
(Computer" . It is a very nice book . And also u should be prepared for writing) N
