  . Quesions are tricky. Think and answer those. Here I am writing questions
  what i remembered.

             printf("World");
             }

             what is o/p of above program ?
   2. quick sort time complexity is better than merge sort complexity in one
   case ?.  what is that case ? 

          I think this is in best case ( please check )

   3. A queastion on signal catch. Given set of signals , which are u canot

          if ( cond2)
             g()
        if cond1 is true 25 % and  cond2 is true 75 % . If above program
        executes 10000 times how many times f() and g() exectes ?.
          ans is f() is 2500 and g is around 5600 ( please check this)
  6.  sample code is given ( which is nothing but bubble sort )
       and he asked 3 questions on this with some data set .
        hint ( to get ans) :  please check if condition  properly and write

         }
         class c: public A,B
         {
           g() { f()}
           }
           
           which f() is invoked ?.

             please apply this technique there becoz he is given some otherway
             i think , but ans is B's f().
 9.one question on ARP .

          }
 class c : public A,B 
      {
       public :
          sum() { print ( "C");
          }

main()
{
  A *a;
  B *b;
  C c;
  a=&c
  a->sum;
  b=&c;
  b->sum;
  c.sum();
  
 }

 I forgot exact  description but answer is ACC
