<H1>Some Useful UNIX Commands</H1>

What follows are some excerpts from the manual pages; for complete
descriptions, use <B>man command</B>
<P>
Square brackets [ ... ] denote optional arguments to the command.

<HR>
<DL>
<DT> <B>cd </B> [ directory ]
<DD> directory becomes the new working  directory.   The  process
     must  have  execute (search) permission in directory.  If cd
     is used without arguments, it  returns  you  to  your  login
     directory.
<P>
<DT> <B>cp </B> file1 file2
<DD> cp copies the contents of  filename1  onto  filename2.   The
     mode  and  owner  of  filename2  are preserved if it already
     existed; the mode of the source file is used otherwise.   If
     filename1  is a symbolic link, or a duplicate hard link, the
     contents of the file that the link  refers  to  are  copied;
     links are not preserved.
<P>
<DT> <B>diff </B> [ options ] filename1 filename2
<DD> diff is a differential file comparator.  When run on regular
     files,  and  when  comparing  text  files that differ during
     directory comparison  (see  the  notes  below  on  comparing
     directories),  diff  tells what lines must be changed in the
     files to bring them into agreement.   Except  in  rare  circumstances,
     diff finds a smallest sufficient set of differences.  If
     neither filename1 nor filename2 is  a  directory,
     either may be given as `-', in which case the standard input
     is used.  If filename1 is a directory, a file in that directory
     whose filename is the same as the filename of filename2
     is used (and vice versa).
<P>
<DT> <B>du </B> [ -s ] [ -a ] [ filename ... ]
<DD> du gives the number of kilobytes contained in all files and,
     recursively,  directories within each specified directory or
     file filename.  If filename is  missing,  `.'  (the  current
     directory) is used.
<P>
<DT> <B>elm </B>
<DD> Elm is an interactive screen-oriented  mailer  program  that
     supersedes mail and mailx.
<P>
<DT> <B>emacs </B> [ filename ]
<DD> MicroEMACS is a tool for creating and changing documents,
     programs, and other text  files.   It is both relatively easy for
     the novice to  use,  but  also  very  powerful in the hands of an
     expert. MicroEMACS can be extensively customized for the needs of
     the individual user.
<P>
<DT> <B>finger </B> [ options ] [ name ]
<DD> By default, finger displays information about each logged-in
     user,  including his or her: login name, full name, terminal
     name (prepended with a `*' if write-permission  is  denied),
     idle  time,  login  time,  and  location  (comment  field in
     /etc/ttytab for users logged in locally, hostname for  users
     logged in remotely) if known.
<P>
<DT> <B>ftp </B> [ host ]
<DD> ftp is the user  interface  to  the  ARPANET  standard  File
     Transfer  Protocol (FTP).  ftp transfers files to and from a
     remote network site.
<P>
<DT> <B>handout </B>
<DD> Handout allows access to a handout in the category  of  your
     choice.  Handout  provides  a  menu  of current handouts and
     interactively allows viewing, copying, and printing of  handouts
     in the specified categories.
<P>
<DT> <B>lpq </B> [ -Pprinter ]
<DD> lpq displays the contents of a printer  queue.   It  reports
     the  status  of jobs specified by job#, or all jobs owned by
     the user specified by username.  lpq reports on all jobs  in
     the default printer queue when invoked with no arguments.
<P>
<DT> <B>lpr </B> [ -Pprinter ] filename
<DD> lpr creates a printer job in a spooling area for  subsequent
     printing  as  facilities become available.  Each printer job
     consists of a control file and one or more data files.   The
     data  files  are copies of (or, with -s , symbolic links to)
     each filename you specify.  The spool area is managed by the
     line printer daemon, lpd.  Jobs that specify a printer on
     a remote machine are forwarded by lpd.
<P>
<DT> <B>lprm </B> [ -Pprinter ] [ - ] [ job# ] [ username ]
<DD> lprm removes a job or jobs from a printer's spooling  queue.
     Since  the  spool  directory  is protected from users, using
     lprm is normally the only method by which a user can  remove
     a job.
<P>
<DT> <B>ls </B> [ options ] [ name ]
<DD> For each filename which is a directory, ls  lists  the  contents
     of  the directory; for each filename which is a file,
     ls repeats its name and any other information requested.  By
     default, the output is sorted alphabetically.  When no argument
     is  given,  the  current  directory  is  listed.   When
     several  arguments are given, the arguments are first sorted
     appropriately,  but  file  arguments  are  processed  before
     directories and their contents.
<P>
<DT> <B>mail </B> [ options ] [ recipient ]
<DD> mail is a comfortable,  flexible,  interactive  program  for
     composing, sending and receiving electronic messages.  While
     reading messages, mail provides you with commands to browse,
     display, save, delete, and respond to messages.  While sending
     mail, mail allows  editing  and  reviewing  of  messages
     being  composed,  and  the  inclusion  of text from files or
     other messages.
<P>
<DT> <B>man </B> [ options ] name
<DD> man displays information from the reference manuals.  It can
     display  complete  manual pages that you select by title, or
     one-line summaries selected either by keyword  (-k),  or  by
     the name of an associated file (-f).
<P>
<DT> <B>mkdir </B> directory
<DD> mkdir creates directories.  Standard entries, `.',  for  the
     directory itself, and `..' for its parent, are made automatically.
<P>
<DT> <B>more </B> file
<DD> more is a filter that displays the contents of a  text  file
     on  the  terminal,  one  screenful  at  a time.  It normally
     pauses after each screenful, and prints --More-- at the bottom
     of the screen.  more provides a two-line overlap between
     screens for continuity.  If more  is  reading  from  a  file
     rather  than  a pipe, the percentage of characters displayed
     so far is also shown.
<P>
<DT> <B>mv </B> file1 file2
<DD> mv moves files and directories around in the file system.  A
     side  effect  of  mv  is to rename a file or directory.
<P>
<DT> <B>paper </B> [ user ]
<DD> Paper displays paper usage information stored in the default
     paper  quota file /usr/adm/pquota. Each user has an entry in
     the paper quota file on the home site of the user.
<P>
<DT> <B>passwd </B>
<DD> passwd changes (or installs) a  password,  login  shell  (-s
     option),  or  full name (-f option) associated with the user
     username (your own  by  default).   chsh  is  equivalent  to
     passwd  with the -s option, and chfn is equivalent to passwd
     with the -f option.
<P>
<DT> <B>ps </B> [ options ]
<DD> ps displays information  about  processes.   Normally,  only
     those processes that are running with your effective user ID
     and are attached to a controlling terminal  (see  termio(4))
     are  shown.  Additional categories of processes can be added
     to the display using various options.  In particular, the -a
     option allows you to include processes that are not owned by
     you (that do not have your  user  ID),  and  the  -x  option
     allows  you  to include processes without control terminals.
     When you specify both -a and -x, you get processes owned  by
     anyone,  with  or without a control terminal.  The -r option
     restricts  the  list  of  processes  printed  to   "running"
     processes:  runnable processes, those in page wait, or those
     in short-term non-interruptible waits.
<P>
<DT> <B>quota </B> [ -v ] [ username ]
<DD> quota displays users'  disk  usage  and  limits.   Only  the
     super-user  may  use  the optional username argument to view
     the limits of users other than himself.
<P>
<DT> <B>rm </B> file
<DD> rm removes (directory entries for) one or more files.  If an
     entry  was  the  last link to the file, the contents of that
     file are lost.  See ln(1V) for more information about multiple
     links to files.
<P>
<DT> <B>rmdir </B> directory
<DD> rmdir removes each  named  directory.   rmdir  only  removes
     empty directories.
<P>
<DT> <B>sort </B> [ options ] filename
<DD> The sort program sorts and collates lines contained  in  the
     named files, and writes the result onto the standard output.
     If no filename argument is given, or if `-'  appears  as  an
     argument, sort accepts input from the standard input.
<P>
<DT> <B>telnet </B> [ host [ port ] ]
<DD> telnet communicates with another host using the TELNET  protocol.
     If  telnet  is invoked without arguments, it enters
     command mode, indicated by its prompt  (telnet>).   In  this
     mode, it accepts and executes the commands listed below.  If
     it is invoked with arguments, it performs  an  open  command
     (see below) with those arguments.
<P>
<DT> <B>vi </B> [ options ] [ filename ]
<DD> vi (visual) is a  display  oriented  text  editor  based  on
     ex.   ex and vi are, in fact, the same text editor; it is
     possible to get to the command mode of ex from within vi and
     vice-versa.
<P>
<DT> <B>who </B>
<DD> Used without arguments, who lists the login  name,  terminal
     name,  and  login time for each current user.  who gets this
     information from the /etc/utmp file.
