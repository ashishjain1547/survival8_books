1) There are two balls touching each other circumferencically.

The radius of the big ball is 4 times the diameter of the small

ball.The outer small ball rotates in anticlockwise direction

circumferencically over the bigger one at the rate of 16 rev/sec.

The bigger wheel also rotates anticlockwise at Nrev/sec. what is

'N' for the horizontal line from the centre of small wheel always

is horizontal.

 Q)  Strike off any digit from each number in seven rows (need not

 be at same place) and combine the same operations with 3 digit numbers

 to get the same addition. After this strike off another digit from all

 and add all the No.s to get the same 2 digit No. perform the same

 process again with 1 digit No.s. Give the ' no.s in 7 rows at

 each stage.

3) there is a safe with a 5 digit No. The 4th digit is 4 greater than

second digit, while 3rd digit is 3 less than 2nd digit. The 1st digit

is thrice the last digit. There are 3 pairs whose sum is 11. Find

the number.  Ans) 65292.

4) there are 2 guards Bal and Pal walking on the side of a wall of a

wearhouse(12m X 11m) in opposite directions. They meet at a point and

Bal says to Pal " See you again in the other side". After a few moments

   Q) Find the 5 digit No.

    Hint: 5 is used atleast once in the calculation.

6) Afly is there 1 feet below the ceiling right across a wall length

is 30m at equal distance from both the ends. There is a spider 1 feet

above floor right across the long wall eqidistant from both the ends.

travelled by the spider to catch the fly? if it takes the shortest

path.

7) Ramesh sit around a round table with some other men. He has one

rupee more than his right person and this person in turn has 1 rupee

1 rupee to his right & he in turn 2 rupees to his right and 3 rupees

to his right & so on. This process went on till a person has

'no money' to give to his right. At this time he has 4 times the

money to his right person. How many men are there along with Ramesh

and what is the money with poorest fellow.
