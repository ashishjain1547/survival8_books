SECTION I - 8 questions.
Series.

1.   Interchange of letters in a word and the adjacent letters are also to
be changed.  given letters series like [also few condotions]
  AAABBB=
  ABABAB=
LET QUESTION IS ABBAAB
        If we apply 25 on this it means we have to interchange the letters
at positions 2 and 5, and we have to change the adjacent letters 2 and 5
from A to B and B to A.  
That is   q's A B B A A B
  after Step 1 i.e interchange 2 and 5. 

  now change adjacent elements of 2 and 5...finally answer becomes
Ans:    B A A B B A
 
//Hint:  As per question papers 5 questions above like  but numbers
change.

REMAINING 3 QUESTIONS:
 6. To  get AAABBD  from BBBAAA  what ot apply:-
  a) 25   b) 34   c)25 & 34  d) none


SECTION II
1.  Given the function f(n  a  b c ) = ac if n=1
        f(n a b c) = f( n-1  a b  c) + f( 1 a  b  c) + f( n-1  b a c )
                        if n >  1
        f( 2) = ?
Ans:  f( 2 a c b ) = ab + ac + bc.

2. similar question in functions.
3. [ based on function in 1.]   f( 4 a b c )  the number of terms is...?
Ans:  f( 4 a b c ) =  f( 3 a c b ) + f( 1 a b c ) + f( 3 b a c )  etc.
           = 5ab + 5ac + 5bc.
4. f( 5 a b c ) = ?

SECTION III
Permutations and Combinations.
8 questions.

1. r = number of flags;
   n = number of poles;
   Any number of flags can be accommodated on any single pole.

  i)  r=5,n=5 The no. of ways the flags can be arranged ?
 ii) to iv) are based on this.

6.  r= 5 n = 3 . If first pole has 2 flags ,third pole has 1 flag        
   how many ways the remaining can be arranged?
7.& 8. same as above.

SECTION IV
Question consising of figures consist of 4 small squares and every square
having an arrow pointing in one Direction.

GRE test of reasoning.
hint: What is the next sequence if we tilt the figure by 90 degrees like
that( clockwise  and mirror images ? ).

SECTION V
In this section first part of compound word is given. Select meaning of
the second part from the choice given:
        1. Swan
        2. Swans
        3. Fool

  a) category  b) music   c) ---   d) none
Ans: Swansong is compound word. But song is not given as option. so 
     b) music is answer.
