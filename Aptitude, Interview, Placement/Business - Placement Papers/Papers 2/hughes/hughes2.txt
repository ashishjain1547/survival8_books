Iam really sorry for responding so late.
I wanted to sit with your work but I could not ( because of some problems )
I remember very little about the Dharma test pattern.
There was an Apptitude test. Quantitative and Analytical.
The Quantitative is very easy. You should prepare from GRE or any  CAT
Material.
The Analytical part is mostly from Barrons Guide. I remember two questions .
they are from Barron's guide. It is something about a village called "kaya-kaya
" where half the people speak truth and half lies. There was one more about set
of houses of itallian,germans,romman etc in a row whose chimmney colours were
given, their favoritr drinks were given. I hope you will find these questions
in Barron's guide. I did not get a Barron's guide to search them for you. The
interview was mostly about C , C++ . They are mostly working on C++. That will
help if you know. They are working on their own SQL. You should brush up your
fundas in DBMS. In interview there are questions in UNIX Internals also. Hope
this info is of some use to you. Good Luck. Keep me informed on the proceedings
of the campus.
