 Regarding Hughes
paper they conducted two tests. Both were technical(no aptitude test). 
First one was compulsory for everybody. In second one could opt for
electronics or computers. In all i suppose there were 50 questions.
I sent a request to my classmates to send me questions whatevery they
could recall. Till now only one person has responded. I am sending those
questions to you.

And just before interview you were supposed to fill up a performa which
they call Behavioural Test. This was to check you interpersonal skills and
socialising capabilities.  Questions like - would you like to be elected
leaders of organising committees, do you like peoply express their agonies
to you, do you wish people be close to you type questions were repeated in
one and the other form.

Interview was technical as well as personal. CGPA did count - it seems.
They selected 8 people from here. BTW what's your current CGPA and what's
the strength of your class. Do they come for B.Tech and M.Tech separatel
as the case here is or it's all at once.

Top 10 Interview Tips OF Hughes:
================================

Here are the 10 most commonly asked questions in the job interview, which will
help you prepare yourself better for the forthcoming campus placement and also
give you a competitive edge over others. 

A well thought out answer to these questions, prepared and rehearsed in
advance with the logical sequencing of the events will help you sail through.

                   1. Tell us about yourself

This is an open canvas for you giving you an opportunity to direct and lead
your interview in the direction you want. Good idea will be to structure your
answer in the following three broad heads:
Family Background
                       Educational Background (starting from schooling to
                       professional qualifications) 
                       Achievements

In all the above subheads speak only that information which will give strength
to your candidature. Avoid verbose description of yourself. 

                   2. Why do you want to join us? 

To answer this question, you must have researched the company well. Here you
can quote some of your personal beliefs, which are in conjunction with the
values of the company or talk about specific products and services which could
be your professional interest too.

In the event where your skill set is mapping with the requirement of the
company, do not miss the chance to highlight the same. Specify the initiatives
taken or work done to attain that skill set. 

3. What would you like to be doing five years from now? 

This question is asked to assess candidates career plan and ambition for
growth and to see if the company will be able to provide that opportunity over
period of time. Also to assess if your personal goals are not totally off
tangent with what companys objectives are. It is also to check your stability
with the organization. It is good idea to be very realistic in your answer. If
need be take guidance from your seniors who are already in the corporate
environment. 

                   4. Do you prefer working with others or alone? 

This question is usually asked to determine whether you are a team player.
Before answering, however, be sure you know whether the job requires you to
work alone. Then answer appropriately. 

                   5. What are your biggest accomplishments

You may like to begin your reply with: "Although I feel my biggest
achievements are still ahead of me, I am proud of my involvement withI made my
contribution as part of that team and learnt a lot in the process".  It will
be a good idea to close your answer with also specifying what attributes and
circumstances made you succeed. 

                   6. What are your favorite subjects

 It is a leading question giving direction to the panel members for possible
areas where they can probe in further for your knowledge base and in depth
understanding. It is advisable to select the topics that you are competent in.

                   7. Why should we hire you? 

Keep your answer short and to the point. You should highlight areas from your
background that relates to the need of the organization. Recap the
organizations description of the job, meeting it point by point with your
skills.

                   8. What are your hobbies? 

This question is generally asked to assess whether you are "desktop" kind of a
person or an "interaction orientated person". It also indicates your
preference for team - oriented activities or projects with solo contributions. 
It enables the organization to place you accordingly after selection. Be
candid with your answer.

                   9. What is the worst feedback you have ever got? 

To answer this question you must admit and share your areas of improvement.
Also sharing an action plan for improving oneself will indicate your ability
to take criticism well. Your answer should be reflection of your
open-mindedness.

                   10. What is the most difficult situation you have faced? 

Here you should be ready with the real life story. The question looks for
information on two fronts: How do you define difficult? and, what was your
handling of the situation? You should be able to clearly lay down the road map
for solving the problem, your ability to do task management and maintain good
interaction with your team members and other peers. It is advisable to close
with highlighting the learning out of the incident.
