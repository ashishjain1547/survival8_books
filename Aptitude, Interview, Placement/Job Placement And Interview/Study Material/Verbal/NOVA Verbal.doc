\par 312 GRE Prep Course
\par Introduction
\par The verbal section of the GRE contains two to four passages, with about eight questions among them. The
\par subject matter of a passage can be almost anything, but the most common themes are politics, history,
\par culture, and science.
\par Most people find the passages difficult because the subject matter is dry and unfamiliar. Obscure
\par subject matter is chosen so that your reading comprehension will be tested, not your knowledge of a particular
\par subject. Also the more esoteric the subject the more likely everyone taking the test will be on an even
\par playing field. However, because the material must still be accessible to laymen, you won\rquote t find any tracts on
\par subtle issues of philosophy or abstract mathematics. In fact, if you read books on current affairs and the
\par Op/Ed page of the newspaper, then the style of writing used in the GRE passages will be familiar and you
\par probably won\rquote t find the reading comprehension particularly difficult.
\par The passages use a formal, compact style. They are typically taken from articles in academic journals,
\par but they are rarely reprinted verbatim. Usually the chosen article is heavily edited until it is honed down to
\par about 300 to 600 hundred words. The formal style of the piece is retained but much of the \'93fluff\'94 is
\par removed. The editing process condenses the article to about one-third its original length. Thus, an GRE
\par passage contains about three times as much information for its length as does the original article. This is
\par why the passages are similar to the writing on the Op/Ed page of a newspaper. After all, a person writing a
\par piece for the Op/Ed page must express all his ideas in about 500 words, and he must use a formal
\par (grammatical) style to convince people that he is well educated.
\par In addition to being dry and unfamiliar, GRE passages often start in the middle of an explanation, so
\par there is no point of reference. Furthermore, the passages are untitled, so you have to hit the ground running.
\par Reading Methods
\par Reading styles are subjective\emdash there is no best method for approaching the passages. There are as many
\par \'93systems\'94 for reading the passages as there are test-prep books\emdash all \'93authoritatively\'94 promoting their
\par method, while contradicting some aspect of another. A reading technique that is natural for one person can
\par be awkward and unnatural for another person. However, it\rquote s hard to believe that many of the methods
\par advocated in certain books could help anyone. Be that as it may, I will throw in our my two-cents worth\emdash 
\par though not so dogmatically.
\par Some books recommend speed-reading the passages. This is a mistake. Speed reading is designed for
\par ordinary, nontechnical material. Because this material is filled with \'93fluff,\'94 you can skim over the
\par nonessential parts and still get the gist\emdash and often more\emdash of the passage. As mentioned before, however,
\par GRE passages are dense. Some are actual quoted articles (when the writers of the GRE find one that is
\par sufficiently compact). Most often, however, they are based on articles that have been condensed to about
\par one-third their original length. During this process no essential information is lost, just the \'93fluff\'94 is cut.
\par This is why speed reading will not work here\emdash the passages contain too much information. You should,
\par however, read somewhat faster than you normally do, but not to the point that your comprehension suffers.
\par You will have to experiment to find your optimum pace.
\par One technique that you may find helpful is to preview the passage by reading the first sentence of each
\par paragraph. Generally, the topic of a paragraph is contained in the first sentence. Reading the first sentence
\par of each paragraph will give an overview of the passage. The topic sentences act in essence as a summary of
\par the passage. Furthermore, since each passage is only three or four paragraphs long, previewing the topic
\par sentences will not use up an inordinate amount of time. (I don\rquote t use this method myself, however. I prefer
\par to see the passage as a completed whole, and to let the passage unveil its main idea to me as I become
\par absorbed in it. I find that when I try to pre-analyze the passage it tends to become disjointed, and I lose my
\par concentration. Nonetheless, as mentioned before, reading methods are subjective, so experiment\emdash this may
\par work for you.)
\par Points to Remember
\par 1. Reading styles are subjective\emdash there is no best method for approaching the passages.
\par 2. Don\rquote t speed read, or skim, the passage. Instead, read at a faster than usual pace, but not to the point
\par that your comprehension suffers.
\par 3. (Optional) Preview the first sentence of each paragraph before you read the passage.

\par The Six Questions
\par The key to performing well on the passages is not the particular reading technique you use (so long as it\rquote s not
\par speed reading). Rather the key is to become completely familiar with the question types\emdash there are only six\emdash so
\par that you can anticipate the questions that might be asked as you read the passage and answer those that are asked
\par more quickly and efficiently. As you become familiar with the six question types, you will gain an intuitive sense
\par for the places from which questions are likely to be drawn. Note, the order in which the questions are asked
\par roughly corresponds to the order in which the main issues are presented in the passage. Early questions should
\par correspond to information given early in the passage, and so on.
\par The following passage and accompanying questions illustrate the six question types. Read the passage
\par slowly to get a good understanding of the issues.
\par There are two major systems of criminal
\par procedure in the modern world\emdash the adversarial and
\par the inquisitorial. The former is associated with
\par common law tradition and the latter with civil law
\par tradition. Both systems were historically preceded 5
\par by the system of private vengeance in which the
\par victim of a crime fashioned his own remedy and
\par administered it privately, either personally or
\par through an agent. The vengeance system was a
\par system of self-help, the essence of which was 10
\par captured in the slogan \'93an eye for an eye, a tooth
\par for a tooth.\'94 The modern adversarial system is only
\par one historical step removed from the private
\par vengeance system and still retains some of its characteristic
\par features. Thus, for example, even though 15
\par the right to institute criminal action has now been
\par extended to all members of society and even though
\par the police department has taken over the pretrial
\par investigative functions on behalf of the prosecution,
\par the adversarial system still leaves the defendant to 20
\par conduct his own pretrial investigation. The trial is
\par still viewed as a duel between two adversaries,
\par refereed by a judge who, at the beginning of the
\par trial has no knowledge of the investigative background
\par of the case. In the final analysis the adver- 25
\par sarial system of criminal procedure symbolizes and
\par regularizes the punitive combat.
\par By contrast, the inquisitorial system begins
\par historically where the adversarial system stopped its
\par development. It is two historical steps removed 30
\par from the system of private vengeance. Therefore,
\par from the standpoint of legal anthropology, it is
\par historically superior to the adversarial system.
\par Under the inquisitorial system the public investigator
\par has the duty to investigate not just on behalf of 35
\par the prosecutor but also on behalf of the defendant.
\par Additionally, the public prosecutor has the duty to
\par present to the court not only evidence that may lead
\par to the conviction of the defendant but also evidence
\par that may lead to his exoneration. This system man- 40
\par dates that both parties permit full pretrial discovery
\par of the evidence in their possession. Finally, in an
\par effort to make the trial less like a duel between two
\par adversaries, the inquisitorial system mandates that
\par the judge take an active part in the conduct of the 45
\par trial, with a role that is both directive and
\par protective.
\par Fact-finding is at the heart of the inquisitorial
\par system. This system operates on the philosophical
\par premise that in a criminal case the crucial factor is 50
\par not the legal rule but the facts of the case and that
\par the goal of the entire procedure is to experimentally
\par recreate for the court the commission of the alleged
\par crime.
\par 314 GRE Prep Course
\par MAIN IDEA QUESTIONS
\par The main idea is usually stated in the last\emdash occasionally the first\emdash sentence of the first paragraph. If it\rquote s
\par not there, it will probably be the last sentence of the entire passage. Main idea questions are usually the
\par first questions asked.
\par Some common main idea questions are
\par Which one of the following best expresses the main idea of the passage?
\par The primary purpose of the passage is to . . .
\par In the passage, the author\rquote s primary concern is to discuss . . .
\par Main idea questions are rarely difficult; after all the author wants to clearly communicate her ideas to
\par you. If, however, after the first reading, you don\rquote t have a feel for the main idea, review the first and last
\par sentence of each paragraph; these will give you a quick overview of the passage.
\par Because main idea questions are relatively easy, the GRE writers try to obscure the correct answer by
\par surrounding it with close answer-choices (\'93detractors\'94) that either overstate or understate the author\rquote s main
\par point. Answer-choices that stress specifics tend to understate the main idea; choices that go beyond the
\par scope of the passage tend to overstate the main idea.
\par Note! The answer to a main idea question will summarize the author\rquote s argument, yet be neither too
\par specific nor too broad.
\par In most GRE passages the author\rquote s primary purpose is to persuade the reader to accept her opinion.
\par Occasionally, it is to describe something.
\par Example: (Refer to passage on page 313.)
\par The primary purpose of the passage is to
\par (A) explain why the inquisitorial system is the best system of criminal justice
\par (B) explain how the adversarial and the inquisitorial systems of criminal justice both evolved
\par from the system of private vengeance
\par (C) show how the adversarial and inquisitorial systems of criminal justice can both complement
\par and hinder each other\rquote s development
\par (D) show how the adversarial and inquisitorial systems of criminal justice are being combined
\par into a new and better system
\par (E) analyze two systems of criminal justice and deduce which one is better
\par The answer to a main idea question will summarize the passage without going beyond it. (A) violates these
\par criteria by overstating the scope of the passage. The comparison in the passage is between two specific
\par systems, not between all systems. (A) would be a good answer if \'93best\'94 were replaced with \'93better.\'94
\par Beware of extreme words. (B) violates the criteria by understating the scope of the passage. Although
\par the evolution of both the adversarial and the inquisitorial systems is discussed in the passage, it is done to
\par show why one is superior to the other. As to (C) and (D), both can be quickly dismissed since neither is
\par mentioned in the passage. Finally, the passage does two things: it presents two systems of criminal justice
\par and shows why one is better than the other. (E) aptly summarizes this, so it is the best answer.
\par Following is a mini-passage. These exercises are interspersed among the sections of this chapter and
\par are written to the same specifications as actual GRE passages. Because the mini-passages are short and
\par designed to test only one issue, they are more tractable than a full passage.

\par The Six Questions 315
\par Application: (Mini-passage)
\par As Xenophanes recognized as long ago as the sixth century before Christ, whether or not
\par God made man in His own image, it is certain that man makes gods in his. The gods of Greek
\par mythology first appear in the writings of Homer and Hesiod, and, from the character and actions
\par of these picturesque and, for the most part, friendly beings, we get some idea of the men who
\par made them and brought them to Greece.
\par But ritual is more fundamental than mythology, and the study of Greek ritual during recent
\par years has shown that, beneath the belief or skepticism with which the Olympians were regarded,
\par lay an older magic, with traditional rites for the promotion of fertility by the celebration of the
\par annual cycle of life and death, and the propitiation of unfriendly ghosts, gods or demons. Some
\par such survivals were doubtless widespread, and, prolonged into classical times, probably made
\par the substance of Eleusinian and Orphic mysteries. Against this dark and dangerous background
\par arose Olympic mythology on the one hand and early philosophy and science on the other.
\par In classical times the need of a creed higher than the Olympian was felt, and Aeschylus,
\par Sophocles and Plato finally evolved from the pleasant but crude polytheism the idea of a single,
\par supreme and righteous Zeus. But the decay of Olympus led to a revival of old and the invasion
\par of new magic cults among the people, while some philosophers were looking to a vision of the
\par uniformity of nature under divine and universal law.
\par From Sir William Cecil Dampier, A Shorter History of Science, \'a91957, Meridian Books.
\par The main idea of the passage is that
\par (A) Olympic mythology evolved from ancient rituals and gave rise to early philosophy
\par (B) early moves toward viewing nature as ordered by divine and universal law coincided with
\par monotheistic impulses and the disintegration of classical mythology
\par (C) early philosophy followed from classical mythology
\par (D) the practice of science, i.e., empiricism, preceded scientific theory
\par Most main idea questions are rather easy. This one is not\emdash mainly, because the passage itself is not an easy
\par read. Recall that to find the main idea of a passage, we check the last sentence of the first paragraph; if it\rquote s
\par not there, we check the closing of the passage. Reviewing the last sentence of the first paragraph, we see
\par that it hardly presents a statement, let alone the main idea. Turning to the closing line of the passage,
\par however, we find the key to this question. The passage describes a struggle for ascendancy amongst four
\par opposing philosophies: (magic and traditional rites) vs. (Olympic mythology) vs. (monotheism [Zeus]) vs.
\par (early philosophy and science). The closing lines of the passage summarize this and add that Olympic
\par mythology lost out to monotheism (Zeus), while magical cults enjoyed a revival and the germ of universal
\par law was planted. Thus the answer is (B).
\par As to the other choices, (A) is false. \'93Olympic mythology [arose] on one hand and early philosophy
\par and science on the other\'94 (closing to paragraph two); thus they initially developed in parallel. (C) is also
\par false. It makes the same type of error as (A). Finally, (D) is not mentioned in the passage.
\par 316 GRE Prep Course
\par DESCRIPTION QUESTIONS
\par Description questions, as with main idea questions, refer to a point made by the author. However, description
\par questions refer to a minor point or to incidental information, not to the author\rquote s main point.
\par Again, these questions take various forms:
\par According to the passage . . .
\par In line 37, the author mentions . . . for the purpose of . . .
\par The passage suggests that which one of the following would . . .
\par The answer to a description question must refer directly to a statement in the passage, not to
\par something implied by it. However, the correct answer will paraphrase a statement in the passage, not give
\par an exact quote. In fact, exact quotes (\'93Same language\'94 traps) are often used to bait wrong answers.
\par Caution: When answering a description question, you must find the point in the passage from which
\par the question is drawn. Don\rquote t rely on memory\emdash too many obfuscating tactics are used with these questions.
\par Not only must the correct answer refer directly to a statement in the passage, it must refer to the
\par relevant statement. The correct answer will be surrounded by wrong choices which refer directly to the
\par passage but don\rquote t address the question. These choices can be tempting because they tend to be quite close
\par to the actual answer.
\par Once you spot the sentence to which the question refers, you still must read a few sentences before
\par and after it, to put the question in context. If a question refers to line 20, the information needed to answer
\par it can occur anywhere from line 15 to 25. Even if you have spotted the answer in line 20, you should still
\par read a couple more lines to make certain you have the proper perspective.
\par Example: (Refer to passage on page 313.)
\par According to the passage, the inquisitorial system differs from the adversarial system in that
\par (A) it does not make the defendant solely responsible for gathering evidence for his case
\par (B) it does not require the police department to work on behalf of the prosecution
\par (C) it does not allow the victim the satisfaction of private vengeance
\par (D) it requires the prosecution to drop a weak case
\par (E) a defendant who is innocent would prefer to be tried under the inquisitorial system
\par This is a description question, so the information needed to answer it must be stated in the passage\emdash though
\par not in the same language as in the answer. The needed information is contained in lines 34\endash 36, which state
\par that the public prosecutor has to investigate on behalf of both society and the defendant. Thus, the defendant
\par is not solely responsible for investigating his case. Furthermore, the paragraph\rquote s opening implies that
\par this feature is not found in the adversarial system. This illustrates why you must determine the context of
\par the situation before you can safely answer the question. The answer is (A).
\par The other choices can be easily dismissed. (B) is the second best answer. Lines 17\endash 19 state that in
\par the adversarial system the police assume the work of the prosecution. Then lines 28\endash 30 state that the
\par inquisitorial system begins where the adversarial system stopped; this implies that in both systems the
\par police work for the prosecution. (C) uses a false claim ploy. The passage states that both systems are
\par removed from the system of private vengeance. (D) is probably true, but it is neither stated nor directly
\par implied by the passage. Finally, (E) uses a reference to the passage to make a true but irrelevant statement.
\par People\rquote s attitude or preference toward a system is not a part of that system.

\par Application: (Mini-passage)
\par If dynamic visual graphics, sound effects, and automatic scorekeeping are the features that
\par account for the popularity of video games, why are parents so worried? All of these features
\par seem quite innocent. But another source of concern is that the games available in arcades have,
\par almost without exception, themes of physical aggression.... There has long been the belief that
\par violent content may teach violent behavior. And yet again our society finds a new medium in
\par which to present that content, and yet again the demand is nearly insatiable. And there is
\par evidence that violent video games breed violent behavior, just as violent television shows do....
\par The effects of video violence are less simple, however, than they at first appeared. The
\par same group of researchers who found negative effects [from certain video games] have more
\par recently found that two-player aggressive video games, whether cooperative or competitive,
\par reduce the level of aggression in children\rquote s play....
\par It may be that the most harmful aspect of the violent video games is that they are solitary
\par in nature. A two-person aggressive game (video boxing, in this study) seems to provide a cathartic
\par or releasing effect for aggression, while a solitary aggressive game (such as Space Invaders)
\par may stimulate further aggression. Perhaps the effects of television in stimulating aggression will
\par also be found to stem partly from the fact that TV viewing typically involves little social
\par interaction.
\par From Patricia Marks Greenfield, Mind and Media: The Effects of Television, Video Games, and
\par Computers. \'a9 1984 by Harvard University Press.
\par According to the passage, which of the following would be likely to stimulate violent behavior
\par in a child playing a video game?
\par I. Watching the computer stage a battle between two opponents
\par II. Controlling a character in battle against a computer
\par III. Challenging another player to a battle in a non-cooperative two-person game
\par (A) II only
\par (B) III only
\par (C) I and II only
\par (D) II and III only
\par Item I, True: Stimulation would occur. This choice is qualitatively the same as passively watching
\par violence on television. Item II, True: Stimulation would also occur. This is another example of solitary
\par aggression (implied by the second sentence of the last paragraph). Item III, False: No stimulation would
\par occur. Two-player aggressive games are \'93cathartic\'94 (again the needed reference is the second sentence of
\par the last paragraph). The answer is (C).
\par Often you will be asked to define a word or phrase based on its context. For this type of question,
\par again you must look at a few lines before and after the word. Don\rquote t assume that because the word is familiar
\par you know the definition requested. Words often have more than one meaning, and the GRE often asks
\par for a peculiar or technical meaning of a common word. For example, as a noun champion means \'93the
\par winner,\'94 but as a verb champion means \'93to be an advocate for someone.\'94 You must consider the word\rquote s
\par context to get its correct meaning.
\par On the GRE the definition of a word will not use as simple a structure as was used above to define
\par champion. One common way the GRE introduces a defining word or phrase is to place it in apposition to
\par the word being defined.
\par Don\rquote t confuse \'93apposition\'94 with \'93opposition\'94: they have antithetical [exactly opposite] meanings.
\par Words or phrases in apposition are placed next to each other, and the second word or phrase defines,
\par clarifies, or gives evidence for the first word or phrase. The second word or phrase will be set off from the
\par 318 GRE Prep Course
\par first by a comma, semicolon, hyphen, or parentheses. (Note: If a comma is not followed by a linking
\par word\emdash such as and, for, yet\emdash then the following phrase is probably appositional.)
\par Example:
\par The discussions were acrimonious, frequently degenerating into name-calling contests.
\par After the comma in this sentence, there is no linking word (such as and, but, because, although, etc.).
\par Hence the phrase following the comma is in apposition to acrimonious\emdash it defines or further clarifies the
\par word. Now acrimonious means bitter, mean-spirited talk, which would aptly describe a name-calling
\par contest.
\par Application: (Mini-passage)
\par The technical phenomenon, embracing all the separate techniques, forms a whole.... It is
\par useless to look for differentiations. They do exist, but only secondarily. The common features
\par of the technical phenomenon are so sharply drawn that it is easy to discern that which is the
\par technical phenomenon and that which is not.
\par ... To analyze these common features is tricky, but it is simple to grasp them. Just as there
\par are principles common to things as different as a wireless set and an internal-combustion engine,
\par so the organization of an office and the construction of an aircraft have certain identical features.
\par This identity is the primary mark of that thoroughgoing unity which makes the technical
\par phenomenon a single essence despite the extreme diversity of its appearances.
\par As a corollary, it is impossible to analyze this or that element out of it\emdash a truth which is
\par today particularly misunderstood. The great tendency of all persons who study techniques is to
\par make distinctions. They distinguish between the different elements of technique, maintaining
\par some and discarding others. They distinguish between technique and the use to which it is put.
\par These distinctions are completely invalid and show only that he who makes them has understood
\par nothing of the technical phenomenon. Its parts are ontologically tied together; in it, use is
\par inseparable from being.
\par From Jacques Ellul, The Technological Society, \'a91964 by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.
\par The \'93technical phenomenon\'94 referred to in the opening line can best be defined as
\par (A) all of the machinery in use today
\par (B) the abstract idea of the machine
\par (C) a way of thinking in modern society
\par (D) what all machines have in common
\par (A): No, it is clear from the passage that the technical phenomenon is more abstract than that, since it is
\par described in the opening paragraph as uniting all the separate \'93techniques\'94 (not machines) and as comprising
\par the \'93features\'94 that such things as an office and an aircraft have in common. (B): No, the passage states
\par that the technical phenomenon is something that includes both techniques and their use (See closing lines of
\par the passage); it is thus broader that just the idea of machinery. (C): Yes, this seems to be the best answer; it
\par is broad enough to include both techniques and their uses and abstract enough to go beyond talking only
\par about machines. (D): No, the passage suggests that it is something that techniques have in common and
\par techniques can include airplanes or offices.

\par The Six Questions 319
\par WRITING TECHNIQUE QUESTIONS
\par All coherent writing has a superstructure or blueprint. When writing, we don\rquote t just randomly jot down our
\par thoughts; we organize our ideas and present them in a logical manner. For instance, we may present
\par evidence that builds up to a conclusion but intentionally leave the conclusion unstated, or we may present a
\par position and then contrast it with an opposing position, or we may draw an extended analogy.
\par There is an endless number of writing techniques that authors use to present their ideas, so we cannot
\par classify every method. However, some techniques are very common to the type of explanatory or
\par opinionated writing found in GRE passages.
\par A. Compare and contrast two positions.
\par This technique has a number of variations, but the most common and direct is to develop two ideas or
\par systems (comparing) and then point out why one is better than the other (contrasting).
\par Comparing
\par Contrasting
\par Idea 1
\par Idea 2

\par \bullet  According to the passage, a central distinction between a woman\rquote s presence and a man\rquote s presence
\par is:
\par \bullet  In which of the following ways does the author imply that birds and reptiles are similar?
\par Writing-technique questions are similar to main idea questions; except that they ask about how the
\par author presents his ideas, not about the ideas themselves. Generally, you will be given only two writing
\par methods to choose from, but each method will have two or more variations.
\par Example: (Refer to passage on page 313.)
\par Which one of the following best describes the organization of the passage?
\par (A) Two systems of criminal justice are compared and contrasted, and one is deemed to be
\par better than the other.
\par (B) One system of criminal justice is presented as better than another. Then evidence is
\par offered to support that claim.
\par (C) Two systems of criminal justice are analyzed, and one specific example is examined in
\par detail.
\par (D) A set of examples is furnished. Then a conclusion is drawn from them.
\par (E) The inner workings of the criminal justice system are illustrated by using two systems.
\par Clearly the author is comparing and contrasting two criminal justice systems. Indeed, the opening to
\par paragraph two makes this explicit. The author uses a mixed form of comparison and contrast. He opens
\par the passage by developing (comparing) both systems and then shifts to developing just the adversarial
\par 320 GRE Prep Course
\par system. He opens the second paragraph by contrasting the two criminal justice systems and then further
\par develops just the inquisitorial system. Finally, he closes by again contrasting the two systems and implying
\par that the inquisitorial system is superior.
\par Only two answer-choices, (A) and (B), have any real merit. They say essentially the same thing\emdash 
\par though in different order. Notice in the passage that the author does not indicate which system is better
\par until the end of paragraph one, and he does not make that certain until paragraph two. This contradicts the
\par order given by (B). Hence the answer is (A). (Note: In (A) the order is not specified and therefore is
\par harder to attack, whereas in (B) the order is definite and therefore is easier to attack. Remember that a
\par measured response is harder to attack and therefore is more likely to be the answer.)
\par B. Show cause and effect.
\par In this technique, the author typically shows how a particular cause leads to a certain result or set of results.
\par It is not uncommon for this method to introduce a sequence of causes and effects. A causes B, which
\par causes C, which causes D, and so on. Hence B is both the effect of A and the cause of C. For a discussion
\par of the fallacies associated with this technique see Causal Reasoning (page 598). The variations on this

\par Thirdly, I worry about the private automobile. It is a dirty, noisy, wasteful, and lonely means of
\par travel. It pollutes the air, ruins the safety and sociability of the street, and exercises upon the individual
\par a discipline which takes away far more freedom than it gives him. It causes an enormous amount
\par of land to be unnecessarily abstracted from nature and from plant life and to become devoid of any
\par natural function. It explodes cities, grievously impairs the whole institution of neighborliness, fragmentizes
\par and destroys communities. It has already spelled the end of our cities as real cultural and
\par social communities, and has made impossible the construction of any others in their place. Together
\par with the airplane, it has crowded out other, more civilized and more convenient means of transport,
\par leaving older people, infirm people, poor people and children in a worse situation than they were a
\par hundred years ago. It continues to lend a terrible element of fragility to our civilization, placing us in

\par (B) The benefits and demerits of the automobile are compared and contrasted.
\par (C) A topic is presented and a number of its effects are discussed.
\par (D) A set of examples is furnished to support a conclusion.
\par This passage is laden with effects. Kennan introduces the cause, the automobile, in the opening sentence
\par and from there on presents a series of effects\emdash the automobile pollutes, enslaves, and so on. Hence the
\par answer is (C). Note: (D) is the second-best choice; it is disqualified by two flaws. First, in this context,
\par \'93examples\'94 is not as precise as \'93effects.\'94 Second, the order is wrong: the conclusion, \'93I worry about the
\par private automobile\'94 is presented first and then the examples: it pollutes, it enslaves, etc.

\par \bullet  Which of the following does the author cite as evidence that the bald eagle is in danger of becoming
\par extinct?
\par EXTENSION QUESTIONS
\par Extension questions are the most common. They require you to go beyond what is stated in the passage,
\par asking you to draw an inference from the passage, to make a conclusion based on the passage, or to identify
\par one of the author\rquote s tacit assumptions.
\par You may be asked to draw a conclusion based on the ideas or facts presented:
\par It can be inferred from the passage that . . .
\par The passage suggests that . . .
\par Since extension questions require you to go beyond the passage, the correct answer must say more than
\par what is said in the passage. Beware of same language traps with these questions: the correct answer will
\par often both paraphrase and extend a statement in the passage, but it will not directly quote it.
\par Trap!
\par \'93Same Language\'94 traps: For extension questions, any answer-choice that explicitly refers to
\par or repeats a statement in the passage will probably be wrong.
\par The correct answer to an extension question will not require a quantum leap in thought, but it will add
\par significantly to the ideas presented in the passage.
\par Example: (Refer to passage on page 313.)
\par The author views the prosecution\rquote s role in the inquisitorial system as being
\par (A) an advocate for both society and the defendant
\par (B) solely responsible for starting a trial
\par (C) a protector of the legal rule
\par (D) an investigator only
\par (E) an aggressive but fair investigator
\par This is an extension question. So the answer will not be explicitly stated in the passage, but it will be
\par strongly supported by it.
\par 322 GRE Prep Course
\par The author states that the prosecutor is duty bound to present any evidence that may prove the defendant
\par innocent and that he must disclose all pretrial evidence (i.e., have no tricks up his sleeve). This is the
\par essence of fair play. So the answer is probably (E).
\par However, we should check all the choices. (A) overstates the case. Although the prosecutor must
\par disclose any evidence that might show the defendant innocent, the prosecutor is still advocating society\rquote s
\par case against the defendant\emdash it must merely be measured advocacy. This is the second-best answer. As for
\par (B), although it is implied that in both systems the right to initiate a case is extended to all people through
\par the prosecutor, it is not stated or implied that this is the only way to start a case. Finally, neither (C) nor
\par (D) is mentioned or implied in the passage. The answer, therefore, is (E).
\par Application: (Mini-passage)
\par Often, the central problem in any business is that money is needed to make money. The
\par following discusses the sale of equity, which is one response to this problem.
\par Sale of Capital Stock: a way to obtain capital through the sale of stock to individual
\par investors beyond the scope of one\rquote s immediate acquaintances. Periods of high interest rates turn
\par entrepreneurs to this equity market. This involves, of necessity, a dilution of ownership, and
\par many owners are reluctant to take this step for that reason. Whether the owner is wise in declining
\par to use outside equity financing depends upon the firm\rquote s long-range prospects. If there is an
\par opportunity for substantial expansion on a continuing basis and if other sources are inadequate,
\par the owner may decide logically to bring in other owners. Owning part of a larger business may
\par be more profitable than owning all of a smaller business.
\par Small-Business Management, 6th Ed., \'a9 1983 by South-Western Publishing Co.
\par The passage implies that an owner who chooses not to sell capital stock despite the prospect of
\par continued expansion is
\par (A) subject to increased regulation
\par (B) more conservative than is wise under the circumstances
\par (C) likely to have her ownership of the business diluted
\par (D) sacrificing security for rapid growth
\par (A): No. This is not mentioned in the passage. (B): Yes. The passage states that \'93the owner may decide
\par logically to bring in other owners\'94; in other words, the owner would be wise to sell stock in this situation.
\par (C): No. By NOT selling stock, the owner retains full ownership. (D) No. Just the opposite: the owner
\par would be sacrificing a measure of security for growth if she did sell stock.

\par The Six Questions 323
\par APPLICATION QUESTIONS
\par Application questions differ from extension questions only in degree. Extension questions ask you to apply
\par what you have learned from the passage to derive new information about the same subject, whereas
\par application questions go one step further, asking you to apply what you have learned from the passage to a
\par different or hypothetical situation.
\par The following are common application questions:
\par Which one of the following is the most likely source of the passage?
\par Which one of the following actions would be most likely to have the same effect as the
\par author\rquote s actions?
\par You may be asked to complete a thought for the author:
\par The author would most likely agree with which one of the following statements?
\par Which one of the following sentences would the author be most likely to use to complete
\par the last paragraph of the passage?
\par To answer an application question, take the author\rquote s perspective. Ask yourself: what am I arguing
\par for? what might make my argument stronger? what might make it weaker?
\par Because these questions go well beyond the passage, they tend to be the most difficult. Furthermore,
\par because application questions and extension questions require a deeper understanding of the passage,
\par skimming (or worse yet, speed-reading) the passage is ineffective. Skimming may give you the main idea
\par and structure of the passage, but it is unlikely to give you the subtleties of the author\rquote s attitude.
\par Example: (Refer to passage on page 313.)
\par Based on the information in the passage, it can be inferred that which one of the following
\par would most logically begin a paragraph immediately following the passage?
\par (A) Because of the inquisitorial system\rquote s thoroughness in conducting its pretrial investigation,
\par it can be concluded that a defendant who is innocent would prefer to be tried under the
\par inquisitorial system, whereas a defendant who is guilty would prefer to be tried under the
\par adversarial system.
\par (B) As the preceding analysis shows, the legal system is in a constant state of flux. For now
\par the inquisitorial system is ascendant, but it will probably be soon replaced by another
\par system.
\par (C) The accusatorial system begins where the inquisitorial system ends. So it is three steps
\par removed from the system of private vengeance, and therefore historically superior to it.
\par (D) Because in the inquisitorial system the judge must take an active role in the conduct of
\par the trial, his competency and expertise have become critical.
\par (E) The criminal justice system has evolved to the point that it no longer seems to be derivative
\par of the system of private vengeance. Modern systems of criminal justice empower all
\par of society with the right to instigate a legal action, and the need for vengeance is satisfied
\par through a surrogate\emdash the public prosecutor.
\par The author has rather thoroughly presented his position, so the next paragraph would be a natural place for
\par him to summarize it. The passage compares and contrasts two systems of criminal justice, implying that
\par the inquisitorial system is superior. We expect the concluding paragraph to sum up this position. Now all
\par legal theory aside, the system of justice under which an innocent person would choose to be judged would,
\par as a practical matter, pretty much sum up the situation. Hence the answer is (A).

\par The idea of stuff expresses no more than the experience of coming to a limit at which our

\par Something of the same kind happens when the scientist investigates any unit or pattern so
\par distinct to the naked eye that it has been considered a separate entity. He finds that the more
\par carefully he observes and describes it, the more he is also describing the environment in which it
\par moves and other patterns to which it seems inseparably related. As Teilhard de Chardin has so
\par well expressed it, the isolation of individual, atomic patterns \'93is merely an intellectual dodge.\'94
\par ...Although the ancient cultures of Asia never attained the rigorously exact physical

\par is foreign to them even in so basic a form as the separation of the spiritual and the material....
\par Buddhism ... is not a culture but a critique of culture, an enduring nonviolent revolution,
\par or \'93loyal opposition,\'94 to the culture with which it is involved. This gives these ways of liberation
\par something in common with psychotherapy beyond the interest in changing states of consciousness.
\par For the task of the psychotherapist is to bring about a reconciliation between individual

\par What does the passage suggest about the theme of the book from which it is excerpted?
\par (A) The book attempts to understand psychotherapy in the context of different and changing
\par systems of thought.
\par (B) The book argues that psychotherapy unites elements of an exact science with elements of
\par eastern philosophy.
\par (C) The book describes the origins of psychotherapy around the world.
\par (D) The book compares psychotherapy in the West and in the East.
\par (A): Yes, this is the most accurate inference from the passage. The passage discusses how the more

\par moves, and the passage traces similarities between psychotherapy and Eastern systems of (evolving)
\par thought. (B): No, this is too narrow an interpretation of what the whole book would be doing. (C): No,

\par The Six Questions 325
\par TONE QUESTIONS
\par Tone questions ask you to identify the writer\rquote s attitude or perspective. Is the writer\rquote s feeling toward the
\par subject positive, negative, or neutral? Does the writer give his own opinion, or does he objectively present
\par the opinions of others?
\par Strategy
\par Before you read the answer-choices, decide whether the writer\rquote s tone is positive, negative,
\par or neutral. It is best to do this without referring to the passage.
\par However, if you did not get a feel for the writer\rquote s attitude on the first reading, check the adjectives
\par that he chooses. Adjectives and, to a lesser extent, adverbs express our feelings toward subjects. For
\par instance, if we agree with a person who holds strong feelings about a subject, we may describe his opinions
\par as impassioned. On the other hand, if we disagree with him, we may describe his opinions as excitable,
\par which has the same meaning as \'93impassioned\'94 but carries a negative connotation.
\par Example: (Refer to passage on page 313.)
\par The author\rquote s attitude toward the adversarial system can best be described as
\par (A) encouraged that it is far removed from the system of private vengeance
\par (B) concerned that it does not allow all members of society to instigate legal action
\par (C) pleased that it does not require the defendant to conduct his own pretrial investigation
\par (D) hopeful that it will be replaced by the inquisitorial system
\par (E) doubtful that it is the best vehicle for justice
\par The author does not reveal his feelings toward the adversarial system until the end of paragraph one.
\par Clearly the clause \'93the adversarial system of criminal procedure symbolizes and regularizes the punitive
\par combat\'94 indicates that he has a negative attitude toward the system. This is confirmed in the second paragraph
\par when he states that the inquisitorial system is historically superior to the adversarial system. So he
\par feels that the adversarial system is deficient.
\par The \'93two-out-of-five\'94 rule is at work here: only choices (D) and (E) have any real merit. Both are
\par good answers. But which one is better? Intuitively, choice (E) is more likely to be the answer because it is
\par more measured. To decide between two choices attack each: the one that survives is the answer. Now a
\par tone question should be answered from what is directly stated in the passage\emdash not from what it implies.
\par Although the author has reservations toward the adversarial system, at no point does he say that he hopes
\par the inquisitorial system will replace it, he may prefer a third system over both. This eliminates (D); the
\par answer therefore is (E).
\par The remaining choices are not supported by the passage. (A), using the same language as in the
\par passage, overstates the author\rquote s feeling. In lines 12\endash 14, he states that the adversarial system is only one
\par step removed from the private vengeance system\emdash not far removed. Remember: Be wary of extreme
\par words. (A) would be a better choice if \'93far\'94 were dropped. (B) makes a false claim. In lines 15\endash 17, the
\par author states that the adversarial system does extend the right to initiate legal action to all members of
\par society. Finally, (C) also makes a false claim. In lines 20\endash 21, the author states that the defendant in the
\par adversarial system is still left to conduct his own pretrial investigation.

\par Application: (Mini-passage)
\par An elm in our backyard caught the blight this summer and dropped stone dead, leafless,
\par almost overnight. One weekend it was a normal-looking elm, maybe a little bare in spots but
\par nothing alarming, and the next weekend it was gone, passed over, departed, taken....
\par The dying of a field mouse, at the jaws of an amiable household cat, is a spectacle I have
\par beheld many times. It used to make me wince.... Nature, I thought, was an abomination.
\par Recently I\rquote ve done some thinking about that mouse, and I wonder if his dying is necessarily
\par all that different from the passing of our elm. The main difference, if there is one, would be
\par in the matter of pain. I do not believe that an elm tree has pain receptors, and even so, the blight
\par seems to me a relatively painless way to go. But the mouse dangling tail-down from the teeth of
\par a gray cat is something else again, with pain beyond bearing, you\rquote d think, all over his small
\par body. There are now some plausible reasons for thinking it is not like that at all.... At the
\par instant of being trapped and penetrated by teeth, peptide hormones are released by cells in the
\par hypothalamus and the pituitary gland; instantly these substances, called endorphins, are attached
\par to the surfaces of other cells responsible for pain perception; the hormones have the pharmacologic
\par properties of opium; there is no pain. Thus it is that the mouse seems always to dangle so
\par languidly from the jaws, lies there so quietly when dropped, dies of his injuries without a struggle.
\par If a mouse could shrug, he\rquote d shrug....
\par Pain is useful for avoidance, for getting away when there\rquote s time to get away, but when it is
\par end game, and no way back, pain is likely to be turned off, and the mechanisms for this are
\par wonderfully precise and quick. If I had to design an ecosystem in which creatures had to live
\par off each other and in which dying was an indispensable part of living, I could not think of a
\par better way to manage.
\par From Lewis Thomas, On Natural Death, \'a9 1979 by Lewis Thomas.
\par Which one of the following would best characterize the author\rquote s attitude toward the relationship
\par between pain and death?
\par (A) Dismay at the inherent cruelty of nature
\par (B) Amusement at the irony of the relationship between pain and death
\par (C) Admiration for the ways in which animal life functions in the ecosystem
\par (D) A desire to conduct experiments on animals in order to discover more about the relationship
\par between pain and death
\par The author\rquote s attitude toward the relationship between pain and death evolves through three stages. First, he
\par expresses revulsion at the relationship. This is indicated in the second paragraph by the words \'93wince\'94 and
\par \'93abomination.\'94 Then in the third paragraph, he adopts a more analytical attitude and questions his
\par previous judgment. This is indicated by the clause, \'93I wonder if his dying is necessarily all that different
\par from the passing of our elm.\'94 And in closing the paragraph, he seems resigned to the fact the relationship
\par is not all that bad. This is indicated by the sentence, \'93If a mouse could shrug, he\rquote d shrug.\'94 Finally, in the
\par last paragraph, he comes to express admiration for the relationship between pain and death. This is indicated
\par by the phrase \'93wonderfully precise and quick,\'94 and it is made definite by the closing line, \'93If I had to
\par design an ecosystem . . . in which dying was an indispensable part of living, I could not think of a better
\par way to manage.\'94 Thus, the answer is (C).
\par The other choices are easily ruled out. Choice (A) is perhaps superficially tempting. In the second
\par paragraph the author does express dismay at the ways of nature, but notice that his concerns are in the past
\par tense. He is now more understanding, wiser of the ways of nature. As to (B), the author is subtly reverential,
\par never ironical, toward nature. Finally, (D) is not mentioned or alluded to in the passage.
\par Beware of answer-choices that contain extreme emotions. Remember the passages are taken from
\par academic journals. In the rarefied air of academic circles, strong emotions are considered inappropriate and
\par sophomoric. The writers want to display opinions that are considered and reasonable, not spontaneous and
\par TeamLRN
\par The Six Questions 327
\par off-the-wall. So if an author\rquote s tone is negative, it may be disapproving\emdash not snide. Or if her tone is positive,
\par it may be approving\emdash not ecstatic.
\par Furthermore, the answers must be indisputable. If the answers were subjective, then the writers of the
\par GRE would be deluged with letters from angry test takers, complaining that their test-scores are unfair. To
\par avoid such a difficult position, the writers of the GRE never allow the correct answer to be either controversial
\par or grammatically questionable.
\par Let\rquote s use these theories to answer the following questions.
\par Example:
\par Which one of the following most accurately characterizes the author\rquote s attitude with respect to
\par Phillis Wheatley\rquote s literary accomplishments?
\par (A) enthusiastic advocacy
\par (B) qualified admiration
\par (C) dispassionate impartiality
\par (D) detached ambivalence
\par (E) perfunctory dismissal
\par Even without reference to the passage, this is not a difficult question to answer.
\par Scholars may advocate each other\rquote s work, but they are unlikely to be enthusiastic advocates.
\par Furthermore, the context stretches the meaning of advocacy\emdash to defend someone else\rquote s cause or plight. So
\par (A) is unlikely to be the answer.
\par (B) is the measured response and therefore is probably the answer.
\par \'93Dispassionate impartiality\'94 is a rather odd construction; additionally, it is redundant. It could never
\par be the answer to a GRE question. This eliminates (C).
\par \'93Detached ambivalence\'94 is not as odd as \'93dispassionate impartiality,\'94 but it is unusual. So (D) is
\par unlikely to be the answer.
\par Remember, scholars want their audience to consider their opinions well thought out, not off-the-wall.
\par But perfunctory means \'93hasty and superficial.\'94 So (E) could not be the answer.
\par Hence, even without the passage we can still find the answer, (B).
\par Example:
\par Which one of the following best describes the author\rquote s attitude toward scientific techniques?
\par (A) critical
\par (B) hostile
\par (C) idealistic
\par (D) ironic
\par (E) neutral
\par (A) is one of two measured responses offered. Now a scholar may be critical of a particular scientific
\par technique, but only a crackpot would be critical of all scientific techniques\emdash eliminate (A).
\par \'93Hostile\'94 is far too negative. Scholars consider such emotions juvenile\emdash eliminate (B).
\par \'93Idealistic,\'94 on the other hand, is too positive; it sounds pollyannaish\emdash eliminate (C).
\par \'93Ironic\'94 seems illogical in this context. It\rquote s hard to conceive of a person having an ironic attitude
\par toward scientific techniques\emdash eliminate (D).
\par (E) is the other measured response, and by elimination it is the answer.

\par Points to Remember
\par 1. The order of the passage questions roughly corresponds to the order in which the issues are presented
\par in the passage.
\par 2. The six questions are
\par Main Idea
\par Description
\par Writing Technique
\par Extension
\par Application
\par Tone
\par 3. The main idea of a passage is usually stated in the last, sometimes the first, sentence of the first
\par paragraph. If it\rquote s not there, it will probably be the last sentence of the entire passage.
\par 4. If after the first reading, you don\rquote t have a feel for the main idea, review the first and last sentence of
\par each paragraph.
\par 5. The answer to a description question must refer directly to a statement in the passage, not to
\par something implied by it. However, the correct answer will paraphrase a passage statement, not quote
\par it exactly. In fact, exact quotes are used with these questions to bait wrong answers.
\par 6. When answering a description question, you must find the point in the passage from which the
\par question is drawn.
\par 7. If a description question refers to line 20, the information needed to answer it can occur anywhere
\par from line 15 to 25.
\par 8. Some writing techniques commonly used in the GRE passages are
\par A. Compare and contrast two positions.
\par B. Show cause and effect.
\par C. State a position; then give supporting evidence.
\par 9. For extension questions, any answer-choice that refers explicitly to or repeats a statement in the
\par passage will probably be wrong.
\par 10. Application questions differ from extension questions only in degree. Extension questions ask you to
\par apply what you have learned from the passage to derive new information about the same subject,
\par whereas application questions go one step further, asking you to apply what you have learned from
\par the passage to a different or hypothetical situation.
\par 11. To answer an application question, take the perspective of the author. Ask yourself: what am I
\par arguing for? what might make my argument stronger? what might make it weaker?
\par 12. Because application questions go well beyond the passage, they tend to be the most difficult.
\par 13. For tone questions, decide whether the writer\rquote s tone is positive, negative, or neutral before you look at
\par the answer-choices.
\par 14. If you do not have a feel for the writer\rquote s attitude after the first reading, check the adjectives that she
\par chooses.

\par From Romania to Germany, from Tallinn to

\par fact, we thought that the march from a planned economy
\par to a market economy would take place within 25
\par the framework of the bureaucratic system, and that
\par the market within the Communist state would
\par explode the totalitarian structures. Only then would
\par the time come to build the institutions of a civil society;
\par and only at the end, with the completion of the 30
\par market economy and the civil society, would the time
\par of great political transformations finally arrive.
\par The opposite happened. First came the big political
\par change, the great shock, which either broke the

\par The Six Questions 331
\par 1. The author originally thought that the order of
\par events in the transformation of communist
\par society would be represented by which one of the
\par following?
\par (A) A great political shock would break the
\par totalitarian monopoly, leaving in its wake
\par a civil society whose task would be to
\par change the state-controlled market into a
\par free economy.
\par (B) The transformation of the economy would
\par destroy totalitarianism, after which a new
\par and different social and political structure
\par would be born.
\par (C) First the people would freely elect
\par political representatives who would
\par transform the economy, which would then
\par undermine the totalitarian structure.
\par (D) The change to a democratic state would
\par necessarily undermine totalitarianism,
\par after which a new economic order would
\par be created.
\par (E) The people\rquote s frustration would build until
\par it spontaneously generated violent revolution,
\par which would sentence society to
\par years of anarchy and regression.
\par 2. Beginning in the second paragraph, the author
\par describes the complicated relationship between
\par \'93freedom\'94 and \'93democracy.\'94 In the author\rquote s
\par view, which one of the following statements best
\par reflects that relationship?
\par (A) A country can have freedom without
\par having democracy.
\par (B) If a country has freedom, it necessarily
\par has democracy.
\par (C) A country can have democracy without
\par having freedom.
\par (D) A country can never have democracy if it
\par has freedom.
\par (E) If a country has democracy, it cannot have
\par freedom.
\par 3. From the passage, a reader could conclude that
\par which one of the following best describes the
\par author\rquote s attitude toward the events that have
\par taken place in communist society?
\par (A) Relieved that at last the democratic order
\par has surfaced.
\par (B) Clearly wants to return to the old order.
\par (C) Disappointed with the nature of the
\par democracy that has emerged.
\par (D) Confident that a free economy will ultimately
\par provide the basis for a true
\par democracy.
\par (E) Surprised that communism was toppled
\par through political rather than economic
\par means.
\par 1. This is a description question, so you should
\par locate the point in the passage from which it was
\par drawn. It is the third paragraph. In lines 23\endash 28,
\par the author recalls his expectation that, by introducing
\par the market system, the communist system
\par would topple from within.
\par Trap!
\par Be careful not to choose (A). It chronicles
\par how the events actually occurred,
\par not how they were anticipated to occur.
\par (A) is baited with the words \'93great
\par shock,\'94 \'93monopoly,\'94 and \'93civil society.\'94
\par The answer is (B).
\par 2. This is an extension question, so the answer
\par must say more than what is said in the passage,
\par without requiring a quantum leap in thought.
\par The needed reference is \'93Democracy is something
\par more than freedom\'94 (lines 13\endash 14). Since
\par freedom can exist without democracy, freedom
\par alone does not insure democracy.
\par The answer is (A).
\par 3. This is a tone question. The key to answering
\par this question is found in the closing comments.
\par There the author states \'93The masquerade goes
\par on,\'94 referring to nascent democracies. So he has
\par reservations about the newly emerging
\par democracies.
\par Watch out!
\par Watch out for (E). Although it is
\par supported by the passage, it is in a
\par supporting paragraph. The ideas in a
\par concluding paragraph take precedence
\par over those in a supporting
\par paragraph.
\par The answer is (C).
\par 332 GRE Prep Course
\par 4. A cynic who has observed political systems in
\par various countries would likely interpret the
\par author\rquote s description of the situation at the end of
\par the passage as
\par (A) evidence that society is still in the throws
\par of the old totalitarian structure.
\par (B) a distorted description of the new political
\par system.
\par (C) a necessary political reality that is a prelude
\par to \'93democracy.\'94
\par (D) a fair description of many democratic
\par political systems.
\par (E) evidence of the baseness of people.
\par 5. Which one of the following does the author
\par imply may have contributed to the difficulties
\par involved in creating a new democratic order in
\par eastern Europe?
\par I. The people who existed under the totalitarian
\par structure have not had the experience
\par of \'93negotiating the empty space of
\par freedom.\'94
\par II. Mistaking the order in which political,
\par economic, and social restructuring would
\par occur.
\par III. Excessive self-interest among the new
\par political activists.
\par (A) I only
\par (B) II only
\par (C) I and III only
\par (D) II and III only
\par (E) I, II, and III
\par 6. By stating \'93even as we are conscious of our
\par victory, we feel that we are, in a strange way,
\par losing\'94 (lines 50\endash 52) the author means that
\par (A) some of the old governments are still
\par unwilling to grant freedom at the individual
\par level.
\par (B) some of the new governments are not
\par strong enough to exist as a single
\par federation.
\par (C) some of the new democratic governments
\par are electing to retain the old political
\par parties.
\par (D) no new parties have been created to fill the
\par vacuum created by the victory of freedom.
\par (E) some of the new governments are reverting
\par to communism.
\par 4. This is an application question. These are like
\par extension questions, but they go well beyond
\par what is stated in the passage. In this case we are
\par asked to interpret the author\rquote s comments from a
\par cynic\rquote s perspective. Because application questions
\par go well beyond the passage, they are often
\par difficult, as is this one.
\par Hint!
\par A cynic looks at reality from a negative
\par perspective, usually with a sense
\par of dark irony and hopelessness.
\par Don\rquote t make the mistake of choosing (E).
\par Although a cynic is likely to make such a statement,
\par it does not address the subject of the
\par passage\emdash political and economic systems. The
\par passage is not about human nature, at least not
\par directly. The answer is (D).
\par 5. This is an extension question. Statement I is
\par true. In lines 37\endash 39, the author implies that the
\par institutions of the new-born, free society were
\par created in great pain because the people lacked
\par experience. Statement II is true. Expectations
\par that the market mechanisms would explode
\par totalitarianism and usher in a new society were
\par dashed, and having to readjust one\rquote s expectations
\par certainly makes a situation more difficult.
\par Finally, statement III is true. It summarizes the
\par thrust of the passage\rquote s closing lines.
\par The answer is (E).
\par 6. This is a hybrid extension and description
\par question. Because it refers to a specific point in

\par Directions: This passage is followed by a group of questions to be answered based on what is stated or implied in
\par the passage. Choose the best answer; the one that most accurately and completely answers the question.
\par In the United States the per capita costs of
\par schooling have risen almost as fast as the cost of
\par medical treatment. But increased treatment by both
\par doctors and teachers has shown steadily declining
\par results. Medical expenses concentrated on those 5
\par above forty-five have doubled several times over a
\par period of forty years with a resulting 3 percent
\par increase in the life expectancy of men. The
\par increase in educational expenditures has produced
\par even stranger results; otherwise President Nixon 10
\par could not have been moved this spring to promise
\par that every child shall soon have the \'93Right to
\par Read\'94 before leaving school.
\par In the United States it would take eighty
\par billion dollars per year to provide what educators 15
\par regard as equal treatment for all in grammar and
\par high school. This is well over twice the $36 billion
\par now being spent. Independent cost projections
\par prepared at HEW and at the University of Florida
\par indicate that by 1974 the comparable figures will 20
\par be $107 billion as against the $45 billion now projected,
\par and these figures wholly omit the enormous
\par costs of what is called \'93higher education,\'94 for
\par which demand is growing even faster. The United
\par States, which spent nearly eighty billion dollars in 25
\par 1969 for \'93defense,\'94 including its deployment in
\par Vietnam, is obviously too poor to provide equal
\par schooling. The President\rquote s committee for the study
\par of school finance should ask not how to support or
\par how to trim such increasing costs, but how they can 30
\par be avoided.
\par Equal obligatory schooling must be recognized
\par as at least economically unfeasible. In Latin
\par America the amount of public money spent on each
\par graduate student is between 350 and 1,500 times 35
\par the amount spent on the median citizen (that is, the
\par citizen who holds the middle ground between the
\par poorest and the richest). In the United States the
\par discrepancy is smaller, but the discrimination is
\par keener. The richest parents, some 10 percent, can 40
\par afford private education for their children and help
\par them to benefit from foundation grants. But in
\par addition they obtain ten times the per capita
\par amount of public funds if this is compared with the
\par per capita expenditure made on the children of the 45
\par 10 percent who are poorest. The principal reasons
\par for this are that rich children stay longer in school,
\par that a year in a university is disproportionately
\par more expensive than a year in high school, and that
\par most private universities depend\emdash at least 50
\par indirectly\emdash on tax-derived finances.
\par Obligatory schooling inevitably polarizes a
\par society; it also grades the nations of the world
\par according to an international caste system.
\par Countries are rated like castes whose educational 55
\par dignity is determined by the average years of
\par schooling of its citizens, a rating which is closely
\par related to per capita gross national product, and
\par much more painful.
\par 1. Which one of the following best expresses the
\par main idea of the passage?
\par (A) The educational shortcomings of the
\par United States, in contrast to those of
\par Latin America, are merely the result of

\par (B) Both education and medical care are

\par 4. Why does the author consider the results from
\par increased educational expenditures to be \'93even
\par stranger\'94 than those from increased medical

\par (A) The aging of the population should have
\par had an impact only on medical care, not

\par The Six Questions 335
\par Answers and Solutions to Exercise
\par 1. The answer to a main idea question will
\par summarize the passage, without going beyond it.
\par (A) fails to meet these criteria because it
\par makes a false claim. Lines 33\endash 38 imply that the
\par discrepancy in allocation of funds is greater in
\par Latin America. Besides, Latin America is mentioned
\par only in passing, so this is not the main
\par idea.
\par (B) also makes a false claim. The author
\par implies that increased funding for education is irrelevant,
\par if not counterproductive. In fact, the
\par sentence \'93The President\rquote s committee for the
\par study of school finance should ask not how to
\par support or how to trim such increasing costs, but
\par how they can be avoided\'94 implies that he thinks
\par an increase in funding would be counterproductive.
\par (C) is implied by the sentence \'93The United
\par States . . . is obviously too poor to provide equal
\par schooling,\'94 but the author does not fully develop
\par this idea. Besides, he implies that the problem is
\par not financial.
\par (D) is the second-best answer-choice. The
\par answer to a main idea question should sum up
\par the passage, not make a conjecture about it.
\par Clearly the author has serious reservations about
\par obligatory schooling, but at no point does he
\par state or imply that it should be scrapped. He
\par may believe that it can be modified, or he may be
\par resigned to the fact that, for other reasons, it is
\par necessary. We don\rquote t know.
\par Finally, (E) aptly summarizes the passage,
\par without going beyond it. The key to seeing this
\par is the opening to paragraph three, \'93Equal obligatory
\par schooling must be recognized as at least
\par economically unfeasible.\'94 In other words,
\par regardless of any other failings, it cannot succeed
\par economically and therefore cannot provide equal
\par education.
\par 2. This is an application question. These questions
\par tend to be rather difficult, though this one is
\par not. To answer an application question, put
\par yourself in the author\rquote s place. If you were arguing
\par his case, which of the solutions would you
\par advocate?
\par As to (A), although we rejected the recommendation
\par that obligatory education be eliminated
\par as Question 1\rquote s answer, it is the answer to
\par Question 2. The author does not merely imply
\par that obligatory education has some shortcomings;
\par he suggests that it is fundamentally flawed.
\par Again this is made clear by the opening to
\par paragraph three, \'93Equal obligatory schooling
\par must be recognized as at least economically
\par unfeasible.\'94 Still, there is a possible misunderstanding
\par here: perhaps the author believes that
\par obligatory education is a noble but unrealistic
\par idea. This possibility, however, is dispelled by
\par the closing paragraph in which he states that
\par obligatory education polarizes society and sets
\par up a caste system. Obviously, such a system, if
\par this is true, should be discarded. The answer is
\par (A).
\par The other choices can be easily dismissed.
\par (B) is incorrect because nothing in the passage
\par suggests that the author would advocate a solution
\par that would polarize society even more.
\par Indeed, at the end of paragraph three, he suggests
\par that the rich already get more than their fair
\par share.
\par (C) is incorrect because it contradicts the
\par author. Paragraph two is dedicated to showing
\par that the United States is too poor to provide
\par equal schooling. You can\rquote t divert money you
\par don\rquote t have.
\par (D) is incorrect. It reads too much into the
\par last paragraph.
\par Finally, (E) is the second-best answerchoice.
\par Although the author probably believes
\par that future spending should be restrained or
\par capped, this understates the thrust of his argument.
\par However, he might offer this as a compromise
\par to his opponents.
\par 3. This is a description question, so we must
\par find the place from which it is drawn. It is the
\par first paragraph. The sentence \'93But increased
\par treatment by both doctors and teachers has
\par shown steadily declining results\'94 shows that
\par both have reached a point of diminishing returns.
\par This eliminates (A) and (B). Next, the passage
\par states \'93Medical expenses concentrated on those
\par above forty-five have doubled several times\'94
\par (lines 5\endash 7) and that the demand and costs of
\par higher education are growing faster than the
\par demand and costs of elementary and high school
\par education. This eliminates (D). Next, the opening
\par to the passage states that the costs of education
\par \'93have risen almost as fast as the cost of
\par 336 GRE Prep Course
\par medical treatment.\'94 This eliminates (E). Hence,
\par by process of elimination, the answer is (C). We
\par should, however, verify this. In paragraph three,
\par the author does state that there is a \'93keen\'94
\par discrepancy in the funding of education between
\par rich and poor, but a survey of the passage shows
\par that at no point does he mention that this is also
\par the case with health care.
\par 4. This is an extension question. We are asked
\par to interpret a statement by the author. The
\par needed reference is the closing sentence to paragraph
\par one. Remember: extension questions require
\par you to go beyond the passage, so the answer
\par won\rquote t be explicitly stated in the reference\emdash 
\par we will have to interpret it.
\par The implication of President Nixon\rquote s
\par promise is that despite increased educational
\par funding many children cannot even read when
\par they graduate from school. Hence the answer is
\par (B).
\par Don\rquote t make the mistake of choosing (C).
\par Although at first glance this is a tempting inference,
\par it would be difficult to compare the results
\par of education and medical care directly (how
\par would we do so?). Regardless, the opening line
\par to the passage states that educational costs have
\par risen \'93almost as fast\'94 as medical costs, not faster.
\par (A) is incorrect because the passage never
\par mentions the aging of the population. The same
\par is true for (D).
\par Many students who cannot solve this question
\par choose (E)\emdash don\rquote t. It uses as bait language
\par from the passage, \'93inevitably polarizes a society.\'94
\par Note: The phrase \'93Right to Read\'94 in (B) is
\par not a same language trap; it is merely part of a
\par paraphrase of the passage. The correct answer to
\par an extension question will often both paraphrase
\par and extend a passage statement but will not quote
\par it directly, as in (E).
\par 5. Like most tone questions this one is rather
\par easy. Although choice (A) is a measured
\par response, the author clearly does not admire the
\par obligatory school system. This eliminates (A); it
\par also eliminates (C) and (D). Of the two remaining
\par choices, (B) is the measured response, and it
\par is the answer. Although the author strongly
\par opposes obligatory schooling, \'93resentful\'94 is too
\par strong and too personal. A scholar would never
\par directly express resentment or envy, even if that
\par is his true feeling.
\par 6. This is another extension question. By stating
\par that the amount of funding spent on graduate
\par students is more than 350 times the amount spent
\par on the average citizen, the author implies that it
\par would be impossible to equalize the funding.
\par Hence the answer is (B).
\par None of the other choices have any real
\par merit. (A) is incorrect because the import of the
\par passage is that the rich get better schooling and
\par more public funds in the United States and therefore
\par discrimination is \'93keener\'94 here (lines 38\endash 
\par 40).
\par (C) and (D) are incorrect because they are
\par neither mentioned nor implied by the passage.
\par (E) is the second-best choice. Although
\par this is implied by the numbers given, it has little
\par to do with the primary purpose of the passage\emdash 
\par to show that obligatory education is perhaps not
\par such a good idea.

\par Pivotal Words
\par As mentioned before, each passage contains 300 to 600 words and only a few questions, so you will not be
\par tested on most of the material in the passage. Your best reading strategy, therefore, is to identify the places
\par from which questions will most likely be drawn and concentrate your attention there.
\par Pivotal words can help in this regard. Following are the most common pivotal words.
\par PIVOTAL WORDS
\par But Although
\par However Yet
\par Despite Nevertheless
\par Nonetheless Except
\par In contrast Even though
\par As you may have noticed, these words indicate contrast. Pivotal words warn that the author is about
\par to either make a U-turn or introduce a counter-premise (concession to a minor point that weakens the
\par argument).
\par Example: (Counter-premise)
\par I submit that the strikers should accept the management\rquote s offer. Admittedly, it is less than what
\par was demanded. But it does resolve the main grievance\emdash inadequate health care. Furthermore,
\par an independent study shows that a wage increase greater than 5% would leave the company
\par unable to compete against Japan and Germany, forcing it into bankruptcy.
\par The conclusion, \'93the strikers should accept the management\rquote s offer,\'94 is stated in the first sentence. Then
\par \'93Admittedly\'94 introduces a concession (counter-premise); namely, that the offer was less than what was
\par demanded. This weakens the speaker\rquote s case, but it addresses a potential criticism of his position before it
\par can be made. The last two sentences of the argument present more compelling reasons to accept the offer
\par and form the gist of the argument.
\par Pivotal words mark natural places for questions to be drawn. At a pivotal word, the author changes
\par direction. The GRE writers form questions at these junctures to test whether you turned with the author or
\par you continued to go straight. Rarely do the GRE writers let a pivotal word pass without drawing a question
\par from its sentence.
\par Strategy
\par As you read a passage, note the pivotal words and refer to them when answering the
\par questions.
\par Let\rquote s apply this theory to the passage on criminal justice. For easy reference, the passage is reprinted
\par here in the left-hand column, with explanations in the right-hand column. The pivotal words are marked in

\par 338 GRE Prep Course
\par There are two major systems of criminal procedure in
\par the modern world\emdash the adversarial and the inquisitorial.
\par The former is associated with common law tradition and
\par the latter with civil law tradition. Both systems were
\par historically preceded by the system of private vengeance
\par in which the victim of a crime fashioned his own remedy
\par and administered it privately, either personally or
\par through an agent. The vengeance system was a system
\par of self-help, the essence of which was captured in the
\par slogan \'93an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.\'94 The
\par modern adversarial system is only one historical step
\par removed from the private vengeance system and still
\par retains some of its characteristic features. Thus, for
\par example, even though the right to institute criminal
\par action has now been extended to all members of society
\par and even though the police department has taken over
\par the pretrial investigative functions on behalf of the prosecution,
\par the adversarial system still leaves the defendant
\par to conduct his own pretrial investigation. The trial is still
\par viewed as a duel between two adversaries, refereed by a
\par judge who, at the beginning of the trial has no knowledge
\par of the investigative background of the case. In the
\par final analysis the adversarial system of criminal procedure
\par symbolizes and regularizes the punitive combat.
\par By contrast, the inquisitorial system begins historically
\par where the adversarial system stopped its development.
\par It is two historical steps removed from the system
\par of private vengeance. Therefore, from the standpoint of
\par legal anthropology, it is historically superior to the
\par adversarial system. Under the inquisitorial system the
\par public investigator has the duty to investigate not just on
\par behalf of the prosecutor but also on behalf of the defendant.
\par Additionally, the public prosecutor has the duty to
\par present to the court not only evidence that may lead to
\par the conviction of the defendant but also evidence that
\par may lead to his exoneration. This system mandates that
\par both parties permit full pretrial discovery of the evidence
\par in their possession. Finally, in an effort to make the trial
\par less like a duel between two adversaries, the inquisitorial
\par system mandates that the judge take an active part in the
\par conduct of the trial, with a role that is both directive and
\par protective.
\par Fact-finding is at the heart of the inquisitorial
\par system. This system operates on the philosophical
\par premise that in a criminal case the crucial factor is not
\par the legal rule but the facts of the case and that the goal of
\par the entire procedure is to experimentally recreate for the
\par court the commission of the alleged crime.
\par Even though\emdash Here \'93even though\'94 is
\par introducing a concession. In the previous
\par sentence, the author stated that the adversarial
\par system is only one step removed from the
\par private vengeance system. The author uses the
\par two concessions as a hedge against potential
\par criticism that he did not consider that the
\par adversarial system has extended the right to
\par institute criminal action to all members of
\par society and that police departments now
\par perform the pretrial investigation. But the
\par author then states that the adversarial system
\par still leaves the defendant to conduct his own
\par pretrial investigation. This marks a good place
\par from which to draw a question. Many people
\par will misinterpret the two concessions as
\par evidence that the adversarial system is two
\par steps removed from the private vengeance
\par system.
\par By contrast\emdash In this case the pivotal word
\par is not introducing a concession. Instead it indicates
\par a change in thought: now the author is
\par going to discuss the other criminal justice
\par system. This is a natural place to test whether
\par the student has made the transition and whether
\par he will attribute the properties soon to be introduced
\par to the inquisitorial system, not the adversarial
\par system.
\par But also\emdash In both places, \'93but also\'94 indicates
\par neither concession nor change in thought.
\par Instead it is part of the coordinating conjunction
\par \'93not only . . . but also . . . .\'94 Rather than
\par indicating contrast, it emphasizes the second
\par element of the pair.

\par Pivotal Words 339
\par Let\rquote s see how these pivotal words can help answer the questions in the last section. The first is from
\par the Description Section:
\par Example:
\par According to the passage, the inquisitorial system differs from the adversarial system in that
\par (A) it does not make the defendant solely responsible for gathering evidence for his case
\par (B) it does not require the police department to work on behalf of the prosecution
\par (C) it does not allow the victim the satisfaction of private vengeance
\par (D) it requires the prosecution to drop a weak case
\par (E) a defendant who is innocent would prefer to be tried under the inquisitorial system
\par The pivotal phrase \'93by contrast\'94 flags the second paragraph as the place to begin looking. The pivotal
\par phrase \'93but also\'94 introduces the answer\emdash namely that the prosecutor must also investigate \'93on behalf of the
\par defendant.\'94 The answer is (A).
\par The next question is from the Writing Techniques Section:
\par Example:
\par Which one of the following best describes the organization of the passage?
\par (A) Two systems of criminal justice are compared and contrasted, and one is deemed to be better
\par than the other.
\par (B) One system of criminal justice is presented as better than another. Then evidence is presented
\par to support that claim.
\par (C) Two systems of criminal justice are analyzed, and one specific example is examined in detail.
\par (D) A set of examples is presented. Then a conclusion is drawn from them.
\par (E) The inner workings of the criminal justice system are illustrated by using two systems.
\par The pivotal phrase \'93by contrast\'94 gives this question away. The author is comparing and contrasting two
\par criminal justice systems, which the opening pivotal word introduces. Hence the answer is (A).
\par For our final example, consider the question from the Extension Section:
\par Example:
\par The author views the prosecution\rquote s role in the inquisitorial system as being
\par (A) an advocate for both society and the defendant
\par (B) solely responsible for starting a trial
\par (C) a protector of the legal rule
\par (D) an investigator only
\par (E) an aggressive but fair investigator
\par The information needed to answer this question is introduced by the pivotal phrase, \'93but also.\'94 There it is
\par stated that the prosecutor must present evidence that may exonerate the defendant; that is, he must act fairly.
\par The answer is (E).
\par Points to Remember
\par 1. Pivotal words indicate that the author is about to make a U-turn in thought or introduce a counterpremise
\par (concession to a minor point that weakens the argument).
\par 2. The following are the most common pivotal words:
\par But Although
\par However Yet
\par Despite Nevertheless
\par Nonetheless Except
\par In contrast Even though
\par 3. Pivotal words mark natural places for questions to be drawn. At a pivotal word, the author changes
\par direction. The GRE writers form questions at these junctures to test whether you made the turn with
\par the author or whether you continued to go straight. Rarely do the GRE writers pass a pivotal word
\par without drawing a question from its sentence.
\par 4. As you read each passage, note the pivotal words.

\par question. Hints, insights, and answers are given in the right-hand column.
\par The premise with which the multiculturalists
\par begin is unexceptional: that it is important to
\par recognize and to celebrate the wide range of
\par cultures that exist in the United States. In what
\par sounds like a reflection of traditional American
\par pluralism, the multiculturalists argue that we
\par must recognize difference, that difference is
\par legitimate; in its kindlier versions, multiculturalism
\par represents the discovery on the part of
\par minority groups that they can play a part in
\par molding the larger culture even as they are
\par molded by it. And on the campus multiculturalism,
\par defined more locally as the need to recognize
\par cultural variations among students, has tried
\par with some success to talk about how a racially
\par and ethnically diverse student body can enrich
\par everyone\rquote s education.
\par Phillip Green, a political scientist at Smith
\par and a thoughtful proponent of multiculturalism,
\par notes that for a significant portion of the students
\par the politics of identity is all-consuming.
\par Students he says \'93are unhappy with the thin gruel
\par of rationalism. They require a therapeutic curriculum
\par to overcome not straightforward racism
\par but ignorant stereotyping.\'94
\par (1) But multiculturalism\rquote s hard-liners, who
\par seem to make up the majority of the movement,
\par damn as racism any attempt to draw the myriad
\par of American groups into a common American
\par culture. For these multiculturalists, differences
\par are absolute, irreducible, intractable\emdash occasions
\par not for understanding but for separation. The
\par multiculturalist, it turns out, is not especially
\par interested in the great American hyphen, in the
\par syncretistic (and therefore naturally tolerant)
\par identities that allow Americans to belong to more
\par than a single culture, to be both particularists and
\par universalists.
\par The time-honored American mixture of
\par assimilation and traditional allegiance is
\par denounced as a danger to racial and gender
\par authenticity. This is an extraordinary reversal of
\par the traditional liberal commitment to a \'93truth\'94
\par that transcends parochialisms. In the new
\par race/class/gender formation, universality is
\par replaced by, among other things, feminist science
\par Nubian numerals (as part of an Afro-centric
\par science), and what Marilyn Frankenstein of the
\par University of Massachusetts-Boston describes as
\par \'93ethno-mathematics,\'94 in which the cultural basis
\par of counting comes to the fore.
\par There are two critical pivotal words in this
\par passage\emdash (1) But, and (2) however.
\par (1) But. Until this point, the author did not
\par reveal his feeling toward multiculturalism. He
\par presented an objective, if not positive, view of
\par the movement. However, \'93But\'94 introduced an
\par abrupt change in direction (a U-turn). Before he
\par talked about the \'93kindlier\'94 multiculturalism\emdash to
\par which he appears to be sympathetic. Now he
\par talks about \'93hard-line\'94 multiculturalism, which
\par he implies is intolerant and divisive.
\par The pivotal word \'93but\'94 doesn\rquote t just change the
\par direction of the passage, it introduces the main
\par idea: that multiculturalism has become an
\par extreme and self-contradictory movement.
\par TeamLRN
\par Pivotal Words 341
\par The multiculturalists insist on seeing all
\par perspectives as tainted by the perceiver\rquote s particular
\par point of view. Impartial knowledge, they
\par argue, is not possible, because ideas are simply
\par the expression of individual identity, or of the
\par unspoken but inescapable assumptions that are
\par inscribed in a culture or a language. The problem,
\par (2) however, with this warmed-over
\par Nietzscheanism is that it threatens to leave no
\par ground for anybody to stand on. So the multiculturalists
\par make a leap, necessary for their own
\par intellectual survival, and proceed to argue that
\par there are some categories, such as race and gender,
\par that do in fact embody an unmistakable
\par knowledge of oppression. Victims are at least
\par epistemologically lucky. Objectivity is a mask
\par for oppression. And so an appalled former 1960s
\par radical complained to me that self-proclaimed
\par witches were teaching classes on witchcraft.
\par \'93They\rquote re not teaching students how to think,\'94
\par she said, \'93they\rquote re telling them what to believe.\'94
\par 1. Which one of the following ideas would a multiculturalist
\par NOT believe?
\par (A) That we should recognize and celebrate
\par the differences among the many cultures
\par in the United States.
\par (B) That we can never know the \'93truth\'94
\par because \'93truth\'94 is always shaped by one\rquote s
\par culture.
\par (C) That \'93difference\'94 is more important than
\par \'93sameness.\'94
\par (D) That a school curriculum should be constructed
\par to compensate for institutionalized
\par racism.
\par (E) That different cultures should work to
\par assimilate themselves into the mainstream
\par culture so that eventually there will be no
\par excuse for racism.
\par 2. According to a hard-line multiculturalist, which
\par one of the following groups is most likely to
\par know the \'93truth\'94 about political reality?
\par (A) Educated people who have learned how to
\par see reality from many different
\par perspectives.
\par (B) A minority group that has suffered
\par oppression at the hands of the majority.
\par (C) High government officials who have
\par privileged access to secret information.
\par (D) Minorities who through their education
\par have risen above the socioeconomic position
\par occupied by most members of their
\par ethnic group.
\par (E) Political scientists who have thoroughly
\par studied the problem.
\par (2) however. This is the second critical pivotal
\par word. The author opened this paragraph by
\par presenting the multiculturalist\rquote s view; now he
\par will criticize their positions.
\par 1. The sentence introduced by the pivotal word
\par \'93But\'94 gives away the answer to this question.
\par The answer is (E).
\par 2. This is a rather hard extension question.
\par Hint!
\par A subjugated minority group has at
\par least the \'93unmistakable knowledge of
\par oppression\'94 (last paragraph).
\par Watch out!
\par Don\rquote t make the mistake of choosing
\par (D). Upper class minorities have
\par simply exchanged one tainted point
\par of view for another\emdash and probably a
\par more tainted one since the adopted
\par position does not allow for knowledge
\par of \'93oppression.\'94
\par The answer is (B).
\par 342 GRE Prep Course
\par 3. The author states that in a \'93kindlier version\'94 of
\par multiculturalism, minorities discover \'93that they
\par can play a part in molding the larger culture even
\par as they are molded by it.\'94 If no new ethnic
\par groups were incorporated into the American
\par culture for many centuries to come, which one of
\par the following would be the most probable
\par outcome of this \'93kindlier version\'94?
\par (A) At some point in the future, there would
\par be only one culture with no observable
\par ethnic differences.
\par (B) Eventually the dominant culture would
\par overwhelm the minority cultures, who
\par would then lose their ethnic identities.
\par (C) The multiplicity of ethnic groups would
\par remain but the characteristics of the
\par different ethnic groups would change.
\par (D) The smaller ethnic groups would remain,
\par and they would retain their ethnic
\par heritage.
\par (E) The minority cultures would eventually
\par overwhelm the dominant culture, which
\par would then lose its identity.
\par 4. The author speaks about the \'93politics of identity\'94
\par that Phillip Green, a political scientist at Smith,
\par notes is all-consuming for many of the students.
\par Considering the subject of the passage, which
\par one of the following best describes what the
\par author means by \'93the politics of identity\'94?
\par (A) The attempt to discover individual identities
\par through political action
\par (B) The political agenda that aspires to create
\par a new pride of identity for Americans
\par (C) The current obsession for therapy groups
\par that help individuals discover their inner
\par selves
\par (D) The trend among minority students to
\par discover their identities in their ethnic
\par groups rather than in their individuality
\par (E) The increased political activism of minorities
\par on college campuses
\par 3. This application question clearly goes well
\par beyond the passage.
\par If no new ethnic groups were incorporated
\par into the American culture, then the interplay
\par between the larger and smaller groups would
\par continue, with both groups changing, until there
\par would be only one common (and different from
\par any original) group.
\par The answer is (A).
\par 4. This is an extension question. You may find
\par the classification of the these problems as
\par \'93application\'94 or \'93extension\'94 to be somewhat
\par arbitrary or even disagree with a particular classification.
\par As mentioned before, application and
\par extension questions differ only in degree.
\par Question 3 is clearly an application question; by
\par asking you to make a conjecture about the future,
\par it goes well beyond the passage. How to classify
\par Question 4, however, is not so clear. I classified
\par it as an extension question because it seems to be
\par asking merely for the author\rquote s true meaning of
\par the phrase \'93the politics of identity.\'94 That is, it
\par stays within the context of the passage.
\par Trap!
\par Don\rquote t be led astray by (B); it uses the
\par word \'93political\'94 to tempt you. Although
\par it is perhaps a good description, it is not
\par within the context of the passage, which
\par focuses on ethnic politics, not national
\par identities through \'93roots.\'94
\par The answer is (D).

\par Pivotal Words 343
\par 5. Which one of the following best describes the
\par attitude of the writer toward the multicultural
\par movement?
\par (A) Tolerant. It may have some faults, but it
\par is well-meaning overall.
\par (B) Critical. A formerly admirable movement
\par has been taken over by radical

\par (D) Enthusiastic. The author embraces the
\par multiculturalist movement and is trying to
\par present it in a favorable light.
\par (E) Ambivalent. Like a moth to a flame he is
\par simultaneously attracted and repulsed by
\par the movement.
\par 6. \'93Multiculturalist relativism\'94 is the notion that
\par there is no such thing as impartial or objective
\par knowledge. The author seems to be grounding
\par his criticism of this notion on
\par (A) the clear evidence that science has indeed
\par discovered \'93truths\'94 that have been independent
\par of both language and culture.
\par (B) the conclusion that relativism leaves one
\par with no clear notions of any one thing that
\par is true.
\par (C) the absurdity of claiming that knowledge
\par of oppression is more valid than knowledge
\par of scientific facts.
\par (D) the agreement among peoples of all
\par cultures as to certain undeniable truths\emdash 
\par e.g., when the sky is clear, day is warmer
\par than night.
\par (E) the fact that \'93truth\'94 is not finitely definable
\par and therefore that any discussion of
\par impartial or objective truth is moot.
\par 5. Like most tone questions this one is rather
\par easy.
\par To get a feel for the author\rquote s attitude, check
\par the adjectives he chooses. The author starts by
\par introducing the \'93kindlier\'94 version of multiculturalism
\par and describes a proponent of multiculturalism,
\par Phillip Green, as \'93thoughtful.\'94 Then he
\par introduces the \'93hard liners\'94 who \'93damn\'94 any
\par attempt at cultural assimilation. He feels that the
\par movement has changed; that it has gone bad.
\par The answer is (B).
\par 6. This is an another extension question.
\par Hint!
\par The answer can be derived from the
\par pivotal sentence containing
\par \'93however\'94 (2).
\par The answer is (B).

\par According to usage and conventions which
\par are at last being questioned but have by no means
\par been overcome, the social presence of a woman is
\par different in kind from that of a man. A man\rquote s
\par presence is dependent upon the promise of power 5
\par which he embodies. If the promise is large and
\par credible his presence is striking. If it is small or
\par incredible, he is found to have little presence. The
\par promised power may be moral, physical, temperamental,
\par economic, social, sexual\emdash but its object 10
\par is always exterior to the man. A man\rquote s presence
\par suggests what he is capable of doing to you or for
\par you. His presence may be fabricated, in the sense
\par that he pretends to be capable of what he is not.
\par But the pretense is always toward a power which 15
\par he exercises on others.
\par By contrast, a woman\rquote s presence expresses
\par her own attitude to herself, and defines what can
\par and cannot be done to her. Her presence is manifest
\par in her gestures, voices, opinions, expressions, 20
\par clothes, chosen surroundings, taste\emdash indeed there
\par is nothing she can do which does not contribute to
\par her presence. Presence for a woman is so intrinsic
\par to her person that men tend to think of it as an
\par almost physical emanation, a kind of heat or smell 25
\par or aura.
\par To be born a woman has been to be born,
\par within an allotted and confined space, into the
\par keeping of men. The social presence of women
\par has developed as a result of their ingenuity in 30
\par living under such tutelage within such a limited
\par space. But this has been at the cost of a woman\rquote s
\par self being split into two. A woman must continually
\par watch herself. Whilst she is walking across a
\par room or whilst she is weeping at the death of her 35
\par father, she can scarcely avoid envisaging herself
\par walking or weeping. From earliest childhood she
\par has been taught and persuaded to survey herself
\par continually.
\par And so she comes to consider the surveyor 40
\par and the surveyed within her as the two constituent
\par yet always distinct elements of her identity as a
\par woman.
\par She has to survey everything she is and everything
\par she does because how she appears to others, 45
\par and ultimately how she appears to men, is of crucial
\par importance for what is normally thought of as
\par the success of her life. Her own sense of being in
\par herself is supplanted by a sense of being appreciated
\par as herself by another. Men survey women 50
\par before treating them. Consequently how a woman
\par appears to a man can determine how she will be
\par treated. To acquire some control over this process,
\par women must contain it and internalize it.
\par That part of a woman\rquote s self which is the surveyor 55
\par treats the part which is the surveyed so as to
\par demonstrate to others how her whole self would
\par like to be treated. And this exemplary treatment
\par of herself by herself constitutes her presence.
\par Every woman\rquote s presence regulates what is and is 60
\par not \'93permissible\'94 within her presence. Every one
\par of her actions\emdash whatever its direct purpose or
\par motivation\emdash is also read as an indication of how
\par she would like to be treated. If a woman throws a
\par glass on the floor, this is an example of how she 65
\par treats her own emotion of anger and so of how she
\par would wish to be treated by others. If a man does
\par the same, his action is only read as an expression
\par of his anger. If a woman makes a good joke this
\par is an example of how she treats the joker in herself 70
\par and accordingly of how she as joker-woman
\par would like to be treated by others. Only a man
\par can make a good joke for its own sake.

\par Answers and Solutions to Exercise
\par This passage is filled with pivotal words, some of which are crucial to following the author\rquote s train of
\par thought. We will discuss only the critical pivotal words. The first pivotal word, \'93but\'94 (line 15), introduces
\par a distinction between a man\rquote s presence and a woman\rquote s: a man\rquote s is external, a woman\rquote s internal. The
\par second pivotal word, \'93by contrast,\'94 introduces the main idea of the passage. The author opened the passage
\par by defining a man\rquote s presence; now she will define a woman\rquote s presence. The last pivotal word, \'93but\'94 (lines
\par 32\endash 34), also introduces a change in thought. Now the author discusses how a woman\rquote s presence has split
\par her identity into two parts\emdash the surveyor and the surveyed. By closing with, \'93Only a man can make a good
\par joke for its own sake,\'94 the author is saying a man can concentrate on the punch line, whereas a woman
\par must concentrate on its delivery.
\par 1. This is a description question. The needed
\par reference is contained in lines 21\endash 24: \'93there is
\par nothing [a woman] can do which does not contribute
\par to her presence. Presence for a woman is
\par intrinsic to her person . . .\'94 If something is
\par intrinsic to you, then it necessarily is part of your
\par reality. Hence the answer is (B).
\par Note the question refers to \'93usage and
\par conventions\'94 discussed in the passage, not to any
\par other way of viewing the world\emdash such as your
\par own!
\par 2. Although the author opens the passage with
\par a hint that she doesn\rquote t like the customary sex
\par roles (\'93conventions which are at last being
\par questioned\'94), the rest of the passage is explanatory
\par and analytical. So (C) and (D) are too
\par strong. The answer is (B).
\par 3. This is an application question; we are asked
\par to apply what we have learned from the passage
\par to a hypothetical situation.
\par The best way to analyze this question is to
\par compare the speaker to a joke-teller. The passage
\par paints a portrait of a woman as most concerned
\par with the image she presents to the world.
\par She is not concerned with the speech or joke, per
\par se, rather with how she delivers it. \'93Only a man
\par can make a good joke for its own sake.\'94 The
\par answer is (C).
\par Don\rquote t make the mistake of choosing (B).
\par Although men have, in the main, molded her
\par self-image, she has gone beyond that; she now
\par measures herself in the abstract: \'93how will I
\par come off to the ultimately critical audience?\'94 and
\par not \'93how will actual audience members see me?\'94
\par 4. This description question is a bit tricky
\par because the second-best choice is rather good.
\par Women are concerned with the image they present,
\par so they cannot be themselves\emdash they must
\par act their part. Hence the answer is (C).
\par You may have been tempted by (A).
\par According to the passage, women are thrown
\par into the role of an actress, \'93into the keeping of
\par men.\'94 So, like victims, they are not responsible
\par for their social position. However, nothing in the
\par passage directly suggests that it is wrong for
\par women to be in this position or that women
\par attempt to refuse this role. According to the passage,
\par therefore, women are not, strictly speaking,
\par victims. (Victim means \'93someone not in control
\par of something injurious happening to him or
\par her.\'94)
\par 5. This is an extension question. The passage
\par discusses the fact that a man may fabricate his
\par image (lines 13\endash 14). This suggests that men are
\par conscious of their images, but the passage also
\par states that image is not intrinsic to their personalities,
\par as it is for women. The answer is (B).
\par 6. This is a rather hard main idea question
\par because the second-best choice, (A), is quite
\par good.
\par The passage does open with a discussion of
\par a man\rquote s presence. But in paragraph two the
\par pivotal phrase \'93by contrast\'94 introduces a woman\rquote s
\par presence; from there the discussion of a
\par man\rquote s presence is only in regard to how it affects
\par a woman\rquote s. So a woman\rquote s presence is the main
\par idea; contrasting it with a man\rquote s presence is secondary.
\par (B) gives the proper emphasis to these
\par two purposes.

\par The Three Step Method
\par Now we apply all the methods we have learned to another passage. First let\rquote s summarize the reading
\par techniques we have developed and express them in a three-step attack strategy for reading GRE passages:
\par THE THREE STEP METHOD
\par 1. (Optional) Preview the first sentence of each paragraph.
\par 2. Read the passage at a faster than usual pace (but not to the point that comprehension
\par suffers). Stay alert to places from which any of the six questions might be drawn:
\par a.) Main Idea
\par b.) Description
\par c.) Writing Technique
\par d.) Extension
\par e.) Application
\par f.) Tone
\par 3. Annotate the passage and note any pivotal words. Then use them as reference points when
\par answering the questions. Following are some common annotation marks (you may want to
\par add to this list):
\par A = Author\rquote s Attitude
\par C = Complex point
\par ? = Question? I don\rquote t understand this part (you can bet that this area will be important to
\par at least one question)
\par SP = Significant point
\par ! = Exclamation! Strong opinion
\par W = Weak, questionable or unsupported argument or premise
\par Notice how the three-step process proceeds from the general to the specific. The first step, previewing the
\par first sentences, gives you an overview of the passage. This will help you answer main idea questions. The
\par second step, reading the passage at a slightly faster than usual pace, brings out the passage\rquote s structure (i.e.,
\par does the author compare and contrast, show cause and effect, etc.). Further, it will clue you into the
\par author\rquote s attitude (positive, negative, objective, indifferent, etc.). Finally, the third step, noting pivotal
\par words and annotating, will solidify your understanding of the passage and highlight specific details.
\par The three step method should be viewed as a dynamic, and not a static, process. The steps often
\par overlap and they are not performed in strict order. Comprehending a passage is an ebb and flow process.
\par Analyzing a passage to understand how it is constructed can be compared to dismantling an engine to
\par understand how it was built\emdash you may stop occasionally and reassemble parts of it to review what you just
\par did; then proceed again to dismantle more. Likewise, when reading a passage, you may first read and
\par annotate a paragraph (disassembling it) and then go back and skim to reassemble it. During this process,
\par comprehension proceeds from the global to the specific. This can be represented by an inverted pyramid:
\par 348 GRE Prep Course
\par CONJECTURE
\par main idea
\par GENERAL UNDERSTANDING
\par author's attitude
\par logical structure
\par SPECIFIC UNDERSTANDING
\par logical details
\par INCORPORATION
\par what if?
\par In the conjecture stage, we form a tentative main idea\emdash one which we may have to modify or even
\par reject as we read more deeply into the passage. In the general understanding stage, we develop a feel for
\par the author\rquote s tone and discover the schema that she uses to present her ideas. In the specific understanding
\par stage, we fill in the minor gaps in our understanding. Finally, in the incorporation stage, we integrate the
\par ideas presented in the passage into our own thought process. We now understand the ideas sufficiently to
\par defend them, apply them to other situations, or evaluate their validity in a hypothetical situation. Only with
\par complete understanding of the passage can this be done.
\par Let\rquote s apply the three step method to the passage on the next page. Begin by previewing the first
\par sentence of each paragraph:
\par The sentence \'93That placebos can cure everything from dandruff to leprosy is well known\'94 implies
\par that the passage is about placebos and that they are perhaps cure-alls.
\par The sentence \'93Every drug tested would prove effective if special steps were not taken to neutralize the
\par placebo effect\'94 gives the first bit of evidence supporting the topic sentence.
\par The sentence \'93Most people feel that the lucky patients in a drug test get the experimental drug
\par because the real drug provides them a chance to be cured\'94 might be introducing a counter-premise or
\par pivotal point; we won\rquote t know until we read the passage.
\par The sentence \'93Placebos regularly cure more than five percent of the patients and would cure
\par considerably more if the doubts associated with the tests were eliminated\'94 provides more support for the
\par topic sentence.
\par The sentence \'93The actual curing power of placebos probably stems from the faith of the patient in the
\par treatment\'94 explains why the topic sentence is true.
\par The sentence \'93It may take a while to reach the ten percent level of cure because any newly
\par established program will not have cultivated the word-of-mouth advertising needed to insure its success\'94 is
\par hard to interpret. This does not help us.
\par The sentence \'93Unfortunately, placebo treatment centers cannot operate as nonprofit businesses\'94
\par seems to be off the subject. Again, this does not help us.
\par In summary, although the last two sentences were not useful, we now have a good idea of what the
\par passage is about: how and why placebos are effective. We now read the passage\emdash looking for places from
\par which any of the six questions might be drawn, noting the pivotal words, and annotating key points.
\par Passage begins on the next page. \u-9280\'3f\u-9146\'3f

\par The Three Step Method 349
\par That placebos can cure everything from dandruff
\par to leprosy is well known. They have a long
\par history of use by witch doctors, faith healers, and
\par even modern physicians, all of whom refuse to
\par admit their efficacy. Modern distribution tech- 5
\par niques can bring this most potent of medicines to
\par the aid of everyone, not just those lucky enough to
\par receive placebos in a medical testing program.
\par Every drug tested would prove effective if
\par special steps were not taken to neutralize the 10
\par placebo effect. This is why drug tests give half the
\par patients the new medication and half a harmless
\par substitute. These tests prove the value of placebos
\par because approximately five percent of the patients
\par taking them are cured even though the placebos are 15
\par made from substances that have been carefully
\par selected to be useless.
\par Most people feel that the lucky patients in a
\par drug test get the experimental drug because the real
\par drug provides them a chance to be cured. (1) Yet 20
\par analysis shows that patients getting the placebo may
\par be the lucky ones because they may be cured
\par without risking any adverse effects the new drug
\par may have. Furthermore, the drug may well be
\par found worthless and to have severe side effects. No 25
\par harmful side effects result from placebos.
\par Placebos regularly cure more than five
\par percent of the patients and would cure considerably
\par more if the doubts associated with the tests were
\par eliminated. Cures are principally due to the patien- 30
\par t\rquote s faith, (2) yet the patient must have doubts knowing
\par that he may or may not be given the new drug,
\par which itself may or may not prove to be an effective
\par drug. Since he knows the probability of being
\par given the true drug is about fifty percent, the 35
\par placebo cure rate would be more than doubled by
\par removing these doubts if cures are directly related
\par to faith.
\par The actual curing power of placebos probably
\par stems from the faith of the patient in the treatment. 40
\par This suggests that cure rates in the ten percent range
\par could be expected if patients are given placebos
\par under the guise of a proven cure, even when
\par patients know their problems are incurable.
\par It may take a while to reach the ten percent 45
\par level of cure because any newly established
\par program will not have cultivated the word-of-mouth
\par advertising needed to insure its success. One
\par person saying \'93I was told that my problem was
\par beyond medical help, but they cured me,\'94 can direct 50
\par countless people to the treatment with the required
\par degree of faith. Furthermore, when only terminal
\par illnesses are treated, those not cured tell no one of
\par the failure.
\par Unfortunately, placebo treatment centers 55
\par cannot operate as nonprofit businesses. The
\par nonprofit idea was ruled out upon learning that the
\par first rule of public medicine is never to give free
\par medicine. Public health services know that
\par medicine not paid for by patients is often not taken 60
\par or not effective because the recipient feels the
\par medicine is worth just what it cost him. (3) Even
\par though the patients would not know they were
\par taking sugar pills, the placebos cost so little that the
\par patients would have no faith in the treatment. 65
\par Therefore, though it is against higher principles,
\par treatment centers must charge high fees for placebo
\par treatments. This sacrifice of principles, however, is
\par a small price to pay for the greater good of the
\par patients. 70

\par (D) perplexed by its effectiveness
\par (E) zealous promotion
\par The first item is a main idea question:
\par 1. Which one of the following best expresses the main idea of the passage?
\par (A) Placebo treatment is a proven tool of modern medicine and its expanded use would
\par benefit society\rquote s health.
\par (B) Because modern technology allows for distribution of drugs on a massive scale, the
\par proven efficacy of the placebo is no longer limited to a privileged few.
\par (C) The curative power of the placebo is so strong that it should replace proven drugs
\par because the patients receiving the placebo will then be cured without risking any

\par (D) The price of placebo treatment must be kept artificially high because patients have
\par little faith in inexpensive treatments.
\par (E) Semi-placebos\emdash drugs that contain only a small amount of the usual dosage\emdash are
\par even more effective curatives than either the placebo or the full-strength drug.
\par As we found by previewing the topic sentences, the passage is about the efficacy of placebo treatment.
\par Careful reading shows that the passage also promotes expanded use of placebos. Hence the answer is (A).
\par The other choices can be quickly dismissed. (B) is the second-best choice: the author does mention
\par that modern distribution techniques can bring the curative power of placebos to everyone, but he does not
\par TeamLRN
\par The Three Step Method 351
\par fully develop that idea. This answer-choice is tempting because it is contained in the topic paragraph. As
\par to (C), it overstates the author\rquote s claim. Although in the third paragraph, the author states that those who
\par receive the placebos may be the lucky ones, this is referring to new, unproven drugs, not to established
\par drugs. As to (D), it, like (B), is mentioned in the passage but is not fully developed. It\rquote s tempting because
\par it appears in the last paragraph\emdash a natural place for the conclusion. Finally, (E) is neither mentioned nor
\par implied by the passage.
\par The second item is an application question.
\par 2. Which one of the following is most analogous to the idea presented in the last paragraph?
\par (A) Buying a television at a discount house
\par (B) Making an additional pledge to charity
\par (C) Choosing the most expensive dishwasher in a manufacturer\rquote s line
\par (D) Waiting until a book comes out in paperback
\par (E) Contributing one dollar to the Presidential Campaign fund on your tax return
\par The information needed to answer this question is heralded by the pivotal phrase \'93Even though\'94 (lines
\par 62\endash 65). The implication of that sentence is \'93you get what you pay for.\'94 This would motivate one to buy
\par the most expensive item in a manufacturer\rquote s line. Hence the answer is (C).
\par The third item is a description question.
\par 3. According to the passage, when testing a new drug medical researchers give half of the
\par subjects the test drug and half a placebo because
\par (A) proper statistical controls should be observed.
\par (B) this method reduces the risk of maiming too many subjects if the drug should prove
\par to be harmful.
\par (C) all drugs which are tested would prove to be effective otherwise.
\par (D) most drugs would test positively otherwise.
\par (E) the cost of dispensing drugs to all the patients is prohibitive.
\par Since this is a description question, you must refer to the passage to answer it. The opening sentence to
\par paragraph two contains the needed information. That sentence states \'93Every drug would prove effective if
\par special steps were not taken to neutralize the placebo effect.\'94 Hence the answer is (C).
\par Choice (D) illustrates why you must refer directly to the passage to answer a description question:
\par unless you have a remarkable memory, you will be unsure whether the statement was that all or that most
\par drugs would prove effective.
\par The fourth item is an extension question.
\par 4. It can be inferred from the passage that the author might
\par (A) believe that the benefits of a placebo treatment program that lead patients to believe
\par they were getting a real drug would outweigh the moral issue of lying.
\par (B) support legislation outlawing the use of placebos.
\par (C) open up a medical clinic that would treat patients exclusively through placebo
\par methods.
\par (D) believe that factors other than faith are responsible for the curative power of the
\par placebo.
\par (E) believe that placebo treatment centers should be tax-exempt because they are
\par nonprofit businesses.
\par The answer is (A). One of the first clues to the author\rquote s view on this issue is contained in the pivotal clause
\par \'93yet the patient . . . effective drug\'94 (lines 31\endash 34). Later, in paragraph six, the author nearly advocates that
\par 352 GRE Prep Course
\par the patient should not be told that he or she might be receiving a placebo. Finally, the closing line of the
\par passage cinches it. There, the author implies that certain principles can be sacrificed for the greater good of
\par the patients.
\par The fifth item is a writing technique question.
\par 5. Which one of the following best describes the organization of the material presented in the
\par passage?
\par (A) A general proposition is stated; then evidence for its support is given.
\par (B) Two types of drug treatment\emdash placebo and non-placebo\emdash are compared and
\par contrasted.
\par (C) A result is stated, its cause is explained, and an application is suggested.
\par (D) A dilemma is presented and a possible solution is offered.
\par (E) A series of examples is presented; then a conclusion is drawn from them.
\par In the first paragraph the author claims that placebos can cure everything from dandruff to leprosy\emdash this is
\par a result. Then in paragraphs two, three, four, and five, he explains the causes of the result. Finally, he
\par alludes to an application\emdash the placebo treatment centers. The answer is (C).
\par The sixth item is a tone question.
\par 6. Which one of the following most accurately characterizes the author\rquote s attitude toward
\par placebo treatment?
\par (A) reserved advocacy
\par (B) feigned objectivity
\par (C) summary dismissal
\par (D) perplexed by its effectiveness
\par (E) zealous promotion
\par This question is a little tricky. Only choices (A) and (B) have any real merit. Although the passage has a
\par detached, third-person style, the author nonetheless does present his opinions\emdash namely that placebos work
\par and that their use should be expanded. However, that advocacy is reserved, so the answer is (A).
\par The other choices can be quickly eliminated:
\par \'93Summary dismissal\'94 is not supported by the passage. Besides, a scholar would never summarily
\par dismiss something; he would consider it carefully\emdash or at least give the impression that he has\emdash before
\par rejecting it. This eliminates (C).
\par Given the human ego, we are unlikely to admit that we don\rquote t understand the subject we are writing
\par about. This eliminates (D).
\par \'93Zealous promotion\'94 is too strong; \'93promotion\'94 itself is probably too strong. This eliminates (E).

\par Directions: This passage is followed by a group of questions to be answered based on what is stated or
\par implied in the passage. Choose the best answer; the one that most accurately and completely answers the
\par question.
\par Following the Three Step Method, we preview the first sentence of each paragraph in the passage: (The
\par body of the passage will be presented later.)
\par The enigmatic opening sentence \'93Many readers, I suspect, will take the title of this article [Women,
\par Fire, and Dangerous Things] as suggesting that women, fire, and dangerous things have something in
\par common\emdash say, that women are fiery and dangerous\'94 does not give us much of a clue to what the passage is
\par about.
\par The sentence \'93The classical view that categories are based on shared properties is not entirely
\par wrong\'94 is more helpful. It tells us the passage is about categorization and that there are at least two
\par theories about it: the classical view, which has merit, and the modern view, which is apparently superior.
\par The sentence \'93Categorization is not a matter to be taken lightly\'94 merely confirms the subject of the
\par passage.
\par Although only one sentence was helpful, previewing did reveal a lot about the passage\rquote s subject
\par matter\emdash categorization. Now we read the passage, noting pivotal words, annotating, and noting likely
\par places from which any of the six questions might be drawn. After each paragraph, we will stop to analyze
\par and interpret what the author has presented:
\par 354 GRE Prep Course
\par Many readers, I suspect, will take the title of this article [Women, Fire, and Dangerous
\par Things] as suggesting that women, fire, and dangerous things have something in common\emdash say,
\par that women are fiery and dangerous. Most feminists I\rquote ve mentioned it to have loved the title for
\par that reason, though some have hated it for the same reason. But the chain of inference\emdash from
\par conjunction to categorization to commonality\emdash is the norm. The inference is based on the
\par common idea of what it means to be in the same category: things are categorized together on the
\par basis of what they have in common. The idea that categories are defined by common properties
\par is not only our everyday folk theory of what a category is, it is also the principle technical
\par theory\emdash one that has been with us for more than two thousand years.
\par In this paragraph, the author introduces the subject matter of the passage\emdash categorization. And the
\par pivotal sentence, introduced by \'93but,\'94 explains the classical theory of categorization, albeit rather obtusely.
\par Namely, like things are placed in the same category.
\par Now we consider the second paragraph:
\par The classical view that categories are based on shared properties is not entirely wrong. We
\par often do categorize things on that basis. But that is only a small part of the story. In recent
\par years it has become clear that categorization is far more complex than that. A new theory of
\par categorization, called prototype theory, has emerged. It shows that human categorization is
\par based on principles that extend far beyond those envisioned in the classical theory. One of our
\par goals is to survey the complexities of the way people really categorize. For example, the title of
\par this book was inspired by the Australian aboriginal language Dyirbal, which has a category,
\par balan, that actually includes women, fire, and dangerous things. It also includes birds that are
\par not dangerous, as well as exceptional animals, such as the platypus, bandicoot, and echidna.
\par This is not simply a matter of categorization by common properties.
\par In this paragraph, the second pivotal word\emdash but\emdash is crucial. It introduces the main idea of the
\par passage\emdash the prototype theory of categorization. Now everything that is introduced should be attributed to
\par the prototype theory, not to the classical theory. Wrong answer-choices are likely to be baited with just the
\par opposite.
\par The author states that the prototype theory goes \'93far beyond\'94 the classical theory. Although he does
\par not tell us what the prototype theory is, he does tell us that it is not merely categorization by common
\par properties.
\par Now we turn to the third paragraph:
\par Categorization is not a matter to be taken lightly. There is nothing more basic than categorization
\par to our thought, perception, action and speech. Every time we see something as a kind of
\par thing, for example, a tree, we are categorizing. Whenever we reason about kinds of things\emdash 
\par chairs, nations, illnesses, emotions, any kind of thing at all\emdash we are employing categories.
\par Whenever we intentionally perform any kind of action, say something as mundane as writing
\par with a pencil, hammering with a hammer, or ironing clothes, we are using categories. The particular
\par action we perform on that occasion is a kind of motor activity, that is, it is in a particular
\par category of motor actions. They are never done in exactly the same way, yet despite the differences
\par in particular movements, they are all movements of a kind, and we know how to make
\par movements of that kind. And any time we either produce or understand any utterance of any
\par reasonable length, we are employing dozens if not hundreds of categories: categories of speech
\par sounds, of words, of phrases and clauses, as well as conceptual categories. Without the ability
\par to categorize, we could not function at all, either in the physical world or in our social and
\par intellectual lives.
\par Though the author does not explicitly state it, this paragraph defines the theory of prototypes. Notice
\par the author likes to use an indirect, even cryptic, method of introducing or switching topics, which makes
\par this a classic GRE type passage. The GRE writers have many opportunities here to test whether you are
\par following the author\rquote s train of thought.
\par Now we attack the questions.

\par The Three Step Method 355
\par 1. The author probably chose Women, Fire,
\par and Dangerous Things as the title of the
\par article because
\par I. he thought that since the Dyirbal
\par placed all three items in the same
\par category, women, fire, and dangerous
\par things necessarily had something
\par in common.
\par II. he was hoping to draw attention to
\par the fact that because items have been
\par placed in the same category doesn\rquote t
\par mean that they necessarily have
\par anything in common
\par III. he wanted to use the Dyirbal classification

\par (E) The discovery that other cultures

\par 1. This is an extension question. The second
\par paragraph contains the information needed to
\par answer it. There the author states that women,
\par fire, and dangerous things belong to a category
\par called balan in an Australian aboriginal
\par language, which is not simply based on common
\par properties. This eliminates Statement I and
\par confirms Statement II.
\par The answer is (B).
\par 2. This is a description question, so we must find
\par the points in the passage from which the statements
\par were drawn.
\par Remember!
\par Remember, the answer to a
\par description question will not
\par directly quote a statement from the
\par passage, but it will be closely
\par related to one\emdash often a paraphrase.
\par The needed references for Statements I, II, and
\par III are all contained in the closing paragraph.
\par The answer is (E).
\par 3. This is one of the few questions that does not
\par easily fit into any of the six question types.
\par Nevertheless, our work in the arguments section
\par has prepared us for this type of question.
\par Remember!
\par Remember: to weaken an argument,
\par attack one or more of its
\par premises.
\par Now the implication of the title is that women,
\par fire, and dangerous things do not have anything
\par in common. To weaken this implication, the
\par answer should state that all things in the balan
\par category have something in common.
\par The answer is (C).

\par 4. If linguistic experts cannot perceive how
\par women, fire, and dangerous things in the
\par category balan have at least one thing in
\par common, it follows that
\par (A) there probably is something other
\par than shared properties that led to all
\par items in balan being placed in that
\par category.
\par (B) the anthropologists simply weren\rquote t
\par able to perceive what the items had in

\par (C) the anthropologists might not have

\par (D) the items do not have anything in

\par (E) the Australian aboriginal culture is
\par rather mystic.
\par 5. Which one of the following sentences
\par would best complete the last paragraph of
\par the passage?
\par (A) An understanding of how we categorize
\par is central to any understanding of
\par how we think and how we function,
\par and therefore central to an understanding
\par of what makes us human.
\par (B) The prototype theory is only the latest
\par in a series of new and improved theories
\par of categorization; undoubtedly
\par even better theories will replace it.
\par (C) The prototype theory of categories
\par has not only unified a major branch of
\par linguistics, but it has applications to
\par mathematics and physics as well.
\par (D) An understanding of how the prototype
\par theory of categorization evolved
\par from the classical theory is essential
\par to any understanding of how we think
\par and how we function in society.
\par (E) To fully understand how modern
\par Australian society functions, we must
\par study how it is influenced by aboriginal
\par culture\emdash most specifically how
\par aborigines organize and classify their
\par surroundings.
\par 4. This is an extension question; we are asked to
\par draw a conclusion based on the passage.
\par Hint!
\par The thrust of the passage is that commonality
\par is not the only way to categorize
\par things.
\par The answer is (A).
\par 5. This is an application question; we are asked
\par to complete a thought for the author.
\par Most of the third paragraph is introducing
\par the prototype theory of categorization. But in the
\par last sentence the author changes direction
\par somewhat\emdash without any notice, as is typical of
\par his style. Now he is discussing the importance of
\par the ability to categorize. The clause \'93Without
\par the ability to categorize, we could not function at
\par all\'94 indicates that this ability is fundamental to
\par our very being.
\par Watch out!
\par Be careful not to choose (D).
\par Although it is probably true, it is too
\par specific: in the final sentence the
\par author is discussing categorization in
\par general.
\par The answer is (A).

\par Global strategies to control infectious
\par disease have historically included the erection of
\par barriers to international travel and immigration.
\par Keeping people with infectious diseases outside
\par national borders has reemerged as an important 5
\par public health policy in the human immunodeficiency
\par virus (HIV) epidemic. Between 29 and
\par 50 countries are reported to have introduced
\par border restrictions on HIV-positive foreigners,
\par usually those planning an extended stay in the 10
\par country, such as students, workers, or seamen.
\par Travel restrictions have been established
\par primarily by countries in the western Pacific and
\par Mediterranean regions, where HIV seroprevalence
\par is relatively low. However, the country 15
\par with the broadest policy of testing and excluding
\par foreigners is the United States. From December
\par 1, 1987, when HIV infection was first classified
\par in the United States as a contagious disease,
\par through September 30, 1989, more than 3 20
\par million people seeking permanent residence in
\par this country were tested for HIV antibodies. The
\par U.S. policy has been sharply criticized by
\par national and international organizations as being
\par contrary to public health goals and human-rights 25
\par principles. Many of these organizations are boycotting
\par international meetings in the United
\par States that are vital for the study of prevention,
\par education, and treatment of HIV infection.
\par The Immigration and Nationality Act 30
\par requires the Public Health Service to list
\par \'93dangerous contagious diseases\'94 for which
\par aliens can be excluded from the United States.
\par By 1987 there were seven designated diseases\emdash 
\par five of them sexually transmitted (chancroid, 35
\par gonorrhea, granuloma inguinale, lymphog-ranuloma
\par venereum, and infectious syphilis) and two
\par non-venereal (active tuberculosis and infectious
\par leprosy). On June 8, 1987, in response to a
\par Congressional direction in the Helms 40
\par Amendment, the Public Health Service added
\par HIV infection to the list of dangerous contagious
\par diseases.
\par A just and efficacious travel and immigration
\par policy would not exclude people because of 45
\par their serologic status unless they posed a danger
\par to the community through casual transmission.
\par U.S. regulations should list only active tuberculosis
\par as a contagious infectious disease. We
\par support well-funded programs to protect the 50
\par health of travelers infected with HIV through
\par appropriate immunizations and prophylactic
\par treatment and to reduce behaviors that may
\par transmit infection.
\par We recognize that treating patients infected 55
\par with HIV who immigrate to the United States
\par will incur costs for the public sector. It is
\par inequitable, however, to use cost as a reason to
\par exclude people infected with HIV, for there are
\par no similar exclusionary policies for those with 60
\par other costly chronic diseases, such as heart
\par disease or cancer.
\par Rather than arbitrarily restrict the movement
\par of a subgroup of infected people, we must
\par dedicate ourselves to the principles of justice, 65
\par scientific cooperation, and a global response to
\par the HIV pandemic.
\par 1. According to the passage, countries in the western
\par Pacific have
\par (A) a very high frequency of HIV-positive immigrants
\par and have a greater reason to be concerned
\par over this issue than other countries.
\par (B) opposed efforts on the part of Mediterranean
\par states to establish travel restrictions on HIVpositive
\par residents.
\par (C) a low HIV seroprevalence and, in tandem
\par with Mediterranean regions, have established
\par travel restrictions on HIV-positive foreigners.
\par (D) continued to obstruct efforts to unify policy
\par concerning immigrant screening.
\par (E) joined with the United States in sharing
\par information about HIV-positive individuals.

\par 2. The authors of the passage conclude that
\par (A) it is unjust to exclude people based on
\par their serological status without the knowledge
\par that they pose a danger to the public.
\par (B) U.S. regulations should require more
\par stringent testing to be implemented at all
\par major border crossings.
\par (C) it is the responsibility of the public sector
\par to absorb costs incurred by treatment of
\par immigrants infected with HIV.
\par (D) the HIV pandemic is largely overstated
\par and that, based on new epidemiological
\par data, screening immigrants is not
\par indicated.
\par (E) only the non-venereal diseases active
\par tuberculosis and infectious leprosy should
\par be listed as dangerous and contagious
\par diseases.
\par 3. It can be inferred from the passage that
\par (A) more than 3 million HIV-positive
\par people have sought permanent
\par residence in the United States.
\par (B) countries with a low seroprevalence
\par of HIV have a disproportionate and

\par of AIDS by immigration.
\par (C) the United States is more concerned
\par with controlling the number of HIVpositive
\par immigrants than with
\par avoiding criticism from outside its

\par (D) current law is meeting the demand
\par for prudent handling of a potentially
\par hazardous international issue.
\par (E) actions by countries in the western
\par Pacific and Mediterranean regions to
\par restrict travel are ineffective.
\par 4. Before the Helms Amendment in 1987,
\par seven designated diseases were listed as
\par being cause for denying immigration. We
\par can conclude from the passage that
\par (A) the authors agree fully with this

\par Answers and Solutions to Exercise
\par Previewing the first sentence of each paragraph shows that the passage is about restricting travel of HIVpositive
\par persons and that the authors feel there should be no restrictions. There are two pivotal words:
\par \'93however\'94 (line 15), and \'93Rather than\'94 (line 63), which introduces the concluding paragraph.
\par 1. This is a description question, so we must
\par find the point in the passage from which the
\par question is drawn. It is the opening sentence to
\par paragraph two. There it is stated that countries in
\par the western Pacific and Mediterranean regions
\par have a low incidence of HIV infection and have
\par introduced border restrictions. The answer,
\par therefore, is (C).
\par 2. This is another description question. The
\par answer is (A). This is directly supported by the
\par opening sentence of paragraph four. Note that
\par (A) is a paraphrase of that sentence.
\par Be careful with (C). Although this is hinted
\par at in paragraph five, it is never directly stated
\par that the public sector is responsible for these
\par costs, only that it would in fact pick up these
\par costs. Remember: A description question must
\par be answered from what is directly stated in the
\par passage, not from what it implies.
\par 3. This is an extension question. Lines 22\endash 24
\par state \'93U.S. policy has been sharply criticized by
\par national and international organizations.\'94
\par Given that this criticism has not caused the
\par United States to change its policies, it must be
\par more concerned with controlling the number of
\par HIV-positive immigrants than with avoiding
\par criticism. The answer, therefore, is (C).
\par Don\rquote t be tempted by (A); it\rquote s a same
\par language trap. Every word in it is taken from the
\par passage. However, the passage states that over 3
\par million people were tested for HIV antibodies
\par (lines 20\endash 22), not that they were tested
\par \'93positive\'94 for HIV antibodies.
\par 4. This is another extension question. In lines
\par 48\endash 49, the authors state that only active tuberculosis
\par should be listed as a dangerous contagious
\par disease. We expect that they would oppose
\par adding HIV to the list. The answer is (C).
\par 5. Although governments have ostensibly
\par restricted the immigration of HIV-positive
\par persons out of fear that they may spread the
\par disease, the authors apparently are referring to
\par financial costs, not costs to public health. This is
\par indicated by lines 57\endash 62, where they describe
\par heart disease and cancer as non-contagious and
\par costly, yet still admissible. The answer,
\par therefore, is (A).

\par Most students arrive at [college] using \'93discrete,
\par concrete, and absolute categories to understand
\par people, knowledge, and values.\'94 These students live
\par with a dualistic view, seeing \'93the world in polar terms
\par of we-right-good vs. other-wrong-bad.\'94 These 5
\par students cannot acknowledge the existence of more
\par than one point of view toward any issue. There is one
\par \'93right\'94 way. And because these absolutes are
\par assumed by or imposed on the individual from external
\par authority, they cannot be personally substantiated 10
\par or authenticated by experience. These students are
\par slaves to the generalizations of their authorities. An
\par eye for an eye! Capital punishment is apt justice for
\par murder. The Bible says so.
\par Most students break through the dualistic stage 15
\par to another equally frustrating stage\emdash multiplicity.
\par Within this stage, students see a variety of ways to
\par deal with any given topic or problem. However,
\par while these students accept multiple points of view,
\par they are unable to evaluate or justify them. To have 20
\par an opinion is everyone\rquote s right. While students in the
\par dualistic stage are unable to produce evidence to support
\par what they consider to be self-evident absolutes,
\par students in the multiplistic stage are unable to connect
\par instances into coherent generalizations. Every asser- 25
\par tion, every point, is valid. In their democracy they are
\par directionless. Capital punishment? What sense is
\par there in answering one murder with another?
\par The third stage of development finds students
\par living in a world of relativism. Knowledge is rela- 30
\par tive: right and wrong depend on the context. No
\par longer recognizing the validity of each individual idea
\par or action, relativists examine everything to find its
\par place in an overall framework. While the multiplist
\par views the world as unconnected, almost random, the 35
\par relativist seeks always to place phenomena into
\par coherent larger patterns. Students in this stage view
\par the world analytically. They appreciate authority for
\par its expertise, using it to defend their own generalizations.
\par In addition, they accept or reject ostensible 40
\par authority after systematically evaluating its validity.
\par In this stage, however, students resist decision
\par making. Suffering the ambivalence of finding several
\par consistent and acceptable alternatives, they are almost
\par overwhelmed by diversity and need means for manag- 45
\par ing it. Capital punishment is appropriate justice\emdash in
\par some instances.
\par In the final stage students manage diversity
\par through individual commitment. Students do not deny
\par relativism. Rather they assert an identity by forming 50
\par commitments and assuming responsibility for them.
\par They gather personal experience into a coherent
\par framework, abstract principles to guide their actions,
\par and use these principles to discipline and govern their
\par thoughts and actions. The individual has chosen to 55
\par join a particular community and agrees to live by its
\par tenets. The accused has had the benefit of due
\par process to guard his civil rights, a jury of peers has
\par found him guilty, and the state has the right to end his
\par life. This is a principle my community and I endorse. 60

\par 4. In paragraph two, the author states that in their
\par \'93democracy\'94 students in the multiplicity stage
\par are directionless. The writer describes multiplicity

\par Extra Reading 363
\par A growing taste for shark steaks and shark-fin soup
\par has for the first time in 400 million years put the
\par scourge of the sea at the wrong end of the food
\par chain. Commercial landings of this toothsome fish
\par have doubled every year since 1986, and shark popu- 5
\par lations are plunging. It is hardly a case of good riddance.
\par Sharks do for gentler fish what lions do for
\par the wildebeest: they check populations by feeding on
\par the weak. Also, sharks apparently do not get cancer
\par and may therefore harbor clues to the nature of that 10
\par disease.
\par Finally, there is the issue of motherhood.
\par Sharks are viviparous. That is, they bear their young
\par alive and swimming (not sealed in eggs) after gestation
\par periods lasting from nine months to two years. 15
\par Shark mothers generally give birth to litters of from
\par eight to twelve pups and bear only one litter every
\par other year.
\par This is why sharks have one of the lowest
\par fecundity rates in the ocean. The female cod, for 20
\par example, spawns annually and lays a few million
\par eggs at a time. If three quarters of the cod were to be
\par fished this year, they could be back in full force in a
\par few years. But if humans took that big of a bite out
\par of the sharks, the population would not recover for 25
\par 15 years.
\par So, late this summer, if all goes according to
\par plan, the shark will join the bald eagle and the
\par buffalo on the list of managed species. The federal
\par government will cap the U.S. commercial catch at 30
\par 5,800 metric tons, about half of the 1989 level, and
\par limit sportsmen to two sharks per boat. Another
\par provision discourages finning, the harvesting of
\par shark fins alone, by limiting the weight of fins to 7
\par percent of that of all the carcasses. 35
\par Finning got under the skin of environmentalists,
\par and the resulting anger helped to mobilize support
\par for the new regulations. Finning itself is a fairly
\par recent innovation. Shark fins contain noodle-like
\par cartilaginous tissues that Chinese chefs have tradi- 40
\par tionally used to thicken and flavor soup. Over the
\par past few years rising demand in Hong Kong has
\par made the fins as valuable as the rest of the fish.
\par Long strands are prized, so unusually large fins can
\par be worth considerably more to the fisherman than 45
\par the average price of about $10 a pound.
\par But can U.S. quotas save shark species that
\par wander the whole Atlantic? The blue shark, for
\par example, migrates into the waters of something like
\par 23 countries. John G. Casey, a biologist with the 50
\par National Marine Fisheries Service Research Center
\par in Narragansett, R.I., admits that international coordination
\par will eventually be necessary. But he
\par supports U.S. quotas as a first step in mobilizing
\par other nations. Meanwhile the commercial fishermen 55
\par are not waiting for the new rules to take effect.
\par \'93There\rquote s a pre-quota rush on sharks,\'94 Casey says,
\par \'93and it\rquote s going on as we speak.\'94

\par (C) sharks are quickly becoming fewer in
\par number.
\par (D) sharks are now as scarce as bald eagles

\par (E) sharks are scavengers and therefore

\par \'93A writer\rquote s job is to tell the truth,\'94 said
\par Hemingway in 1942. No other writer of our time had
\par so fiercely asserted, so pugnaciously defended or so
\par consistently exemplified the writer\rquote s obligation to
\par speak truly. His standard of truth-telling remained, 5
\par moreover, so high and so rigorous that he was ordinarily
\par unwilling to admit secondary evidence, whether literary
\par evidence or evidence picked up from other
\par sources than his own experience. \'93I only know what I
\par have seen,\'94 was a statement which came often to his 10
\par lips and pen. What he had personally done, or what he
\par knew unforgettably by having gone through one version
\par of it, was what he was interested in telling about.
\par This is not to say that he refused to invent freely. But
\par he always made it a sacrosanct point to invent in terms 15
\par of what he actually knew from having been there.
\par The primary intent of his writing, from first to
\par last, was to seize and project for the reader what he
\par often called \'93the way it was.\'94 This is a characteristically
\par simple phrase for a concept of extraordinary 20
\par complexity, and Hemingway\rquote s conception of its meaning
\par subtly changed several times in the course of his
\par career\emdash always in the direction of greater complexity.
\par At the core of the concept, however, one can invariably
\par discern the operation of three aesthetic instruments: the 25
\par sense of place, the sense of fact, and the sense of scene.
\par The first of these, obviously a strong passion with
\par Hemingway, is the sense of place. \'93Unless you have
\par geography, background,\'94 he once told George Antheil,
\par \'93you have nothing.\'94 You have, that is to say, a dra- 30
\par matic vacuum. Few writers have been more place-conscious.
\par Few have so carefully charted out the geographical
\par ground work of their novels while managing
\par to keep background so conspicuously unobtrusive.
\par Few, accordingly, have been able to record more eco- 35
\par nomically and graphically the way it is when you walk
\par through the streets of Paris in search of breakfast at a
\par corner caf\'e9 . . . Or when, at around six o\rquote clock of a
\par Spanish dawn, you watch the bulls running from the
\par corrals at the Puerta Rochapea through the streets of 40
\par Pamplona towards the bullring.
\par \'93When I woke it was the sound of the
\par rocket exploding that announced the release of
\par the bulls from the corrals at the edge of town. 45
\par Down below the narrow street was empty. All
\par the balconies were crowded with people.
\par Suddenly a crowd came down the street. They
\par were all running, packed close together. They
\par passed along and up the street toward the bull- 50
\par ring and behind them came more men running
\par faster, and then some stragglers who were really
\par running. Behind them was a little bare space,
\par and then the bulls, galloping, tossing their heads
\par up and down. It all went out of sight around the 55
\par corner. One man fell, rolled to the gutter, and
\par lay quiet. But the bulls went right on and did
\par not notice him. They were all running together.\'94
\par This landscape is as morning-fresh as a design in 60
\par India ink on clean white paper. First is the bare white
\par street, seen from above, quiet and empty. Then one
\par sees the first packed clot of runners. Behind these are
\par the thinner ranks of those who move faster because
\par they are closer to the bulls. Then the almost comic 65
\par stragglers, who are \'93really running.\'94 Brilliantly behind
\par these shines the \'93little bare space,\'94 a desperate margin
\par for error. Then the clot of running bulls\emdash closing the
\par design, except of course for the man in the gutter making
\par himself, like the designer\rquote s initials, as inconspicu- 70
\par ous as possible.
\par 14. According to the author, Hemingway\rquote s primary
\par purpose in telling a story was
\par (A) to construct a well-told story that the
\par reader would thoroughly enjoy.
\par (B) to construct a story that would reflect
\par truths that were not particular to a
\par specific historical period.
\par (C) to begin from reality but to allow his
\par imagination to roam from \'93the way it
\par was\'94 to \'93the way it might have been.\'94
\par (D) to report faithfully reality as Hemingway
\par had experienced it.
\par (E) to go beyond the truth, to \'93create\'94 reality.
\par 366 GRE Prep Course
\par 15. From the author\rquote s comments and the example of
\par the bulls (paragraph 4), what was the most likely
\par reason for which Hemingway took care to include
\par details of place?
\par (A) He felt that geography in some way illuminated
\par other, more important events.
\par (B) He thought readers generally did not have
\par enough imagination to visualize the scenes
\par for themselves.
\par (C) He had no other recourse since he was
\par avoiding the use of other literary sources.
\par (D) He thought that landscapes were more
\par important than characters to convey \'93the
\par way it was.\'94
\par (E) He felt that without background information
\par the readers would be unable to follow
\par the story.
\par 16. One might infer from the passage that
\par Hemingway preferred which one of the following
\par sources for his novels and short stories?
\par (A) Stories that he had heard from friends or
\par chance acquaintances
\par (B) Stories that he had read about in newspapers
\par or other secondary sources
\par (C) Stories that came to him in periods of meditation
\par or in dreams
\par (D) Stories that he had lived rather than read
\par about
\par (E) Stories adapted from myths
\par 17. It has been suggested that part of Hemingway\rquote s
\par genius lies in the way in which he removes
\par himself from his stories in order to let readers
\par experience the stories for themselves. Which of
\par the following elements of the passage support this
\par suggestion?
\par I. The comparison of \'93the designer\rquote s initials\'94
\par to the man who fell and lay in the gutter
\par (lines 61\endash 62) during the running of the
\par bulls
\par II. Hemingway\rquote s stated intent to project for
\par the reader \'93the way it was\'94 (line 21)
\par III. Hemingway\rquote s ability to invent fascinating
\par tales from his own experience
\par (A) I only
\par (B) II only
\par (C) I and II only
\par (D) I and III only
\par (E) I, II, and III
\par 18. From the passage, one can assume that which of
\par the following statements would best describe
\par Hemingway\rquote s attitude toward knowledge?
\par (A) One can learn about life only by living it
\par fully.
\par (B) A wise person will read widely in order to
\par learn about life.
\par (C) Knowledge is a powerful tool that should
\par be reserved only for those who know how
\par to use it.
\par (D) Experience is a poor teacher.
\par (E) One can never truly \'93know\'94 anything.
\par 19. The author calls \'93the way it was\'94 a
\par \'93characteristically simple phrase for a concept of
\par extraordinary complexity\'94 (lines 21\endash 23) because
\par (A) the phrase reflects Hemingway\rquote s talent for
\par obscuring ordinary events.
\par (B) the relationship between simplicity and
\par complexity reflected the relationship
\par between the style and content of
\par Hemingway\rquote s writing.
\par (C) Hemingway became increasingly
\par confused about \'93the way it was\'94 throughout
\par the course of his career.
\par (D) Hemingway\rquote s obsession for geographic
\par details progressively overshadowed the
\par dramatic element of his stories.
\par (E) it typifies how Hemingway understated
\par complex issues.

\par Imagine that we stand on any ordinary seaside pier,
\par and watch the waves rolling in and striking against the
\par iron columns of the pier. Large waves pay very little
\par attention to the columns\emdash they divide right and left and
\par re-unite after passing each column, much as a regiment of 5
\par soldiers would if a tree stood in their way; it is almost as
\par though the columns had not been there. But the short
\par waves and ripples find the columns of the pier a much
\par more formidable obstacle. When the short waves
\par impinge on the columns, they are reflected back and 10
\par spread as new ripples in all directions. To use the technical
\par term, they are \'93scattered.\'94 The obstacle provided by
\par the iron columns hardly affects the long waves at all, but
\par scatters the short ripples.
\par We have been watching a working model of the way 15
\par in which sunlight struggles through the earth\rquote s atmosphere.
\par Between us on earth and outer space the atmosphere
\par interposes innumerable obstacles in the form of
\par molecules of air, tiny droplets of water, and small particles
\par of dust. They are represented by the columns of the 20
\par pier.
\par The waves of the sea represent the sunlight. We
\par know that sunlight is a blend of lights of many colors\emdash as
\par we can prove for ourselves by passing it through a prism,
\par or even through a jug of water, or as Nature demonstrates 25
\par to us when she passes it through the raindrops of a summer
\par shower and produces a rainbow. We also know that
\par light consists of waves, and that the different colors of
\par light are produced by waves of different lengths, red light
\par by long waves and blue light by short waves. The mix- 30
\par ture of waves which constitutes sunlight has to struggle
\par through the obstacles it meets in the atmosphere, just as
\par the mixture of waves at the seaside has to struggle past
\par the columns of the pier. And these obstacles treat the
\par light waves much as the columns of the pier treat the sea- 35
\par waves. The long waves which constitute red light are
\par hardly affected, but the short waves which constitute blue
\par light are scattered in all directions.
\par Thus, the different constituents of sunlight are
\par treated in different ways as they struggle through the 40
\par earth\rquote s atmosphere. A wave of blue light may be scattered
\par by a dust particle, and turned out of its course.
\par After a time a second dust particle again turns it out of its
\par course, and so on, until finally it enters our eyes by a path
\par as zigzag as that of a flash of lightning. Consequently, 45
\par the blue waves of the sunlight enter our eyes from all
\par directions. And that is why the sky looks blue.
\par 20. We know from experience that if we look directly
\par at the sun, we will see red light near the sun. This
\par observation is supported by the passage for which
\par one of the following reasons?
\par (A) It seems reasonable to assume that red light
\par would surround the sun because the sun is
\par basically a large fireball.
\par (B) It seems reasonable to assume that the other
\par colors of light would either cancel each
\par other or combine to produce red.
\par (C) It seems reasonable to assume that red light
\par would not be disturbed by the atmospheric
\par particles and would consequently reach us
\par by a relatively direct path from the sun to
\par our eyes.
\par (D) It is not supported by the passage. The
\par author does not say what color of light
\par should be near the sun, and he provides no
\par reasons that would allow us to assume that
\par the light would be red.
\par (E) Gazing directly at the sun forces the eye to
\par focus on the longer red waves.
\par 21. Scientists have observed that shorter wavelength
\par light has more energy than longer wavelength
\par light. From this we can conclude that
\par (A) red light will exert more energy when it hits
\par the surface of the earth than will blue light.
\par (B) lightning is caused by the collision of blue
\par light with particles in the air.
\par (C) red light will travel faster than blue light.
\par (D) blue light has more energy than red light.
\par (E) blue light has less energy than red light.

\par 22. A scientist makes new observations and learns
\par that water waves of shorter wavelengths spread
\par in all directions not only because they scatter off
\par piers but also because they interact with previously
\par scattered short water waves. Drawing
\par upon the analogy between water waves and light
\par waves, we might hypothesize which of the
\par following?
\par (A) Blue light waves act like ripples that other
\par blue light waves meet and scatter from.
\par (B) Red light waves will be scattered by blue
\par light waves like incoming long water
\par waves are scattered by outgoing ripples.
\par (C) Red light waves can scatter blue light
\par waves, but blue light waves cannot scatter
\par red.
\par (D) The analogy between water and light
\par waves cannot be extended to include the
\par way in which short water waves become
\par ripples and scatter one another.
\par (E) The scattering effect of blue light waves is
\par canceled by that of red.
\par 23. Which one of the following is a reason for
\par assuming that sunlight is constituted of waves of
\par many colors?
\par (A) The mixture of waves that make up
\par sunlight has to struggle through a variety
\par of obstacles in the atmosphere.
\par (B) When passing through water in the atmosphere,
\par sunlight is sometimes broken
\par down into an array of colors.
\par (C) Many different wavelengths of light enter
\par our eyes from all directions.
\par (D) The mere fact that light waves can be
\par scattered is a reason for assuming that
\par sunlight is constituted of waves of
\par different colors.
\par (E) When passing through dust in the atmosphere,
\par sunlight is sometimes broken
\par down into an array of colors.
\par 24. From the information presented in the passage,
\par what can we conclude about the color of the sky
\par on a day with a large quantity of dust in the air?
\par (A) The sky would be even bluer
\par (B) The sky would be redder
\par (C) The sky would not change colors
\par (D) We do not have enough information to

\par the information presented in the passage, this
\par phenomenon would seem to be explained by
\par which of the following?
\par I. Light meets more obstacles when passing
\par parallel to the earth\rquote s surface than when

\par even red light is diffused.
\par II. The blue light may not make it through

\par Questions 1\endash 7
\par Before we turn to the answers, three pivotal words in the first passage should be noted: \'93However\'94 (line 18),
\par \'93however\'94 (line 42), and \'93Rather\'94 (line 50).
\par 1. This is an extension question. Statement I is
\par true. This is the essential characteristic of dualistic
\par (right/wrong) thinkers (lines 3\endash 8). This eliminates (B)
\par and (C). Statement II is false. Dualistic thinkers grant
\par authority (right thinking) to adults and adult figures.
\par This is clear from the sentence, \'93These students are
\par slaves to the generalizations of their authorities.\'94
\par This eliminates (D). Unfortunately, we have to check
\par Statement III. It is true since Dualistic thinkers
\par believe their group is right and the other group is
\par wrong. (Again, see lines 3\endash 8.) The answer, therefore,
\par is (E).
\par 2. This is another extension question. Dualistic
\par thinkers probably cannot give cogent arguments for
\par their beliefs since they have adopted them unquestioningly
\par from authority figures; dualistic thinkers do not
\par know (have never thought of) the reasons for which
\par their beliefs are right or wrong. Hence the answer is
\par (B).
\par 3. This is a description question. (A) is false. After
\par carefully thinking through their reasons, committed
\par thinkers are reasonably sure of their position. (B) is
\par also false. Relativistic thinkers make sense of the
\par world, but they have not chosen their position; indeed
\par they cannot even choose a position. (C) is true.
\par Multiplicity thinkers see the world as randomly organized;
\par they can\rquote t see the relationships that connect different
\par positions. (See the first pivotal word,
\par \'93however\'94 [line 18].)
\par 4. This is an extension question. Multiplicity students
\par view all opinions as equally valid. They have
\par yet to learn how to rank opinions (truths)\emdash all votes
\par (thoughts) count equally. The answer is (B).
\par Note, (C) is offered to humor Republicans. The
\par test-makers sometimes run out of tempting wrong
\par choices. Don\rquote t dwell on such humorous nonsense.
\par 5. This is another description question. (A): No,
\par these are the Multiplists.
\par (B): No, Dualists think this way.
\par (C): No, this describes Relativists. Don\rquote t confuse (A)
\par and (C). Multiplists acknowledge no right or wrong;
\par whereas Relativists acknowledge a morality, but one
\par that is context dependent.
\par (D): No, Committed thinkers fit this description rather
\par nicely. Hence, by process of elimination, we have
\par learned the answer is (E).
\par 6. This is an application question. Since all the students
\par showed how the characters exemplified the same
\par concept of \'93tragedy,\'94 they must be working from a
\par common definition of tragedy (the traditional one).
\par They have accepted \'93authority\rquote s\'94 definition of tragedy
\par and have shown how each character fits it. It never
\par occurred to them that there may be other ways to view
\par a tragedy. Hence they are all dualistic thinkers. The
\par answer is (B).
\par 7. This is a writing technique question. In each
\par paragraph the author shows how a stage of thought
\par evolved from a previous stage\emdash except the dualistic
\par stage, which starts the analysis. Further, the thought
\par process in each stage is illustrated by how it views
\par capital punishment. Hence the answer is (E).
\par Be careful not to choose (D). Although dualistic
\par thinking certainly is simplistic and provincial, and
\par committed thinking seems to be considered and cosmopolitan,
\par neither of these judgments is stated nor
\par implied by the passage.

\par 8. This is a description question. Paragraph 3 contains
\par the information needed to answer it. There it is
\par stated that the cod population can replenish itself in a
\par few years, but the shark population would take 15
\par years. Hence the answer is (B).
\par Don\rquote t make the mistake of choosing (C).
\par Although it is certainly supported by the passage, it
\par does not state how this relates to cod\emdash they too may
\par be decreasing in number. (C) uses the true-but-irrelevant
\par ploy.
\par 9. This is a description question. Statement I is
\par true. It is supported by the analogy drawn between
\par lions and sharks (lines 7\endash 9). This eliminates (A) and
\par (B). Statement II is false. It is too strong an inference
\par to draw from the information in lines 9\endash 11. If sharks
\par were on the verge of extinction, this \'93could hamper\'94
\par research. But given that the author does not claim or
\par imply that sharks are near extinction, \'93would hamper\'94
\par is too strong. Besides, the author does not state that
\par sharks are being used in research, just that they may be
\par useful in that regard. This eliminates (D) and (E).
\par Hence, by process of elimination, we have learned the
\par answer is (C).
\par 10. This is an application question; we are asked to
\par apply what we have learned in the passage to a hypothetical
\par situation. A review of the passage shows that
\par only (B) and (E) have any real merit. But sharks have
\par survived for 400 million years with an extremely low
\par fecundity rate. This eliminates (B). Hence the answer
\par is (E).
\par 11. This is a rather easy tone question. The passage
\par has a matter-of-fact or journalistic tone to it. So the
\par answer is (B).
\par 12. This is an extension question. Statement I is
\par incorrect. Like Statement II in Question 9, it overstates
\par the case. Statement II is correct. We know
\par from lines 48\endash 50 that some species of sharks migrate
\par into the waters of over 20 countries. U.S. quotas alone
\par cannot \'93protect\'94 these sharks, even if the quotas
\par reduce the rate of killing in U.S. waters. Statement III
\par is incorrect. The environmentalists are angry at the
\par finning fishermen who are over-fishing the waters,
\par there is nothing in the passage to suggest that this
\par anger is also directed towards the chefs. The answer is
\par (B).
\par 13. By announcing the impending classification, the
\par federal government ironically encourages fishermen to
\par kill as many sharks as they can before the regulations
\par go into effect\emdash stimulating the opposite of what was
\par intended, i.e., the saving of sharks. The answer is (D).
\par Questions 14\endash 19
\par 14. This is a description question. (A) is false. The
\par enjoyment of the reader was incidental to
\par Hemingway\rquote s primary purpose\emdash truth-telling. (B) is
\par false, though very tempting. The first half of this item
\par \'93to construct a story that would reflect truths\'94 looks
\par very good. The second half, however, spoils it by
\par adding the qualifier \'93not particular to a specific
\par historical period.\'94 Reviewing the passage reveals no
\par indication that Hemingway is trying to create any kind
\par of \'93general truth.\'94 In fact, one can argue that
\par Hemingway\rquote s emphasis on developing a strong \'93sense
\par of place\'94 (lines 27\endash 31), and his belief that when trying
\par to tell the truth \'93I only know what I have seen\'94 (lines
\par 9\endash 10) support the inference that Hemingway sees truth
\par as subjective, not objective. (C) is also false. The
\par passage gives no indication that Hemingway was
\par interested in the way things \'93might have been.\'94 (D) is
\par true. This is clearly the author\rquote s interpretation of
\par Hemingway\rquote s purpose. Look at the first few sentences
\par of both the first and the second paragraphs. Notice
\par that this question item emphasizes subjective truth, or
\par the truth \'93as Hemingway had experienced it.\'94
\par Strategy: In this question, you have two
\par choices\emdash (B) and (D)\emdash which at first glance seem
\par very close. Let\rquote s assume you don\rquote t understand exactly
\par why a \'93close second\'94 is wrong. When confronted
\par with this situation, it\rquote s a good idea to take a few seconds
\par and try to get into the Question-Writer\rquote s mindset.
\par What are you missing that the Question-Writer thinks
\par is an important point in this passage? In this case, the
\par Question-Writer is focusing on the subtle point that
\par Hemingway sees his perspective as \'93subjective,\'94 that
\par certain things, true in some places or to some people,
\par may not be true in other places or to other people. In
\par other words, there is no \'93objective reality.\'94
\par If intuition is the only way to distinguish
\par between the two close choices, then you should
\par mark them in your test booklet as close, perhaps like
\par this
\par (B)
\par (C)
\par (D)
\par , to show that you had to choose
\par between them, and move on. If you have trouble with
\par later questions on the same passage, you may want to
\par go back, analyze the passage, and determine the real
\par difference between the earlier \'93close pair.\'94 The
\par Question-Writer may be testing the same question
\par from a different angle, in which case time is well spent
\par pondering the issue.

\par 15. This is an extension question. In lines 28\endash 30,

\par In lines 32\endash 34, the author refers to the
\par \'93geographical groundwork\'94 of Hemingway\rquote s novels.
\par Both of these statements imply that details of place set

\par are quite important to Hemingway. In fact, \'93first\'94 in
\par the opening to paragraph 3 almost indicates that details
\par of place are the most important aspect of his writing.
\par Looking closely, however, we see that the passage
\par gives no indication of Hemingway\rquote s perspective on
\par characters. So no comparison can be made.
\par 16. Hemingway\rquote s primary intent was to project for
\par the reader \'93the way it was,\'94 as seen through his eyes.
\par The answer is (D).
\par 17. This is an extension question. Statement I is
\par true. The last line of the passage states that the
\par designer\rquote s initials (i.e., the writer\rquote s presence) are made
\par as inconspicuous as possible. Statement II is also true.
\par Readers cannot see \'93the way it was\'94 if they are looking
\par through another medium (the author). Hemingway
\par appears to say, in effect: \'93I\rquote m striving to report
\par exactly what happened (and not my opinions about it).
\par The readers must draw their own conclusions.\'94
\par Statement III is false. In fact, a good case could be
\par made that writing only from personal experience
\par would tend to increase, not decrease, the presence of
\par the writer in his writings. The answer is (C).
\par 18. This is an application question; we are asked to
\par put ourselves in Hemingway\rquote s mind. From
\par Hemingway\rquote s statement \'93I only know what I have
\par seen\'94 and from the author\rquote s assertion that Hemingway
\par refused to honor secondary sources, we can infer that
\par he believed one can \'93know\'94 only through experience.
\par Hence the answer is (A).
\par 19. This is an extension question. The answer is (B).
\par There is a great parallel here. Phrase (in the passage)
\par corresponds to style (in the answer-choice), and concept
\par corresponds to content.
\par Questions 20\endash 26
\par 20. This is an extension question. According to the
\par passage, red light would not be significantly deflected
\par and consequently would pass through a relatively
\par direct route from the sun to our eyes. Hence the
\par answer is (C).
\par 21. This is another extension question. Since the
\par passage is a science selection, we should expect a lot
\par of extension questions. (A): No, if anything, blue light
\par would exert more energy.
\par (B): No. We can not infer this. The collision of blue
\par light with particles in the air is the reason for a blue
\par sky, not for lightning.
\par (C): No. Speed of light is not mentioned in the
\par passage.
\par (D): Yes. Blue light has a shorter wavelength, consequently
\par it has more energy than red light.
\par 22. This is an application question since it introduces
\par new information about water waves and asks us to
\par conclude how the behavior of light waves might be
\par similarly affected. Given this information, however,
\par we can justify no conclusion about whether light
\par waves imitate water waves in this new regard. The
\par analogy might hold or it might break down. We don\rquote t
\par yet know. (To find out we would have to do an experiment
\par using light.) The answer is (D).
\par 23. (A): No. We do not know anything about a
\par \'93variety\'94 of obstacles; even if we did, we would have
\par no reason to assume that light is constituted of different
\par colors.
\par (B): Yes. See lines 22\endash 27. Rainbows occur because
\par light is constituted of many colors. (C): No. This is a
\par distortion of lines 45\endash 47, and it sounds illogical to
\par boot.
\par (D): No. This gives no reason to assume that light is
\par constituted of many colors.
\par (E): No. Water vapor in the atmosphere causes rainbows,
\par not dust.
\par 24. (A): No. Although dust is mentioned as one of
\par the three important obstacles (lines 18\endash 20), we simply
\par do not have enough information to conclude how dust
\par density would change sky color.
\par (B): No. While this idea may fit with the common lore
\par that a lot of dust in the air creates great, red sunsets,
\par the passage itself gives no basis to any conclusion
\par regarding color change.
\par (C): No. Same reason as in (A) and (B). (D): Yes.
\par There is not enough information in the passage to
\par determine a relationship between color change and
\par 372 GRE Prep Course
\par dust density. The dust may give off a certain color of
\par its own\emdash we can\rquote t say for certain.
\par 25. Statement I is true. There are obviously more
\par particles on a horizontal than a vertical path. The
\par glowing red sky is reasonable evidence for some diffusion.
\par Note that Question 24 asks \'93what can we conclude\'94
\par while this question asks what seems plausible
\par (what \'93would seem to be explained\'94). So, while we
\par are attempting to make very similar inferences in both
\par questions, what we can do with the data depends,
\par among other things, on the degree of certainty
\par requested. Statement II is true. The path of evening
\par light probably has a greater average density, since it
\par spends more time passing through a zone of thicker
\par atmosphere. It is reasonable to assume this significantly
\par greater density, or the absolute number of particles,
\par might present an obstacle to blue light.
\par Statement III is false. There are two things wrong
\par with this answer: (1) red light waves are not short, relative
\par to blue; (2) we do not know that waves with
\par more energy will more readily pass through obstacles.
\par The passage, in fact, implies just the opposite. The
\par answer is (C).
\par 26. (A): No. Water waves offer only a model for
\par light waves. As a model, they are identical in some
\par ways but not in others.
\par (B): No. This is not implied by the passage. What
\par they have in common is the way they act when they
\par impinge on obstacles.
\par (C): No. Waves of water are used as a model because
\par they have much in common with waves of light.
\par (D): Yes. See explanation for (A).

\par Antonyms I
\par There are about 9 antonyms on the verbal section of the test. The questions are mixed in with the analogies,
\par sentence completions, and reading comprehension. An antonym will often begin the verbal section.
\par Antonyms are probably the hardest type of question to improve on since increasing one\rquote s vocabulary is a
\par long-term project. Nevertheless, we will study some very effective techniques that can be applied to these
\par problems.
\par However, don\rquote t rely on just these techniques\emdash as we mentioned at the beginning of the verbal section,
\par you must study word lists. Obviously, you cannot attempt to memorize the dictionary, and you don\rquote t need to.
\par The GRE tests a surprisingly limited number of words. At the end of the verbal portion of this book, you will
\par find a list of 4000 essential words. Granted, memorizing a list of words is rather dry, but it is probably the
\par most effective way of improving your performance on the verbal section. While you are studying the verbal
\par techniques, you should also be studying the word lists. It\rquote s not as daunting as it appears: you will know many
\par of the words or at least be familiar with them. And if you don\rquote t know them, there are some techniques to learn
\par new words that will simplify the process. Everyone learns differently, so choose the technique that works best
\par for you.
\par TECHNIQUES FOR LEARNING NEW VOCABULARY
\par Put The Definition In Your Own Words
\par The first technique for learning new words is to put the definition in your own words. It is best to try to
\par condense the definition to only one or two words; this will make it easier to remember. You will find simple
\par one or two word definitions provided for you in the list of 4000 essential words in this book. You may be even
\par more likely to remember these, however, if you put the definitions in your own words. For example, take the
\par word
\par Heinous
\par The definition of heinous is \'93abominable, vile.\'94 However, you may find it much easier to remember by the
\par word
\par Horrible
\par Often the dictionary definition of a word can be simplified by condensing the definition into one word. Take,
\par for example, the word
\par Expiate
\par The dictionary definition is \'93to put an end to; to extinguish guilt, to make amends for.\'94 This definition may be
\par summed up by one word
\par Atone
\par Putting definitions in your own words makes them more familiar and therefore easier to remember.
\par Write Down The Words
\par Many people are visual learners and do not fully benefit from a mere review of words and their definitions as
\par they appear in a dictionary or in the list in this book. For these learners, writing the words and their definitions
\par may well make a dramatic difference in retaining the words and their meanings. For many, it may take several
\par times of writing the word down along with its definition to make it all \'93sink in.\'94 If you think this method is
\par best for you, get a notebook to write your words in.
\par 374 GRE Prep Course
\par Use Flashcards
\par If you decide to write down the new words you are learning, you might also consider accomplishing two jobs
\par at once by creating your own set of flashcards. Cut heavyweight paper into a size that you feel is manageable.
\par Then, when you are practicing your words by writing them down, simply write the words on one side of a
\par flashcard and write the definition on the other side. You will then have a wonderful tool with which to learn
\par words on your own or to use with a partner in quizzing each other.
\par Create A Word Picture
\par Creating mental word pictures is another visual technique that you can apply to many words. You may
\par remember in grade school learning the difference between the word principal and the word principle. Your
\par teacher probably told you that principal refers to \'93the leader of an educational institution\'94 and the word ends
\par with \'93pal.\'94 Your school principal wants to be your \'93pal,\'94 so this is easy to remember (after all, you always
\par wanted to be best friends with your principal, right?). Your teacher gave you a mental word picture.
\par Let\rquote s take another word: sovereign. Sovereign means \'93monarch.\'94 The word itself contains the word reign.
\par What do you think of when you think of reign? You probably think of a king\emdash or a monarch. So, picture a king
\par when you are trying to recall the meaning of sovereign, and it should be easy to remember.
\par How about pestilence. Pestilence means \'93disease.\'94 The word pest is in the word. Pests are common in a
\par garden, and, unfortunately, they often cause diseases among the plants in a garden. So when you see this word,
\par picture a garden and then picture all of the pests that bring diseases to your garden. Then you will remember
\par the meaning of pestilence.
\par If you have created flashcards, it may help to draw a small reminder on the flashcard of your mental word
\par picture to further ingrain the word in your memory. For example, for sovereign, you might draw a small crown;
\par for pestilence, you could pencil in a pesty bug.
\par Creating mental word pictures helps you retain the meanings of new words and clarifies your thinking when
\par you get to the test.
\par Set Goals
\par Whatever technique works best for you, it is necessary to set goals if you plan to learn the \'93Ubiquitous 400\'94 as
\par well as the top 4000 words that are listed in this study guide. To do so, first look ahead to your intended test
\par date. Next, determine how many days you have before this test date. Finally, divide the list so you have a
\par preset goal each day of how many words you will learn. This makes the task much less formidable because you
\par will be able to measure your accomplishments each day rather than trying to attack in one sitting what seems to
\par be an insurmountable task.
\par WHEN YOU DON\rquote T KNOW THE WORD
\par As we mentioned, you can\rquote t possibly memorize the whole dictionary, and, while you can learn the words in a
\par list of words that occur most frequently on the GRE, there will inevitably still be some that you do not know.
\par Don\rquote t be discouraged. Again, there are some very effective techniques that can be applied when a word does
\par not look familiar to you.
\par Put The Word In Context
\par In our daily speech, we combine words into phrases and sentences; rarely do we use a word by itself. This can
\par cause words that we have little trouble understanding in sentences to suddenly appear unfamiliar when we view
\par them in isolation. For example, take the word
\par Whet
\par Most people don\rquote t recognize it in isolation. Yet most people understand it in the following phrase:
\par TeamLRN
\par Antonyms I 375
\par To whet your appetite
\par Whet means to \'93stimulate.\'94
\par If you don\rquote t recognize the meaning of a word, think of a phrase in which you have heard it used.
\par For another example, take the word
\par Hallow
\par In isolation, it may seem unfamiliar to you. However, you probably understand its use in the phrase
\par The hallowed halls of academia
\par Hallow means \'93to make sacred, to honor.\'94
\par Problem Set A:
\par For the following antonyms think of a common phrase in which the capitalized word is used. Answers and
\par solutions begin on page 384.
\par Directions: For the following problems, choose the word most opposite in meaning to the capitalized word.
\par 1. GRATUITOUS: (A) voluntary (B) arduous (C) solicitous (D) righteous (E) befitting
\par 2. FALLOW: (A) fatuous (B) productive (C) bountiful (D) pertinacious (E) opprobrious
\par 3. METTLE: (A) ad hoc (B) perdition (C) woe (D) trepidation (E) apathy
\par 4. SAVANT: (A) dolt (B) sage (C) attach\'e9 (D) apropos comment (E) state of confusion
\par 5. RIFE: (A) multitudinous (B) blemished (C) sturdy (D) counterfeit (E) sparse
\par 6. ABRIDGE: (A) distend (B) assail (C) unfetter (D) enfeeble (E) prove
\par 7. PRODIGAL: (A) bountiful (B) dependent (C) provident (D) superfluous (E) profligate
\par 8. REQUIEM: (A) humility (B) prerequisite (C) resolution (D) reign (E) hiatus
\par 9. METE: (A) indict (B) convoke (C) hamper (D) disseminate (E) deviate
\par 10. SEVERANCE: (A) continuation (B) dichotomy (C) astringency (D) disclosure (E) remonstrance
\par Change The Word Into A More Common Form
\par Most words are built from other words. Although you may not know a given word, you may spot the root
\par word from which it is derived and thereby deduce the meaning of the original word.
\par Example 1: PERTURBATION: (A) impotence (B) obstruction
\par (C) prediction (D) equanimity (E) chivalry
\par You may not know how to pronounce PERTURBATION let alone know what it means. However, changing
\par its ending yields the more common form of the word \'93perturbed,\'94 which means \'93upset, agitated.\'94 The opposite
\par of upset is calm, which is exactly what EQUANIMITY means. The answer is (D).
\par Example 2: TEMPESTUOUS: (A) prodigal (B) reticent (C) serene
\par (D) phenomenal (E) accountable
\par TEMPESTUOUS is a hard word. However, if we drop the ending \'93stuous\'94 and add the letter \'93r\'94 we get the
\par common word \'93temper.\'94 The opposite of having a temper is being calm or SERENE. The answer is (C).
\par 376 GRE Prep Course
\par Problem Set B:
\par For each of the following problems change the capitalized word into a more common form of the word and
\par then find its antonym. Solutions begin on page 384.
\par 1. HYPOCRITICAL: (A) forthright (B) judicious (C) circumspect (D) puritanical (E) unorthodox
\par 2. VOLUMINOUS: (A) obscure (B) cantankerous (C) unsubstantial (D) tenacious (E) opprobrious
\par 3. FANATICISM: (A) delusion (B) fascism (C) remorse (D) cynicism (E) indifference
\par 4. INTERMINABLE: (A) finite (B) jejune (C) tranquil (D) incessant (E) imprudent
\par 5. ORNATE: (A) Spartan (B) blemished (C) sturdy (D) counterfeit (E) temporary
\par 6. MUTABILITY: (A) simplicity (B) apprehension (C) frailty (D) maverick (E) tenacity
\par 7. VIRULENT: (A) benign (B) intrepid (C) malignant (D) hyperbolic (E) tentative
\par 8. ABSTEMIOUS: (A) timely (B) immoderate (C) bellicose (D) servile (E) irreligious
\par 9. VERBOSE: (A) subliminal (B) myopic (C) pithy (D) dauntless (E) ubiquitous
\par 10. VISCID: (A) subtle (B) faint (C) slick (D) vicious (E) difficult
\par Test Words For Positive And Negative Connotations
\par Testing words for positive and negative connotations is probably the most effective technique for antonyms.
\par Surprisingly, you can often solve an antonym problem knowing only that the word has a negative connotation.
\par Example 1: REPUDIATE: (A) denounce (B) deceive (C) embrace (D) fib (E) generalize
\par You may not know what REPUDIATE means, but you probably sense that it has a negative connotation.
\par Since we are looking for a word whose meaning is opposite of REPUDIATE, we eliminate any answer-choices
\par that are also negative. Now, \'93denounce,\'94 \'93deceive,\'94 and \'93fib\'94 are all, to varying degrees, negative. So eliminate
\par them. \'93Generalize\'94 has a neutral connotation: it can be positive, negative, or neither. So eliminate it as
\par well. Hence, by process of elimination, the answer is (C), EMBRACE.
\par Example 2: NOXIOUS: (A) diffuse (B) latent (C) beneficial (D) unique (E) unjust
\par NOXIOUS has a negative connotation (strongly so). Therefore, we are looking for a word with a positive connotation.
\par Now \'93diffuse\'94 means \'93spread out, widely scattered.\'94 Hence, it is neutral in meaning, neither positive
\par nor negative. Thus, we eliminate it. \'93Latent\'94 and \'93unique\'94 are also neutral in meaning\emdash eliminate.
\par \'93Unjust\'94 has a negative connotation\emdash eliminate. The only word remaining, BENEFICIAL, has a strongly positive
\par connotation and is the answer.
\par Note! Any GRE Word That Starts With \'93De,\'94 \'93Dis,\'94 or \'93Anti\'94 Will Almost Certainly Be
\par Negative.
\par Examples: Degradation, Discrepancy, Discriminating, Debase, Antipathy
\par Note!
\par Any GRE Word That Includes The Notion of Going up Will Almost Certainly Be Positive,
\par and any GRE Word That Includes The Notion of Going Down Will Almost Certainly Be
\par Negative.
\par Examples (positive): Elevate, Ascendancy, Lofty
\par Examples (negative): Decline, Subjugate, Suborn (to encourage false witness)
\par TeamLRN
\par Antonyms I 377
\par Problem Set C:
\par Solve the following problems by checking for positive and negative connotations. Solutions begin on page 385.
\par 1. DERISION: (A) urgency (B) admonishment (C) uniqueness (D) diversity (E) acclaim
\par 2. ANTIPATHY: (A) fondness (B) disagreement (C) boorishness (D) provocation (E) opprobrium
\par 3. CAJOLE: (A) implore (B) glance at (C) belittle (D) ennoble (E) engender
\par 4. CENSURE: (A) prevaricate (B) titillate (C) aggrandize (D) obscure (E) sanction
\par 5. ADULATION: (A) immutability (B) reluctance (C) reflection (D) defamation (E) indifference
\par 6. NOISOME: (A) salubrious (B) affable (C) multifarious (D) provident (E) officious
\par 7. CONSECRATE: (A) curb (B) destroy (C) curse (D) inveigh (E) exculpate
\par 8. ILLUSTRIOUS: (A) bellicose (B) ignoble (C) theoretical (D) esoteric (E) immaculate
\par 9. DEIGN: (A) inveigh (B) gainsay (C) speculate (D) reject (E) laud
\par 10. SUBTERFUGE: (A) bewilderment (B) artlessness (C) deceit (D) felicitation (E) jeopardy
\par Watch Out For Eye-Catchers
\par Some answer-choices will catch your eye by reminding you of some part of the original word or some common
\par meaning of the word. Be wary of these choices\emdash they are eye-catchers.
\par Example 2: SUFFRAGE: (A) absence of charity (B) absence of franchise (C) absence of pain
\par (D) absence of success (E) absence of malice
\par SUFFRAGE is a hard word. It appears to come from the word \'93suffer.\'94 The opposite of suffering would be an
\par absence of pain. However, that connection would be too easy, too obvious for this hard problem. \'93Absence of
\par pain\'94 is a trap. In fact, SUFFRAGE means \'93the right to vote.\'94 And FRANCHISE is a synonym for \'93vote.\'94
\par Hence, the answer is (B), ABSENCE OF FRANCHISE.
\par Problem Set D:
\par Eliminate the eye-catchers in the following problems; then solve. Solutions are on page 386.
\par 1. UPSHOT: (A) consequence (B) descent (C) annihilation (D) termination (E) inception
\par 2. WHET: (A) obscure (B) blunt (C) desiccate (D) imbibe (E) enervate
\par 3. PRODIGY: (A) vacuous comment (B) hegemony (C) plane (D) common occurrence
\par (E) capitulation
\par 4. AMBULATORY: (A) immutable (B) obdurate (C) hospitalized (D) pedantic (E) stationary
\par 5. PLATITUDE: (A) sincere comment (B) enigmatic comment (C) hostile comment
\par (D) disingenuous comment (E) original comment
\par 6. SEEMLY: (A) redoubtable (B) flaccid (C) imperceptible (D) indigenous (E) unbecoming
\par Be Alert To Secondary (Often Rare) Meanings Of Words
\par The GRE writers often use common words but with their uncommon meanings. An example will illustrate.
\par Example 1: CHAMPION: (A) relinquish (B) contest (C) oppress (D) modify (E) withhold
\par The common meaning of CHAMPION is \'93winner.\'94 Its opposite would be \'93loser.\'94 But no answer-choice
\par given above is synonymous with \'93loser.\'94 CHAMPION also means to support or fight for someone else.
\par (Think of the phrase \'93to champion a cause.\'94) Hence, the answer is (C), OPPRESS.
\par 378 GRE Prep Course
\par The parts of speech in an antonym problem are consistent throughout the problem. Hence, if the given word is
\par a verb, then every answer-choice will be a verb as well. This fact often helps you determine whether a word is
\par being used in a secondary sense because words often have different meanings depending on their use as nouns,
\par verbs, or adjectives.
\par Example 2: AIR: (A) release (B) differ (C) expose (D) betray (E) enshroud
\par AIR is commonly used as a noun\emdash indicating that which we breathe. But every answer-choice is a verb.
\par Hence, AIR in this case must also be a verb. A secondary meaning for AIR is to discuss publicly. The opposite
\par is to ENSHROUD, to hide, to conceal. Hence, the answer is (E).
\par Problem Set E:
\par In solving the following problems, look for secondary meanings. Solutions begin on page 386.
\par 1. CURB: (A) bridle (B) encourage (C) reproach (D) ameliorate (E) perjure
\par 2. DOCUMENT: (A) copy (B) implement (C) gainsay (D) blanch (E) rant
\par 3. FLUID: (A) radiant (B) smooth (C) solid (D) balky (E) craggy
\par 4. BOLT: (A) linger (B) refrain from (C) subdue (D) strip (E) transgress
\par 5. TABLE: (A) palliate (B) acclimate (C) garner (D) propound (E) expedite
\par 6. HARBOR: (A) provide shelter (B) banish (C) acquiesce (D) extol (E) capitulate
\par 7. FLOWER: (A) burgeon (B) exact (C) blight (D) refute (E) stabilize
\par 8. STEEP: (A) desiccate (B) intensify (C) pontificate (D) whet (E) hamper
\par 9. RENT: (A) reserved (B) restored (C) razed (D) busy (E) kinetic
\par 10. EXACT: (A) extract (B) starve (C) lecture (D) menace (E) condone
\par Use Your Past Knowledge / Education
\par Since you are studying for the GRE, you have probably completed, or almost completed, your undergraduate
\par studies. Therefore, you have a wealth of knowledge from which to draw when it comes to examining the words
\par that will appear on the test. In your undergraduate classes, you studied history and probably one or more
\par foreign languages. You may have even taken a Latin class. Because the English language has \'93borrowed\'94
\par many words from other languages, especially Latin and French, these classes give you valuable clues to the
\par meanings of many of the words you may come across.
\par Example 1: NARCISSISTIC: (A) egocentric (B) complacent
\par (C) pretentious (D) unostentatious (E) unassertive
\par You may remember Narcissus from one of your literature and Greek mythology classes. One version of the
\par story of Narcissus relates a man who falls in love with his own reflection in a pool. Because of his requited
\par love, he dies. As a man in love with his own reflection, he portrays self-love to the ultimate degree. A man like
\par this is pretentious. Unostentatious is the opposite of pretentious. Hence, the answer is (D),
\par UNOSTENTATIOUS.
\par Example 2: VERDANT: (A) na\'efve (B) seasoned (C) ignorant (D) amateur (E) innocent
\par Recall from your Spanish class that verde means \'93green\'94 and from your French class that vert means \'93green\'94
\par as well. These words may remind you of the word verdant, which also means \'93green\'94 and can refer to being
\par \'93green\'94 in experience or judgment. Therefore, in this example, (B), SEASONED, is the answer because it
\par means \'93experienced.\'94

\par \bullet  Watch out for eye-catchers
\par \bullet  Be alert to secondary (often rare) meanings of words
\par \bullet  Use your past education/knowledge
\par Tips
\par \bullet  If the word starts with \'93De,\'94 \'93Dis,\'94 or \'93Anti,\'94 the word most likely has a negative connotation.
\par \bullet  If the word contains the notion of going up, it will most likely have a positive connotation.
\par \bullet  If the word contains the notion of going down, it will most likely have a negative connotation.
\par \bullet  Hard problems have hard answers. Hence be wary of common words on hard problems. But don\rquote t eliminate
\par them for that reason alone: they may still be the answer. So if the given word is totally unfamiliar and
\par none of the previous techniques have helped, then choose the hardest or most unusual word.
\par \bullet  You can eliminate answer-choices intelligently: eliminate any that are synonyms (have the same meaning)
\par as the given word; eliminate any answer-choices that have the same antonym.
\par \bullet  Never spend more than 30 seconds on an antonym problem.

\par Problem Set A:
\par 1. You may not recognize GRATUITOUS in isolation,
\par but you probably understand it in the
\par phrase: \'93Gratuitous sex and violence.\'94 GRATUITOUS
\par means \'93freely given, uncalled for.\'94
\par The opposite is BEFITTING. The answer is

\par METTLE means \'93character, courage.\'94 The

\par The answer is (D).
\par 4. Think of the description: \'93Idiot-savant.\'94 An

\par of both a mentally retarded person
\par and a mental gifted person. SAVANT means
\par \'93reflective thinker.\'94 The opposite is a DOLT.

\par 5. You may have heard RIFE used in the following
\par manner: \'93The city is rife with crime.\'94
\par RIFE means \'93widespread, permeated.\'94 The
\par opposite is SPARSE. The answer is (E).
\par 6. Think of the description: \'93Unabridged dictionary.\'94
\par An unabridged dictionary is the unabbreviated
\par version of a dictionary. Hence,
\par ABRIDGE means \'93to shorten.\'94 The opposite
\par is DISTEND: to swell or protrude. The answer
\par is (A).
\par 7. Think of the description: \'93Prodigal son.\'94 The
\par prodigal son is the wasteful, spoiled son\emdash a
\par playboy. Hence, PRODIGAL means
\par \'93immoderate.\'94 The opposite is PROVIDENT\emdash 
\par frugal, careful. The answer is (C).
\par 8. Think of the phrase: \'93Requiem for a heavyweight.\'94

\par to continue the relationship. The answer is
\par (A).
\par Problem Set B:
\par 1. HYPOCRITICAL contains the base word
\par HYPOCRITE, one who deceives. The opposite
\par is one who is honest and candid. The
\par answer is (A), FORTHRIGHT.
\par 2. Embedded in the word VOLUMINOUS is the
\par word VOLUME. So we are looking for a word
\par that is related to size. The only answer-choice
\par related to size is UNSUBSTANTIAL. The answer
\par is (C). (VOLUMINOUS means \'93large.\'94)
\par TeamLRN
\par Antonyms I 385
\par 3. FANATICISM contains FANATIC which in
\par turn contains FAN. Now, at a sporting event,
\par fans often become overenthusiastic, which is
\par precisely the meaning of FANATIC. Thus, we
\par are looking for a word that means unenthusiastic.
\par That is the meaning of INDIFFERENCE.
\par The answer is (E).
\par 4. INTERMINABLE comes from the base word
\par TERMINATE\emdash to stop. Now, the prefix in
\par means \'93not,\'94 so INTERMINABLE means \'93not
\par able to stop.\'94 The only word that contains the
\par notion of stopping or limitedness is FINITE.
\par Hence, the answer is (A).
\par 5. Changing the ending of ORNATE to \'93ment\'94
\par yields the more familiar word ORNAMENT\emdash 
\par a decoration. The opposite is undecorated.
\par Now, the best answer-choice is SPARTAN,
\par which means \'93plain or austere.\'94 The answer is
\par (A).
\par 6. Changing the ending of MUTABILITY from
\par \'93ability\'94 to \'93ate\'94 yields the more common
\par word MUTATE\emdash to change. So we\rquote re looking
\par for a word that means \'93unchanging.\'94
\par TENACITY means \'93steadfastness in one\rquote s
\par opinions.\'94 In other words, not changing one\rquote s
\par opinion easily. The answer is (E).
\par 7. Dropping \'93lent\'94 from VIRULENT and adding
\par \'93s\'94 yields the common word VIRUS. A
\par VIRUS is harmful, so we want a word that
\par means harmless, which is precisely the meaning
\par of BENIGN. The answer is (A).
\par 8. ABSTEMIOUS comes from ABSTAIN\emdash to
\par refrain from doing. The opposite is to do too
\par much. Now, IMMODERATE means \'93excessive,
\par indulgent.\'94 Hence, the answer is (B).
\par 9. VERBOSE contains the word VERB, which
\par means \'93word.\'94 VERBOSE means \'93too many
\par words, wordy.\'94 Now, PITHY means \'93well
\par put, concise.\'94 Hence, the answer is (C).
\par 10. You have probably never seen the word
\par VISCID, but changing the ending yields
\par viscous or viscosity. The viscosity of oil is a
\par measure of the thickness or gumminess of oil.
\par Hence, VISCID means thick or gummy, and
\par the opposite of gummy is SLICK. The answer
\par is (C).
\par Problem Set C:
\par 1. Since DERISION starts with DE, it should be
\par negative. So we are looking for a positive
\par word. \'93Urgency\'94 and \'93admonishment\'94 are
\par both somewhat negative\emdash eliminate.
\par \'93Uniqueness\'94 and \'93diversity\'94 are both
\par neutral\emdash eliminate. Hence, by process of
\par elimination, the answer is (E), \'93acclaim.\'94
\par DERISION means \'93scorn.\'94
\par 2. Since ANTIPATHY starts with ANTI, it is
\par negative. \'93Disagreement\'94 \'93boorishness,\'94
\par \'93provocation,\'94 and \'93opprobrium\'94 are all negative
\par to varying degrees. Hence, the answer is
\par (A), \'93fondness.\'94 ANTIPATHY means
\par \'93hatred.\'94
\par 3. CAJOLE has a positive connotation.
\par \'93Implore,\'94 \'93ennoble,\'94 and \'93engender\'94 are all
\par neutral to positive, and they are all similar to
\par CAJOLE\emdash eliminate. \'93Glance at\'94 is neutral\emdash 
\par eliminate. Thus, by process of elimination, the
\par answer is (C), \'93belittle.\'94 CAJOLE means \'93to
\par encourage.\'94
\par 4. CENSURE is a hard word. Nonetheless, you
\par may sense that it has a negative connotation.
\par (It comes from the same root as does
\par \'93censor.\'94) Hence, we want a positive word.
\par \'93Sanction\'94 is the only positive word offered,
\par and it is the answer. CENSURE means \'93to
\par deplore.\'94 The answer is (E).
\par 5. ADULATION has a positive connotation.
\par \'93Immutability,\'94 \'93reluctance,\'94 \'93reflection,\'94 and
\par \'93indifference\'94 are all neutral in connotation\emdash 
\par eliminate. Thus, by process of elimination, the
\par answer is (D), \'93defamation.\'94 ADULATION
\par means \'93praise, applause.\'94
\par 6. NOISOME is a very negative word, so we are
\par looking for a very positive word. Now,
\par \'93multifarious\'94 is neutral: it means \'93diverse,
\par many-sided.\'94 \'93Provident\'94 is a positive synonym
\par for \'93miserly.\'94 \'93Officious\'94 is negative: it
\par means \'93acting like an official, sticking your
\par nose into other people\rquote s business.\'94 Finally,
\par both \'93salubrious\'94 and \'93affable\'94 are positive,
\par but \'93salubrious\'94 (healthful) is more positive.
\par So (A) is the answer. NOISOME means
\par \'93noxious.\'94
\par 7. CONSECRATE (to make holy) has a positive
\par connotation. The only negative word is
\par \'93curse.\'94 The answer is (C). Note: \'93Destroy\'94
\par is neutral, not negative: you can destroy something
\par that is good or bad.
\par 8. ILLUSTRIOUS has a positive connotation.
\par Now, \'93bellicose\'94 and \'93ignoble\'94 are equally
\par negative. At this point you have to guess. The

\par ILLUSTRIOUS means \'93honored,

\par 9. Since DEIGN starts with DE, it should be
\par negative. So we are looking for a positive
\par word. \'93Inveigh\'94 is negative; it means to rail
\par against. Eliminate (A). \'93Gainsay\'94 is also
\par negative; it means \'93to contradict, to impugn.\'94
\par Eliminate (B). \'93Speculate\'94 is neutral as is
\par \'93reject,\'94 rejecting something may be wise or
\par unwise depending on the circumstance\emdash eliminate
\par (C) and (D). Hence, by process of elimination,
\par the answer is (E). DEIGN means \'93to
\par condescend, to disdain.\'94 And LAUD means
\par \'93to praise, to extol.\'94
\par 10. The prefix \'93sub\'94 gives SUBTERFUGE the
\par sense of going down. So we expect SUBTERFUGE
\par to have a negative connotation.
\par Hence, we are looking for a positive word.
\par Now, \'93bewilderment\'94 is somewhat negative\emdash 
\par eliminate. \'93Artlessness\'94 (sincere, ingenuous)
\par is positive; it may be the answer. \'93Deceit\'94 is
\par negative\emdash eliminate. \'93Felicitation\'94 (an
\par expression of good wishes, congratulation) is
\par also positive; it too may be the answer.
\par \'93Jeopardy\'94 is negative\emdash eliminate. Now,
\par SUBTERFUGE means \'93deceit, conspiracy.\'94
\par The opposite is artlessness. The answer is (B).
\par Problem Set D:
\par 1. The eye-catcher is \'93descent.\'94 UPSHOT contains
\par UP and the opposite of up is down, or a
\par descent. Now, UPSHOT is a result. Whereas,
\par an inception is the beginning of something, it
\par does not follow anything. The answer is (E).
\par 2. The eye-catcher is \'93desiccate\'94: the opposite of
\par \'93wet.\'94 However, WHET has nothing to do
\par with water. In fact, WHET means \'93to stimulate.\'94
\par Think of the saying \'93To whet your appetite.\'94
\par The opposite of stimulating a desire or
\par emotion is dulling or blunting it. The answer
\par is (B).
\par 3. Most people associate a PRODIGY with a
\par mentally gifted child, and the opposite would
\par be stupid. So choice (A), VACUOUS
\par COMMENT is tempting. But this would be
\par too easy a connection for this hard question.
\par Now, a PRODIGY is a person with extraordinary
\par ability or talent, but not necessarily intelligence.
\par By extension, PRODIGY means
\par anything extraordinary. The opposite is a
\par COMMON OCCURRENCE. The answer is
\par (D).
\par 4. You may not have heard the word AMBULATORY
\par before. But it reminds you of ambulance,
\par which in turn reminds you of the
\par answer-choice HOSPITALIZED. Don\rquote t be
\par tricked: HOSPITALIZED is an eye-catcher.
\par Now, AMBULATORY means \'93walking, moving
\par about.\'94 The opposite is STATIONARY.
\par The answer is (E).
\par 5. One of the first associations that comes to mind
\par with PLATITUDE is a clich\'e9 or trite comment.
\par So the opposite might be SINCERE
\par COMMENT. Be careful: this analysis is too
\par easy and too pat to be the answer to this hard
\par problem. Now, a PLATITUDE is insincere
\par because not much thought goes into creating it.
\par Hence, it is unoriginal. The opposite is original.
\par The answer is (E), ORIGINAL
\par COMMENT.
\par 6. SEEMLY appears to mean \'93seem,\'94 and the
\par opposite of \'93seem\'94 is \'93imperceptible.\'94
\par However, \'93imperceptible\'94 is an eye-catcher.
\par The actual meaning of SEEMLY is
\par \'93appropriate or proper.\'94 You may be more
\par familiar with its antonym \'93unseemly.\'94 The
\par answer is (E), UNBECOMING.
\par Problem Set E:
\par 1. Since all the answer-choices are verbs, CURB
\par cannot mean the sidewalk you park your car
\par next to. As a verb, CURB means \'93to restrain
\par or stop.\'94 The opposite of stopping an activity
\par is encouraging it. Hence, the answer is (B).
\par 2. As a noun, DOCUMENT means \'93a legal or
\par official paper.\'94 But all the answer-choices are
\par verbs. As a verb, DOCUMENT means \'93to
\par attest to, or to supply evidence.\'94 The opposite
\par is to contradict, which is the meaning of
\par \'93gainsay.\'94 The answer is (C).
\par 3. Since all the answer-choices are adjectives,
\par FLUID must also be an adjective. Now, as an
\par adjective, FLUID means \'93moving in a continuous,
\par smooth manner.\'94 The opposite would be
\par moving in a hesitating manner, which is the
\par meaning of \'93balky.\'94 (Think of a \'93balk\'94 in the
\par game of baseball.) The answer is (D).
\par 4. As a verb BOLT means \'93to move quickly.\'94
\par (The sprinters bolted out of the starting
\par blocks.) The opposite is to linger. The answer
\par is (A).
\par 5. None of the answer-choices are nouns, so
\par TABLE cannot be referring to furniture. As a
\par verb, TABLE means \'93to postpone.\'94 You may
\par have heard it used in government: \'93Congress
\par tabled the bill.\'94 The opposite is to expedite.
\par The answer is (E).
\par Choice (D), \'93propound,\'94 is second-best.
\par However, \'93expedite\'94 is more precisely opposite
\par because it includes the notion of speeding
\par up the consideration of a proposal.

\par The answer is (A).
\par 9. This is a hard problem. Unfortunately, the

\par be tested on the GRE. As a verb, RENT means
\par \'93to tear apart.\'94 The opposite is to RESTORE.
\par The answer is (B).
\par 10. As an adjective, EXACT means \'93accurate.\'94
\par But as a verb, EXACT means \'93to use authority
\par to force payment or compliance.\'94 The opposite
\par is to CONDONE: to allow or forgive. The
\par answer is (E).
\par Problem Set F:
\par 1. Legend has it that if you kiss a magical stone
\par in Blarney, Ireland, you will be given the gift

\par Antonyms II (Etymology)
\par Etymology is the study of the development of words and their forms. Many of the words in the English
\par language have fascinating histories; familiarity with these stories and the development of the words can help
\par you remember the meanings of the words and help you decipher the meanings of others words.
\par A Biography of English
\par It is helpful to learn some of the history of English\emdash a language less than 2000 years old that has made its way
\par to almost every corner of the world, making it the one true global language. Knowing something about the
\par history of the language as well as its present qualities should not only intrigue you, but also give you more
\par facility to acquire new vocabulary and use it well in your graduate work.
\par It has been said that English came to Britain \'93on the edge of a sword.\'94 In 449 AD, Britain, at the time
\par settled by the Celts, became the target of several invasions because other groups of people wanted its fertile
\par land. The first group of people to invade, the Anglo-Saxons, drove the Celtic-Britons westward, settled into the
\par fertile land, and began farming their new property. The Anglo-Saxons were an agricultural people; everyday
\par words like sheep, shepherd, ox, earth, dog, wood, field, and work come from the Anglo-Saxon Old English.
\par Moreover, it is nearly impossible to write a modern English sentence without using Anglo-Saxon words like
\par the, is, you, here, and there.
\par The Vikings built on the Anglo-Saxon vocabulary with their merciless invasions. During the time of the
\par Viking invasions, Anglo-Saxon writing reflected a bitter, negative tone. Themes like transience of life,
\par heroism, and keeping dignity in the face of defeat permeated their writings about themes such as the cruel sea,
\par ruined cities, war, and exile. One notable example of Old English writing is the heroic epic poem Beowulf.
\par Lines 20-25 of the Prologue in Old English read:
\par Swa sceal geong guma gode gewyrcean,
\par fromum feohgiftum on f\'e6der bearme,
\par p\'e6t hine on ylde eft gewunigen
\par wilgesipas, ponne wig cume,
\par leode gel\'e6sten; lofd\'e6dum sceal
\par in m\'e6gpa gehw\'e6re man gepeon.
\par These lines are translated as follows:
\par So becomes it a youth to quit him well
\par with his father\rquote s friends, by fee and gift,
\par that to aid him, aged, in after days,
\par come warriors willing, should war draw nigh,
\par liegemen loyal; by lauded deeds
\par shall an earl have honor in every clan.
\par Most likely, you found it impossible to interpret even one word of the poem as it was originally written; Old
\par English was certainly very different from English as we know it today.
\par It would take yet another invasion to add just a bit of present-day \'93normalcy\'94 to the language. This
\par invasion came in 1066 and became known as the Norman Conquest. It transformed the English language,
\par marking a turning point in the language\rquote s history from Old English to Middle English. When the Normans
\par Antonyms II (Etymology) 391
\par invaded Britain from present-day Normandy, France, and William the conqueror took the throne, English
\par began its transformation into the melting pot of all languages.
\par When the Normans arrived in Britain, they found a people governed by what they considered to be
\par inferior moral and cultural standards. Consequently, French was the language of the aristocrats, the wellbred\emdash 
\par the language of the civilized. However, English survived for a number of reasons. First and foremost, it
\par was too established to disappear. In addition, there was intermarriage between the French-speaking Normans
\par and the English-speaking Anglos, and, in instances where an Anglo woman married a Norman, the children
\par were more likely to speak their mother\rquote s language, thus carrying the language to the next generation.
\par Other events had an effect on the strength of English as well. The Hundred Years War caused French to
\par lose its prestige while it bolstered nationalism for English. During the war, the Black Plague took so many
\par lives that labor was scarce, forcing the rise of the English working man. The disease had the same effect in
\par churches and monasteries.
\par Through the survival of English came many changes to its vocabulary and to its written form. The biggest
\par change was the addition of many borrowed words, especially from French and Latin. Although English
\par borrowed many words from French, French had little impact on the grammatical structure of the language,
\par though there were notable changes to its form. For example, pronunciations and spelling changed as regional
\par dialects formed. In addition, word order began to change. Through all the changes, English began to take on
\par more of the look that we recognize today although there were still marked differences. Following is an excerpt
\par from the Prologue of Chaucer\rquote s Canterbury Tales. Try deciphering the left column without consulting the
\par translation in the right column.
\par Here bygynneth the Book
\par of the tales of Caunterbury
\par Here begins the Book
\par of the Tales of Canterbury
\par Whan that aprill with his shoures soote

\par And bathed every veyne in swich licour
\par Of which vertu engendred is the flour;

\par (so priketh hem nature in hir corages);
\par Thanne longen folk to goon on pilgrimages,
\par And palmeres for to seken straunge strondes,
\par To ferne halwes, kowthe in sondry londes;
\par And specially from every shires ende

\par And specially from every shire's end
\par Of England they to Canterbury wend,
\par The holy blessed martyr there to seek
\par Who helped them when they lay so ill and weak
\par Undoubtedly, you found Canterbury Tales easier to decipher than Beowulf, even in its original form. Clearer
\par still is the following well-known excerpt from William Shakespeare\rquote s Romeo and Juliet:
\par O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
\par Deny thy father and refuse thy name!
\par Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
\par And I\rquote ll no longer be a Capulet. (2.2.33-36)
\par William Shakespeare along with King James marked the change from Middle English to Modern English
\par although their writing reflected a use of word order that still sounds awkward in our present-day English. For
\par example, the King James version of the Bible uses such phrases as follow thou me, speak ye unto me, cake
\par unleavened, things eternal, they knew him not. Although these authors\rquote  writings may seem antiquated to us
\par today, they both have left a lasting impression. Many present-day phrases came from Shakespeare: good
\par riddance, lie low, the long and the short of it, a fool\rquote s paradise, sleep a wink, green-eyed jealousy, and love at
\par first sight. King James contributed many of today\rquote s idioms: the root of the matter, wolf in sheep\rquote s clothing,
\par lambs to the slaughter, an eye for an eye, and straight and narrow.

\par In comparison, English as Shakespeare and King James knew it and English as we know it is quite
\par different. Truly, English is a changing language. And, although it seems to have already had a very full life,
\par there is no reason to assume that it will not continue to pass through new and different stages in its life.
\par The Birth of a Word
\par Just as the English language was born and has lived a life of change, so too a word has a life. From its birth, a
\par word can undergo changes or remain static throughout its life; it may seem immortal, or it may die. Words
\par have ancestors; they have relatives. Words also have \'93friends\'94 (synonyms) and \'93enemies\'94 (antonyms).
\par Studying the life of words is fascinating and gives you an upper hand at understanding and using words and
\par deciphering unfamiliar words you may find on the GRE or in your graduate work.
\par A word\rquote s ancestor is called a cognate. Cognates are ancient words that bare a close resemblance to
\par modern words. For example, in ancient Indo-European Sanskrit the word father is \'93pitar;\'94 in Latin, \'93pater;\'94 in
\par French, \'93p\'e8re;\'94 in Spanish \'93padre.\'94 In Sanskrit, mother is \'93matar;\'94 in Latin, \'93mater;\'94 in French, \'93m\'e8re;\'94 in
\par Spanish, \'93madre.\'94 Sir William Jones, a British judge, was the first to point out the close relationship between
\par languages despite the passage of time. His theory, a theory shared by many today, was that the languages of
\par 1/3 of the human race have a common source in this Indo-European language.
\par This common source found in cognates should not be confused with borrowed words. Borrowing is one
\par way that words are given birth in the English language. English has borrowed more words than any other
\par language, especially from French and Latin\emdash a direct result from the Norman Conquest. Borrowed words
\par sometimes keep their original form. For example, the French word laissez-faire is commonly used in English
\par and refers to the \'93policy of non-interference, especially as pertaining to government.\'94 In other instances,
\par however, words change form to fit the accepted rules and pronunciation that govern the English language. For
\par example, the word adroit means \'93right, justice.\'94 The word is from the French \'e0, which means \'93to\'94 and droit
\par (pronounced dwa), which means \'93right.\'94 Through their transition to English, the words changed spelling to
\par become one word, the English version lost the accent mark, and the pronunciation changed. Following are
\par some examples of other borrowed words:
\par ABERRATION
\par Present meaning: departure from what is normal
\par Derived from: Latin aberrare, to wander away from
\par Details of origin: Originally a psychological term describing a person who mentally deviates from the norm.
\par ABOMINATE
\par Present meaning: loathe
\par Derived from: Latin abominor, \'93I pray that the event predicted by the omen may be averted\'94
\par Details of origin: A superstitious word the Romans uttered to ward off evil spirits when anyone said something
\par unlucky.
\par ALOOF
\par Present meaning: distant (as pertaining to emotion)
\par Derived from: Dutch te loef, to windward; also used as a sailor\rquote s term a loof, to the luff or windward direction
\par Details of origin: Present meaning suggests that the use of the term to mean "keeping a ship\rquote s head to the wind
\par and away from the shore" developed into our meaning of \'93distance.\'94
\par EBULLIENT
\par Present meaning: high-spirited; exuberant
\par Derived from: Latin ebullire, to boil over
\par Details of origin: Much as a pot boils over, one who is ebullient \'93boils over\'94 with enthusiasm.
\par EXPUNGE
\par Present meaning: erase; remove
\par Derived from: Latin expungere, to prick through or mark off

\par GREGARIOUS
\par Present meaning: sociable
\par Derived from: Latin gregarius and grex, flock or herd
\par Details of origin: From the idea that animals stayed in flocks or herds because they were sociable came our
\par present-day meaning.
\par LETHARGY
\par Present meaning: drowsiness; sluggishness
\par Derived from: Greek lethargia or lethe, forgetfulness
\par Details of origin: Because of the Greeks belief in afterlife, legend had it that the dead crossed the river Lethe,

\par While some words are borrowed directly from another language, others are adopted from interesting people
\par and events in history. For example, you have probably at one time or another made a Freudian slip, an
\par unintentional comment based on some subconscious feeling. And did you know that a bootlegger was
\par originally someone who smuggled illegal alcoholic liquor in the tops of his boots? Here are some other words
\par with fascinating histories:
\par AMALGAM
\par Present meaning: mixture, combination
\par Derived from: Latin amalgama, alloy of mercury; Greek malagma, softening substance
\par Details of origin: Evolved to present meaning in 1775.
\par BOWDLERIZE
\par Present meaning: to remove offensive words from a book
\par Derived from: Scottish physician Dr. Thomas Bowdler
\par Details of origin: Dr. Bowdler published an edition of Shakespeare\rquote s works, omitting certain words which he
\par deemed offensive.
\par CHAUVINISM
\par Present meaning: exaggerated patriotism
\par Derived from: one of Napoleon\rquote s soldiers, Nicolas Chauvin
\par Details of origin: After retiring from the army, Chauvin spoke so highly of himself and his feats while in battle
\par that he became a joke and thus the term was coined.
\par CYNOSURE
\par Present meaning: center of attention or admiration
\par Derived from: Greek mythology Cynosura, dog\rquote s tail
\par Details of origin: The Greek god Zeus honored a nymph by placing her as a constellation in the sky. One star
\par in the constellation in particular stood out. To many, the constellation looked like a dog\rquote s tail because of the
\par one bright star.
\par DESULTORY
\par Present meaning: lacking in consistency; disconnected
\par Derived from: Romans desultor, a leaper
\par Details of origin: Often Roman soldiers would go into battle with two horses so that when one horse tired, the
\par soldier could leap to the second horse striding alongside. This person became known as a desultor, or leaper.
\par The term evolved since this leaper only stayed on one horse for a short amount of time before becoming
\par disconnected and jumping to the other horse.

\par FIASCO
\par Present meaning: humiliating failure or breakdown
\par Derived from: Italian fiasco, flask or bottle
\par Details of origin: Venetian glassblowers set aside fine glass with flaws to use in making ordinary bottles. The
\par term resulted from the fact that something fine should be turned into something ordinary.
\par GAMUT
\par Present meaning: whole series or range of something
\par Derived from: medieval musician Guido of Arezzo
\par Details of origin: Arezzo was the first to use the lines of the musical staff, and he assigned the Greek letter
\par \'93gamma\'94 for the lowest tone. This note was called \'93gamma ut\'94 and thus \'93gamut\'94 evolved into our present
\par meaning.
\par INTRANSIGENT
\par Present meaning: uncompromising
\par Derived from: Spanish intransigente, not compromising
\par Details of origin: In 1873, Amadeus was forced to give up the throne of Spain. After this occurred, a group of
\par people attempted to form a political party of their own. This group was known as los intransigentes because
\par they would not conform to the policies of any other groups.
\par JOVIAL
\par Present meaning: merry
\par Derived from: Latin Jovialis, of Jupiter; Jovius, Jupiter
\par Details of origin: Astrologers believed that those born under the sign of Jupiter were characterized by a merry
\par disposition.
\par MESMERIZE
\par Present meaning: fascinate; spellbind
\par Derived from: Austrian doctor Friedrich Anton Mesmer
\par Details of origin: Doctor Mesmer was the first to successfully use hypnotism. Although the term is still used
\par today to relate to the technique of hypnotism, its meaning has broadened to encompass a general idea of
\par fascination.
\par OSTRACIZE
\par Present meaning: to exclude from a society as by general consent
\par Derived from: Greek ostrakon, tile, shell
\par Details of origin: In ancient Greece, if a man was considered dangerous to society, judges would cast their
\par votes regarding banishment by writing their names on a tile and dropping them in an urn.
\par QUARANTINE
\par Present meaning: isolation to prevent contagion
\par Derived from: Latin quadraginta, forty and quattuor, four; quarantina, space of forty days
\par Details of origin: This word has a rich history, originally referring to the period of time that a widow in the
\par 1500\rquote s could live in her dead husband\rquote s house. It was also used to reference the period of 40 days during which
\par Christ fasted in the wilderness. In the 1600\rquote s, the Venetians kept ships at bay for 40 days if their voyage originated
\par in a disease-stricken country. Since then, the term has broadened to encompass any period of isolation.
\par QUISLING
\par Present meaning: traitor
\par Derived from: Norweigan army officer Vidkun Quisling
\par Details of origin: Although the term loosely refers to a traitor, more specifically it describes a traitor who
\par betrays his country to serve a dictatorial government. Officer Quisling was one such traitor who betrayed
\par Norway to join arms with the Nazis in World War II.
\par Antonyms II (Etymology) 395
\par SYCOPHANT
\par Present meaning: self-seeking flatterer
\par Derived from: Greek sykon, fig; phantes, one who shows
\par Details of origin: Originally, a sycophant referred to an informer. Etymologists speculate that the term \'93figshower\'94
\par was used in this context because ancient Greeks, or sycophants, would act as informers against
\par merchants who were unlawfully exporting figs.
\par The process by which a word comes into being is called neologism or coinage. A new word is coined when it
\par is used by a large number of people for a significant amount of time. Though not a very specific and
\par measurable process, it is clearer when we look at three main reasons people begin using new words. First, new
\par words are created when two words are combined into one. For example, the word breakfast evolved from the
\par two words break and fast. Breakfast \'93breaks\'94 the \'93fast\'94 your body undergoes during the night. Other words
\par like roommate, housewife, stay-at-home, and doorbell were coined by the same process of combining multiple
\par words to form one.
\par The opposite process also forms new words. For example, the word ref is short for referee; gym is short
\par for gymnasium; and exam is short for examination. It is easy to imagine how shortened words become
\par coined\emdash as a society, we are always looking for shortcuts, and clipping words is a convenient shortcut.
\par New words are also coined to avoid confusion, most often between languages. For example, have you
\par ever wondered exactly where the tennis term love came from? It seems a strange term to use for scoring.
\par Tennis is originally a French game, and since a zero is egg-shaped, the French referred to it as l\rquote oeuf. This term
\par was confused in translation and only the pronunciation was adopted; English-speakers heard \'93love\'94 and it
\par stuck. Another example of confusion is the word maudlin, which means \'93tearfully sentimental.\'94 The word
\par evolved from the British English pronunciation of \'93Mary Magdalene.\'94 During the Middle Ages, one of the
\par popular plays depicted the life of the Bible\rquote s Mary Magdalene. Because the character was usually tearful in
\par every scene and, because the British pronunciation was \'93Maudlin,\'94 the term picked up this meaning.
\par The Life of a Word
\par Whatever the birth story, some words live exciting lives of change while others retain their original meaning.
\par Words can undergo changes by being clipped as mentioned above or by being combined with other words to
\par form completely new ones. Some words become more powerful. For example, the words filth and foul were
\par originally used to mean plain old \'93dirt.\'94 Originally, you might wipe down your kitchen counter at the end of
\par the day because it was filthy or foul. Today filthy and foul have taken on a more powerful meaning so that you
\par probably only associate filth and foul with the nearest garbage dump. Another example of a word that has
\par gained force is disaster. At one time, the word simply referred to \'93an unlucky event.\'94 Today, we hear the word
\par used in reference to \'93disaster areas\'94 resulting from earthquakes, floods, and tornadoes. There is much more
\par power associated with the word now.
\par Words can also lose power. Take the word mortify, for example. It originally meant \'93to make dead.\'94 Now
\par it can simply refer to a moment of humiliation: He was mortified when he realized that his zipper was down
\par during his important speech. Other words have powerful meanings, even as depicted in the dictionary, but in
\par everyday speech they are used rather casually. For example, the word atrocious by definition refers to
\par something that is \'93extremely savage or wicked.\'94 But you\rquote ve probably heard the word in reference to
\par someone\rquote s taste in style: Did you see that atrocious purple and green striped dress she was wearing?
\par Words gain power and they lose power. Words can also gain or lose a bad reputation. The word lewd has
\par gained a negative connotation over the years from its original reference to all laymen. From there it evolved to
\par present-day where it now encompasses things that are \'93indecent or obscene.\'94 On the other hand, marshal once
\par referred to a person who took care of horses. Over the years, the position gained more respect and now not only
\par refers to the person who controls parades, but also refers to someone in a high-ranking position such as a
\par sheriff.
\par In both the example of lewd and the example of marshal, not only did the meanings change from positive
\par to negative and vice versa, but they also changed in scope. Lewd became more narrow in its meaning, marshal
\par more broad. Butcher is another example of a word that has broadened in scope. A butcher was originally a man
\par who killed goats. Nowadays, you can expect to find a vast array of meats in a butcher shop. By contrast, the
\par TeamLRN
\par 396 GRE Prep Course
\par original meaning of disease was \'93ill at ease.\'94 The word has narrowed its scope over the years so that now it
\par refers to specific ailments and maladies.
\par What a boring language we would speak if words did not change in so many different ways! And how
\par mundane our speech would be if it were not colored with such flourishes as slang and colloquialisms. The
\par word slang was coined by combining the word slinging with the word language. Specific to certain countries,
\par even just to particular regions of a country, slang refers to very informal language. Slang should therefore not
\par be used in your graduate classes. Slang generally stays with the time and examples include such words as
\par yuppie, valleygirl, and phat. Slang can also include standard words that portray alternate, often ironic,
\par meanings; for example, the word bad when used as slang can describe something that is actually good. Think
\par of slang as language you would use only when you are chillin\rquote  (slang for \'93spending time with\'94) with your
\par closest friends
\par Colloquialisms are also informal although they are more widely accepted. Still, you should not use
\par colloquial speech in your graduate work. You could use colloquial language with those with whom you are
\par close but perhaps not quite as familiar as your best buddies\emdash your parents, for example. Instead of chillin\rquote  with
\par your family, you might hang out with them. Or you might tell a co-worker to give you a holler if he wants to
\par get together for lunch. Clearly, knowing your audience is important when choosing the language you will use.
\par Since your work on the GRE and in graduate school is for a formal audience, formal language should be
\par favored; avoid slang and colloquialisms.
\par You should also avoid overusing euphemisms, or \'93delicate\'94 language. In our world of political
\par correctness, there is a natural tendency to substitute \'93nice\'94 words for real words. For example, you might
\par describe a \'93domestic engineer\'94 who is \'93with child.\'94 Translation? A pregnant housewife. The best writing
\par conveys a real point clearly and therefore euphemisms should be used sparingly.
\par While slang, colloquialism, and euphemism, though informal, are ways to bring the personality of a
\par writer or speaker out in the open, a more subtle way to express such character is through connotative writing.
\par In comparison to denotative language, connotative words possess undertones of emotion. Denotation is factual.
\par Take the word gentleman, for example. Gentleman is a connotative word that contains much more meaning
\par than does the denotative word man. To picture a man is just to picture a male human. But to picture a
\par gentleman is to imagine a well-dressed man who brings flowers, opens doors, and pulls out chairs for his lady.
\par And of course a lady is not just a woman but a sophisticated female who is elegant and courteous, who quietly
\par laughs at the right time and crosses her legs when she sits down. A lady is lovely (connotative), not just pretty
\par (denotative).
\par How Words Die
\par Although certain words are seemingly immortal like and, the, and is, others do meet their death. When a word
\par meets its death, it becomes obsolete. The King James version of the Bible as well as any one of Shakespeare\rquote s
\par plays contains a vast sum of words that, today, are obsolete. Slang words and colloquialisms are also quick to
\par become obsolete. This is because slang and colloquialisms generally come into existence through trends.
\par Speaking trends fade in and fade out just as quickly as the latest fashion trends.
\par Some words do not fade away, but their meaning does. A well-known example of such a phenomenon is
\par the word gay, which at one time meant \'93happy.\'94 Today the word is used in reference to homosexuality. And
\par did you know that nice originally referred to something that was \'93silly\'94 or \'93foolish\'94? Other meanings of words
\par are surely on their way out as technology advances. For example, very few people actually \'93dial\'94 a number
\par into their phone because there are few rotary phones still in use. Along the same lines, singers no longer put
\par out \'93albums\'94 because we now have compact discs rather than records. It is probably just a matter of time until
\par these meanings die.
\par When you study the life of a word, it is easy to see that English is truly a unique language. Studying its history,
\par its life, and its patterns is both fascinating and helpful in learning to communicate effectively. Excelling in your
\par use of the English language in graduate school will contribute greatly to your success. Success in graduate
\par school will lead to success in your career which is your ultimate goal. Knowing this should make you all the
\par more diligent in your study of English and the words that make up the one true global language.
\par Antonyms II (Etymology) 397
\par Word Analysis
\par In addition to the study of word origin, etymology also involves word analysis, which is the process of
\par separating a word into its parts and then using the meanings of those parts to deduce the meaning of the
\par original word. Take, for example, the word INTERMINABLE. It is made up of three parts: a prefix IN (not),
\par a root TERMIN (stop), and a suffix ABLE (can do). Therefore, by word analysis, INTERMINABLE means
\par \'93not able to stop.\'94 This is not the literal meaning of INTERMINABLE (endless), but it is close enough to find
\par an antonym. For another example, consider the word RETROSPECT. It is made up of the prefix RETRO
\par (back) and the root SPECT (to look). Hence, RETROSPECT means \'93to look back (in time), to contemplate.\'94
\par Word analysis is very effective in decoding the meaning of words. However, you must be careful in its
\par application since words do not always have the same meaning as the sum of the meanings of their parts. In
\par fact, on occasion words can have the opposite meaning of their parts. For example, by word analysis the word
\par AWFUL should mean \'93full of awe,\'94 or awe-inspiring. But over the years it has come to mean just the
\par opposite\emdash terrible. In spite of the shortcomings, word analysis gives the correct meaning of a word (or at least
\par a hint of it) far more often than not and therefore is a useful tool.
\par Examples:
\par INDEFATIGABLE
\par Analysis: IN (not); DE (thoroughly); FATIG (fatigue); ABLE (can do)
\par Meaning: cannot be fatigued, tireless
\par CIRCUMSPECT
\par Analysis: CIRCUM (around); SPECT (to look)
\par Meaning: to look around, that is, to be cautious
\par ANTIPATHY
\par Analysis: ANTI (against); PATH (to feel); Y (noun suffix)
\par Meaning: to feel strongly against something, to hate
\par OMNISCIENT
\par Analysis: OMNI (all); SCI (to know); ENT (noun suffix)

\par Analogies I
\par In analogy questions, the relationship between the words is more important than the meanings of the words
\par themselves. Your task in answering an analogy question is to identify the relationship between the given
\par pair of words and then choose the answer-pair with the most similar relationship. Although esoteric
\par (difficult, known to only a few people) words can make an analogy problem difficult (but not impossible),
\par many of the hardest analogies involve simple, common words but with subtle relationships. Analogies are
\par probably the easiest type of question to improve on, in part, because they fall into nice patterns. Once you
\par become familiar with these patterns and become wise to the traps, you'll find yourself knocking off these
\par questions rapidly.
\par Strategy
\par Before You Look at the Answer-Choices, Think of a Short Sentence That Expresses the
\par Relationship Between the Two Words.
\par Example: FISH : SCHOOL ::
\par How are FISH and SCHOOL related? Well, a group of fish is called a school.
\par Example: JOURNALIST : TYPEWRITER ::
\par Paraphrase: A journalist uses a typewriter as a tool of his trade.
\par Example: ORCHESTRA : MUSICIAN ::
\par (A) story : comedian
\par (B) band : singer
\par (C) garden : leaf
\par (D) troupe : actor
\par (E) government : lawyer
\par Paraphrase: \'93An ORCHESTRA is comprised of MUSICIANS.\'94 Now, a STORY is not comprised of
\par COMEDIANS. Eliminate (A). A BAND may have a SINGER, but a BAND is not comprised of
\par SINGERS: there may be a drummer, guitarist, etc. Eliminate (B). Similarly, a GARDEN is comprised of
\par more than just LEAVES. Eliminate (C). But a TROUPE is comprised of ACTORS. The answer, therefore,
\par is (D).
\par Most students who, at first, struggle with analogies do so because they take a global view of the problem.
\par They read the problem as they would a reading passage, looking for the feel, tone, or general relationship
\par between the given words. However, analogies require an exactness and precision more similar to that used
\par in math. You are looking for a relationship between the given words. If more than one answer-choice fits
\par your inital paraphrase, hone it down until it captures a precise relationship between the given words. Don\rquote t
\par just choose the answer that feels right, instead adjust your paraphrase to capture the essence of the relationship,
\par and then apply it methodically to the answer-choices, eliminating any that do not fit the paraphrase.
\par TeamLRN
\par 416 GRE Prep Course
\par Strategy
\par If More Than One Answer-Choice Fits Your Paraphrase, Make Your Paraphrase
\par More Specific.
\par Example: CLUB : GOLF ::
\par (A) type : book
\par (B) ball : soccer
\par (C) glove : baseball
\par (D) racket : tennis
\par (E) board : chess
\par Paraphrase: \'93A CLUB is used to play GOLF.\'94 However, this paraphrase eliminates only answer-choice
\par (A). A more specific paraphrase is: A CLUB is used to strike a ball in the game of GOLF. Similarly, a
\par RACKET is used to strike a ball in the game of TENNIS. The answer is (D).
\par Words have different meanings and connotations for different people. So sometimes you may form a paraphrase
\par that does not work with any of the answer-choices. This may occur because you noticed a superficial
\par relationship between the words, but the test writers are looking for a subtle, deeper relationship. If your
\par paraphrase does not work for any of the answer-choices, try to think of unusual, often bookish, meanings of
\par the given words.
\par Strategy
\par For Analogies Involving Verbs, Try Forming a Paraphrase Using the Infinitive, or
\par \'93to\'94, form of the Verb. These Analogies Can Often Be Written with the Following
\par Structure: To ____ Is To ____ .
\par You may already use this technique naturally. However, identifying methods that we may use intuitively
\par increases our understanding of them and allows us to use them more efficiently.
\par Examples:
\par CRAWL : PROCEED
\par TO CRAWL is TO PROCEED slowly.
\par SKIM : READ
\par TO SKIM is TO READ quickly and superficially.
\par ASSUAGE : SORROW
\par TO ASSUAGE is TO soothe or lessen the SORROW of another.
\par Strategy
\par Don\rquote t Hesitate to Reverse the Order of the Given Words in Your Paraphrase.
\par When forming a paraphrase of the given pair, it is often more natural to mention the second word first. Of
\par course, the answer-choice must also be paraphrased in reverse order. Be alert to wrong answer-choices that
\par have the same relationship as the original pair but in the wrong order.
\par Example: POTTERY : SHARD ::
\par Paraphrase: A SHARD is a piece of broken POTTERY.
\par Example: SERMON : HOMILY ::
\par Paraphrase: A HOMILY is a long moralistic SERMON.
\par Strategy
\par If You Don't Recognize a Word, Use the Techniques We Discussed in the Antonym
\par Section to Conjure Its Meaning.
\par Analogies I 417
\par The parts of speech are consistent throughout an analogy problem. Hence, if the given pair is an adjective
\par and a noun, then each answer-pair will be an adjective and a noun, in that order. This helps you determine
\par the intended meaning when one (or both) of the given words belongs to more than one part of speech.
\par Example: PURIFY : DROSS ::
\par (A) defile : litter
\par (B) purge : rival
\par (C) align : objects
\par (D) effectuate : thespian
\par (E) vest : assets
\par You know what PURIFY means (to cleanse). But DROSS is probably less familiar. Does it perhaps mean
\par the opposite of PURIFY (to pollute). This would make it a verb, but all the second words in the answerchoice
\par pairs are nouns. So DROSS must be a noun as well. Perhaps DROSS is what is removed when
\par something is PURIFIED. Similarly, political RIVALS are removed in a PURGE. The answer is (B).

\par Strategy
\par If You Don't Recognize a Word, Use the Techniques We Discussed in the Antonym
\par Section to Conjure Its Meaning.
\par Educated guessing is a very useful technique on the GRE. If you can eliminate one or more answerchoices,
\par you will probably increase your score by guessing.
\par Example: CORROSION : IRON ::
\par (A) sloth : energy
\par (B) disease : vision
\par (C) atrophy : muscle
\par In choices (A) and (C) there are clear and reasonably necessary relationships between the words of each
\par pair: a SLOTHFUL person lacks ENERGY, and ATROPHY means \'93the wasting away of MUSCLE.\'94 But
\par in choice (B) there is no necessary relationship between the words: most DISEASES have no effect on
\par VISION. Hence, eliminate choice (B). The correct answer is (C) since CORROSION is the wasting away
\par of IRON, just as ATROPHY is the wasting away of MUSCLE.
\par Note!
\par Be careful when eliminating answer-choices to hard analogy problems because the relationship
\par may not be strong, or it may actually be between esoteric (rare) meanings of the words. This is
\par often what makes a hard analogy problem hard.
\par Study the following pairs of words that have no clear relationship between them.
\par (A) DESIRE : OPTIMIST :: (An optimist may or may not have desires.)
\par (B) REPUDIATE : FRIEND :: (One may or may not repudiate a friend, though typically one does not.)

\par Watch out!
\par Watch Out For Eye-Catchers
\par Unfortunately, the writers of the GRE often set traps by offering an answer-pair that reminds you of the
\par original pair but has a different relationship. The correct answer-pair, of course, will have the same relationship
\par as the original pair, but the words in the answer will typically be in an entirely different category.
\par The following diagram indicates how the relationship functions between the original pair and the correct
\par answer, and how the relationship functions between the original pair and the eye-catcher.
\par ANARCHY : GOVERNMENT
\par FREETHINKER : DOGMATIST
\par Correct Answer
\par ANARCHY : GOVERNMENT
\par TYRANNY : MONARCHY
\par Eye-catcher
\par MONARCHY is an eye-catcher since it reminds one of GOVERNMENT\emdash it\rquote s a type of government.
\par Now, a paraphrase for ANARCHY : GOVERNMENT is ANARCHY is the absence of GOVERNMENT.
\par Similarly, FREETHINKING is the absence of DOGMATIC thought. Notice that GOVERNMENT and
\par DOGMATIST are in different categories: a DOGMATIST is not a GOVERNMENT.
\par Example : EXCERPT : NOVEL ::
\par (A) critique : play
\par (B) review : manuscript
\par (C) swatch : cloth
\par (D) foreword : preface
\par (E) recital : performance
\par Notice how in answer-choice (B) MANUSCRIPT reminds you of NOVEL: a manuscript could be an
\par unpublished novel. However, a REVIEW is not part of a manuscript. Whereas, an EXCERPT is part of a
\par NOVEL. (What is the other eye-catcher in this problem?) The answer is (C).
\par Strategy
\par In Hard Problems, Eliminate any Answer-Choice That Reminds You of the Original
\par Pair.
\par Eye-catchers are sometimes the answer to easy problems; rarely are they the answer to medium problems;
\par and virtually never are they the answer to hard problems. When an average student guesses on a hard problem
\par he chooses an answer that reminds him of the original pair. But if the eye-catcher were the answer,
\par then the average student would get the problem correct and therefore it would not be a hard problem.
\par Example : EXORCISM : DEMON ::
\par (A) matriculation : induction
\par (B) banishment : member
\par (C) qualm : angel
\par (D) heuristic : method
\par (E) manifesto : spirit
\par This is a hard problem. Hence, eliminate any answer-choice that reminds you (however vaguely) of
\par DEMON. A DEMON is a SPIRIT. So eliminate choice (E). Next, choice (C) is not strictly speaking an
\par eye-catcher. But an ANGEL does remind one of a DEMON, and this is a hard problem. So eliminate
\par choice (C). Now, to EXORCISE a DEMON means to drive it away. Similarly, to a BANISH a MEMBER
\par of a group means to drive him or her away. The answer is (B).

\par Problem Set A:
\par 1. Paraphrase: \'93A COACH leads or heads a TEAM.\'94
\par Now, a COMPANY does not lead an EMPLOYEE\emdash 
\par eliminate (A). A GROUPIE does not lead or head a
\par BAND\emdash eliminate (B). However, a FOREMAN does
\par head a jury. The answer is (C).
\par 2. Paraphrase: \'93ANARCHY is the lack of GOVERNMENT.\'94
\par Now, a CONFEDERATION does not
\par lack STATES. However, TREPIDATION is the lack
\par of COURAGE. The answer is (B).
\par 3. Paraphrase: \'93A CHARISMATIC LEADER
\par GALVANIZES people.\'94 Likewise, an ARBITER
\par MODERATES. The answer is (E).
\par 4. Paraphrase: \'93A SENTENCE is made of
\par WORDS.\'94 Now, an ALBUM is not made of a GUITAR.
\par A MANUSCRIPT is not made of an EDITOR.
\par A PARAGRAPH is not made of PUNCTUATION. A
\par NOVEL is not made of an INDEX. However, a COLLAGE
\par is made of PAPER STRIPS. The answer is (E).
\par 5. To PARRY a BLOW is to deflect or evade it.
\par Similarly, to EQUIVOCATE is to evade a QUESTION.
\par The answer is (A).
\par 6. DISQUIETUDE is ANXIETY. Similarly, NONPLUS
\par is PERPLEXITY. The answer is (E).
\par Choice (B) is a close second-best. SEQUESTERED
\par does mean ISOLATED. However, the
\par pair NONPLUS and PERPLEXED offers a stronger
\par relationship because both words describe a mental
\par state, as do both words of the pair DISQUIETUDE and
\par ANXIOUS.
\par 7. To MILK something is to DRAIN it thoroughly.
\par Think of the phrase, \'93To milk it for all it\rquote s worth.\'94
\par Similarly, to EXPLOIT something is to EMPLOY it
\par thoroughly, to take full advantage of it. The answer is
\par (D).
\par 8. ABSTRUSE means UNCLEAR, hard to understand.
\par Similarly, NONDESCRIPT means INCONSPICUOUS.
\par The answer is (A).
\par 9. OMNISCIENT means all-knowing, unlimited
\par KNOWLEDGE. Similarly, BOUNDLESS means
\par unlimited EXPANSE. (The expanse of the universe is
\par boundless.) The answer is (E).
\par 10. To STOKE a fire is to stir it up or feed it. Hence,
\par STOKE and SMOTHER are antonyms. Now,
\par ANIMATE means to bring to life, to energize; and
\par ENERVATE means to weaken, to debilitate. Hence,
\par ANIMATE and ENERVATE are also antonyms. The
\par answer is (B).
\par Problem Set B:
\par 1. There is no clear and necessary relationship
\par between DEFINE and EASY. Defining something may
\par or may not be easy. This eliminates (A). Now, to
\par MUTTER is to speak INDISTINCTLY. Similarly, to
\par ARTICULATE is to speak CLEARLY. The answer is
\par (C). (Note: In this problem the eye-catcher is the
\par answer. Again, the eye-catcher can be the answer,
\par though it rarely is.)
\par 2. SPARTAN has little to do with WICKEDNESS.
\par So eliminate (C). Also BOLDNESS has little to do
\par with GUILT. Eliminate (D).
\par Now, EMPATHY is a type of FEELING. MELANCHOLY
\par is not a type of JOY\emdash eliminate (A). And
\par INSTITUTION is not a type of ENCOURAGEMENT\emdash 
\par eliminate (E). However, a SIBLING is a type
\par of RELATIVE. The answer is (B).
\par 3. There is no relationship between DISOWN and
\par FRIEND. One does not expect friends to disown each
\par other\emdash eliminate (B). Now, to DEVIATE from the
\par LECTURE is to go off the main topic, to digress.
\par Similarly, to MEANDER is to DRIVE off the main
\par path. The answer is (E).
\par TeamLRN
\par 422 GRE Prep Course
\par 4. There is no relationship between INSINCERE and
\par MISANTHROPE. A MISANTHROPE may or may
\par not be sincere. Eliminate (A). There is no relationship
\par between BENEVOLENT and EXCELLENCE. One
\par who is benevolent may or may not be excellent at what
\par he does. Eliminate (B). There is no relationship
\par between DISCERNING (having a perceiving mind)
\par and HOPE. Eliminate (D). There is no relationship
\par between COMPOSED and INNOCENCE. One who is
\par innocent may or may not be composed. Eliminate (E).
\par Hence, by process of elimination, the answer is (C).
\par However, let\rquote s verify the answer by constructing
\par a paraphrase. NEBULOUS means without FORM.
\par Similarly, INSIPID means without TASTE.
\par 5. There is no reasonably necessary relationship
\par between CONFIDENT and VICTORY. One may or
\par may not be confident about achieving a victory.
\par Eliminate (B). There is no relationship between
\par ELOQUENT and OPTIMISM. Eliminate (C). Now,
\par PENSIVE and MELANCHOLY are synonyms; both
\par mean \'93sad or contemplative.\'94 Likewise, SCORNFUL
\par and CONTEMPT are synonyms; both mean \'93disdain.\'94
\par The answer is (A).
\par 6. There is no relationship between CARTOONS
\par and INSTITUTION. Eliminate (C). Now, a COPYRIGHT
\par identifies the owner of a BOOK. Similarly, a
\par DEED identifies the owner of a PROPERTY. The
\par answer is (D).
\par Problem Set C:
\par 1. ADDRESS is an eye-catcher since it might remind
\par one of a SPEECH. DIGRESSION is also an eyecatcher
\par since one may digress during a SPEECH.
\par Now, a FILIBUSTER is a long SPEECH. Similarly, a
\par MARATHON is a long RACE. The answer is (A).
\par 2. Choice (A) is somewhat tempting: it\rquote s often said
\par that we are ENSLAVED by BUREAUCRACY, but
\par that is meant in a figurative, not a literal, sense.
\par Eliminate (A). Choice (B) does not have a reasonably
\par necessary relationship: a MONARCH may or may not
\par ABNEGATE (renounce) his or her crown. Eliminate
\par (B). Choice (C) is the eye-catcher: GENTRY reminds
\par one of ARISTOCRACY. However, there is no relationship
\par between GENTRY and TALENT. Eliminate
\par (C). Choice (D) is the answer. A paraphrase for
\par ARISTOCRAT : LAND might be \'93an ARISTOCRAT
\par has privilege in society because of LAND ownership.\'94
\par Similarly, a DIGNITARY has privilege in society due
\par to RANK.
\par 3. The eye-catcher is (A): CLANDESTINE has the
\par same meaning as SURREPTITIOUS. Now, SURREPTITIOUS
\par means secretive or STEALTHY.
\par Similarly, PERNICIOUS means injurious or BANEFUL.
\par The answer is (D).
\par 4. ERROR is the eye-catcher since it reminds one of
\par a FLAW. Now, a PECCADILLO is a minor character
\par FLAW. Similarly, a NICK can be interpreted as a
\par minor or small SCORE (a groove in metal or other
\par material that facilitates bending). The answer is (C).
\par 5. RAMPART is the eye-catcher since it reminds
\par one of a LEVEE. In fact, a LEVEE can be described as
\par a RAMPART\emdash both are embankments or barriers.
\par Now, a LEVEE contains a RIVER. Similarly, a
\par CORDON contains a THRONG. (Police cordoned off
\par the crowd.) The answer is (B).
\par 6. GENEROUS is the eye-catcher since it means
\par UNSTINTING. Hence, HEDONIST and UNSTINTING
\par are antonyms. Similarly, PROTAGONIST
\par (leading character) and INSIGNIFICANT are
\par antonyms. The answer is (A).
\par 7. Choices (B) and (E) are eye-catchers since they
\par contain terms related to sound. Now, DISSONANCE
\par refers to disorder in SOUND. Similarly, CHAOS
\par refers to disorder in a MIXTURE. The answer is (A).
\par 8. HARASS is the eye-catcher since it means to
\par HECTOR. Now, HECTOR and EQUANIMITY
\par (calmness of mind) are antonyms. Similarly, AFFIRM
\par (assert) and SCRUPLE (misgiving, doubt) are
\par antonyms. The answer is (C).
\par 9. HOAX is the eye-catcher since it means a RUSE.
\par Now, the purpose of a RUSE is to TRICK Similarly,
\par the purpose of PROCRASTINATING is to DELAY.
\par The answer is (A).
\par 10. GRIPE is the eye-catcher since it means to
\par COMPLAIN. Now, CARPING is COMPLAINING
\par continuously. Similarly, GLUTTONY is EATING
\par continuously. The answer is (C).
\par 11. LAVISH is the eye-catcher since it means
\par EXTRAVAGANT. Now, EXTRAVAGANT and
\par FRUGAL are antonyms. Similarly, VEHEMENT
\par (passionate) and STOLID (impassive) are antonyms.
\par The answer is (D).
\par 12. BULKY is the eye-catcher since it means
\par MASSIVE. Now, MODICUM (trifle) and MASSIVE
\par are antonyms. Similarly, RAPTURE and DISCONSOLATE
\par (sullen) are antonyms. The answer is (C).

\par Analogies II (Classification)
\par In the last section, we analyzed the structure of an analogy problem; in this section, we will analyze the
\par various types of analogies.
\par A. SYNONYMS
\par Synonyms are words that have similar meanings. True synonyms are from the same part of speech.
\par However, we will also classify as synonyms words which have similar meaning but come from different
\par parts of speech, for example: UNRULY (adjective) : LAWLESSNESS (noun).
\par Examples:
\par a. Clientele : Customers (Clientele are customers.)
\par b. Prevarication : Liar (To prevaricate is to lie.)
\par c. Surreptitious : Stealth (Surreptitious means \'93secret\'94 as does stealth.)
\par Example: PERSPICACIOUS : INSIGHT ::
\par (A) ardent : quickness
\par (B) warm : temperature
\par (C) wealthy : scarcity
\par (D) rapacious : magnanimity
\par (E) churlish : enmity
\par PERSPICACIOUS and INSIGHT are synonyms, both mean \'93sharp, keen of mind.\'94 Similarly, CHURLISH
\par and ENMITY are synonyms; both mean \'93dislike, rudeness.\'94 The answer is (E).
\par Problem Set A: Answers and solutions begin on page 440.

\par (D) entreat : controvert
\par (E) debate : heckle

\par 424 GRE Prep Course
\par B. ANTONYMS
\par Antonyms are words that have opposite meanings. Just as there are few (if any) exact synonyms, there are
\par few (if any) exact antonyms.
\par In the antonym pair EGOIST : ALTRUISM, an EGOIST is one who thinks only of himself, whereas
\par ALTRUISM is characteristic of one who thinks of all humanity. Often, however, the antonym pair are
\par direct opposites as in the pair REMAIN : DEPART.
\par Example: UNPRECEDENTED : PREVIOUS OCCURRENCE ::
\par (A) naive : harmony
\par (B) incomparable : equal
\par (C) improper : vacillation
\par (D) eccentric : intensity
\par (E) random : recidivism
\par UNPRECEDENTED means \'93without PREVIOUS OCCURRENCE.\'94 Similarly, INCOMPARABLE
\par means \'93without EQUAL.\'94 The answer is (B).
\par Note: In the other answer-pairs there is no clear relationship between the words. Hence, this problem
\par can also be solved by elimination, without even knowing the meanings of the original pair.
\par Problem Set B: Solutions begin on page 440. Note, not all problems in this exercise involve antonyms.
\par 1. INTUITIVE : CONSIDERED ::

\par (B) prudent : harmonious
\par (C) virile : feckless
\par (D) conformable : gross
\par (E) optimistic : sanguine
\par Analogies II (Classification) 425
\par C. MEMBER AND CLASS
\par Member and class analogies are usually easy problems. In this type of analogy, the first word may be an
\par element of the class that the second word describes, or vice versa. This category can also be classified as
\par \'93Type Of.\'94
\par Example: LIMERICK : POEM ::
\par (A) monologue : chorus
\par (B) sonnet : offering
\par (C) waltz : tango
\par (D) skull : skeleton
\par (E) aria : song
\par A LIMERICK is a type of POEM. Similarly, an ARIA is a type of SONG. The answer is (E). The eyecatcher
\par is SONNET since it is a type of POEM. However, there is no relationship between SONNET and
\par OFFERING.
\par Problem Set C: Solutions begin on page 440. Note, not all problems in this exercise are member-andclass
\par analogies.
\par 1. CONVOCATION : MEETING ::
\par (A) bargain : market
\par (B) supplication : prayer

\par 426 GRE Prep Course
\par D. DEGREE OF INTENSITY
\par The writers of the GRE consider these problems to be hard. However, once you get used to them, they can
\par become routine. In a degree-of-intensity analogy, the two words express a similar concept, but one word is
\par stronger, harsher, or more intense than the other.
\par Example: INTEREST : OBSESSION ::
\par (A) faith : caprice
\par (B) nonchalance : insouciance
\par (C) diligence : assiduity
\par (D) decimation : annihilation
\par (E) alacrity : procrastination
\par OBSESSION is extreme, unending INTEREST. Similarly, ANNIHILATION is complete DECIMATION.
\par The answer is (D). Note, DECIMATION does not mean complete destruction; it literally means the
\par destruction of one tenth of a population. By extension, it means widespread, but not complete, destruction.
\par Note!
\par The degree of intensity in the answer-pair must be the same as in the original pair. In the pair
\par INTEREST : OBSESSION the degree of intensity is from moderate to extreme; the same is true
\par of the pair DECIMATION : ANNIHILATION.
\par Example: RESOLUTE : WILL ::
\par (A) violent : peacefulness
\par (B) fanatic : concern
\par (C) balky : contrary
\par (D) notorious : infamy
\par (E) virtuous : wholesomeness
\par RESOLUTE means \'93very strong-WILLED.\'94 So the degree of intensity is from strong to moderate.
\par Similarly, FANATIC means \'93having a very strong, excessive CONCERN for a cause.\'94 The answer is (B).
\par Problem Set D: Solutions begin on page 441.
\par 1. EAT : GORGE ::
\par (A) sprint : jog
\par (B) snicker : smirk
\par (C) read : write
\par (D) disengage : attack
\par (E) drink : guzzle
\par 2. HELPFUL : OFFICIOUS ::
\par (A) difficult : incorrigible
\par (B) maudlin : sardonic
\par (C) apathetic : zealous
\par (D) true : contrary
\par (E) friendly : amiable
\par 3. SATURATE : DAMPEN ::
\par (A) contaminate : pollute
\par (B) besmirch : sully
\par (C) extol : praise
\par (D) waive : donate
\par (E) pronounce : presume
\par 4. SHOWER : CLOUDBURST ::
\par (A) wave : storm
\par (B) sound : noise
\par (C) censure : admonishment
\par (D) shard : pottery
\par (E) recession : depression
\par 5. GROW : BURGEON ::
\par (A) secede : assent
\par (B) exhort : enjoin
\par (C) relish : abound
\par (D) befriend : attest
\par (E) lop : instate
\par 6. PATRIOTIC : NATIONALISTIC ::
\par (A) prophetic : gratified
\par (B) hideous : aesthetic
\par (C) frugal : miserly
\par (D) sordid : adept
\par (E) sylvan : inclusive
\par Analogies II (Classification) 427
\par E. PART TO WHOLE
\par In this type of analogy, the first word is part of the second word. The order can also be whole to part.
\par Example: ATOM : MATTER ::
\par (A) neutron : proton
\par (B) vegetable : animal
\par (C) molecule : element
\par (D) component : system
\par (E) pasture : herd
\par MATTER is made up of ATOMS. Similarly, a SYSTEM is made up of COMPONENTS. The answer is
\par (D). Choice (C) is second-best. A molecule is made of elements, but the direction here is the reverse of
\par that in the original pair. Be wary of the pair NEUTRON : PROTON it is an eye-catcher: both words
\par remind you of an ATOM. However, a NEUTRON is not part of a PROTON, nor vice versa.
\par Example: ACTORS : TROUPE ::
\par (A) plotters : cabal
\par (B) professors : tenure
\par (C) workers : bourgeoisie
\par (D) diplomats : government
\par (E) directors : cast
\par A TROUPE is a group of ACTORS. Similarly, a CABAL is a group of PLOTTERS. The answer is (A).
\par Be wary of the pair DIRECTORS : CAST it\rquote s an eye-catcher: CAST reminds one of TROUPE. In fact, a
\par TROUPE is a CAST.
\par Problem Set E: Solutions begin on page 441. Note, not all problems in this exercise are part-to-whole
\par analogies.
\par 1. PARAGRAPH : ESSAY ::
\par (A) trailer : automobile
\par (B) query : question
\par (C) instrument : surgery
\par (D) penmanship : essay
\par (E) shot : salvo
\par 2. COMPOUND : BUILDING ::
\par (A) classroom : campus
\par (B) department : government
\par (C) tapestry : fabric
\par (D) seed : vegetable
\par (E) commonwealth : country
\par 3. CONSTELLATION : STARS ::
\par (A) amplifier : hearing
\par (B) ocean : water
\par (C) mosaic : tile
\par (D) tracks : train
\par (E) book : paper
\par 4. ACCELERATE : VELOCITY ::
\par (A) relinquish : assets
\par (B) energize : stamina

\par (A) fidget : uneasiness
\par (B) inspirit : confidence
\par (C) indulge : vacillation
\par (D) quail : intrepidity

\par F. DEFINITION
\par This is probably the most common type of analogy problem. In a definitional analogy one of the words can
\par be used to define the other.
\par Example 1: COFFER : VALUABLES ::
\par (A) mountain : avalanche
\par (B) book : paper
\par (C) vault : trifles
\par (D) sanctuary : refuge
\par (E) sea : waves
\par By definition, a coffer is a container in which to store valuables. Similarly, a SANCTUARY is by
\par definition a place of REFUGE. The answer is (D).
\par Sometimes the definition is only partial: stating only one of the characteristics of the word.
\par Example 2: LION : CARNIVORE ::
\par (A) man : vegetarian
\par (B) ape : ponderer
\par (C) lizard : mammal
\par (D) buffalo : omnivore
\par (E) shark : scavenger
\par A defining characteristic of a LION is that it is CARNIVOROUS, meat-eating. Similarly, a defining
\par characteristic of a SHARK is that it is a SCAVENGER. The answer is (E).

\par G. LACK OF
\par This sub-category of the definition type of analogy is important and common enough to warrant a name. In
\par this type of analogy one word describes the absence of the other word.
\par Example: ANARCHISM : GOVERNMENT (Anarchy is by definition the absence of government.)
\par Example: ANONYMOUS : NAME (Anonymous means without name.)
\par Example: DISHEARTENED : HOPE ::
\par (A) enervated : ennui
\par (B) buoyant : effervescence
\par (C) amoral : ethics
\par (D) munificent : altruism
\par (E) nefarious : turpitude
\par DISHEARTENED means without HOPE. Likewise, AMORAL means without ETHICS. The answer is
\par (C). Note, AMORAL does not mean immoral. If you commit an AMORAL act, you are not aware that
\par you actions are unethical; whereas if you commit an immoral act, then you realize that your actions are
\par wrong.

\par (A) curt : incivility
\par (B) apathetic : zest
\par (C) immaculate : brevity

\par the answer is (D).

\par means \'93to lessen the quality of something,\'94 and

\par Sentence Completions
\par The sentence completions form the most straightforward part of the test, and most students do well on
\par them. You will get about 6 sentence completions on the test.
\par Before You Look at The Answer-Choices, Think of a Word That \'93Fits\'94 The Sentence
\par Example :
\par Crestfallen by having done poorly on the GRE, Susan began to question her abilities. Her selfconfidence
\par was .
\par (A) appeased
\par (B) destroyed
\par (C) placated
\par (D) elevated
\par (E) sustained
\par If somebody is crestfallen (despairing) and has begun to question herself, then her self-confidence would be
\par destroyed. Hence, the answer is (B).
\par If a Sentence Has Two Blanks, Plug in the First Word in Each Answer-Choice, Eliminating
\par any that Don't Make sense.
\par After eliminating the answer-choices that don't make sense with the first word plugged in, turn to the
\par remaining answer-choices and plug in the second word.
\par Example :
\par The plane had been redesigned so many times before it reached the assembly line that its
\par conception was no longer .
\par (A) appropriate . . visible
\par (B) dilapidated . . relevant
\par (C) original . . recognizable
\par (D) initial . . understandable
\par (E) promised . . viable
\par An \'93appropriate conception\'94 does not make sense in this context, eliminate (A). A \'93dilapidated
\par conception\'94 probably does not make sense in any context, eliminate (B). A \'93promised conception\'94 is an
\par odd construction, probably eliminate. Now, \'93original\'94 and \'93initial\'94 both work in the first blank. However,
\par \'93understandable\'94 does not make sense in the second blank. A redesign could clarify the original design,
\par but it's hard to imagine how it would make the original design unintelligible, eliminate (D). Finally,
\par \'93recognizable\'94 does make sense. Since the plane was redesigned many times, is it likely to look quite
\par different from its original design. The answer is (C).
\par Most often the answer-choices to sentence completion problems are not simple or common words, that is,
\par words we use in daily speech. Nevertheless, don\rquote t hesitate to use a common word. Although an everyday
\par word is unlikely to be the answer, it will help guide you to the answer. Further, it will help eliminate wrong
\par answer-choices.
\par Sentence Completions 447
\par Be Alert to Transitional Words
\par Transitional words tell you what is coming up. They indicate that the author is now going to draw a contrast
\par with something stated previously, or support something stated previously.
\par Contrast Indicators
\par To contrast two things is to point out how they differ. In this type of sentence completion problem, we look
\par for a word that has the opposite meaning (an antonym) of some key word or phrase in the sentence.
\par Following are some of the most common contrast indicators:
\par BUT YET
\par DESPITE ALTHOUGH
\par HOWEVER NEVERTHELESS
\par WHEREAS IN CONTRAST
\par Example :
\par Although the warring parties had settled a number of disputes, past experience made them
\par to express optimism that the talks would be a success.
\par (A) rash (B) ambivalent (C) scornful (D) overjoyed (E) reticent
\par \'93Although\'94 sets up a contrast between what has occurred\emdash success on some issues\emdash and what can be
\par expected to occur\emdash success for the whole talks. Hence, the parties are reluctant to express optimism. The
\par common word \'93reluctant\'94 is not offered as an answer-choice, but a synonym\emdash reticent\emdash is. The answer is
\par (E).
\par Example :
\par Rather than increasing its security by developing nuclear weapons, a nascent nuclear power is viewed
\par as a by its enemies.
\par (A) benefactor (B) protector (C) target (D) patron (E) non entity
\par The phrase \'93rather than\'94 sets up a contrast between what a country hopes to achieve by developing nuclear
\par weapons (increased security) and what it actually achieves (becoming a target). The answer is (C).
\par Support Indicators
\par Supporting words support or further explain what has already been said. These words often introduce
\par synonyms for words elsewhere in the sentence. Following are some common supporting words:
\par AND ALSO INDEED
\par FURTHERMORE LIKEWISE SIMILARLY
\par IN ADDITION FOR TRULY
\par Example :
\par Davis is an opprobrious and speaker, equally caustic toward friend or foe\emdash a true
\par curmudgeon.
\par (A) lofty (B) vituperative (C) unstinting (D) retiring (E) laudatory
\par \'93And\'94 in the sentence indicates that the missing adjective is similar in meaning to \'93opprobrious,\'94 which is
\par very negative. Now, vituperative\emdash the only negative word\emdash means \'93abusive.\'94 Hence, the answer is (B).
\par Example :
\par The belief that sanctions and tactical military strikes can turn the people of a country against a dictator
\par is folly; indeed, as we are witnessing in the Balkans, this causes the population to rally
\par around the dictator.
\par (A) sometimes (B) rarely (C) invariably (D) never (E) occasionally
\par \'93Indeed\'94 in the sentence indicates that the second clause supports and emphasizes what is stated in the first
\par clause: that sanctions and tactical military strikes will not work. Now, something that will not work will
\par invariably (always) fail. The answer is (C).
\par TeamLRN
\par 448 GRE Prep Course
\par Cause And Effect Indicators
\par These words indicate that one thing causes another to occur. Some of the most common cause and effect
\par indicators are
\par BECAUSE FOR ACCORDINGLY
\par THUS HENCE CONSEQUENTLY
\par THEREFORE IF , THEN . DUE TO
\par Example :
\par Because the Senate has the votes to override a presidential veto, the President has no choice but to
\par .
\par (A) object
\par (B) abdicate
\par (C) abstain
\par (D) capitulate
\par (E) compromise
\par Since the Senate has the votes to pass the bill or motion, the President would be wise to compromise and
\par make the best of the situation. The answer is (E).
\par Apposition
\par This rather advanced grammatical structure is very common on the GRE. (Don\rquote t confuse \'93apposition\'94 with
\par \'93opposition\'94: they have opposite meanings.)
\par Words or phrases in apposition are placed next to each other, and the second word or phrase defines,
\par clarifies, or gives evidence to the first word or phrase. The second word or phrase will be set off from the
\par first by a comma, semicolon, hyphen, or parentheses. Note: If a comma is not followed by a linking
\par word\emdash such as and, for, yet\emdash then the following phrase is probably appositional.
\par Identifying an appositional structure, can greatly simplify a sentence completion problem since the
\par appositional word, phrase, or clause will define the missing word.
\par Example :
\par His novels are ; he uses a long circumlocution when a direct coupling of a simple
\par subject and verb would be best.
\par (A) prolix
\par (B) pedestrian
\par (C) succinct
\par (D) vapid
\par (E) risqu\'e9
\par The sentence has no linking words (such as because, although, etc.). Hence, the phrase following the
\par semicolon is in apposition to the missing word\emdash it defines or further clarifies the missing word. Now,
\par writing filled with circumlocutions is aptly described as prolix. The answer is (A).
\par Example :
\par Robert Williams\rquote  style of writing has an air of : just when you think the story line is
\par predictable, he suddenly takes a different direction. Although this is often the mark of a beginner,
\par Williams pulls it off masterfully.
\par (A) ineptness
\par (B) indignation
\par (C) reserve
\par (D) jollity
\par (E) capriciousness
\par There is no connecting word following the colon. Hence, the description, \'93just when you think the story
\par line is predictable, he suddenly takes a different direction,\'94 defines the missing word. Now, something that
\par is unpredictable because it\rquote s continually changing direction is capricious. Thus, the answer is (E).

\par 1. If the public expects a comedian to always
\par make them laugh, then they might not accept a

\par dramatic role. The answer is (C).
\par 2. The phrase \'93all but\'94 implies that the debate
\par was a make-or-break event for the candidate.
\par Suppose the candidate did well. Then his spirits
\par would be high, and we would expect the missing
\par word to be positive. However, a positive word in
\par the phrase \'93all but any hope\'94 is awkward.
\par Hence, the candidate must have done
\par poorly in the debate and had his hopes for election
\par nixed. So we turn to the answer-choices
\par looking for \'93nixed.\'94 It\rquote s not there, but a
\par synonym\emdash nullifies\emdash is. The answer is (A).
\par 3. Since no connecting word\emdash such as and, for,
\par so, etc.\emdash follows the comma, the phrase
\par \'93seemingly with an endless reserve of energy\'94
\par defines the missing word. Now, a person with an
\par endless reserve of energy would be lively, which
\par is the meaning of \'93vivacious.\'94 The answer is
\par (B).
\par 4. \'93Despite\'94 sets up a contrast between the key
\par phrase \'93uplifting experience\'94 and the missing
\par word. The implication is that in spite of the
\par rewards, the job is harsh and trying; in other
\par words, rigorous. The answer is (D).
\par 5. \'93Yet\'94 draws a contrast between what one
\par would expect an Atheist to do (renounce faith in
\par God) and what Liharev did (maintained faith in
\par God). In other words, he did not lose faith in
\par God. The answer is (B).
\par 6. To rationalize evil is to make excuses for
\par wrong doing. Now, the words following the
\par colon explain how existentialism can be used to
\par excuse or justify evil. The answer is (D).
\par 7. The phrase \'93who would have believed\'94
\par implies that the reality is the opposite of what
\par one would expect. Now, one would not expect
\par the drab DMV to be a catalyst for creativity. The
\par answer is (A).
\par 8. The sentence implies that even when
\par Erikson knows he is taking the wrong path in
\par life, he still cannot stop. That is, he cannot exert

\par connotations or implications. The answer is (D).
\par 11. The passage states that when sitting behind
\par his desk J. Egar Hoover looked larger than he
\par actually was. So the perspective must have
\par increased the appearance of his size. The only

\par The answer is (A).
\par 12. Since man is violent, any useful theory of
\par conflict resolution must incorporate this fact.
\par The answer is (C).
\par 13. The clause \'93whereas in a totalitarian regime,
\par no one is listening\'94 implies that a democracy
\par does listen to protests. In other words, it is sensitive
\par to protests. The answer is (D).
\par 14. \'93Although\'94 sets up a contrast between what
\par the property values are (high) and what one
\par would expect them to be in a dilapidated (run

\par 18. The clause \'93a desire not to show any deference
\par to the other side\'94 implies that the issue was
\par who would win not who was right. So the
\par placement of the comma did not affect the specific
\par meaning of the sentence. The answer is
\par (A).
\par 19. A financial scandal is an indiscretion; and it
\par may not have made the front page because the

\par 23. We are told that the author is gracious, yet

\par 36. Printing something that is untrue would
\par reflect negatively on the editor, so he hesitated to
\par print the articles because they were
\par \'93improbable.\'94 The answer is (C). \'93Indecisive\'94
\par could also be the reason the editor hesitated to
\par print the articles, but \'93improbable\'94 is a stronger
\par reason not to publish an article. One of the jobs
\par of an editor is to verify the truth of an article.
\par Publishing false material could subject the editor
\par to ridicule or even legal action.
\par 37. The word \'93as\'94 in the sentence indicates that
\par the missing word is explained or defined by the
\par clause that follows it: \'93they do not complain
\par about menial chores given to them or about harsh
\par treatment meted out.\'94 This aptly describes a
\par \'93docile\'94 person. The answer is (E).
\par 38. The conjunction \'93and\'94 in the phrase
\par \'93Despite its _______ and safety\'94 indicates that
\par the missing word has a positive meaning because
\par \'93safety\'94 has a positive meaning. Since the
\par sentence is implying that the drug is useful in
\par curing depression and anxiety, it is expected that
\par the drug would be widely used. But \'93despite\'94
\par implies that the drug is not widely \'93accepted.\'94
\par The answer is (E).
\par 39. The word \'93age\'94 in the sentence implies that
\par the missing word is characteristic of age.
\par \'93Youthful\'94 fits well: Despite her advanced age,
\par she has a youthful sense of humor. The answer is
\par (E). \'93Adolescent\'94 could also work in the
\par sentence, but the phrase \'93adolescent sense of
\par humor\'94 carries a negative connotation, and the
\par sentence does not seem to be critical.
\par 40. The word \'93and\'94 in the phrase \'93different and
\par ________ versions\'94 indicates that the missing
\par word is similar in meaning to the word
\par \'93different.\'94 Now, different versions of an event
\par can be \'93conflicting.\'94 Further, a dastardly act
\par needs to be condemned \'93unequivocally.\'94 The
\par answer is (D).
\par 41. The show was organized to tell the stories of
\par successful celebrities. By \'93profiling\'94 these
\par celebrities, the show narrates the stories of the
\par \'93influential\'94 newsmakers from all walks of life.
\par The answer is (B).
\par 42. Since hyenas eat carrion (decaying flesh),
\par they have an \'93appetite\'94 for it. A society ruled by
\par females is called \'93matriarchal.\'94 The answer is
\par (D).
\par 43. The word \'93both\'94 in the statement implies
\par there are two different types of sunscreen. Since
\par one is internal, the other one should be external
\par or at least of a different type. The choices
\par \'93territorial,\'94 \'93atmospheric,\'94 and \'93regional\'94 do
\par not imply the opposite of internal. \'93Polar\'94 and
\par \'93tropical\'94 may indicate other varieties.
\par Sunscreens are not used in polar regions; they are
\par used in tropical regions. Hence, the answer is
\par (B).
\par 44. The first sentence describes AIDS as a big
\par threat; it also describes another disease that is
\par unreported and is on a greater rampage. Yet, the
\par author says there is a cure for this silent killer. It
\par is ironic that the silent killer causes more harm
\par than AIDS, yet it is curable. The answer is (D).
\par 45. The statement implies that Julian is certainly
\par not the greatest American actor. To believe him
\par to be the greatest actor would be to indulge in
\par \'93hyperbole.\'94 The answer is (D).
\par 46. The word \'93only\'94 in the first clause limits the
\par meaning of courage: They have courage, but
\par only to a point. The word \'93bluff\'94 in the second
\par clause indicates that their courage is merely
\par bluster. This is the meaning of \'93bravado.\'94 The
\par answer is (E).
\par 47. The phrase \'93too complex for\'94 indicates that
\par the missing word should have the opposite
\par meaning of the word \'93complex.\'94 The opposite of
\par complex is simple. Now, \'93facile\'94 means simplistic,
\par superficial. The answer is (A).
\par 48. The second clause states that worldwide
\par steps are being taken to ban plastic. The word
\par \'93and\'94 joining the two clauses of the sentence
\par indicates that the first clause should provide a
\par reason for the worldwide ban of plastic. The
\par reason is that plastic is proving to be a menace to
\par the environment. The second blank needs to be
\par filled by a word that supports the statement and
\par shows the negative consequences of plastic
\par usage. The suitable word is \'93non-ecofriendly.\'94
\par The answer is (C).
\par 49. The word \'93while\'94 indicates a contrast
\par between what is expressed in the first clause
\par (welcoming the move) and what is expressed in
\par the second clause (opposing the move). The

\par 50. Man is a social being; and to function properly,
\par he needs to be an integral part of society.
\par When a person fails to integrate himself into
\par society, he often feels alienated and incomplete,
\par which, without a social support system, can lead
\par to suicide. The author believes that those who
\par commit suicide do so because they are unable to
\par integrate themselves into the society. The answer
\par is (E).
\par 51. The author states that some people are born
\par with an inclination to commit suicide. Though
\par the remaining people who have committed
\par suicide do not have such a predisposition, they
\par commit it because they are unable to bear sudden
\par cataclysmic changes that occur in their lives. The
\par answer is (C).
\par 52. According to the author, the core issue
\par involves a hard, practical point that is to be dealt
\par with a pragmatic approach. Pragmatism means
\par \'93practical approach.\'94 The author stresses the
\par immediacy of the situation since it is raising lifethreatening

\par 53. One would reasonably assume (preconceive)
\par that a state where parents are alleged to have sold
\par their children in exchange for food is an
\par \'93impoverished\'94 state. The answer is (C). Note,
\par (D) is the second-best choice. Although an
\par impoverished state is probably impotent, impoverished
\par describes the situation better. Further, the
\par sentence does not imply that the preconceived
\par notions of the state were unwarranted (not
\par justified).
\par 54. The sentence implies that the location,
\par though having splendid natural settings, is
\par distressed by the ongoing battle. We can observe
\par from the structure of the sentence that both
\par blanks explain the natural beauty of the location.
\par The author implies that if the location had no
\par overtones of the battlefield, it would have been a
\par \'93picturesque\'94 airfield in an \'93exquisite\'94 part of
\par the North. The answer is (D).

\par How to Get a \'93Top-Half\'94 Score
\par Writing essays for standardized exams can raise anxieties in people who are poised when answering other
\par kinds of test questions. Perhaps this is because critical and creative skills are being tested and evaluated in
\par a more subjective manner than they are within the objective multiple-choice format. Performance anxiety
\par can lead to a host of problems, from having a difficult time understanding exactly what is being asked to
\par having debilitating uncertainties about how to begin an answer.
\par The best way to reduce such anxieties, and therefore increase your chance of obtaining a top-half score,
\par is through rehearsal, which encompasses four activities that need to take place before taking the GRE:
\par 1) understanding the two writing tasks and how they differ
\par 2) knowing what the evaluators expect to find in top-half essays
\par 3) anticipating an organizational scheme for each of the two essays
\par 4) writing out at least one answer for each of the two question types
\par Having completed these four steps, you will be in an excellent position to approach the Analytical Writing
\par Test with confidence and competency.

\par Introduction
\par The Analytical Writing Section requires you to respond to two essay questions within 75 minutes. The first
\par section, Present Your Perspective on an Issue (45 minutes), asks that you discuss the complexities of an
\par issue and take a position on the problem. The second section, Analyze an Argument (30 minutes), asks that
\par you evaluate an argument or critique a line of reasoning. You are not required to agree or disagree with the
\par argument, but you must clearly point out the strengths and weaknesses in the argument.
\par ETS has an official Web site, www.gre.org, where you can view the pool of topic questions from
\par which the questions on your test will be randomly drawn. It is helpful to review this list of questions, but do
\par not try to write a sample essay for each topic because the list of topics is much too extensive. Moreover, the
\par wording of the question on the test may be altered, so it is best just to become familiar with the kind of
\par topics and arguments you will be required to address. The more familiar you are with the material that will
\par be on the test, the more prepared and confident you\rquote ll be on test day.
\par You will type your essay on a computer using a very basic word processor. The Analytical Writing
\par Section starts with a tutorial that shows how the word processor works. You may write your essay on the
\par computer or on paper supplied at the center. However, handwritten essays can take up to six weeks to be
\par scored. After completing the Issue section, you may move on to the Argument section. There is no break
\par between sections, and, once you exit either section, you cannot return, even if you finish with time
\par remaining.
\par Scoring the Analytical Writing Section
\par Your Issue and Argument scores are combined into one average score that is reported to the colleges.
\par Although you can view your math and verbal scores at the test center shortly after the test, your analytical
\par writing score will not be available until 10\endash 15 days after the test.
\par Each of your two essays will be graded holistically, receiving a score between 0 and 6. With the
\par holistic grading method, papers are read quickly and a score is assigned based on the general impact of the
\par writing on the reader. Papers awarded 6's are considered to be outstanding, 5's are strong, 4's are adequate,
\par 3's are limited, 2's are seriously flawed, and 1's are fundamentally deficient. Notice that papers graded with
\par \'93top-half\'94 scores\emdash 4, 5, or 6\emdash are described as having positive attributes, whereas papers receiving
\par \'93bottom-half\'94 scores\emdash 1, 2, or 3\emdash are described as being problematic.
\par Before we begin studying particular essays, we need to review some fundamentals of sentence structure and
\par punctuation. No matter how inspired an essay is, its score may be hurt by punctuation errors that make the
\par essay difficult to read or inadvertently change its intended meaning.
\par TeamLRN
\par 508 GRE Prep Course
\par Punctuation
\par Although you can receive a high score on the Analytical Writing Section even if your essays contain some
\par grammatical errors, the official guidelines indicate that grammar is given some weight in the scoring.
\par Knowing the rules that govern punctuation will reduce your error rate dramatically. Moreover, knowledge
\par of grammar and punctuation will be invaluable in your graduate writing, where mistakes can be costly. In
\par this section, we will discuss the most commonly used punctuation marks: commas, semicolons, colons,
\par dashes, apostrophes, and quotation marks. We will also discuss the use of punctuation to correct run-on
\par sentences and sentence fragments.
\par Commas
\par Use a comma:
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9026\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  (Rule 1) in series and lists.
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9026\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  (Rule 2) after an introductory phrase.
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9026\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  (Rule 3) to set off nonrestrictive clauses.
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9026\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  (Rule 4) to set off interjections and transitional phrases.
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9026\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  (Rule 5) with a coordinating conjunction to separate two independent clauses.
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9026\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  Rule 1 \endash  Use a comma to separate each item in a series or list of three or more words, phrases, or
\par clauses. Also, use commas with descriptive words where two or more adjectives modify the same
\par noun.
\par Example:
\par I made the beds, swept the floors, vacuumed the carpet, and scrubbed the bathtub to get
\par ready for our guests. Then I went shopping to stock the refrigerator with drinks,
\par vegetables, and fruit. I hope I\rquote m ready to welcome them into our home and to have a
\par great visit.
\par In this example, the four underlined clauses in the opening series are separated by commas, and the three
\par underlined words in the list are separated by commas. Notice that the concluding sentence does not contain
\par any commas. In this sentence, the clause to welcome them into our home and the clause to have a great visit
\par are part of a series of only two elements and are simply separated by the conjunction and. Note that a series
\par of words or phrases is marked by a relationship between the elements, whereas a list is simply a notation of
\par two or more words that may or may not be related. For instance, in the example above, the first sentence
\par contains a series of clauses. Each clause is related because they are all actions that the person took. The
\par second sentence contains a list of items such as you would take to the grocery store.
\par Commas are also used with descriptive words. Use a comma in a series of two or more adjectives that
\par modify the same noun.
\par Example:
\par The long, narrow, winding road lead to a beautiful, serene lake.
\par In this example, long, narrow, and winding are adjectives that all modify the noun road. Thus, they are
\par separated by commas. Likewise, beautiful and serene modify lake and are separated by commas. Note that
\par Analytical Writing 509
\par no comma follows the last adjective in the series; also be careful in determining the function of the last
\par word of the series. You must make sure that all the adjectives equally modify the noun. For example,
\par Before you watch TV, I want you to clean the dirty, grimy kitchen sink.
\par In this example, kitchen sink acts as a single noun because without kitchen, sink is not adequately identified.
\par Therefore, grimy is the last adjective before the noun in the series and no comma should be placed after it.
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9193\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  Check your work
\par Look through your work for any series of words, phrases or clauses. If there are two or more of these
\par elements, place a comma after all but the last one.
\par Example (without punctuation):
\par He thought taking a road trip would help him feel rejuvenated allow him to work through
\par his feelings and provide some much needed solitude in which to get his studying done.
\par Here the three clauses are underlined. Once you have identified these clauses, you should place commas
\par after each clause except the last one:
\par He thought taking a road trip would help him feel rejuvenated, allow him to work through
\par his feelings, and provide some much needed solitude in which to get his studying done.
\par This example contains a list of adjectives:
\par She looked longingly through the window at the lovely elegant pearl necklace.
\par First, identify the list of words: lovely, elegant, and pearl modify necklace. Now confirm that each
\par adjective equally modifies the noun necklace. To do this, insert the word and in between each adjective:
\par She looked longingly through the window at the lovely and elegant and pearl necklace.
\par Clearly, the sentence does not make sense with the and between elegant and pearl. Therefore, you should
\par place the commas appropriately:
\par She looked longingly through the window at the lovely, elegant pearl necklace.
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9026\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  Rule 2 \endash  Use a comma to set off an introductory word, phrase, or clause from the independent clause
\par that follows. Introductory elements that require a comma are prepositional phrases, subordinating
\par clauses, transitional words or phrases, and verbal phrases.
\par A prepositional phrase begins with a preposition and includes any modifiers or objects. Prepositional
\par phrases usually signal a relationship, particularly a relationship of time or location.
\par Examples:
\par In the movie Titanic, Leonardo di Caprio\rquote s character Jack dies.
\par Since the accident last year, she has been afraid to drive on the highway.
\par Both introductory clauses in these examples begin with prepositions. The clauses indicate a relationship of
\par location (In the movie\'85) and time (Since the accident\'85) between the introductory phrases and the
\par independent clauses that follow. Therefore, they must be set off by commas.
\par A subordinating clause begins with a subordinator, which is a word that indicates a relationship\emdash usually a
\par relationship of time or location\emdash between the clause it begins and the independent clause that follows. This
\par relationship makes a subordinating clause similar to a prepositional phrase. However, unlike a prepositional
\par phrase, a subordinating clause can also be referred to as a dependent clause because it has both a subject
\par and a verb. It is a dependent clause, not an independent clause, because it cannot stand alone as a sentence.
\par TeamLRN
\par 510 GRE Prep Course
\par Example:
\par When I first entered the workforce, we didn\rquote t have all the modern technological conveniences
\par that make today\rquote s business world move at such a rapid pace.
\par Here the phrase When I first entered the workforce begins with the subordinator When, which signals a time
\par relationship between the subordinating clause and the independent clause that follows. Although this clause
\par has a subject (I) and a verb (entered), it cannot stand alone as a sentence and requires the independent
\par clause to complete the thought. Here is another example:
\par Before I had a chance to answer, he snatched the paper out of my hands and threw it in
\par the fire.
\par Here again an introductory subordinating clause requires the independent clause to complete the sentence.
\par In both examples, a comma is required to set off the subordinating clause from the independent clause.
\par Transitional words and phrases add coherence to your writing. They help connect one sentence to the next.
\par A comprehensive list of transitional words and phrases appears later in this chapter, but here are some of
\par the most commonly used transitions: finally, furthermore, moreover, and next indicate sequence; again,
\par likewise, and similarly indicate comparison; although, but, however, by contrast, and on the other hand
\par indicate contrast; for example, in fact, and specifically indicate examples; accordingly, as a result, consequently,
\par and therefore indicate cause and effect.
\par Example:
\par Dear Employees,
\par I am writing to tell you about a new incentive program we are beginning here at ABC
\par Company. Specifically, this incentive program will focus on rewarding sales. Our
\par customer base has dropped drastically this year. Consequently, we must look for new
\par ways to increase sales. Although we have offered incentives in the past, this program will
\par be different because it will reward you for improvement in sales rather than for your sales
\par numbers. Furthermore, you will not only be able to earn monetary rewards, but you may
\par also be awarded with extra vacation days.
\par Happy selling,
\par Mr. Smith
\par In this example, transitional words and phrases are used to make the text flow more smoothly. A comma is
\par required after each transitional word or phrase.
\par Verbal phrases contain verb elements but function as nouns, adjectives or adverbs rather than verbs. There
\par are two kinds of verbal phrases that can act as introductory phrases and therefore must be set off by
\par commas: participial phrases and infinitive phrases.
\par Participial phrases are made up of a present participle (the \endash ing form of a verb) or a past participle (the \endash ed
\par form of a verb) as well as any modifiers or objects. Participial phrases act as adjectives because they
\par describe, or modify, the subject in the independent clause.
\par Examples:
\par Standing alone by the door, Ricky watched the rest of the boys dance with their dates.
\par Angered by the kids\rquote  cutting remarks, Naomi stormed out of the room and then burst into
\par tears.
\par The first example contains a participial phrase that contains the present participle Standing. The introductory
\par phrase Standing alone by the door describes Ricky. In the second example, the past participle Angered
\par makes up the participial phrase, and the full introductory phrase describes Naomi.
\par Analytical Writing 511
\par Infinitive phrases are made up of an infinitive as well as any modifiers or objects.
\par Examples:
\par To win a gold medal, you must work very hard.
\par To earn a high score on the GRE, you must study this guide thoroughly.
\par To win is the infinitive in the first sentence, and To earn is the infinitive in the second sentence. Both infinitives
\par serve as part of the introductory phrase, which must be set off by commas.
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9193\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  Check your work
\par To find introductory phrases that should be set off with a comma, first look for the subject and verb of the
\par independent clause. Then note any words that precede the subject and verb. Other than articles and adjectives,
\par any words or phrases that precede the subject and verb make up the introductory phrase. You can
\par then confirm this by identifying the introductory phrase.
\par Example:
\par The strongest qualities of a teacher are patience and understanding.
\par Here qualities is the subject (don\rquote t be thrown off by of a teacher) and are is the verb. The and strongest
\par precede the subject in this sentence. The is an article and strongest is an adjective, so there is no need for a
\par comma here. Now look at this example:
\par Knowing that the strongest qualities of a teacher are patience and understanding, Beth
\par highlighted these qualities on her r\'e9sum\'e9.
\par Here Beth is the subject and highlighted is the verb. The phrase Knowing that the strongest qualities of a
\par teacher are patience and understanding is a participial phrase and therefore should be set off with a
\par comma.
\par Many writers do not place a comma after a short introductory clause.
\par Example:
\par This morning I stopped at the bagel shop for coffee.
\par Here a comma is acceptable after This morning; however, it is not necessary. You can use your ear to make
\par a decision in cases like these. Often commas may be placed where there would be a pause if the sentence is
\par spoken. When in doubt, however, use a comma.
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9026\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  Rule 3 \endash  Use a comma to set off nonrestrictive clauses and phrases, clauses and phrases that are not
\par essential in identifying the words they modify. Adjectival clauses and appositives (words that rename a
\par noun) are most often nonrestrictive.
\par Adjectival clauses are phrases that begin with who, whom, whose, which, that, when, where, or why. In
\par many cases, an adjectival clause is nonrestrictive such as in the following example:
\par The heart, which pumps the body\rquote s blood, is necessary to sustain life.
\par In this sentence, the adjectival clause which pumps the body\rquote s blood is set off by commas because it is not
\par essential to the sentence. The sentence would have the same meaning without the clause. By contrast, the
\par adjectival clause in the next sentence is restrictive because it is necessary to convey the meaning of the

\par Appositives act as nouns or noun substitutes by modifying the noun that precedes the appositive. Just as
\par with adjectival clauses, nonrestrictive appositives are set off by commas, whereas restrictive appositives are
\par not.
\par Nonrestrictive examples:
\par My high school English teacher, Mr. Roper, taught me how to use commas properly.
\par She drove her new car, a Honda Accord, to the senior center to pick up her grandmother.
\par The book club will be meeting this Wednesday to discuss the latest book, Grisham\rquote s
\par Rainmaker.
\par In these examples, the underlined phrases are nonrestrictive appositives, which rename the noun preceding
\par them. These phrases add interesting description to the sentences, but they are not necessary to make the
\par sentences complete and understandable. On the other hand, some appositives are essential to capture the
\par full meaning of the sentence. Such restrictive appositives should not be set off with commas as shown in
\par the following examples:
\par My son Michael is two years old, and my other son Jacob is five months old.
\par Meet me at 6:00 at the new restaurant Vinny\rquote s Vittles that just opened on Main Street.
\par My friend Tammy met me at the beach yesterday.
\par The appositives in these examples are necessary in specifying the subjects. This information is necessary so

\par Review each sentence in your writing. Identify the adjectival phrases and appositives and the nouns they
\par modify. For each adjectival phrase or appositive, ask yourself if the phrase provides important identifying
\par information about the noun, or if it just provides \'93extra\'94 information. If you are still unsure, read the
\par sentence without the adjectival phrase or appositive. Does the sentence still have its full meaning? If so, set
\par the phrase off with commas. If not, omit the commas.
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9026\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  Rule 4 \endash  Use a comma to set off interjections and transitional phrases.
\par An interjection is usually one or two words that interrupt the flow of a sentence and give extra information
\par about the content of the sentence. Although an interjection provides added detail that enhances the reader\rquote s
\par knowledge, generally the information provided by an interjection could be omitted with little or no effect
\par on the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, most interjections should be set off by commas as in the following
\par examples:
\par I could probably take, say, five people in my van for the carpool.
\par She was, oddly enough, the only one who entered the contest.
\par I was thinking, by the way, that we could stop by the store on the way home.
\par A transitional phrase directs the flow of an essay. Often, transitional phrases are helpful in leading to a
\par conclusion and therefore should not be set off with commas such as in these two examples:
\par His strategy was to impress the boss and thus receive the promotion.
\par I was tired and therefore did not want to go to the party.
\par In these examples, the transitional words serve to fully define the meaning of the sentences. There are
\par instances, however, where a transitional word could be omitted without affecting the meaning of the
\par sentence.
\par Examples:
\par I was not confident, however, that he knew the answer.
\par The message when on to say, furthermore, that he would not be coming home for dinner.
\par Analytical Writing 513
\par The transitional words in these examples enhance the text by emphasizing the direction in which the
\par meaning of the sentence is moving. However, the meaning of the sentences would be the same without the
\par transitional words.

\par To double-check your use of commas with interjections, identify any word or words that interrupt your
\par sentence and have little or no effect to the meaning of the sentence. Set these words off with commas. Next,
\par check for transitional words, keeping in mind the list of common transitional phrases we discussed earlier.
\par Once you have identified the transitional words, ask yourself if the words are necessary to convey the

\par An independent clause is a group of words that contain both a subject and a verb and can stand alone as a
\par sentence.
\par Example:
\par I drove my car to work. (I is the subject, and drove is the verb.)
\par A coordinating conjunction is a word that serves as a link between a word or group of words. These

\par To properly combine two independent clauses with a comma and a conjunction, you must check to make
\par sure that the clauses joined by the comma and conjunction are indeed independent clauses. To do this, first
\par find all the conjunctions. Then look at the clauses on either side of each conjunction. Does each clause have
\par a subject and a verb? Can each clause stand alone as sentences? If so, the conjunction is properly placed
\par and a comma should precede the conjunction.
\par Incorrect:
\par We went to the mall last night, and bought some new dresses for work.
\par Correct:
\par We went to the mall last night and bought some new dresses for work.
\par Correct:
\par We went to the mall last night, and Terri bought some new dresses for work.
\par In the first example, and is the conjunction. We went to the mall last night is an independent clause (we is
\par the subject, went is the verb). However, bought some new dresses for work is not an independent clause
\par because there is no subject. Therefore, the sentence can be corrected by simply omitting the comma as seen
\par in the second example. Or, if there is a possible subject for the sentence, it can be added and the comma can
\par stay as seen in the third example. Here is another example where the same guidelines apply:
\par Incorrect:
\par He committed the crime, but didn\rquote t think the judge\rquote s ruling was fair.
\par Correct:
\par He committed the crime but didn\rquote t think the judge\rquote s ruling was fair.

\par semicolon in coordination with a transitional word and in place of a comma and a conjunction.
\par Sometimes a period seems like too strong of a mark to use to separate two closely related sentences, but a
\par comma does not emphasize both sentences adequately. In cases like this, you can use a semicolon to join
\par two independent clauses. Using a semicolon to join two independent clauses gives you as the writer a subtle
\par way of showing a relationship between two clauses. You might use a semicolon, for example, if your
\par second sentence restates your first. Or perhaps your second sentence more clearly defines your first sentence
\par by giving an example or by presenting a contrast. Finally, you may want to link two clauses with a
\par semicolon if they have a cause and effect relationship.
\par Analytical Writing 515
\par Example:
\par Loyalty is the foundation upon which relationships are built; without loyalty, friendships
\par and marriages crumble.
\par In this example, the second sentence restates the first sentence. A semicolon is appropriate here and functions
\par to convey the close relationship between the two sentences.
\par Example:
\par The puppy scooted blindly across the floor; his eyes hadn\rquote t opened yet leaving him totally
\par dependent on his mother.
\par The second sentence in this example more clearly defines why the puppy is moving around blindly. The
\par semicolon ties the explanation of the first clause to the description in the second clause. A semicolon is also
\par functional in this last example:
\par Of course it\rquote s pouring down rain on the day of the picnic; it was sunny the day we were
\par inside roller-skating!
\par The semicolon here emphasizes the irony that is portrayed in this sentence by connecting the two contrasting
\par sentences.
\par Contrasting clauses may also be joined by using a semicolon along with a transitional word.
\par Example:
\par These days there is a cure for every ailment; however, the side effects of many medications
\par are worse than the condition for which the medication is prescribed.
\par Here two independent clauses are joined with a semicolon and the transitional word however. The second
\par clause shows that medicines don\rquote t always produce positive effects in contrast with the first clause, which
\par indicates that almost every ailment can be cured. The transitional word however further defines this
\par contrasting relationship. A transitional word may also serve to emphasize a cause-effect relationship such
\par as in this example:
\par The drought has greatly affected many farmers; therefore, the price of produce is
\par expected to rise.
\par You may choose to use semicolons to portray a close relationship between two clauses as seen in the
\par examples above. In other cases, you may recognize that using a variety of punctuation marks adds interest
\par to your writing. Based on this recognition, the choice to join two clauses with a semicolon and a transitional
\par word may be a stylistic choice rather than a grammatical one. Likewise, adding variety to your writing may
\par be the purpose when it comes to replacing a comma and conjunction with a semicolon.
\par Example:
\par The slippery rock presented the climbers with a challenge, so they watched their footing
\par very closely.
\par Becomes:
\par The slippery rock presented the climbers with a challenge; they watched their footing
\par very closely.
\par In the first example, the two independent clauses are joined with a comma and a conjunction, and in the
\par second sentence, a semicolon replaces the comma and the conjunction. While both sentences are correct
\par and function equally well, you may choose to use the semicolon this way to add variety. Sometimes,
\par however, it is necessary to replace the comma with a semicolon in order to provide clarity. In these cases,
\par you may or may not omit the conjunction. For example,

\par From such a great distance, the man could not make out the faces of the evil, crafty

\par Because this sentence contains so much punctuation, it is a bit tedious to read and can be confusing. To
\par remedy this, a semicolon can be used to join the two clauses. In this case, the conjunction but is important
\par in enhancing the cause and effect relationship in the sentence and therefore it should remain:
\par From such a great distance, the man could not make out the faces of the evil, crafty
\par conspirators; but, if he moved any closer, he would be taking an unnecessary, careless
\par risk of being seen.
\par The semicolon in the example above provides much needed clarity to the sentence by separating the two

\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9193\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  Check your work
\par To use a semicolon to join two independent clauses, analyze the two clauses carefully to make sure there is
\par a close relationship between the two before placing the semicolon. Be careful not to misuse semicolons,
\par especially when you use them with a transitional word or in place of a comma and conjunction. For
\par example:
\par Incorrect:
\par I was forced; therefore, to take the detour around the construction site.
\par Correct:
\par I was forced, therefore, to take the detour around the construction site.
\par In this example, therefore is a transitional word and should be set off with commas. Furthermore, the clause
\par I was forced is an independent clause and to take the detour around the construction site is not, so the
\par clauses cannot be set apart by a semicolon.
\par Take the same caution when replacing a comma and conjunction with a semicolon. Remember that, to join
\par two clauses with a comma and a conjunction, both clauses must be independent. That is, each clause must
\par be able to stand alone as a separate sentence. For example,
\par Incorrect:
\par He completed the yard work, and then enjoyed a lemonade break with his mom.
\par Incorrect:
\par He completed the yard work; and then enjoyed a lemonade break with his mom.
\par Correct:
\par He completed the yard work and then enjoyed a lemonade break with his mom.
\par The subject in this sentence is He and the compound verb is completed and enjoyed. There is no subject in
\par the second part of the sentence, so it is incorrect to use a comma and conjunction in the sentence. Likewise,
\par a semicolon cannot be used.
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9026\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  Rule 2 \endash  Use a semicolon to join more than two independent clauses.
\par In Rule 1, we discussed using a semicolon to join two independent clauses. Semicolons can also be used to
\par join multiple independent clauses in more complex sentences:
\par Analytical Writing 517
\par Example:
\par Over the past few years, violence has adopted a new calling card; it is more random,
\par gruesome and sinister than ever. In this country of freedom, violence has made its
\par presence known in all areas of life. In schools, students take the lives of other students
\par before taking their own; a close knit community is gripped by fear because of random
\par shootings by a sniper; a father kills another father over their sons\rquote  hockey game.
\par This example could be written as a few separate sentences; however, since the independent clauses are all
\par closely related, it is acceptable to link them with semicolons. Joining multiple independent clauses is often
\par a stylistic choice and an effective one because it makes an impact by more closely connecting the
\par sentences. When not serving just a stylistic choice, joining more than two independent clauses with a
\par semicolon adds clarity such as in the following example:
\par Confusing:
\par The Thompsons spent two exciting weeks on safari in Africa and returned with wild tales
\par of their trip. They saw all the sights anyone who goes on safari dreams of: They saw
\par zebras, rhinoceroses, and giraffes grazing on the savanna, they witnessed a lion chasing
\par after an antelope, a herd of elephants stomped across the road in front of their truck, and
\par some curious, chattering monkeys came up to their truck and took food out of their hands.

\par In the first example, the writer uses commas to separate the series of clauses. However, because the clauses

\par To join multiple independent clauses with a semicolon, make sure the clauses you are joining are related.
\par Also consider using a semicolon instead of a comma to join clauses. To do this, check for commas within
\par the clauses. Too many commas cause confusion and can be eliminated by using semicolons instead. Be
\par careful, however, not to use semicolons too often because overuse can make a writer sound pedantic. When
\par used conservatively, semicolons can add a great deal of impact. To avoid overusing semicolons, reread
\par your text and make sure your use of semicolons is sporadic; semicolons should never appear as often as
\par commas or periods.
\par Too many semicolons:
\par My next interviewee came in and sat across from me; she tried to put on a confident face;
\par she maintained eye contact throughout the interview; I could tell she was nervous,
\par though; she played anxiously with her ring; she shifted positions every few seconds; her

\par by maintaining eye contact throughout the interview. I could tell she was nervous,
\par though; she played anxiously with her ring, shifted positions every few seconds and her
\par voice quivered a bit.
\par Semicolons are used in place of periods and almost all of the commas in the first example. In the rewrite of
\par the example, all but one semicolon is replaced with a period. The remaining semicolon is placed after I

\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9026\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  Rule 3 \endash  Use a semicolon to separate items in a series when the items themselves contain commas.
\par Just as you should use semicolons to join independent clauses when the clauses contain commas, you
\par should also use semicolons to separate words and phrases in a series when those words and phrases contain
\par commas. For example,
\par Confusing:
\par I boarded a flight in Los Angeles, California, had a two-hour layover in Detroit,
\par Michigan, and finally landed in London, England.
\par Better:
\par I boarded a flight in Los Angeles, California; had a two-hour layover in Detroit,
\par Michigan; and finally landed in London, England.
\par This sentence contains a series of clauses, which must be separated. However, each clause contains the
\par name of a city and a state, which also must be separated. Using only commas in this example causes confusion
\par because it is difficult to tell which commas separate clauses and which ones separate the elements
\par within each clause. Separating the clauses with semicolons clarifies the meaning. Here is another example:
\par All employees must bring a pen, paper, and a notebook to the first day of training; a
\par laptop, highlighter and paperclips to day two; and a sample report, pie chart and three
\par markers to the last day.
\par Here again, too many commas creates confusion, so in order to simplify the sentence and make it more
\par clear, the clauses in the series are separated by semicolons.
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9193\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  Check your work
\par Check each of the independent clauses you have joined with commas. Do any of the independent clauses
\par contain commas? If so, joining the independent clauses with a semicolon instead of a comma will probably
\par make the sentence clearer.
\par Confusing:
\par My pottery class is on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and I baby sit my nephew,

\par Better:

\par Again, be careful not to overuse semicolons. If, after you review your writing, you feel you have used
\par semicolons too often, consider using other methods to join phrases. For example, you might use a period to
\par divide clauses into separate sentences. Remember that semicolons can make a big impact but only when
\par used conservatively and correctly.
\par Colons

\par When a comma does not place adequate emphasis on the relationship between two independent clauses,
\par you can use a semicolon. When a semicolon does not provide adequate emphasis, you can use a colon. A
\par colon joins two independent clauses to emphasize the relationship between the two clauses and is often
\par used to introduce an explanation or an example.

\par Example:
\par When I picture my dream house, it is set in beautiful scenery: the beach or mountains, for
\par example, would provide an ideal setting for a home.
\par In this sentence, the colon serves to introduce two examples of a dream home. The colon in this example
\par strengthens the relationship between the idea of a beach or mountain home and the subject of dream homes
\par in the first clause. A colon can also introduce an explanation such as in the following example:
\par Dave and Stephanie\rquote s presentation lacked the usual enthusiasm: this could be because
\par they were at the office all night working on the ad campaign.
\par The second clause in this example explains the first clause and therefore may be introduced with a colon.

\par Dashes
\par Use dashes
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9026\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  (Rule 1) to interrupt a sentence.

\par Example:
\par If you are interested in martial arts\emdash and who wouldn\rquote t be interested in such a disciplined
\par art?\emdash there are many centers for instruction.
\par The dashes in this example allow you to break into the sentence in an informal way. Here is another

\par Although commas may be used to set off phrases that interrupt a sentence, dashes add emphasis to the
\par clause that is set off. In addition, dashes set an informal tone in your writing. Because of their informality,
\par dashes should be used sparingly, if ever, in graduate writing. When you do choose to use dashes, you may
\par include question marks and exclamation points in the clauses that are set off by dashes (as in the first
\par example above).
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9026\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  Rule 2 \endash  Use dashes to set off parenthetical or explanatory information.
\par Example:
\par The editor of the Banner Herald often employs hyperbole\emdash deliberate exaggeration or
\par overstatement to show special emphasis or create humor\emdash to express his political views.
\par Here dashes set apart the definition of hyperbole. Though not necessary to the meaning of the sentence, the
\par definition adds useful information. Again, dashes are an informal way of setting off information; a comma
\par would serve the same purpose here.
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9193\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  Check your work
\par Review each sentence in your writing and identify any information that is parenthetical or that explains a
\par topic in the sentence. You may set this information off with dashes. Remember, though, that dashes should
\par seldom be used in formal writing. In formal writing, you should use commas to set off these elements from
\par the rest of the sentence.
\par Apostrophes
\par Use an apostrophe
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9026\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  (Rule 1) in contractions.

\par Contractions are used in informal writing and serve to shorten two words by leaving out some letters and
\par joining the two words with an apostrophe. Following is a chart that lists some common contractions and the
\par words that form them:

\par The use of contractions is quite simple: if you wish to shorten two words into one and it is appropriate to do
\par so using an apostrophe, you simply replace the words with the correct contraction. There are, however,
\par some common mistakes people make when using contractions. There are a few contractions that sound like
\par possessive words, and these are often confused. For example, the contraction they\rquote re sounds like the
\par possessive their, but the two words have very different meanings.
\par Example (they\rquote re):
\par I don\rquote t know where they think they\rquote re going, but they\rquote re going to end up at a dead end.
\par Example (their):
\par When I saw them heading toward the dead end, I assumed they did not know their way.
\par Example (they\rquote re and their):
\par They\rquote re going to run into a dead end because they don\rquote t know their way.
\par Remember that they\rquote re is short for they are. Their is the third person plural possessive. The next pair of
\par words to watch out for is the contraction you\rquote re and the possessive your.
\par Example (you\rquote re):
\par You\rquote re not going to succeed in school if you don\rquote t study hard.
\par Example (your):
\par Your success in school is dependent upon hard work.
\par Example (you\rquote re and your):
\par You\rquote re not going to succeed in school if you don\rquote t try your best in all that you do.
\par You\rquote re is short for you are, and your is the second person singular possessive. The final pair of words that
\par can be confusing are it\rquote s and its.
\par Example (it\rquote s):
\par It\rquote s seemingly impossible for a cat to travel that far to get home.
\par Example (its):
\par A cat will travel a long way to find its home and the family it loves.
\par Example (it\rquote s and its):
\par It\rquote s amazing the distance a cat will travel to find its way back home.
\par Be careful when you use it\rquote s or its; remember that it\rquote s is the contraction for it is and its is the third person
\par singular possessive.
\par To check for proper use of a contraction, especially those that can be tricky, substitute the words that have
\par been replaced by the contraction. If the full-length word makes sense, the contraction is correct. If not, you
\par need to check your spelling. Once again, though, keep in mind that contractions are more appropriate for
\par use in informal writing.
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9026\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  Rule 2 \endash  Use an apostrophe to show possession.
\par To show the possessive form of singular nouns, add an apostrophe and an \endash s
\par Examples:
\par Teddy cleaned the dog\rquote s house before he and his family went on vacation.
\par The teacher used Julia\rquote s homework as an example because it was exceptional.
\par She didn\rquote t feel comfortable borrowing Harris\rquote s car.
\par Analytical Writing 523
\par To show the possessive form of plural nouns, add an \endash s and an apostrophe:
\par Examples:
\par Coach Hannigan distributed the girls\rquote  uniforms at soccer practice.
\par Some plural nouns, however, do not end in \endash s. In these instances, add an apostrophe and an \endash s.
\par Examples:
\par The women\rquote s meeting will be held in the gymnasium on Thursday night.
\par All of the children\rquote s bikes were parked in the driveway.
\par Competition between men\rquote s sports teams is fierce.
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9193\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  Check your work
\par Check for the correct use of apostrophes with possessives by first identifying the nouns that show possession.
\par Then identify whether the noun is singular or plural. If the noun is singular, add an apostrophe and an
\par \endash s. If the noun is plural, add an \endash s and an apostrophe. Finally, take note of any irregular plural nouns that do
\par not end in \endash s. Add an apostrophe and an \endash s to irregular nouns.
\par Quotation Marks
\par Use quotation marks to set off quotations and dialogue.
\par Example (quotation):
\par In his famous inaugural address, President John F. Kennedy implored, \'93My fellow
\par Americans, ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your
\par country.\'94
\par Example (dialog):
\par \'93Where are you going tonight?\'94 asked Greg.
\par \'93Beth and I are going to the library to get some research done,\'94 Susan replied. \'93Then
\par we\rquote re heading to the mall to do some shopping.\'94
\par When using quotation marks
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9026\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  (Rule 1) commas and periods go inside the quotation marks.
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9026\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  (Rule 2) semicolons and colons go outside the quotation marks.
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9026\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  (Rule 3) question marks and exclamation points go outside the quotation marks.
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9026\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  Rule 1 \endash  Commas and periods should be placed inside quotation marks.
\par Example:
\par \'93I don\rquote t understand what you\rquote re trying to say,\'94 Glen said. \'93You need to speak up.\'94
\par Don\rquote t use a comma and quotation marks for indirect quotes.
\par Example (direct quote):
\par He said, \'93I don\rquote t have time to take the car for an oil change today.\'94
\par Example (indirect quote):
\par He said that he didn\rquote t have time to take the car for an oil change today.
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9193\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  Check your work
\par Place commas and periods inside quotation marks. To determine if a quote is a direct or indirect quote, ask
\par yourself if the quote comes directly from the speaker and if the quote contains the exact words of the
\par speaker. If so, place quotation marks around the quote. If not, there should be no comma or quotation
\par marks.

\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9026\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  Rule 2 \endash  Place semicolons and colons outside quotation marks.
\par Example (semicolon):
\par My mom always used to say, \'93A stitch in time saves nine\'94; I always remember that quote
\par when I am tempted to procrastinate.
\par Example (colon):
\par Patrick Henry made a strong statement when he said, \'93Give me liberty or give me death\'94:
\par he felt that it would be better to die than to live in a country without freedom.
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9193\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  Check your work
\par When you use quotation marks with a semicolon or colon, first determine whether you are using the semicolon
\par or colon correctly. Then make sure you place the semicolon or colon outside the quotation marks.
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9026\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  Rule 3 \endash  Place question marks and exclamation points outside quotation marks unless they are a part of
\par the quotation.
\par Examples (question mark):
\par Did you hear Professor Johnston say, \'93You must read the first 500 pages for a quiz on
\par Monday\'94?
\par Stunned, she implored, \'93Why didn\rquote t you tell me you were leaving for good?\'94
\par In the first example, the quotation is a statement that does not require a question mark; however, the overall
\par sentence that contains the quotation is a question. Therefore, the question mark goes outside the quotation
\par marks. In the second example, though, the quotation is a question, so the question mark goes inside the quotation
\par marks.
\par Examples (exclamation point):
\par I can\rquote t believe she finally said, \'93I love you\'94!
\par The woman ran after the thief yelling, \'93Hey, come back with my purse!\'94
\par Overall, the first sentence is an exclamatory sentence, but the phrase I love you is not; therefore, the exclamation
\par point goes outside the quotation marks. Hey, come back with my purse in the second sentence,
\par however, is an exclamation, so the exclamation point goes inside the quotation marks.
\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9193\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  Check your work
\par Examine all quotations in your writing. If the quotation itself is a question or exclamation, place the appropriate
\par punctuation mark inside the quotation marks. If, however, the overall sentence is a question or
\par exclamation but the actual quote is not, the punctuation should be placed outside the quotation marks.
\par Sentence Fragments
\par A sentence fragment is a clause that is punctuated like an independent clause, but it lacks a grammatical
\par element required to make it a complete sentence. As we discussed before, an independent clause must have
\par a subject and a verb. Without both a subject and a verb, a clause is a sentence fragment because it cannot
\par function alone.
\par Example (independent clause):
\par I ran down the road.
\par Examples (sentence fragments):
\par Ran down the road.
\par Running down the road.
\par Analytical Writing 525
\par The independent clause above has both a subject (I) and a verb (ran). The first example of a sentence
\par fragment, however, has only a verb (ran). The last example contains the participle Running, which needs a
\par helping verb like was as well as a subject like He: He was running down the road.

\par To find sentence fragments in your writing, first analyze each sentence. In your analysis, mark the subject
\par and verb by underlining the subject once and the verb twice. Following are some examples:
\par On our way to the store tomorrow, we need to stop at the bank.
\par Sprinting toward the finish line, Dan took a deep breath and pressed on.
\par Providing equal opportunity to all citizens is of utmost importance.
\par The first two examples begin with introductory phrases, which can be confusing so take care in identifying
\par these types of clauses and isolating them from the independent clause. The third example contains a gerund,
\par providing, which acts as a noun. Now let\rquote s analyze each sentence of a paragraph. First, we will underline
\par each subject and each verb. Then we will flag each sentence that is a fragment with a star.
\par Dan always has busy days at his law office. *In the morning, stops for breakfast at a

\par Clearly, many of the sentences in this paragraph need to be revised. Before we can complete the revisions,

\par each sentence:
\par Dan always has busy days at his law office. (This sentence is fine.)
\par *In the morning, stops for breakfast at a coffee shop near the office. (The introductory phrase here
\par can make the sentence tricky because you may be tempted to identify morning as the subject.
\par Although stops is the verb, the subject is missing.)
\par *Upon entering the office. (This introductory phrase has been set off by itself.)
\par Dan gets his messages from his secretary. (This sentence is fine.)
\par For the rest of the day, Dan keeps busy. (This sentence is fine, but again there is an introductory
\par phrase, which can be deceiving.)
\par *Reviewing briefs and preparing witnesses. (This clause should act as the object of the sentence
\par and therefore is missing both the subject and the verb.)
\par Usually Dan does not have time to go out to lunch, but his secretary generally has something
\par delivered to him. (Two independent clauses are correctly joined here with a comma and a conjunction.
\par In a sentence like this, identifying the subject and verb can be confusing. In the second
\par clause, for example, it would be easy to mistake his as the subject when his is actually an adjective
\par modifying the subject secretary.)

\par morning. When he gets home, he is exhausted. Because he is so tired, he goes to bed at
\par 8:00.
\par *In the morning, stops for breakfast at a coffee shop near the office. (We corrected this sentence
\par by adding the subject he after the introductory phrase.)
\par *Upon entering the office. (We corrected this sentence by replacing the period after office with a
\par comma and thereby making it an introductory phrase and combining it with the next sentence.)
\par *Reviewing briefs and preparing witnesses. (We corrected this fragment by simply combining it
\par with the complete clause that preceded it.)
\par *When he gets home. (We corrected this sentence by replacing the period after home with a
\par comma and thereby making it an introductory phrase and combining it with the next sentence.)
\par *Because he is so tired. (We corrected this sentence by replacing the period after tired with a
\par comma and thereby making it an introductory phrase and combining it with the next sentence.)
\par Once you have made your revisions, make sure you reread your writing. Identify the subject and verb in
\par each sentence once again to make sure your revisions corrected the fragments.
\par Analytical Writing 527
\par Run-On Sentences
\par A run-on sentence contains one or more independent clauses but does not have all the proper words and
\par marks of punctuation that are required to join independent clauses.
\par Example:
\par David went on a field trip to an aquarium with his classmates and they saw a large variety
\par of fish.
\par In this example, two independent clauses are joined with a coordinating conjunction, but there is no
\par comma. This type of run-on sentence is called a fused sentence. A fused sentence can also lack both a
\par comma and a conjunction such as in the following example:
\par The debate over alien existence will probably continue for years some are sure they have
\par seen aliens.
\par This next sentence contains a comma but no coordinating conjunction:
\par Many people believe in the powers of a psychic, sometimes even detectives depend on
\par psychics to help solve crimes.
\par Because this sentence contains a comma but no coordinating conjunction, it is called a comma splice.

\par This example is a fused sentence because it contains two independent clauses linked by a coordinating
\par conjunction but no comma.
\par History provides us with interesting stories, it also helps us in the future because we can
\par learn from mistakes made in history.
\par This example is a comma splice because it contains two independent clauses linked by a comma but no
\par coordinating conjunction. These examples contain only two independent clauses that are not combined
\par correctly. Many writers also link multiple clauses incorrectly. If you are prone to this error, it is important
\par that you take the time to go through each sentence and identify the subjects and verbs. From there, you can

\par }{\f1\insrsid11230344 \u-9280\'3f\u-9026\'3f}{\f1\insrsid11230344  Step 2 \endash  Revise your run-on sentences by using one of five methods:
\par \bullet  Separate the clauses in to complete sentences.
\par Example:
\par (Run-on) Working together as a team is more productive than working individually, a
\par team can get more accomplished than one person.
\par (Revised) Working together as a team is more productive than working individually. A

\par way to work through frustration.
\par (Revised) Writing is great therapy; letting off steam through the written word is a good
\par way to work through frustration.
\par \bullet  Link the clauses with a comma and a coordinating conjunction.
\par Example:
\par (Run-on) I went to Florida last week to go to Disney World with a friend but it rained the
\par whole time that I was there.
\par (Revised) I went to Florida last week to go to Disney World with a friend, but it rained
\par the whole time that I was there.
\par \bullet  Rewrite the clauses to form just one independent clause.
\par Example:
\par (Run-on) This summer has been a very hot one, it has been humid also.
\par (Revised) This summer has been a very hot and humid one.
\par \bullet  Rewrite the clauses to form one independent clause with an introductory dependent
\par clause.
\par Example:
\par (Run-on) We re-painted our house, the old paint was peeling and fading.
\par (Revised) Because the old paint was peeling and fading, we re-painted our house.

\par 1. Dana is a foster mother who takes care of newborns. When babies are put up for adoption, a social
\par worker places the baby in Dana\rquote s house where the baby stays until the adoption is completed. Usually
\par the baby stays no longer than six weeks unless there is no adoptee lined up yet.
\par Takes care of newborns is a fragment; it was corrected by joining it to the first clause Dana is a foster
\par mother. When babies are put up for adoption is an introductory dependent clause and should be
\par followed by a comma. The last clause is a run-on sentence, and it was corrected by placing a period
\par after completed.
\par 2. Buying a new car is a big decision. There are many factors to consider: dependability, for example, is
\par a key factor in choosing the car to suit your needs.
\par The first clause is a run-on sentence and should be divided into two sentences; thus, a period was
\par placed between decision and There. Moreover, their was replaced with the correct word there. Once
\par you have divided the sentence into two separate clauses, notice that dependability is an example.
\par Therefore, a colon should follow consider. In addition, for example should be set off by commas
\par because it is an interjection.
\par 3. The energetic, boisterous boy climbed the jungle gym, hung from the monkey bars, jumped down, and
\par then ran to the merry-go-round.
\par Energetic and boisterous are adjectives that modify boy. Because there are two adjectives modifying
\par the same noun, they should be separated by a comma. In addition, a set of four phrases follows\emdash 
\par climbed the jungle gym, hung from the monkey bars, jumped down, and then ran to the merry-goround\emdash 
\par and should also be separated by commas.
\par 4. What do you think he meant when he said, \'93You\rquote re going to have to figure that one out on your
\par own\'94?
\par Your and you\rquote re are misspelled. The contraction you\rquote re should be the first word in the quotation, and
\par the possessive your should precede own. The question mark in the sentence should be placed outside
\par the quotation marks because the quotation itself is not a question; however, the complete sentence is a
\par question.
\par 5. A cool, sparkling stream meandered through the peaceful forest. Some deer stopped to take a drink.
\par Before they disappeared into the trees, they glanced up for a moment to look at me.
\par First, a comma should separate the series of adjectives cool and sparkling. Second, this clause is a
\par run-on sentence and was corrected by dividing it into two independent clauses by placing a period
\par between forest and Some. Finally, a third clause was created by converting the sentence fragment into
\par an introductory clause.
\par 6. Some people claim, even boast, that they have never read an entire book. This is their loss because
\par reading leads to knowledge; knowledge leads to power; power enables people to influence those
\par around them.
\par Even boast is an interjection and should be set apart by commas. You should use commas instead of
\par dashes because the topic of the sentences is formal. The contraction they\rquote ve should be changed to they
\par have to maintain the formality. The next sentence should contain the possessive their. Finally, the last
\par clause is a run-on sentence. Because the clauses are closely related, they should be separated by
\par semicolons.

\par 7. That Halloween night couldn\rquote t have been spookier if it had come out of a story\emdash a horror story.
\par Patches of fog enveloped the trees in some places. Because of the full moon, the trees cast dark, eerie
\par shadows in others.
\par Can\rquote t is the wrong contraction here. You can test it by plugging in the full-length words\emdash That
\par Halloween night cannot have been spookier. A horror story at the end of the sentence provides further
\par explanation of story and thus can be set apart with a dash. A dash was used instead of a comma
\par because of the informal topic. A comma should separate the adjectives dark and eerie. Finally,
\par Because of the full moon is a sentence fragment and was converted into an introductory phrase for the
\par last independent clause.
\par 8. The men\rquote s group did charity work this weekend. They completed the following projects: they helped
\par rebuild a church that had been damaged in a tornado, they completed some of the landscaping on the
\par church grounds, and they began repairs to the pastor\rquote s home nearby the church.
\par Because the word men is a plural noun that does not end in \endash s, its possessive should be spelled with an
\par apostrophe and then an \endash s. Also, the first clause is a run-on, so there should be a period between
\par weekend and They. Next, there should be a colon after projects in order to introduce the series of
\par clauses that follow. The word following is your clue to use a colon in this instance. Each clause in the
\par series should be separated by a comma. Finally, pastor\rquote s is possessive and should contain an
\par apostrophe.
\par 9. Many people suffer from \'93diet fatigue\'94; they try diet after diet only to meet failure with each one.
\par What they should be focusing on instead is nutritional eating and fitness. Nutritional eating consists of
\par eating well-balanced servings of meats, vegetables, fruits, and grains; drinking lots of water; and
\par indulging in junk food sparingly. Proper fitness can come in the form of aerobic exercise, walking,
\par sports, or weight training. Making just a few adjustments in daily eating and exercise habits can make
\par all the difference in a person\rquote s physical and emotional well-being.
\par The first clause is a run-on and should be divided into two separate sentences; since they\rquote re closely
\par related, you may use a semicolon. The semicolon should be placed outside the quotation marks
\par around diet fatigue. A period should follow fitness in order to separate the next run-on sentence into
\par separate sentences. In the third sentence, you are presented with a series of clauses; one of the clauses
\par contains a list of words that require commas to separate them. Because so many commas can be
\par confusing, the series of clauses should be separated by semicolons. The series of words in the
\par sentence that follows should be separated by commas as well. A final sentence should be set off
\par starting at Making. Finally, the possessive of person\rquote s must contain an apostrophe.
\par 10. The beautiful, grand stain-glassed windows added a majestic feeling to the old cathedral.
\par A comma should separate beautiful and grand. Notice that there is no comma after grand. You can
\par double-check this by placing and between each adjective: The beautiful and grand and stain-glassed
\par window. The and between grand and stain-glassed does not make sense; therefore, there should be no
\par comma preceding stain-glassed.

\par Usage
\par Even if you know all of the rules that govern the proper use of punctuation, your knowledge will not
\par enhance your writing if you do not use correct grammar in your writing. The field of grammar is huge and
\par complex\emdash tomes have been written on the subject. This complexity should be no surprise since grammar
\par deals with the process of communication.
\par Usage concerns how we choose our words and how we express our thoughts: in other words, are the
\par connections between the words in a sentence logically sound, and are they expressed in a way that
\par conforms to standard idiom? We will study six major categories:
\par \bullet  Pronoun Errors
\par \bullet  Subject-Verb Agreement
\par \bullet  Misplaced Modifiers
\par \bullet  Faulty Parallelism
\par \bullet  Faulty Verb Tense
\par \bullet  Faulty Idiom
\par Pronoun Errors
\par A pronoun is a word that stands for a noun, known as the antecedent of the pronoun. The key point for the
\par use of pronouns is this:
\par \bullet  Pronouns must agree with their antecedents in both number (singular or plural) and person (1st, 2nd, or
\par 3rd).
\par Example:
\par Steve has yet to receive his degree.
\par Here, the pronoun his refers to the noun Steve.
\par Following is a list of the most common pronouns:
\par PRONOUNS
\par Singular Plural Both Singular
\par and Plural
\par I, me we, us any
\par she, her they none
\par he, him them all
\par it these most
\par anyone those more
\par either some who
\par each that which
\par many a both what
\par nothing ourselves you
\par one any
\par another many
\par everything few
\par mine several
\par his, hers others
\par this
\par that
\par Analytical Writing 533
\par Reference
\par \bullet  A pronoun should be plural when it refers to two nouns joined by and.
\par Example:
\par Jane and Katarina believe they passed the final exam.
\par The plural pronoun they refers to the compound subject Jane and Katarina.
\par \bullet  A pronoun should be singular when it refers to two nouns joined by or or nor.
\par Example:
\par Incorrect:
\par Neither Jane nor Katarina believes they passed the final.
\par Correct:
\par Neither Jane nor Katarina believes she passed the final.
\par \bullet  A pronoun should refer to one and only one noun or compound noun.
\par This is probably the most common pronoun error. If a pronoun follows two nouns, it is often unclear which
\par of the nouns the pronoun refers to.
\par Faulty Usage
\par The breakup of the Soviet Union has left nuclear weapons in the hands of unstable,
\par nascent countries. It is imperative to world security that they be destroyed.
\par Although one is unlikely to take the sentence to mean that the countries must be destroyed, that interpretation
\par is possible from the structure of the sentence. It is easily corrected:
\par The breakup of the Soviet Union has left nuclear weapons in the hands of unstable,
\par nascent countries. It is imperative to world security that these weapons be destroyed.
\par Faulty Usage
\par In Somalia, they have become jaded by the constant warfare.
\par This construction is faulty because they does not have an antecedent. The sentence can be corrected by
\par replacing they with people:
\par In Somalia, people have become jaded by the constant warfare.
\par Better:
\par The people of Somalia have become jaded by the constant warfare.
\par \bullet  In addition to agreeing with its antecedent in number, a pronoun must agree with its antecedent in
\par person.
\par Faulty Usage
\par One enters this world with no responsibilities. Then comes school, then work, then
\par marriage and family. No wonder, you look longingly to retirement.
\par In this sentence, the subject has changed from one (third person) to you (second person). To correct the

\par Subject-Verb Agreement
\par Within a sentence there are certain requirements for the relationship between the subject and the verb.
\par \bullet  The subject and verb must agree both in number and person.
\par Example:
\par We have surpassed our sales goal of one million dollars.
\par Here, the first person plural verb have agrees with its first person plural subject we.
\par Note that, ironically, third person singular verbs often end in s or es:
\par He seems to be fair.
\par \bullet  Intervening phrases and clauses have no effect on subject-verb agreement.
\par Example:
\par Only one of the President\rquote s nominees was confirmed.
\par Here, the singular verb was agrees with its singular subject one. The intervening prepositional phrase of the
\par President\rquote s nominees has no effect on the number or person of the verb.
\par Collective nouns followed by intervening phrases are particularly easy to miss.
\par Example:
\par The content of the boxes is what she wants.
\par The meaning of her sentences is not clear.
\par A group of lions is called a "pride."
\par Be careful when a simple subject is followed by a phrase beginning with as well as, along with, together
\par with, in addition to, or a similar expression. Be sure to make the verb agree with the simple subject, not
\par with a noun in the intervening phrase.
\par Example:
\par Our Senator, along with most congressmen, opposes the bill.
\par Here, the singular verb opposes agrees with its singular subject Senator. The intervening phrase along with
\par most congressmen has no effect on the number or person of the verb.
\par \bullet  When the subject and verb are reversed, they still must agree in both number and person.
\par Example:
\par Attached are copies of the contract.
\par Here, the plural verb are attached agrees with its plural subject copies. The sentence could be rewritten as
\par Copies of the contract are attached.

\par Misplaced Modifiers
\par A modifier is a phrase or a clause that describes something. A misplaced modifier, therefore, is one that
\par describes the wrong item in a sentence, often creating an illogical statement.
\par \bullet  As a general rule, a modifier should be placed as close as possible to what it modifies.
\par Example:
\par Following are some useful tips for protecting your person and property from the FBI.
\par As written, the sentence implies that the FBI is a threat to your person and property. To correct the sentence
\par put the modifier from the FBI next to the word it modifies, tips:
\par Following are some useful tips from the FBI for protecting your person and property.
\par \bullet  When a phrase begins a sentence, make sure that it modifies the subject of the sentence.
\par Example:
\par Coming around the corner, a few moments passed before I could recognize my old home.
\par As worded, the sentence implies that the moments were coming around the corner. The sentence can be
\par corrected as follows:

\par Faulty Parallelism
\par \bullet  For a sentence to be parallel, similar elements must be expressed in similar form.
\par \bullet  When two adjectives modify the same noun, they should have similar forms.
\par Example:
\par The topology course was both rigorous and a challenge.
\par Since both rigorous and a challenge are modifying course, they should have the same form:
\par The topology course was both rigorous and challenging.
\par \bullet  When a series of clauses is listed, the verbs in each clause must have the same form.
\par Example:
\par During his trip to Europe, the President will discuss ways to stimulate trade, offer
\par economic aid, and trying to forge a new coalition with moderate forces in Russia.
\par In this example, the first two verbs, discuss and offer, are active. But the third verb in the series, trying, is
\par passive. The form of the verb should be active:
\par During his trip to Europe, the President will discuss ways to stimulate trade, offer

\par 3. A pronoun should refer to one and only one noun or compound noun.
\par 4. A pronoun must agree with its antecedent in both number and person.
\par 5. The subject and verb must agree both in number and person.
\par 6. Intervening phrases and clauses have no effect on subject-verb agreement.
\par 7. When the subject and verb are reversed, they still must agree in both number and person.
\par 8. As a general rule, a modifier should be placed as close as possible to what it modifies.
\par 9. When a phrase begins a sentence, make sure that it modifies the subject of the sentence.

\par manufacturer\rquote s products that the customers may have bought.
\par (E) to immediately notify its customers whenever the government is contemplating a forced recall of

\par Choice (A) is incorrect because the plural pronoun their cannot have the singular noun a manufacturer as

\par Although choice (B) corrects the given false reference, it introduces another one. Their can now refer

\par Choice (C) also corrects the false reference, but it introduces a redundancy: immediately means
\par \'93without delay.\'94
\par Choice (D) corrects the false reference, but its structure is very awkward. The direct object of a verb

\par customers by the clause \'93that the government is contemplating a forced recall of any of the manufacturer\rquote s

\par (D) after the war, the United States enacted the Marshall Plan to rebuild Germany.
\par (E) after the war, the United States enacted the Marshall Plan in order to rebuild Germany.
\par Choice (A) is incorrect. Since United States is denoting the collective country, it is singular and therefore
\par cannot be correctly referred to by the plural pronoun they.
\par Choice (B) is not technically incorrect, but it lacks precision since it does not state who enacted the
\par Marshall Plan. Further, it uses a passive construction: \'93was enacted.\'94
\par Choice (C) states who enacted the Marshall Plan, but it retains the passive construction \'93was
\par enacted.\'94
\par Choice (E) is second-best. The phrase \'93in order\'94 is unnecessary.

\par (E) to most Americans. Now, however, most Americans will accept it as desirable.
\par The sentence is not incorrect as written. Hence, the answer is choice (A).
\par Choice (B) creates a run-on sentence by replacing the semicolon with a comma. Without a connecting
\par word\emdash and, or, but, etc.\emdash two independent clauses must be joined by a semicolon or written as two
\par separate sentences. Also, deleting \'93as desirable\'94 changes the meaning of the sentence.
\par Choice (C) uses a very awkward construction: are desirable of it.
\par Choice (D) contains an error in tense. The sentence progresses from the past to the present, so the verb
\par in the second clause should be accept, not accepted.
\par Choice (E) writes the two clauses as separate sentences, which is allowable, but it also changes the
\par tense of the second clause to the future: will accept.

\par (C) one that they believe triggers

\par Although choice (C) reads more smoothly, it still contains the double pronouns.

\par Choice (A) is incorrect because the plural verb have does not agree with its singular subject the rising cost.
\par Both (B) and (C) are incorrect because they turn the sentence into a fragment.

\par (A) its means of distribution are equally shared by the parties.

\par (C) its means of distribution is equally shared by the parties.
\par (D) their means of distribution is equally shared by the parties.
\par (E) the means of distribution are equally shared by the parties.
\par Choice (A) is incorrect. Recall that intervening phrases have no effect on subject-verb agreement. In this
\par sentence, the subject ownership is singular, but the verb are is plural. Dropping the intervening phrase
\par clearly shows that the sentence is ungrammatical:
\par In a co-publication, agreement ownership are equally shared by the parties.
\par Analytical Writing 553
\par Choice (B) is incorrect. Neither adding each of nor interchanging shared and equally addresses the
\par issue of subject-verb agreement.

\par (C) indicates that the country is becoming less tolerant, and therefore that
\par (D) indicates that the country is being less tolerant, and therefore
\par (E) indicates that the country is becoming less tolerant of and therefore that
\par Choice (A) has two flaws. First, the subject of the sentence the rise is singular, and therefore the verb
\par indicate should not be plural. Second, the comma indicates that the sentence is made up of two independent
\par clauses, but the relative pronoun that immediately following therefore forms a subordinate clause.
\par Choice (C) corrects the number of the verb, but retains the subordinating relative pronoun that.
\par Choice (D) corrects the number of the verb and eliminates the subordinating relative pronoun that.
\par However, the verb being is less descriptive than the verb becoming: As negative attitudes toward foreigners
\par increase, the country becomes correspondingly less tolerant. Being does not capture this notion of change.
\par Choice (E) corrects the verb\rquote s number, and by dropping the comma, makes the subordination
\par allowable. However, it introduces the preposition of which does not have an object: less tolerant of what?
\par Choice (B) both corrects the verb\rquote s number and removes the subordinating relative pronoun that. The
\par answer is (B).

\par (E) The harvest of grapes in the local valleys began decreasing in 1990 for the third straight year but

\par Choice (A) is incorrect since the singular subject the harvest requires a singular verb, not the plural verb
\par were.
\par Choice (B) is illogical since it states that the harvest began to decrease in 1990 and then it states that it
\par was the third straight year of decrease.
\par In choice (C) the plural verb were still does not agree with its singular subject the harvest.
\par Choice (E) contains the same flaw as choice (B).
\par Choice (D) has the singular verb was agreeing with its singular subject the harvest. Further, it places

\par (E) sociologists have overlooked the other causes of crime\emdash such as the breakup of the nuclear

\par Choice (A) is incorrect since it implies that the other causes of crime are doing the focusing.
\par Choice (B) has the same flaw.
\par Choice (C) is incorrect. The phrase by focusing on poverty must modify the subject of the sentence,
\par but there cannot be the subject since the construction there are is used to introduce a subject.
\par Choice (D) implies that crimes are focusing on poverty.
\par Choice (E) puts the subject of the sentence sociologists immediately next to its modifying phrase by

\par (D) Using the Hubble telescope, astronomers are now charting previously unknown galaxies.
\par (E) With the aid of the Hubble telescope, previously unknown galaxies are now being charted.
\par Choice (A) is incorrect because the phrase using the Hubble telescope does not have a noun to modify.
\par Analytical Writing 555
\par Choice (B) is incorrect because the phrase using the Hubble telescope still does not have a noun to

\par (C) stranded motorists unless they are well-insulated
\par (D) stranded motorists unless there is insulation
\par (E) the stranded motorist unless insulated
\par Choice (A) is incorrect. As worded, the sentence implies that the cold should be well-insulated.
\par Choice (B) is awkward; besides, it still implies that the cold should be well-insulated.
\par Choice (D) does not indicate what should be insulated.
\par Choice (E), like choices (A) and (B), implies that the cold should be well-insulated.

\par (E) Traveling across and shooting the vast expanse of the Southwest, Ansel Adams began his photographic

\par Choice (A) has two flaws. First, the introductory phrase is too long. Second, the subject Ansel Adams
\par should immediately follow the introductory phrase since it was Ansel Adams\emdash not the year 1945\emdash who
\par was traveling and shooting the Southwest.
\par Choice (B) is incorrect because the phrase \'93traveling across\'85 Southwest\'94 is too far from its subject

\par (A) eating properly will result
\par (B) proper diet resulted
\par (C) dieting will result
\par (D) proper diet results
\par (E) eating properly results
\par Choice (A) is incorrect since eating properly (verb-adverb) is not parallel to sensible exercise (adjectivenoun).
\par Choice (B) offers two parallel nouns, exercise and diet. However, a general truth should be expressed
\par in the present tense, not in the past tense.
\par Choice (C) is not parallel since it pairs the noun exercise with the gerund (a verb acting as a noun)

\par beginning.
\par (E) war brewing in Europe, the industrial revolution well-established, and saw the birth of the

\par Choice (A) is incorrect. Although the first two phrases, war brewing in Europe and the industrial
\par revolution well-established, have different structures, the thoughts are parallel. However, the third phrase,
\par and a nascent communication age, is not parallel to the first two.
\par Choice (B) does not make the third phrase parallel to the first two.
\par Choice (C) changes the meaning of the sentence: the new formulation states that war already existed
\par in Europe while the original sentence states that war was only developing.
\par Choice (E) is not parallel since the first two phrases in the series are noun phrases, but saw the birth of
\par the communication age is a verb phrase. When a word introduces a series, each element of the series must
\par agree with the introductory word. You can test the correctness of a phrase in a series by dropping the other
\par phrases and checking whether the remaining phrase agrees with the introductory word. In this series, each
\par phrase must be the object of the preposition with:
\par This century began with war brewing in Europe
\par This century began with the industrial revolution well-established
\par This century began with saw the birth of the communication age
\par In this form, it is clear the verb saw cannot be the object of the preposition with.

\par (C) chose to return to the private sector.
\par (D) have chosen to return to the private sector.
\par (E) have chosen returning to the private sector.
\par Choice (A) is incorrect because it uses the past perfect had chosen, which describes an event that has been

\par the private sector. Hence, the present perfect tense should be used.
\par Choice (B) is incorrect because it uses the present progressive tense having chosen, which describes
\par an ongoing event. Although this is the case, it does not capture the fact that the event began in the past.
\par Choice (C) is incorrect because it uses the simple past chose, which describes a past event. But again,

\par Choice (C) is the correct answer because it uses the past perfect had been to indicate that the homes

\par Choice (D) is incorrect because it uses the present perfect have been, which implies that the homes

\par General Tips on Writing Your Essays
\par Structure
\par Now that you know when to use a semicolon instead of a comma, how do you get started writing your
\par essay? Learning the rules that govern written English is one thing; putting your knowledge to use is
\par another. We will discuss some specific tips in each of the essay sections later, but for now, we will look at
\par some general techniques to make your essay the best it can be. We begin by looking at the proper structure
\par for your introduction and for your conclusion.
\par Introduction
\par Your introduction should serve two structural purposes: It should restate your topic so that the reader need
\par not review the given question, and it should offer a clear thesis so the reader knows what your purpose is.
\par Simply defined, a thesis states the main idea of your essay. Because the strategy you need to employ for
\par developing your thesis differs for each type of essay, however, we will discuss it in further detail later on in
\par this chapter.
\par Your introduction should, in effect, restate the given topic. In other words, your reader should be able to
\par ascertain the issue or argument without reading the given topic. Suppose the GRE gives you this argument:
\par The following letter was sent by a group of homeowners from the Rivermill Subdivision to
\par all homeowners in that subdivision.
\par \'93Providence Golf Community down the street has a homeowner\rquote s association. Part of the
\par role of this association is to develop bylaws, which dictate the outside appearance of all
\par homes in the community. For example, according to the rules set forth in the covenant,
\par homeowners may only build privacy fences around their yard; no chain link is permitted.
\par Property values in this community are double property values in our subdivision. In order
\par to raise our property values, we need to improve the look of our neighborhood. Therefore,
\par we should start an association and develop a covenant.\'94
\par Your initial reaction to this prompt may be to begin your essay with a direct response such as This letter
\par presents a faulty argument. However, this introductory sentence does not provide adequate information
\par because it does not specify which letter and therefore it would leave the reader confused. Following is the
\par beginning of an introduction that does give adequate information to the reader:
\par Does the adoption of covenants in housing communities result in rising property values? In a letter
\par to the residents of Rivermill Subdivision, a small group of homeowners stated that property values
\par in nearby Providence were double the property values in Rivermill because of such a covenant.
\par Not only should you restate the topic, but you should also do so in a way that will spark interest. It may
\par seem like a tall order to restate your topic, create a thesis, AND make it captivating, but if you don\rquote t grab
\par your reader\rquote s attention in the introduction, it doesn\rquote t matter how interesting the body of your essay is
\par because he won\rquote t feel compelled to read on. Think of your introduction as the worm on a fishhook, just
\par dangling there enticing the fish to bite. There are several techniques you can employ to get your reader to
\par \'93bite\'94 and, thus, read on.
\par TeamLRN
\par 562 GRE Prep Course
\par \bullet  Begin your introduction with a question. Naturally, when a question is posed to your reader, he or
\par she will want to keep reading to find out the answer.
\par \bullet  Begin your introduction with a quote. Because you will not have time to research your topic for the
\par GRE test, this may not be as feasible as, say, on a term paper for a graduate class; however, if you
\par can remember a specific quote pertinent to your topic, use it.
\par \bullet  Begin with an anecdote. An anecdote is entertaining and will thus draw in the reader.
\par \bullet  Begin with an illustration or a hypothetical example based on the topic you are going to discuss.
\par \bullet  Begin with a true-to-life example.
\par \bullet  Begin with vivid description of something pertaining to your topic.
\par It is particularly important that, in the context of the GRE, you make a concerted effort to create a captivating
\par introduction. Keep in mind that the scorers of your essays are the scorers of everyone else\rquote s essays.
\par They read hundreds of responses to the same issues and arguments. You must make your essay stand out.
\par What better way to make it stand out than to make it exceptional from the beginning?
\par Conclusion
\par The conclusion of your essay is just as important as the introduction because it wraps up your thoughts and
\par evidence and should leave your reader satisfied that a convincing discussion has just taken place. Your
\par conclusion should include a restatement of your thesis and then end with a more general statement, perhaps
\par a warning or a call for action. Tip: If time is running out and you get stuck trying to formulate a conclusion,
\par try beginning with \'93In conclusion\'94 or \'93In summary.\'94 Then continue by restating your thesis.
\par Style
\par We have examined the rules that govern the English language, and we have learned some techniques on
\par structure. But how does a writer make a piece of writing his own? And how does a writer add interest to his
\par essays? The way a writer uses words and phrases to add personality to his writing is called style. A writer is
\par to style as a figure skater is to skating. A writer can learn all the rules that make his writing correct, just as a
\par figure skater can learn how to accomplish her jumps and footwork. But just learning the rules of grammar is
\par not enough to create a well-written essay; learning just the rules of skating is not enough to earn a gold
\par medal. The writer must bring his own methods and personality to his writing just as a skater must invest her
\par own personality and flair to her performance.
\par Many elements combine to form a writer\rquote s style, and, even though many of these elements can be
\par identified, each is unique to a writer. Moreover, a good writer does not allow any elements of his style to
\par stagnate. Rather, he continues to practice writing in order to continually improve and develop his style. We
\par will touch briefly on how you can develop your writing style, but first let\rquote s look at some specific elements
\par of style.
\par Transitions
\par Transitional phrases are an important element of style because they create coherence. They guide the reader
\par from point A to point B. On the GRE, the reader will read through your essay quickly, scoring according to
\par his first impression of what you wrote. If your essay is choppy and does not flow well, the reader will not
\par gain a good first impression. Therefore, it is imperative that your essay exhibits solid cohesiveness. Look at
\par the lists below for some examples of transitional words and phrases that will help you write a smooth,
\par coherent essay.
\par Agreement: also, plus, in addition, further, furthermore, moreover, additionally, to add to
\par that, next, in accordance with, accordingly, in agreement, finally, for instance, for
\par example, in exemplification, exemplifying that, in fact, factually speaking, in terms of,
\par and so forth, in coordination with, along those lines, collectively speaking, generally
\par speaking, indeed, undoubtedly, obviously, to be sure, equally
\par Contrast: however, in contrast, on the contrary, on the other hand, from a different angle,
\par nonetheless, nevertheless, but, yet, a catch to this is, sadly enough, as a hindrance, oddly
\par enough, instead, in direct opposition, still, rather
\par Analytical Writing 563
\par Result: as a result, as a consequence, consequently, thus, therefore, hence, thereby,
\par resulting in, ultimately, in the end, finally, in the overall analysis, in hindsight, in
\par retrospect, retrospectively, vicariously, the long term effect, as a short term result,
\par significantly, as a major effect, effectively, heretofore, hereafter, thereafter, in short,
\par generally, over all, concluding
\par Transitional words and phrases are helpful not only in linking your ideas between sentences, but also in
\par providing cohesiveness from paragraph to paragraph. Each paragraph of your essay should include a topic
\par sentence, which can also act as a transitional sentence. This transitional sentence should link your paragraphs
\par by relating to some element in the preceding paragraph. Take a look at the following example:
\par The size of your house will probably be a factor in how you decide to decorate. If you
\par have a large house, you may opt for a grand, sophisticated look. Over-sized furniture and
\par ornate fixtures will complement solid-colored walls accented with artwork. On the other
\par hand, a cozy look suits a smaller home. This look can be achieved by choosing less
\par formal furniture, simple accents and warm colors. Equally, patterned wall-coverings add
\par a lovely touch to a small home.
\par Regardless of the size of your house, your financial situation will also likely play a
\par large role in the style of d\'e9cor you choose. Limited funds may force you to make some of
\par your own decorations, like curtains and knick knacks. However, unlimited funds may
\par offer the option of hiring an interior decorator to do all the work for you.
\par The first sentence of the second paragraph is not only the topic sentence of the paragraph (it lets the reader
\par know what the paragraph will be about), but also the transitional sentence that links the two paragraphs.
\par Notice that the phrase \'93Regardless of the size of your house\'94 refers to the topic of the first paragraph,
\par thereby tying together the topics of both paragraphs. In addition, the word \'93also\'94 in this sentence indicates
\par that a second factor of decorating is being introduced.
\par Other more subtle transitions occur in the first paragraph. For example, \'93over-sized furniture\'94 in the
\par third sentence refers to the \'93large house\'94 in the preceding sentence. This provides a transition without using
\par a transitional word. Notice further that \'93large\'94 is part of the subordinate clause in the second sentence but
\par \'93over-sized\'94 is part of the main subject in the third sentence, thus providing transition while also giving the
\par reader some variety in sentence pattern. (We will discuss varying your sentences later on.)
\par More obvious are the transitional words we discussed previously. In the first paragraph, for example,
\par the phrase \'93On the other hand\'94 depicts the contrast between a large and a small house while \'93equally\'94
\par continues the thoughts pertaining to a cozy home. In the second paragraph, \'93However\'94 is used to show
\par contrast in a pattern much like in the first paragraph.
\par Using transitions, both subtle and obvious, in your sentences and between paragraphs is essential in
\par creating cohesiveness in your essay. Without this clarity, your essay will likely be choppy and difficult for
\par the scorer to read and understand. A word of caution, however, before we move on: Since time is limited on
\par the writing assessment sections, you must be concise and to the point. Be careful not to overuse transitional
\par words and phrases because overuse can make you sound like a pedantic writer rather than an intelligent
\par one.
\par Varying Your Sentences
\par No matter how well your essay flows, the reader will easily get bored if your essay consists only of
\par sentences that contain the same words and follow the same structure. Consider this paragraph:
\par Dogs are smarter than cats. They are often used to help handicapped people. Dogs help
\par blind people. Dogs also help epileptic people. Dogs can sense when an epileptic person is
\par about to have a seizure. Dogs are also used in rescue work. They help rescue skiers. They
\par also help in catastrophic events. They rescue people after earthquakes.
\par There are several things wrong with this paragraph:
\par \bullet  Almost every sentence is the same length.
\par \bullet  The structure in each sentence is almost identical: Subject + Verb + Direct Object.
\par \bullet  The same words are used over and over: \'93dogs,\'94 \'93they,\'94 \'93also,\'94 \'93help,\'94 \'93rescue.\'94
\par \bullet  No description is used to further illustrate the writer\rquote s points.

\par To add more interest to your writing, you need to vary your sentence length and structure. Try different
\par beginnings for your sentences. Employ a variety of words and use these words to paint a vivid picture of
\par your subject. Let\rquote s apply these tips to the paragraph above:
\par Dogs are more intelligent than your average feline. A cat cannot, for example, guide a
\par blind person across busy streets and along crowded sidewalks. Amazingly enough, a dog
\par is also a perfect companion for a person with epilepsy because a dog seems to be able to
\par sense when a seizure is coming on. While dogs help keep the handicapped away from
\par danger, they also aid in rescuing people who have fallen victim to dangerous situations,
\par like skiers trapped in an avalanche. Moreover, when catastrophic events, like earthquakes,
\par leave victims pinned beneath debris and rubble, a canine team often comes to the rescue.
\par A good way to vary your sentences is to begin them in different ways. For example, you could begin your
\par sentence with the subject and predicate and then build on them using various words and phrases. This type
\par of sentence is called a cumulative sentence. By contrast, in a periodic sentence, you use words and phrases
\par to build up to the subject and the predicate at the end of the sentence. Here are some examples:
\par Cumulative sentence:
\par The energetic children played hard, chasing each other in all directions, occasionally
\par falling and then scrambling to their feet, giggling at each other\rquote s antics and never stopping
\par for even a moment to catch their breath.
\par Periodic sentence:
\par With flour in her hair, dough in between her fingers and sauce all over her face, she
\par attempted to make a gourmet pizza.
\par Both types of sentences not only add variety, but also bring rhythm and cadence to writing. This rhythm
\par creates interest and is pleasant to the reader. Additionally, descriptive words paint a clear picture for the
\par reader.
\par Figurative Language
\par Another excellent way to paint vivid pictures for your reader is to use figures of speech. Figures of
\par speech\emdash like similes, metaphors, analogies, personification, hyperbole, irony, and allusion\emdash when used
\par correctly, add extra flair to your writing. They add to your style of writing an element that takes your
\par writing from ordinary to extraordinary.
\par Similes show a marked comparison between two things by using the phrases \'93like,\'94 \'93as,\'94 or \'93as if.\'94
\par Example:
\par The cat stood poised and still as a statue, waiting for the opportune moment to pounce.
\par Here the cat is described \'93as a statue\'94 because it is standing so still.
\par Metaphors show absolute comparison by omitting \'93like,\'94 \'93as,\'94 or \'93as if.\'94
\par Example:
\par She is Mother Theresa when it comes to her generosity and compassion.
\par Here the comparison is absolute because the writer states that this person is Mother Theresa; the writer does
\par not say that this person is just like Mother Theresa.
\par Analogies compare the similar features of two dissimilar things. Analogies often bring clarity to writing by
\par showing a reader another way of seeing something. Analogies are not limited to a sentence; sometimes an
\par analogy streams its way through an entire piece of writing.
\par Analytical Writing 565
\par Example:
\par Office cooperation is like a soccer game. Each employee has a position on the playing
\par field, and each position dictates an employee\rquote s function. Working together, the office
\par completes passes by communicating well within each department. Shots on goal are taken
\par when employees meet with prospective clients to pitch ideas. And the whole office
\par triumphs when a goal is scored and a prospect becomes a client.
\par Here one element, an office working together, is compared to another, a soccer team playing a game.
\par Although an office and a soccer team are two very unrelated things, the writer sees similarities in some
\par aspects between the two and uses these similarities to show more clearly how an office works together.
\par Personification gives human characteristics to animals, inanimate objects and ideas in order to make them
\par more real and understandable.
\par Example:
\par The rusty car groaned, coughed, then gave one last sputter and died.
\par The car in this sentence comes to life even as it \'93dies\'94 because of the human characteristics it is given.
\par Hyperbole uses deliberate exaggeration or overstatement to show special emphasis or create humor.
\par Example:
\par Fat-free foods have become so popular that soon all vendors will want to give it a shot.
\par Before you know it, Kentucky Fried Chicken will have fat-free fried chicken. Big Macs
\par will contain 0 grams of fat. And the amount of fat in a Pizza Hut cheese pizza? You
\par guessed it\emdash none!
\par In order to show how far out of hand peoples\rquote  obsession with fat-free foods has become, this description
\par purposefully exaggerates a world where the most unlikely things are fat-free.
\par Irony uses language that makes a suggestion that directly contrasts with the literal word or idea. It can offer
\par humor to writing, or a bitter tone when it is used in sarcasm.
\par Example:
\par Scientists have worked hard to develop ways to decrease infant mortality rates and
\par increase longevity. As a result, more people are living longer and scientists will soon
\par have to develop some methods with which to control overpopulation.
\par This sentence uses irony by predicting that, because scientists have now discovered ways to increase a
\par person\rquote s life span, they will soon have to deal with another problem\emdash overpopulation. This is because, with
\par everyone living longer, there will soon be too many people for the earth to support.
\par Allusion makes indirect reference to known cultural works, people or events. The familiarity allusions
\par bring to writing helps the writer make connections with the reader.
\par Example:
\par I have so much to do today, I feel like David must have felt as he approached Goliath.
\par Most people are familiar with the Bible story of David and Goliath. David is a small shepherd who slays
\par the giant, Goliath, with a slingshot and one stone after the army\rquote s best soldiers fail. Even through his feat,
\par however, David must have felt a bit intimidated when facing Goliath, a feeling this writer intimates when
\par thinking about everything that needs to be done.
\par TeamLRN
\par 566 GRE Prep Course
\par Figures of speech to avoid
\par Clich\'e9s are overused phrases that prevent your writing from being fresh and original, so don\rquote t use clich\'e9s
\par like \'93Cute as a button\'94 or \'93Busy as a bee.\'94
\par Mixed metaphors are comparisons that are not consistent; they only cause confusion. For example, \'93The
\par infant was like a baby bird, opening his cavernous well for food.\'94 Here the simile that an infant is like a
\par baby bird holds true, but the following words that equate the baby\rquote s mouth to a cavernous well are not
\par consistent.
\par Tone
\par The words you choose will greatly affect the tone of your essay. Likewise, the tone you wish to achieve
\par will depend on your audience. In this case, you know your audience will consist of men and women who
\par will be quickly reading your essay and then assigning a score based on their impression and how well you
\par handled the topic. Knowing this, you will want to use a professional, formal tone, the kind you will
\par probably use in most of your graduate work. Using a formal tone means that you will want to keep some
\par distance between you, the writer, and your audience, the scorer. Be courteous and polite but avoid being
\par chummy or intimate in any way. Furthermore, you should avoid all colloquialisms and slang.
\par Diction
\par While tone defines the overall language you use, diction deals with the specific kinds of words and phrases
\par you choose for your essay. Since you have already determined your audience and thus ascertained that you
\par need to portray a formal tone in your essay, you must be consistent with your diction, or word choice.
\par Diction may be classified as technical (homo sapien rather than human), formal (Please inform me when
\par you are ready to depart.), informal or colloquial (Give me a buzz when you\rquote re ready to go.), or slang (She\rquote s
\par a real couch potato and watches the tube from early morning \lquote til the cows come home.) Knowing that your
\par audience dictates a formal tone, you must also be consistent in maintaining formal diction. Look at the
\par following example of inconsistent diction:
\par Violence in schools has become an epidemic problem. School shootings occur regularly,
\par and fights erupt daily in the nation\rquote s classrooms. Even with the addition of metal detectors
\par at school entrances, violence will never be eradicated because the jocks are always
\par ganging up on the geeks. If only we could just all get along.
\par This example begins with a formal tone and formal diction; however, it takes a quick turn when the writer
\par uses slang words like \'93jocks\'94 and \'93geeks.\'94 The paragraph is concluded informally with \'93If only we could
\par just all get along.\'94
\par As you write your essay, and later when you proofread it, you will want to make sure that you preserve the
\par formality your audience requires.
\par Person
\par It is important to maintain consistency in person. For example, if you begin your essay in second person
\par (you) do not shift to third person (he, she, it, one, or they). Let\rquote s look at a couple of examples illustrating a
\par shift in person:
\par Example:
\par One can get excellent grades in school if you study hard.
\par The switch from \'93one\'94 to \'93you\'94 is confusing and awkward.
\par Example:
\par Off the coast of Puerto Rico, on the island of Vieques, is an old French mansion turned
\par hotel. Here one can enjoy spacious guest rooms and a cozy library. One can lounge
\par around the pool and indulge in the honorary pool bar. Because the hotel is not far from
\par the ocean, you can also take a leisurely walk down to the white sandy beach where one
\par can spend a lazy day basking in the sun.
\par The switch from one to you is confusing in this paragraph and detracts from the imagery. Decide from the
\par beginning of your essay what person you wish to employ and make a conscious effort to stick to it.
\par Analytical Writing 567
\par Developing Your Style
\par Your goal as a writer is to create interest and coherence through your unique writing style. Using figures of
\par speech and maintaining consistent use of tone, diction and person are effective ways to create interest.
\par Using transitions creates coherence. Also remember that part of creating coherence is being concise. Use
\par only the details that are necessary to support your topic and avoid tedious description. This is not to say that
\par you should avoid vivid imagery, but that you should take care to ensure that your information adds to your
\par writing rather than detracts from your writing.
\par In taking all of these elements of style into account, the most important aspect to remember about
\par developing your style is that it only comes through practice. Practice your writing and proofread, proofread,
\par proofread. If you do all of these things, you will be well on your way to becoming an effective, skillful
\par writer. Are you ready to start practicing? Let\rquote s move on and discuss the two different essays you will be
\par asked to write.
\par Warm-Up Drill II
\par Directions: Read each paragraph in the following essay and rewrite it, making necessary changes in order
\par to enhance the effectiveness of the essay. Pay close attention to all of the elements you learned about
\par writing style. Answers and solutions begin on the next page.
\par Issue prompt:
\par It is more beneficial to complete independent study than to attend college.
\par 1. This opinion is not valid and is clearly not based on any evidence that would prove its validity. One
\par can\rquote t gain more knowledge by completing independent study instead of attending college. It is necessary
\par to look at some evidence to prove this.
\par 2. Some people think that there are too many distractions at college because there are so many other
\par students who take up class time. Interaction with other students can provide valuable insight into topics
\par you study in college. Other people\rquote s backgrounds and experience add differences in perspectives and,
\par in some cases, valuable expertise. Professors add expertise as well since they are the experts in the
\par areas they are teaching. When a student studies on his own, he is dependent only on what he knows. He
\par is also dependent on what he can read about. He is also dependent on his own background and experiences.
\par This is very limiting to the value he can obtain from his education.
\par 3. Some people think that students can learn more discipline by studying independently at home instead
\par of going to college. College students learn a lot of discipline. They are held accountable by their
\par college professors. They are held accountable by fellow students too. They depend upon them to
\par contribute to the class. Students who study on their own are only accountable to themselves. Many
\par times, studies get set aside when life gets too busy. Studies get the boot when a student encounters a
\par subject they\rquote re not too excited about.
\par 4. Studying at home independently is not as beneficial as attending college because the degree you get, if
\par you get a degree at all, will not carry as much weight with potential employers as will a college degree
\par from an accredited college or university. Employers place more weight on someone whose expertise
\par they can depend on. Employers feel they can depend more on the expertise of someone who has been
\par trained at a college or university.
\par 5. People should go to college. You can\rquote t depend on your own motivation to finish your studies at home.
\par A student gains a lot more from the interaction they receive between other students and professors in
\par college. Students who get a degree from a college may have a better chance of getting a good job after
\par college.

\par 568 GRE Prep Course
\par Solutions to Warm-Up Drill II
\par 1. The opening sentence in this paragraph does not make an effective introduction. It does not restate the
\par topic but rather makes a direct address to the topic question. A good introduction should not require the
\par reader to read the topic. The second sentence of the paragraph gives a concise thesis statement but
\par should be elaborated on a bit. Also, the contraction can\rquote t does not fit with the formal tone of the essay.
\par The last sentence serves as a transition to the next paragraph, but it does not show much sophistication
\par or subtlety.
\par Better:
\par Should a student give up a college education in order to complete an independent study at home?
\par Although the financial savings of independent study may be substantial, one can gain more benefits by
\par obtaining a college or university education. Studying at a college or university can give a student a
\par broader education, can help him learn discipline through accountability, and can pay off in the long
\par run.
\par This introduction begins with a question, which is more effective than directly addressing the
\par question/topic. The thesis statement concisely lists three reasons a formal education is better than independent
\par study; this sentence gives the reader a clear idea of what the essay will be about.
\par 2. The first sentence serves as a topic sentence for the paragraph; however, it should be reworded to act as
\par a better transitional sentence, one that would tie in with the last sentence of the preceding paragraph.
\par The second sentence would function better with a transitional phrase like On the contrary to introduce
\par it. Also in this sentence, the use of second person you is inconsistent with the rest of the essay. The
\par fourth sentence uses the same two words add and expertise that were used in the preceding sentence.
\par These should be changed to add some variety. The next three sentences are repetitive and should be
\par combined.
\par Better:
\par Some people think that distractions at college from other students who take up class time results in a
\par narrow education. On the contrary, interaction with other students can provide valuable insight into the
\par topics one studies in college. Other people\rquote s backgrounds and experience add different perspectives
\par and, in some cases, valuable expertise. Professors offer much value as well since they are the experts in
\par the areas they are teaching. When a student studies on his own, he is dependent only on what he knows
\par or can read about and on his own background and experiences. This severely limits the value he can
\par obtain from his education.
\par The first sentence works as a transition because it uses the word narrow, which contrasts with the word
\par broader from the thesis statement in the preceding paragraph.
\par 3. The first sentence works well as a topic sentence, but it uses the same wording as the topic sentence for
\par the preceding paragraph. In the fifth sentence, the use of they and them is confusing because it is
\par unclear whether the pronoun reference is to the student or fellow students. The remaining sentences are
\par all the same length and therefore choppy. The last sentence strays from the formal tone of the essay. In
\par addition, the word they does not agree in person with a student.
\par Better:
\par One valuable lesson students can learn at college is discipline. College students learn a lot of discipline
\par because they are held accountable by their professors. Moreover, they are often held accountable by
\par fellow students who depend upon them to contribute to the class. Students who study on their own are
\par accountable only to themselves. Many times, studies get set aside when life gets too busy or when a
\par student encounters a subject for which he is not enthusiastic.
\par The word valuable ties in well with the word value in the last sentence of the preceding paragraph.
\par Thus, this sentence serves not only as a topic sentence but also as a transitional sentence.
\par Analytical Writing 569
\par 4. Again, the first sentence provides a good topic sentence but not a good transition from the preceding
\par paragraph. The second sentence unnecessarily repeats the word weight from the first sentence. In the
\par third sentence, the text shifts to second person you. The last sentence repeats the word depend from the
\par preceding sentence.
\par Better:
\par Studying at a college or university may not make every topic seem scintillating; however, when a
\par student is held accountable, he is more driven. As he is driven to succeed, he will eventually earn a
\par degree. Studying at home independently is not as beneficial as attending college because the degree a
\par student gets, if he gets a degree at all, will not carry as much weight with potential employers as will a
\par degree from an accredited college or university. Employers place more confidence in someone whose
\par expertise they can rely on. Employers feel they can depend more on the expertise of someone who has
\par been trained at a college or university.
\par The topic sentence in this paragraph provides transition because it refers to the preceding paragraph by
\par relating scintillating courses to being enthusiastic about subjects.
\par 5. The first sentence does not act as a thorough topic sentence, nor does it provide a good transition. The
\par second sentence uses you and your, which is an inconsistent use of person. In addition, the contraction
\par can\rquote t takes away from the formal tone of the essay. Overall, this last paragraph is not effective; it has
\par short, choppy sentences and does not adequately conclude the subject by restating the topic and giving
\par final remarks.
\par Better:
\par Whether one is trained at a university or opts to stay home to study independently, an education is
\par extremely important; however, it is clear that a student can benefit more from a formal education than
\par from independent study. Students should not depend on their own motivation to finish their studies, nor
\par should they miss out on the opportunity to benefit from the interaction they will receive from other
\par students and professors in college. Despite any financial savings a student may earn by studying
\par independently, the rewards of a college education will pay off in the long run.
\par The transition here works well because the first sentence uses the word trained, which is used in the
\par sentence before it. This final paragraph functions effectively as a conclusion because it restates the
\par topic. It also brings the writing full circle by once again mentioning the monetary aspect of education,
\par which, as you recall, was mentioned in the introductory paragraph.

\par Patterns of Development
\par Just as there is no universal answer to every question, there are many ways to write a persuasive Issue
\par essay. There are specific strategies that you can use to more effectively respond to different types of Issue
\par topics. These strategies, or methods, are called patterns of development. The type of pattern you choose to
\par employ in writing your essay is dependent upon the question or prompt to which you are responding.
\par Usually, an essay question will contain certain clues, which enable you to determine which pattern of
\par development to use. After choosing a method to use, you will find it much easier to develop a clear, concise
\par thesis, which, in turn, will affect the way you organize your essay.
\par There are three main patterns of development. Let\rquote s examine them now so we have a better understanding
\par of how to apply them. For each, we will discuss clues in an Issue question that prompt the use of a
\par particular pattern of development, we will look at an example of such a question, and we will determine
\par what your job as a writer will be in applying this method.
\par Comparison \endash  Contrast
\par An Issue question that commands the use of the Comparison \endash  Contrast pattern of development:
\par \bullet  will use words that suggest similarity or difference.
\par \bullet  will seek to persuade the reader that one item is superior to another.
\par Example:
\par \'93American cars are better than foreign cars.\'94
\par The author uses the word than to compare the two cars, and he seeks to persuade the reader that an
\par American car is a wiser choice than a foreign one.
\par Your job: By employing the Comparison \endash  Contrast pattern of development, you will portray similarities
\par and differences between two items to prove which one is superior, either in agreement or disagreement with
\par the author\rquote s opinion.
\par Cause \endash  Effect
\par An Issue question that requires the use of the Cause \endash  Effect method of response:
\par \bullet  may include an \'93If\'85then\'94 statement.
\par \bullet  may lack an effect.
\par Example (if\'85then):
\par \'93If college and university faculty spent time outside the academic world working in professions
\par relevant to the courses they teach, then the overall quality of higher education would greatly
\par increase.\'94
\par The author argues that if a certain action is taken, a desirable effect is achieved.
\par Your job: In your essay, you must prove that a particular cause results in a particular effect, either in
\par agreement or disagreement with the author.
\par Example (lack of effect):
\par \'93More restrictions should be set on teenage drivers.\'94
\par In this \'93call for action\'94 statement, the author offers no effects that will result if the action is taken, but
\par surely it is implied that, if the author feels the action should be taken, he assumes something positive will
\par result.
\par Your job: In your responsive essay, it would be your responsibility to support your position in agreement
\par with this statement or against it, thus proving the implied effect.
\par Analytical Writing 573
\par Definition
\par An Issue question that dictates the use of the Definition pattern of development:
\par \bullet  will attempt to show that, by definition, a particular idea or concept is of great value.
\par \bullet  may portray a very limited definition of an idea or concept.
\par Example (great value):
\par \'93Patriotism breaks down the walls of division.\'94
\par The author believes that a concept can do a great thing.
\par Your job: Define the idea or concept and show that, because of its attributes and qualities, it has value or it
\par lacks value.
\par Example (limited definition):
\par \'93A person\rquote s generosity can be determined by examining what he or she has given to charity.\'94
\par In this example, the author seeks to provide a very limited definition of a particular concept.
\par Your job: Support the author\rquote s definition with evidence, or show that the definition is much broader.
\par Writing Your Issue Essay
\par Now that you are familiar with the different methods you can employ to write your essay, let\rquote s get down to
\par the nitty gritty of organizing your thoughts by using these patterns of development. Remember, you are
\par aiming for a 6 essay, one that presents clear, concise evidence to support your view. Writing a 6 essay
\par doesn\rquote t have to be a difficult task. All you have to do is follow seven simple steps, some of which will ask
\par you to plug information into formulas. Note that some steps may include specific formulas for each pattern
\par of development. Also note that you need not enter complete, descriptive sentences into the formulas; simple
\par notes and phrases will suffice.

\par In order to properly present your perspective on an issue, you must first understand the issue you are being
\par asked to discuss. Understanding the issue allows you to fully develop your position, presenting your
\par evidence in a way that is most effective and appropriate for the topic. There are two steps that will help you
\par understand the issue.
\par First, take a couple of minutes to read the given question carefully. Second, ask yourself the following
\par questions:
\par \bullet  What does the statement mean?
\par \bullet  What is the issue at hand?
\par \bullet  What is implied by the statement?

\par Keeping in mind our discussion of the three patterns of development, look for the necessary criteria in your

\par The next, and perhaps the most important, step is to develop your thesis. Your thesis states the purpose of
\par your essay. Without a thesis statement, your reader does not know what you are setting out to prove. And
\par without a thesis statement, it would be very difficult to organize your essay with clarity and coherence.
\par Don\rquote t be intimidated by the task of formulating what is to be the crux of your essay. It can be quite simple.
\par Just use the formulas below:

\par Have you ever been in an argument and find that you\rquote re just not getting very far very fast? This could be
\par because you are failing to see things from the other person\rquote s point of view. Being able to see the \'93flip side
\par of the coin\'94 can go a long way in proving your point and disarming your opponent\rquote s objections. By
\par showing that you are aware, though perhaps not understanding, of the opposing side you are adding credibility
\par to your argument because it is clear that you have viewed the issue from all angles. To write an
\par effective position essay, you must present your knowledge of a counter argument. In other words, you must
\par show that you have considered the other side of the argument. Organize your counter argument this way:
\par COMPARISON \endash  CONTRAST COUNTER CLAIM (formula 2-1):
\par Others may think Item B is better than Item A because 1) __________,
\par 2) __________, 3) __________.
\par (Note that these three points should contrast directly with the three points of your thesis. (see formula
\par 1-1))
\par CAUSE \endash  EFFECT COUNTER CLAIM (formula 2-2):
\par Some may feel that __________ would cause __________ based on __________.
\par (Note that this point should contrast directly with point #1 of your thesis. (see formula 1-2))
\par DEFINITION (formula 2-3):

\par positive / negative.

\par and counter argument points. (Note that the following formulas require you to plug in the three numbered
\par items from your thesis in succession. Although it is not necessary that you discuss them in this order, we

\par \bullet  Is my thesis statement concise?
\par \bullet  Do my body paragraphs clearly support my thesis?
\par \bullet  Have I used logical transitions that help the text flow smoothly between sentences and between

\par \bullet  Have I maintained a formal tone and diction throughout my essay?
\par \bullet  Have I maintained consistent use of person (i.e., first, second, third)?

\par Modern-day housing developments are springing up everywhere, dotting hills and filling in every open

\par Many homeowners do not feel the need to be the designer behind their home. Rather, they strive to
\par \'93keep up with the Joneses\'94 by filling their houses with the same modern d\'e9cor that fills the homes of their
\par neighbors. On the flip side, when seeking to invest in a traditional home, the buyer has a plethora of options
\par because older homes offer so much uniqueness. This uniqueness can be seen in the motifs of style, which

\par Clearly, modern-day homes, which lack individuality, are built more quickly than homes of the past, a

\par pays attention to detail instead of putting up as many homes as possible in the shortest amount of time
\par possible. For example, in the past when builders did take extra time and care, the foundations and overall
\par structures were, and still are, much stronger. This is because many builders today, eager to make a quick
\par buck, do not give homes ample time to \'93settle\'94 on their foundation before continuing with the construction.
\par Overall, older houses are in better condition, even over the course of time, because they were more solidly

\par Colleges and universities require students, regardless of their majors, to complete General Education
\par courses, basic courses that cover general subject areas. These classes include basic literature and writing
\par courses, basic science and math courses, and basic arts classes like music and drama. Some feel students
\par should not be required to take these General Education classes. However, if students are not required to
\par take courses outside their major, they will be ill-prepared should they fail to get a job in their field, they
\par will lack important skills, and they will be close-minded and ignorant of things happening in the world
\par around them.
\par Many opponents of General Education classes are themselves unaware of the advantages of a wellrounded
\par education. They focus only on the theory that students will be more fully prepared to enter their
\par field as a result of more extensive study in their area. What they fail to see, however, is that many graduates
\par are not able to find jobs in their field of expertise. So, without a broad range of knowledge, these highly
\par trained graduates would be stuck in menial jobs.
\par Even if graduates do get jobs within their field, such a wide range of skills are required in the
\par workplace in order to be successful that, without a diverse educational background, a graduate will not be
\par fully competent in any job. For example, when a graduate begins looking for a job, she will discover that
\par excellent communication skills are invaluable in the workplace, both in dealing with customers and with
\par colleagues. Without some base of communication knowledge, such as a student would receive in a basic
\par English class, the candidate will be overlooked for someone who does show strength in communication.
\par Moreover, most jobs require strong problem-solving skills, skills that develop from learning how to think
\par and reason critically. These skills are reinforced in math and science classes.
\par Lack of familiarity in certain educational arenas, like math and science, results in a provincial attitude.
\par This lack of familiarity leads to disinterest in the areas where a student has not gained knowledge.
\par Likewise, this disinterest leads to apathy in participating or supporting any causes that are linked to these
\par fields of study. For example, a student who has not studied science will be indifferent to scientific ideas,
\par ideas which could become theories and could help all of mankind. A student who does not study politics
\par and government will likely be apathetic toward participating in important political events such as elections.
\par It is important that a country\rquote s citizens take part in supporting causes and concepts that generate a
\par common interest in society. Without a well-rounded schedule of classes in college, however, the citizen
\par base will soon be filled with people who are unprepared and indifferent to anything that does not directly
\par pertain to their area of interest. Instead of complaining about an opportunity to gain a broad range of
\par knowledge, students should consider it a privilege and an asset.

\par On your mark! All the runners are at the starting line. Get set! The runners are poised, in position. Go! The
\par runners take off. The spirit of competition is the driving force behind these runners\rquote  desire to win. And, as
\par an integral part of a society, competition brings many benefits. Everyone is given a chance to succeed in a
\par society where competition drives people to be their best, and competition recognizes the accomplishments
\par of those who advance.
\par Some feel that, although competition recognizes winners, there are so few winners that many are left
\par feeling insignificant and alienated. This attitude has, for example, lead to a movement to eliminate salutatorian
\par and valedictorian recognition and speeches at graduation ceremonies. Those in the movement claim
\par that acknowledging salutatorian and valedictorian students for their scholastic achievements causes other
\par students to feel slighted. This is a misguided assumption. Government gives everyone equal opportunity to
\par attend school and to excel. Some students work harder than others and deserve special honors at graduation.
\par Just like in a race, everyone begins at the same starting line and therefore has the same chance to succeed.
\par Each person makes his own decision about how he will run the race. No one has an excuse, then, for not
\par trying his best to succeed.
\par Competition drives people to achieve a goal. For most, this goal represents a person\rquote s best. Since
\par everyone\rquote s concept of \'93best\'94 is different, achievement differs for each person. Therefore, when an individual
\par reaches his goal, this gives him a certain status. This status is different for each person, depending on
\par the goal that was attained. This is extremely important because if competition did not place people at
\par different positions in life, the resulting equality would be stultifying to society. For example, the work force
\par would consist of only custodians and no CEO\rquote s or vice versa.
\par CEO\rquote s get to where they are only through competition. As an employee works hard and competes
\par within a company, he is rewarded for his accomplishments with promotions. Not only does competition
\par award people through tangible benefits like promotions, but competition also gives long-lasting psychological
\par awards such as a feeling of self-worth or pride. This recognition encourages people who succeed to
\par raise their personal goals even higher. Recognition also drives those who were not recognized to do better
\par so that they too may be rewarded.
\par Because competition results in rewards, both tangible and emotional, it is essential for a growing and
\par thriving society. Everyone begins at the same starting line and is given the same chance to succeed. When
\par the starting gun fires, it is up to each runner to decide how he will run the race. This decision will ultimately
\par determine who will become the winners. Driven by competition, these winners, along with the losers,
\par comprise a successful society.

\par More Sample Issue Essays
\par Issue prompt:
\par \'93There is little need for books today because one can learn just as much or more from
\par television.\'94
\par When I was little, I would line up my stuffed animals and \'93read\'94 to them. Although I was not old enough to
\par know the letters formed words and the words formed sentences, I knew there was a story to tell, and I knew
\par there was an audience who would be interested in hearing the story. Now I watch my two-year-old daughter
\par do the same thing. In this media age, books often take a back seat to television, which is unfortunate
\par because books offer so much more. Books are a better tool with which to build imagination. Moreover,
\par readers can gain much more knowledge from the wide variety of books that are available.
\par Satellite dishes and improved cable offer hundreds of channels, a variety that some TV viewers argue
\par is sufficient to replace reading. However, libraries and bookstores offer thousands, not hundreds, of titles
\par from which to choose. Among these choices, a reader can find books on any theme he chooses, from topics
\par of today to stories of every era in the past. Television, unfortunately, is controlled mostly by popular trends.
\par Aside from a handful of specialty channels like The History Channel, there is little on TV about historical
\par events. Furthermore, TV viewers\rquote  choices are limited since the television broadcasting companies choose
\par what they will offer on each channel.
\par A limited choice of TV channels results in limited knowledge. The written word offers much more
\par detail than television. Most TV shows are limited to two hours or less, and because of this time restriction,
\par fewer details can be included in shows like movies and documentaries. For example, a TV documentary on
\par orangutans would most likely be a one hour program which would offer some basic knowledge about
\par orangutans, their habitat and their way of life. A book about orangutans, on the other hand, would educate
\par the reader far beyond the basic knowledge he would gain from watching a television program.
\par In addition to offering more information on a greater number of subjects, the added description
\par included in books helps readers improve vocabulary. In books, readers see unfamiliar words in context,
\par enabling them to decipher the meaning. For TV viewers, unfamiliar words in conversation usually go
\par unnoticed. In fact, many people watch TV simply to \'93veg,\'94 or, in other words, to sit and do nothing but be
\par vaguely aware of the images flickering across the screen. Watching television requires little of the concentration
\par that is required for reading books; consequently the viewer overlooks many details.
\par Because watching TV does not require active participation, the imagination suffers. Television
\par programs take the viewer quickly from one scene to the next, prohibiting the viewer from taking notice of
\par the details of the setting. Books inspire imagination, allowing the reader to picture for herself the setting
\par and characters of the story. A book\rquote s character may be described as tall, dark complected, and wearing a
\par bright purple robe; it is up to the reader to imagine exactly what the character looks like. Is the character
\par Italian or perhaps Native American? Is the bright purple robe rather gaudy looking, or does it give the
\par TeamLRN
\par 584 GRE Prep Course
\par character an air of sophistication? Television makes those decisions for the viewer by placing in the
\par program a specific actor in garb chosen by costume designers, thus leaving little room for imagination.
\par Imagination is the key to forward thinking, thinking that brings a person success in what he does.
\par Without imagination, problems go unsolved and new and inventive ideas never make it to the drawing
\par board. Imagination produces creativity, which inspires dreamers. I hope my daughter will continue to be a
\par dreamer, allowing her imagination to blossom. And when the letters, then words, then sentences take form
\par for her, she will have the added benefit of gaining boundless knowledge from books.
\par Issue prompt:
\par \'93Many of today\rquote s technological conveniences were developed to save time. Ironically,
\par these developments have created an even more hurried, fast-paced society, where people
\par actually have less leisure time.\'94
\par Ah, the good ol\rquote  days! When people sat on their front porch talking and watching the world go by instead
\par of finishing up last-minute work on their laptops. When letters took a week to spread the latest news instead
\par of a few seconds through e-mail. In a world of pagers, faxes, cell phones, and computers, a very hurried
\par society is characterized by impatient workaholics whose nerves are on edge and whose lives are unknowingly
\par empty.
\par Many of today\rquote s conveniences were developed to meet growing impatience with the speed it took to
\par spread information. Through the development of such things as faxes, cell phones and e-mail, however, a
\par new impatience was born. This new impatience is characterized by frustration with the sophistication and
\par complexity of modern technology. Office workers grit their teeth in frustration when an e-mail takes too
\par long to download. In annoyance, they may shut down their computer assuming there is something wrong
\par with the machine. This wastes even more time while restarting the computer and finally retrieving the
\par culprit e-mail. Overnight delivery services emerged to meet this all-consuming impatience as well.
\par Oftentimes, however, even this speedy service is not expedient enough. Some find it necessary to rush a
\par package to the airport so that it may arrive at its destination just a few hours earlier.
\par This annoyance with our more efficient world has thrown society into a frenzy where even the most
\par technologically advanced equipment is unsatisfactorily slow. The resulting annoyance and impatience can
\par turn into rage in the office and on the highway, with stressed out employees who \'93go postal,\'94 losing all
\par rationale and even causing injury to colleagues. Preventable injuries occur on highways as road rage
\par consumes drivers who are eager to get to their next destination.
\par In a world where people are eager to pass information ever more quickly and get to their next destination
\par ever more quickly, this has truly become a society of workaholics. Because the transfer of information
\par is so much more efficient with modern technologies, workers find they can accomplish much more in a
\par given day. Driven by this fact, they work more hours. There is always time to make that last call or send a
\par quick e-mail at the end of the day. And portable conveniences like laptops and palm pilots make it possible
\par for people to work essentially anywhere; work is no longer confined to the office and is often completed at
\par home.
\par Perhaps the most detrimental aspect of our more hurried society lies at home. Because many people
\par spend more time working, and because work is transportable, many spouses discover that their partners
\par spend more time with their computers and cell phones than with their family. Additionally, other conveniences
\par like microwave meals encourage quick meals on-the-go. Rushed families rarely spend quality time
\par together around the dinner table. Rather, they all go their separate ways to eat in front of the TV, at the
\par computer, or at a desk reviewing reports.
\par At home, in the office and on the streets, a fast-paced society continues to become more hurried as
\par technology continues to match a perpetually growing impatience. Is all of this annoyance, frustration, and
\par rage worth the added convenience that technology has brought to our society? It hardly seems so. In fact, in
\par looking back at the good \lquote ol days, it seems that in a world with far less vexation and anger, there was more
\par happiness.

\par Issue prompt:
\par \'93Character is created in a crisis.\'94
\par In 1992, Hurricane Andrew slammed into Florida causing millions of dollars of damage. Many residents
\par lost everything, including their homes. Those houses that had the strongest foundations withstood the storm
\par most favorably. Additionally, the homes that had been adequately prepared to face the storm fared better
\par than those whose windows were not boarded. Character is like a house. If your character has a strong foundation
\par and displays traits of preparedness, you can weather a storm well. In this light, it is clear that character
\par is not born from crisis, but rather, it merely emerges during difficult times.
\par It is not adversity but the small moments of life that create character. Poor decisions, regardless of how
\par insignificant, break down your character. Anytime you are inconsistent in following your principles, no
\par matter how small the compromise, cracks in your foundation undoubtedly weaken your character. On the
\par positive side, though, you can learn a lot from your mistakes. In fact, lessons learned from failures are
\par indispensable in building character. To discern the lesson to be learned, however, takes conscious effort. If
\par you are unwilling to put effort into developing character, you will continue to repeat your mistakes, and
\par your life will stagnate.
\par Part of building character and thus avoiding stagnation is building on your strengths. Taking what is
\par good and making it exceptional is what character building is all about. Continued improvement in life
\par makes you stronger. This too takes a conscious effort in using strengths to positively affect others around
\par you. Channeling the positive to help others results in personal growth, which in turn builds character.
\par Only when you are willing to learn from your mistakes and make a conscious effort to grow can you
\par face a crisis successfully. It is during this adversity that character comes to light. If you have learned from
\par past failures, you will have the strength to face a crisis head on. You will have adequate problem-solving
\par skills to overcome obstacles set before you. If you have made the conscious effort to build on your positive
\par traits, you will have the means with which to get through the crisis positively with the will to move ahead.
\par The will and ability to move forward from crisis is the defining moment of your character. As you
\par move forward, though, you should never stop working to improve, because the stronger your foundation is,
\par the better it will weather any type of storm. What kind of storm can the foundation of your character
\par withstand?

\par \'93People should pursue careers that provide financial security even if they do not enjoy
\par the work.\'94
\par \'93I want to be a fireman when I grow up!\'94 A simple dream from a young child in response to the question
\par every youngster faces at one point or another: What do you want to be when you grow up? The innocence
\par of a child, however, protects him from the world of finances; something everyone is forced to face later on
\par in life. And when that realization hits, what path is best for a person to take: the path that leads to a career
\par with large financial promises, or the one that leads to a career that provides more personal satisfaction?
\par Because contentment has so many rewards, it is better for a person to choose the job that will provide
\par happiness even if it does not pay as well as other jobs.
\par Some people find it necessary to get the best paying job to make financial ends meet. Often someone in
\par financial dire straits will stick with a good paying job just long enough to get ahead and then, because they
\par are unhappy at the job, they quit to find work elsewhere. This has several negative effects. First, the transition
\par to a new job is difficult, and it can be made worse for a new employee if they are followed by negativity.
\par Company officers are reluctant to invest training time and money in employees only to have them leave
\par after a short time and therefore may not be willing to provide favorable references. Second, workers who
\par leave jobs after short periods of time are not with a company long enough to advance within the company.
\par These workers may find that they would have done just as well to begin in a job that they like even if it did
\par not pay as well, because by the time they start all over, they could have already been promoted. The
\par increase in salary that comes with most promotions could equal the wages they were earning at the job they
\par did not enjoy.
\par The potential for promotion should be a major consideration when deciding between the high paying
\par job and the job that provides satisfaction. Employees in positions they do not enjoy often work with a poor
\par attitude. This promotes laziness and apathy. Managers quickly pick up on this and likely pass up these types
\par of employees for promotions. On the other hand, workers who enjoy their job greet each workday with
\par enthusiasm, fresh creativity and perseverance. Bosses commend this type of work ethic and reward such
\par employees with promotions.
\par TeamLRN
\par 586 GRE Prep Course
\par Careers that offer promotions and, most importantly, job satisfaction stimulate self-respect and pride.
\par These characteristics are priceless and have an enormously positive impact on a person and their job
\par performance. The employee who has pride in what he does takes ownership. He is empowered to take
\par charge of the position he holds and give it 110 percent. This attitude has a domino effect and soon colleagues
\par begin to take more pride in their work as well. Managers notice this natural leadership and reward it
\par with promotions.
\par Taking pride in a job leads to success, not just monetarily, but also personally. Personal success and
\par satisfaction far outweigh monetary gain. So if the little boy still wants to be a fireman when he grows up, he
\par should be a fireman, even if it means he will live in a modest home instead of a mansion. He will never
\par regret the happiness and contentment he will feel by following his dream instead of following the green.

\par Although some may believe that focusing on the need for self-improvement assumes that there is
\par something inherently wrong with people, this focus maintains quite the opposite. In fact, self-improvement
\par helps build character. Building character involves taking a person\rquote s strengths and building on them. Such
\par strengths as unselfishness can be developed into a lifelong habit of generosity, a positive spirit into an

\par strengths through self-improvement.
\par Everyone also has weaknesses. Weaknesses are not flaws, but rather negative traits that, through selfimprovement,
\par can be developed into more positive traits. For example, impatience can be turned into
\par determination to accomplish goals. Strong will can be turned into perseverance. If a person can just find a
\par way to capitalize on a weakness, it can be turned into a strength. Self-improvement is the best way to do
\par this.
\par Recent focus on self-improvement is valuable because of the wealth of resources such a focus offers.
\par There is a plethora of different ways a person can work on self-improvement. Groups offer support for
\par improvement, and individual strategies are available in many different forms. Books and videos offer plans
\par for developing a positive attitude. Gyms and health stores offer ways to build self-esteem by building better
\par health.
\par No matter the method a person chooses for self-improvement, every individual has room to improve.
\par Even when a person reaches a specific goal of improvement, there are still ways to build on character and
\par become a person with more positive traits. Those who grow in character, grow in self-esteem, which then
\par breeds confidence. Confidence and a feeling of self-worth give people the power to positively influence

\par Public figures should expect their private lives to be scrutinized.
\par Television shows, newspapers, books, magazines and tabloids delve into the lives of singers, actors,
\par athletes and politicians on a daily basis. Should these public figures expect to lose some of their privacy?
\par Whether they want to or not, people who are in positions that will sometimes place them in the spotlight
\par open themselves to scrutiny from their audience, because people have a natural curiosity and interest in
\par those who have achieved fame.
\par Although public figures should expect some scrutiny in their lives, there is a point where it can become

\par recklessly to get away from aggressive Paparazzi. As a result, the car spun out of control killing Diana.
\par Other similar stories report stalkers and \'93Peeping Toms\'94 who take too much liberty in examining the
\par private lives of stars, athletes and politicians. While these are extreme cases of obsession, public figures
\par must realize that there is a natural human desire to more intimately know the familiar faces on TV or on the
\par Analytical Writing 587
\par sports field. This is especially true of actors and actresses. Television and movie viewers get to know their
\par favorite characters on screen and therefore have a desire to \'93get to know\'94 the actors behind these
\par characters.
\par Not only do people want to get to know those whom they look up to, but they also strive to be like their
\par favorite stars. Ads on TV encourage viewers to \'93Be like Mike [Michael Jordan].\'94 On Halloween, teenage
\par girls can emulate their favorite pop singer by obtaining a Britney Spears costume. Although many people
\par admittedly would not choose a life of glamour and fame, there is something alluring about the lifestyle, and
\par therefore admirers of people in the limelight are driven to discover personal facts about those whom they
\par admire. Knowing these intimate details makes a famous person seem more down-to-earth and thus allows
\par the ordinary person to feel like they have something in common with the rich and famous.
\par The media makes a concerted effort to give viewers a chance to become acquainted with public
\par figures. They splash familiar stars\rquote  faces on the cover of magazines. Channels like E! and VH1 feature
\par behind the scenes stories about singers and actors, their highs and lows and how they became famous.
\par Tabloids are a huge business supported by readers who hungrily devour the latest gossip about their
\par favorite star. Even the news capitalizes on human interest stories that feature public figures. For example,
\par although long and drawn-out, OJ Simpson\rquote s murder trial dominated the news, yet no one seemed to
\par complain.
\par The news often highlights human interest stories that uncover the blunders of politicians. Former
\par President Clinton\rquote s escapades with Monica Lewinsky, for example, made headlines for months. Many
\par public figures, especially politicians, anticipate the scrutinizing eye under which they will find themselves
\par and proactively confess to past mistakes. This takes some of the media pressure off them. Sadly, others find
\par themselves on the front cover of every magazine and newspaper and in every headline when marital
\par infidelity or an encounter with drugs is exposed.
\par Politicians are of deep interest to the public because they are the nation\rquote s leaders. Since people must
\par place some trust in political figures to run the country effectively, politicians should expect their private
\par lives to be examined. Not only should they expect ordinary citizens to dig into their lives, but they should
\par also anticipate other political figures to look closely at their lives. Political campaigns, unfortunately, often
\par focus on tearing apart the opponent. To do this, a politician must find a way to attack his opponent, which
\par requires investigating the personal life of the candidate. This comes with the territory. If a would-be politician
\par cannot stomach having some negative aspect of his life exposed, he should not enter the world of
\par politics.
\par Although many people work hard to achieve the fame of a popular singer, actor, athlete, or politician,
\par some become bitterly disenchanted with the lifestyle when they realize they may lose much of their
\par privacy. This should certainly be a matter of consideration before pursuing any career that places a person
\par in the spotlight. It is, after all, natural that admirers will be interested in the details of the life of public
\par figures. Public figures should consider this admiration flattery rather than an intrusion on their privacy.

\par she lacks the ability to apply herself and therefore is not doing well. As a result, she does not enjoy school
\par and often cuts classes to hang out at the mall with friends who share her same ethic. Sally enjoys athletics

\par and often works so late, the family rarely sees him. Sally\rquote s mother works in an office, but after work, she
\par enjoys going out with her colleagues. Often, Sally is on her own when she gets home and must prepare
\par dinner for herself and her 12-year-old sister. Sally\rquote s parents have missed countless parent-teacher conferences
\par and have yet to meet most of her teachers. They are aware of only one instance of Sally\rquote s truancy;

\par heard about her \'93first\'94 unexcused absence from school, they did nothing but tell her not to do it again.
\par Tommy is also a Sophomore. He is intelligent and works hard to obtain near-perfect grades. He enjoys

\par has never considered skipping school because he knows the consequences at home would be great.
\par Two students, two very different results at school and two opposite attitudes about life. The difference?
\par Parental involvement. Although teachers can equip a student with the tools he needs to succeed in life, it is
\par up to parents to instill in their children the motivation and determination to use these tools to be successful.
\par To do this, parents must be willing to be involved in every aspect of their children\rquote s lives, particularly in
\par their education. It is unfair for parents to expect teachers and school administrators to take sole responsibility
\par for the complete education and training that prepares a student for his adult life.
\par Some parents feel inadequate to help their children in school because they are unfamiliar with their
\par children\rquote s school subjects, or because they did not do well in school themselves. No matter how little
\par academic knowledge parents have, however, they can play an integral part in her child\rquote s education. For
\par example, there are many opportunities to volunteer in schools. Parents can become a part of the school\rquote s
\par Parent-Teacher Association or Parent-Teacher-Student Organization. Parents can help with sports\rquote  teams or

\par in school matters like homework. They can help their children with things the children do not understand
\par or get a tutor if they do not understand it either.
\par Although parents cannot always help a child scholastically, they can teach their children lifelong
\par lessons in motivation and determination. If a man wants to learn how to fish, he can obtain a net and a boat
\par Analytical Writing 589
\par and learn how to cast the net. But he is not a fisherman simply because he has the right tools and knowledge.
\par Someone must instill in him the motivation and determination to sit on a boat day after day performing
\par the tedious task of casting a net that does not always produce a big catch. In the same way, a teacher
\par can give their students the book knowledge they need to be experts in various fields; however, it is the
\par parents who must empower their children to use the knowledge to be successful. This requires parents to
\par teach their children the value of education and thus inspire motivation; parents must teach their children
\par never to give up and thus inspire determination.
\par Only motivated learners have the determination to gain the knowledge and responsibility that will
\par enable them to succeed in life. It is the responsibility of parents to instill in their children these qualities.
\par One of the most effective ways parents can teach their children the importance of such qualities is by
\par modeling them in their own lives. Parents should make an effort to model responsibility through motivation
\par and determination in their own lives. Such examples provide the best lessons a student will ever learn.

\par Logic
\par Because the Analyze an Argument section of the test requires you to critique an argument and discuss the
\par logical soundness of it, we will study the logic of arguments before we begin writing our essays.
\par Conclusions
\par Most argument questions hinge, either directly or indirectly, on determining the conclusion of the
\par argument. The conclusion is the main idea of the argument. It is what the writer tries to persuade the reader
\par to believe. Most often the conclusion comes at the end of the argument. The writer organizes the facts and
\par his opinions so that they build up to the conclusion. Sometimes, however, the conclusion will come at the
\par beginning of an argument; rarely does it come in the middle; and occasionally, for rhetorical effect, the
\par conclusion is not even stated.
\par Example:
\par The police are the armed guardians of the social order. The blacks are the chief domestic
\par victims of the American social order. A conflict of interest exists, therefore, between the
\par blacks and the police.\emdash Eldridge Cleaver, Soul on Ice
\par Here the first two sentences anticipate or set up the conclusion. By changing the grammar slightly, the
\par conclusion can be placed at the beginning of the argument and still sound natural:
\par A conflict of interest exists between the blacks and the police because the police are the
\par armed guardians of the social order and the blacks are the chief domestic victims of the
\par American social order.
\par The conclusion can also be forced into the middle:
\par The police are the armed guardians of the social order. So a conflict of interest exists
\par between the blacks and the police because the blacks are the chief domestic victims of the
\par American social order.
\par It is generally awkward, as in the previous paragraph, to place the conclusion in the middle of the
\par argument because then it cannot be fully anticipated by what comes before nor fully explained by what
\par comes after. On the rare occasion when a conclusion comes in the middle of an argument, most often either
\par the material that comes after it or the material that comes before it is not essential.
\par In summary: To find the conclusion, check the last sentence of the argument. If that is not the
\par conclusion, check the first sentence. Rarely does the conclusion come in the middle of an argument.
\par Writers use certain words to indicate that the conclusion is about to be stated. Following is a list of the
\par most common conclusion indicators:
\par CONCLUSION INDICATORS
\par hence therefore
\par so accordingly
\par thus consequently
\par follows that shows that
\par conclude that implies
\par as a result means that
\par These conclusion flags are very helpful, but you must use them cautiously because many of these words
\par have other functions.
\par Example:
\par All devout Muslims abstain from alcohol. Steve is a devout Muslim. Thus, he abstains
\par from alcohol.
\par In this example, thus anticipates the conclusion that necessarily follows from the first two sentences. Notice
\par the different function of thus in the following argument.
\par Analytical Writing 593
\par Example:
\par The problem is simple when the solution is thus stated.
\par In this example, thus means \'93in that manner.\'94
\par Most often the conclusion of an argument is put in the form of a statement (as with every example we have
\par considered so far). Sometimes, however, the conclusion is given as a command or obligation.
\par Example:
\par All things considered, you ought to vote.
\par Here, the author implies that you are obliged to vote.
\par Example:
\par Son, unless you go to college, you will not make a success of yourself. No Carnegie has
\par ever been a failure. So you will go to college.
\par Here the conclusion is given as an imperative command.
\par The conclusion can even be put in the form of a question. This rhetorical technique is quite effective
\par in convincing people that a certain position is correct. We are more likely to believe something if we feel
\par that we concluded it on our own, or at least if we feel that we were not told to believe it. A conclusion put
\par in question form can have this result.
\par Example:
\par The Nanuuts believe that they should not take from Nature anything She cannot replenish
\par during their lifetime. This assures that future generations can enjoy the same riches of
\par Nature that they have. At the current rate of destruction, the rain forests will disappear
\par during our lifetime. Do we have an obligation to future generations to prevent this result?
\par Here the author trusts that the power of her argument will persuade the reader to answer the question
\par affirmatively.
\par Taking this rhetorical technique one step further, the writer may build up to the conclusion but leave it
\par unstated. This allows the reader to make up his own mind. If the build-up is done skillfully, the reader will
\par be more likely to agree with the author, without feeling manipulated.
\par Example:
\par He who is without sin should cast the first stone. There is no one here who does not have
\par a skeleton in his closet.
\par The unstated but obvious conclusion here is that none of the people has the right to cast the first stone.
\par When determining the conclusion\rquote s scope be careful not to read any more or less into it than the author
\par states. Certain words limit the scope of a statement. These words are called quantifiers\emdash pay close attention
\par to them. Following is a list of the most important quantifiers:

\par Example:
\par Whether the world is Euclidean or non-Euclidean is still an open question. However, if a
\par star\rquote s position is predicted based on non-Euclidean geometry, then when a telescope is
\par pointed to where the star should be it will be there. Whereas, if the star\rquote s position is
\par predicted based on Euclidean geometry, then when a telescope is pointed to where the
\par star should be it won\rquote t be there. This strongly indicates that the world is probably non-
\par Euclidean.
\par Although the opening to the passage states that we don\rquote t know whether the world is non-Euclidean, the
\par author goes on to give evidence that it is non-Euclidean. The author doesn\rquote t say that the world is non-
\par Euclidean, just that evidence strongly indicates that it is. In the last sentence, the word probably properly
\par limits the scope of the main idea that the world is most likely non-Euclidean but can\rquote t be stated so

\par 8. In time I began to recognize that all of these smaller complaints about rigidity, emotional suffocation,

\par Analytical Writing 595
\par Premises
\par Once you\rquote ve found the conclusion, most often everything else in the argument will be either premises or
\par \'93noise.\'94 The premises provide evidence for the conclusion; they form the foundation or infrastructure upon
\par which the conclusion depends. To determine whether a statement is a premise, ask yourself whether it
\par supports the conclusion. If so, it\rquote s a premise. Earlier we saw that writers use certain words to flag
\par conclusions; likewise writers use certain words to flag premises. Following is a partial list of the most
\par common premise indicators:
\par PREMISE INDICATORS
\par because for
\par since is evidence that
\par if in that
\par as owing to
\par suppose inasmuch as
\par assume may be derived from
\par Premise indicators are very helpful. As with conclusion indicators, though, you must use them
\par cautiously because they have other functions. For example, since can indicate a premise, or it can merely
\par indicate time.
\par Example:
\par Since the incumbent\rquote s views are out of step with public opinion, he probably will not be
\par reelected.
\par Here since is used to flag the premise that the incumbent\rquote s positions are unpopular. Contrast this use of
\par since with the following example.
\par Example:
\par Since the incumbent was elected to office, he has spent less and less time with his family.
\par In this case, since merely expresses a passage of time. The statement as a whole expresses an observation,
\par rather than an argument.
\par Suppressed Premises
\par Most arguments depend on one or more unstated premises. Sometimes this indicates a weakness in the
\par argument, an oversight by the writer. More often, however, certain premises are left tacit because they are
\par too numerous, or the writer assumes that his audience is aware of the assumptions, or he wants the audience
\par to fill in the premise themselves and therefore be more likely to believe the conclusion.
\par Example:
\par Conclusion: I knew he did it.
\par Premise: Only a guilty person would accept immunity from prosecution.
\par The suppressed premise is that he did, in fact, accept immunity. The speaker assumes that his audience is
\par aware of this fact or at least is willing to believe it, so to state it would be redundant and ponderous. If the
\par unstated premise were false (that is, he did not accept immunity), the argument would not technically be a
\par lie; but it would be very deceptive. The unscrupulous writer may use this ploy if he thinks that he can get
\par away with it. That is, his argument has the intended effect and the false premise, though implicit, is hard to
\par find or is ambiguous. Politicians are not at all above using this tactic.
\par Example:
\par Politician: A hawk should not be elected President because this country has seen too
\par many wars.
\par The argument has two tacit premises\emdash one obvious, the other subtle. Clearly, the politician has labeled his
\par opponent a hawk, and he hopes the audience will accept that label. Furthermore, although he does not state
\par TeamLRN
\par 596 GRE Prep Course
\par it explicitly, the argument rests on the assumption that a hawk is likely to start a war. He hopes the audience
\par will fill in that premise, thereby tainting his opponent as a warmonger.
\par When attacking an argument, we often challenge its suppressed premises. Finding the suppressed
\par premise, or assumption, of an argument can be difficult. To test whether something is a suppressed premise,
\par ask yourself whether it would make the argument more plausible. If so, then it is very likely a suppressed
\par premise.
\par Example:
\par American attitudes tend to be rather insular, but there is much we can learn from other
\par countries. In Japan, for example, workers set aside some time each day to exercise, and
\par many corporations provide elaborate exercise facilities for their employees. Few
\par American corporations have such exercise programs. Studies have shown that the
\par Japanese worker is more productive than the American worker. Thus it must be
\par concluded that the productivity of American workers will lag behind their Japanese
\par counterparts, until mandatory exercise programs are introduced.
\par The unstated essence of the argument is that exercise is an integral part of productivity and that Japanese
\par workers are more productive than American workers because they exercise more.
\par Example (Suppressed false premise):
\par The petrochemical industry claims that chemical waste dumps pose no threat to people
\par living near them. If this is true, then why do they locate the plants in sparsely populated
\par regions? By not locating the chemical dumps in densely populated areas the petrochemical
\par industry tacitly admits that these chemicals are potentially dangerous to the people
\par living nearby.
\par The suppressed false premise of the argument is that, all things being equal, there is no reason to prefer
\par locating the sites in sparsely populated areas. To weaken the argument, we need to show it is not true that
\par all things are equal. In other words, there are advantages other than safety in locating the sites in sparsely
\par populated areas, such as cost and ease.
\par Example (Suppressed true premise):
\par The news media is often accused of being willing to do anything for ratings. However,
\par recent action by a television network indicates that the news media is sometimes guided
\par by moral principle. This network discovered through polling voters on the east coast that
\par the Republican candidate for President had garnered enough votes to ensure victory
\par before the polls closed on the west coast. However, the network withheld this information
\par until the polls on the west coast closed so that the information would not affect the
\par outcome of key congressional races.
\par The suppressed premise in this argument is that the network expected its ratings to increase if it predicted
\par the winner of the presidential race, and to decrease if did not predict the winner.

\par Inductive vs. Deductive Logic
\par An argument is deductive if its conclusion necessarily follows from its premises\emdash otherwise it is inductive.
\par In an inductive argument, the author presents the premises as evidence or reasons for the conclusion. The
\par validity of the conclusion depends on how compelling the premises are. Unlike deductive arguments, the
\par conclusion of an inductive argument is never certain. The truth of the conclusion can range from highly
\par likely to highly unlikely. In reasonable arguments, the conclusion is likely. In fallacious arguments, it is
\par improbable. We will study both reasonable and fallacious arguments.
\par We will classify the three major types of inductive reasoning\emdash generalization, analogy, and causal\emdash 
\par and their associated fallacies.
\par Generalization
\par Generalization and analogy, which we consider in the next section, are the main tools by which we
\par accumulate knowledge and analyze our world. Many people define generalization as \'93inductive reasoning.\'94
\par In colloquial speech, the phrase \'93to generalize\'94 carries a negative connotation. To argue by generalization,
\par however, is neither inherently good nor bad. The relative validity of a generalization depends on both the
\par context of the argument and the likelihood that its conclusion is true. Polling organizations make predictions
\par by generalizing information from a small sample of the population, which hopefully represents the
\par general population. The soundness of their predictions (arguments) depends on how representative the
\par sample is and on its size. Clearly, the less comprehensive a conclusion is the more likely it is to be true. For
\par example,
\par During the late seventies when Japan was rapidly expanding its share of the American
\par auto market, GM surveyed owners of GM cars and asked them whether they would be
\par more willing to buy a large, powerful car or a small, economical car. Seventy percent of
\par those who responded said that they would prefer a large car. On the basis of this survey,
\par GM decided to continue building large cars. Yet during the \lquote 80\rquote s, GM lost even more of
\par the market to the Japanese.
\par The argument generalizes from the survey to the general car-buying population, so the reliability of the
\par projection depends on how representative the sample is. Suppose eighty percent of the owners who wanted
\par big cars and only 40 percent of the owners who wanted small cars replied to the survey. Then the survey
\par would not represent the entire public and therefore would not be reliable.
\par Analogy
\par To argue by analogy is to claim that because two things are similar in some respects, they will be similar in
\par others. Medical experimentation on animals is predicated on such reasoning. The argument goes like this:
\par the metabolism of pigs, for example, is similar to that of humans, and high doses of saccharine cause cancer
\par in pigs. Therefore, high doses of saccharine probably cause cancer in humans.
\par Clearly, the greater the similarity between the two things being compared, the stronger the argument
\par will be. Also, the less ambitious the conclusion, the stronger the argument will be. The argument above
\par would be strengthened by changing probably to may. It can be weakened by pointing out the dissimilarities
\par between pigs and people.
\par The following words usually indicate that an analogy is being drawn:
\par ANALOGY INDICATORS
\par like likewise
\par similar also
\par too compared to
\par as with just as . . . so too . . .
\par Often, however, a writer will use an analogy without flagging it with any of the above words.
\par Just as the fishing line becomes too taut, so too the trials and tribulations of life in the city
\par can become so stressful that one\rquote s mind can snap.
\par The argument compares the tautness in a fishing line to the stress of city life; it then concludes that the
\par mind can snap just as a fishing line can.

\par Causal Reasoning
\par Of the three types of inductive reasoning we will discuss, causal reasoning is both the weakest and the most
\par prone to fallacy. Nevertheless, it is a useful and common method of thought.
\par To argue by causation is to claim that one thing causes another. A causal argument can be either weak
\par or strong depending on the context. For example, to claim that you won the lottery because you saw a
\par shooting star the night before is clearly fallacious. However, most people believe that smoking causes
\par cancer because cancer often strikes those with a history of cigarette use. Although the connection between
\par smoking and cancer is virtually certain, as with all inductive arguments, it can never be 100 percent certain.
\par Cigarette companies have claimed that there may be a genetic predisposition in some people to both
\par develop cancer and crave nicotine. Although this claim is highly improbable, it is conceivable.
\par There are two common fallacies associated with causal reasoning:
\par 1. Confusing Correlation with Causation.
\par To claim that A caused B merely because A occurred immediately before B is clearly
\par questionable. It may be only coincidental that they occurred together, or something else
\par may have caused them to occur together. For example, the fact that insomnia and lack of
\par appetite often occur together does not mean that one necessarily causes the other. They
\par may both be symptoms of an underlying condition.
\par 2. Confusing Necessary Conditions with Sufficient Conditions.
\par A is necessary for B means \'93B cannot occur without A.\'94 A is sufficient for B means \'93A
\par causes B to occur, but B can still occur without A.\'94 For example, a small tax base is sufficient
\par to cause a budget deficit, but excessive spending can cause a deficit even with a large
\par tax base. A common fallacy is to assume that a necessary condition is sufficient to cause a
\par situation. For example, to win a modern war it is necessary to have modern, high-tech
\par equipment, but it is not sufficient, as Iraq discovered in the Persian Gulf War.
\par Logical Fallacies
\par Now that we have examined the components of logic that make up an argument, let\rquote s define some logical
\par fallacies. Fallacies in an argument are elements of faulty reasoning that weaken the argument and may even
\par make it invalid.
\par Contradiction
\par Contradiction is the most glaring type of fallacy. It is committed when two opposing statements are simultaneously
\par asserted. For example, saying \'93it is raining and it is not raining\'94 is a contradiction. Typically,
\par however, the writer obscures the contradiction to the point that the argument can be quite compelling. Take,
\par for instance, the following argument:
\par \'93We cannot know anything, because we intuitively realize that our thoughts are unreliable.\'94
\par This argument has an air of reasonableness to it. But intuitively realize means \'93to know.\'94 Thus the writer is
\par in essence saying that we know that we don\rquote t know anything. This is self-contradictory.
\par Equivocation
\par Equivocation is the use of a word in more than one sense during an argument. This technique is often used
\par by politicians to leave themselves an \'93out.\'94 If someone objects to a particular statement, the politician can
\par simply claim the other meaning.
\par Individual rights must be championed by the government. It is right for one to believe in
\par God. So government should promote the belief in God.
\par In this argument, right is used ambiguously. In the first sentence, it is used in the sense of a privilege,
\par whereas in the second sentence right is used to mean proper or moral. The questionable conclusion is
\par possible only if the arguer is allowed to play with the meaning of the critical word right.
\par Analytical Writing 601
\par Circular Reasoning
\par Circular reasoning involves assuming as a premise that which you are trying to prove. Intuitively, it may
\par seem that no one would fall for such an argument. However, the conclusion may appear to state something
\par additional, or the argument may be so long that the reader may forget that the conclusion was stated as a
\par premise.
\par Example:
\par The death penalty is appropriate for traitors because it is right to execute those who
\par betray their own country and thereby risk the lives of millions.
\par This argument is circular because \'93right\'94 means essentially the same thing as \'93appropriate.\'94 In effect, the
\par writer is saying that the death penalty is appropriate because it is appropriate.
\par Example:
\par Democracy is the best form of government yet created. Therefore, we must be vigilant in
\par its defense; that is, we must be prepared to defend the right to freedom. Because this right
\par is fundamental to any progressive form of government, it is clear that democracy is better
\par than any other form of government.
\par This argument is circular. It is incumbent on the writer to give evidence or support for the conclusion. In
\par this argument, though, the writer first states that democracy is the best government, the rest is merely
\par \'93noise,\'94 until he restates the conclusion.
\par Shifting the Burden of Proof
\par It is incumbent on the writer to provide evidence or support for her position. To imply that a position is true
\par merely because no one has disproved it is to shift the burden of proof to others.
\par Example:
\par Since no one has been able to prove God\rquote s existence, there must not be a God.
\par There are two major weaknesses in this argument. First, the fact that God\rquote s existence has yet to be proven
\par does not preclude any future proof of existence. Second, if there is a God, one would expect that his existence
\par is independent of any proof by man.
\par Example:
\par Astronomers have created a mathematical model for determining whether life exists
\par outside our solar system. It is based on the assumption that life as we know it can exist
\par only on a planet such as our own, and that our sun, which has nine planets circling it, is
\par the kind of star commonly found throughout the universe. Hence it is projected that there
\par are billions of planets with conditions similar to our own. So astronomers have concluded
\par that it is highly probable, if not virtually certain, that life exists outside our solar system.
\par Yet there has never been discovered so much as one planet beyond our solar system.
\par Hence life exists only on planet Earth.
\par This argument implies that since no planet has been discovered outside our solar system, none exist and
\par therefore no life exists elsewhere in the universe. Hence the burden of proof is shifted from the arguer to
\par the astronomers.
\par Reasoning by shifting the burden of proof is not always fallacious. In fact, our legal system is predicated
\par on this method of thought. The defendant is assumed innocent until proven guilty. This assumption
\par shifts the onus of proof to the state. Science can also validly use this method of thought to better understand
\par the world\emdash so long as it is not used to claim \'93truth.\'94 Consider the following argument: \'93The multitude of
\par theories about our world have failed to codify and predict its behavior as well as Einstein\rquote s theory of
\par relativity. Therefore, our world is probably \lquote Einsteinian.\rquote \'94 This argument is strong so long as it is qualified
\par with probably\emdash otherwise it is fallacious: someone may yet create a better theory of our world.

\par Unwarranted Assumptions
\par The fallacy of unwarranted assumption is committed when the conclusion of an argument is based on a
\par premise (implicit or explicit) that is false or unwarranted. An assumption is unwarranted when it is false\emdash 
\par these premises are usually suppressed or vaguely written. An assumption is also unwarranted when it is true
\par but does not apply in the given context\emdash these premises are usually explicit. The varieties of unwarranted
\par assumptions are too numerous to classify, but a few examples should give you the basic idea.
\par Example (False Dichotomy):
\par Either restrictions must be placed on freedom of speech or certain subversive elements in
\par society will use it to destroy this country. Since to allow the latter to occur is unconscionable,
\par we must restrict freedom of speech.
\par The writer offers two options: either restrict freedom of speech, or lose the country. He hopes the reader
\par will assume that these are the only options available. This is unwarranted. He does not state how the socalled
\par \'93subversive elements\'94 would destroy the country, nor for that matter, why they would want to
\par destroy it. There may be a third option that the author did not mention; namely, that society may be able to
\par tolerate the \'93subversives\'94 and it may even be improved by the diversity of opinion they offer.
\par Example:
\par To score in the ninetieth percentile on the GRE, one must study hard. If one studies four
\par hours a day for one month, she will score in the ninetieth percentile. Hence, if a person
\par scored in the top ten percent on the GRE, then she must have studied at least four hours a
\par day for one month.
\par You may have noticed that this argument uses the converse of the fallacy \'93Confusing Necessary Conditions
\par with Sufficient Conditions\'94 mentioned earlier. In other words, it assumes that something which is sufficient
\par is also necessary. In the given argument, this is fallacious because some people may still score in the
\par ninetieth percentile, though they studied less than four hours a day for one month.
\par Example:
\par Of course Steve supports government sponsorship of the arts. He\rquote s an artist.
\par This argument is fallacious\emdash and unfair\emdash because it assumes that all artists support government sponsorship
\par of the arts. Some artists, however, may have reasons for not supporting government sponsorship of the
\par arts. For example, they may believe that government involvement stifles artistic expression. Or they may
\par reject government involvement on purely philosophical grounds. The argument suggests a person\rquote s profession
\par taints his opinion.
\par Appeal to Authority
\par To appeal to authority is to cite an expert\rquote s opinion as support for one\rquote s own opinion. This method of
\par thought is not necessarily fallacious. Clearly, the reasonableness of the argument depends on the
\par \'93expertise\'94 of the person being cited and whether she is an expert in a field relevant to the argument.
\par Appealing to a doctor\rquote s authority on a medical issue, for example, would be reasonable; but if the issue is
\par about dermatology and the doctor is an orthopedist, then the argument would be questionable.
\par The legalization of drugs is advocated by no less respectable people than William F.
\par Buckley and federal judge Edmund J. Reinholt. These people would not propose a social
\par policy that is likely to be harmful. So there is little risk in experimenting with a one-year
\par legalization of drugs.
\par The only evidence that the author gives to support her position is that respected people agree with her. She
\par is appealing to the authority of others.
\par Analytical Writing 603
\par Personal Attack
\par In a personal attack (ad hominem), a person\rquote s character is challenged instead of her opinions, thereby
\par deflecting attention away from a solid argument.
\par Politician: How can we trust my opponent to be true to the voters? He isn\rquote t true to his wife!
\par This argument is weak because it attacks the opponent\rquote s character, not his positions. Some people may
\par consider fidelity a prerequisite for public office. History, however, shows no correlation between fidelity
\par and great political leadership.
\par A reporter responded with the following to the charge that he resorted to tabloid journalism when he
\par rummaged through and reported on the contents of garbage taken from the home of Henry Kissinger.
\par \'93Of all the printed commentary . . . only a few editorial writers thought to express the
\par obvious point that when it comes to invasion of privacy, the man who as National
\par Security Advisor helped to bug the home phones of his own staff members is one of our
\par nation\rquote s leading practitioners.\'94\emdash Washington Monthly, October 1975
\par The reporter justifies his actions by claiming that Kissinger is guilty of wrongdoing. So, instead of addressing
\par the question, he attacks the character of Henry Kissinger.
\par True But Irrelevant
\par This tactic is quite simple: the arguer bases a conclusion on information that is true but not germane to the
\par issue.
\par Example:
\par This pain relief product is available over the counter or in a stronger form with a prescription.
\par But according to this pamphlet, for the prescription strength product to be effective
\par it must be taken at the immediate onset of pain, it must be taken every four hours
\par thereafter, and it cannot be taken with any dairy products. So it actually doesn\rquote t matter
\par whether you use the prescription strength or the over-the-counter strength product.
\par It is unreasonable to reject the effectiveness of a product merely because it has modest requirements for
\par use. All medications have directions and restrictions. So, it cannot be concluded that just because the
\par prescription strength product has certain guidelines and restrictions on its use that it is not more effective.
\par Identifying the conclusion of the argument you are given is essential in your analysis. From there, recognizing
\par the author\rquote s premises will enable you to identify any flaws in the argument. Only then will you be able
\par to write an effective analysis.

\par On-the-job accidents are a major concern to companies. Every year, workplace injuries cost companies
\par thousands of dollars in medical expenses and wages paid to recovering employees. Naturally, these companies
\par look for ways to reduce risks and make the workplace safer. Recently, a memo went out to Presto
\par Product employees regarding on-the-job accidents. It seems that Presto\rquote s rate of accidents is 25 percent
\par higher than that of nearby Mega Manufacturing. The memo suggested that Presto employees\rquote  workdays
\par should be shortened by one hour by starting work at 9:00 instead of 8:00. However, this argument has
\par several flaws: Based on an assumption that Presto employees work more hours than Mega Manufacturing,
\par it offers fatigue as the main factor in these accidents, and it does not discuss the size of the companies or
\par describe what each company does.
\par By not taking into account what each company does, the Presto memo fails to accurately identify the
\par cause of on-the-job accidents. For example, perhaps Presto Products uses forklifts and Mega Manufacturing
\par does not. If this were the case, Presto could have a higher rate of accidents involving those workers who
\par operate the heavy machinery. In addition, the type of work Presto employees do could be more of a
\par contributing factor to fatigue than the number of hours worked. If workers at Presto Products spend a
\par majority of the day on their feet, they would clearly be more affected by fatigue than a company whose
\par employees spend much of their time at desks.
\par In addition to the misguided assumptions the Presto memo makes about fatigue, it also fails to consider
\par break times during a workday. By law, companies are required to give their employees a certain number of
\par timed breaks. The number of breaks required is dependent upon the number of hours an employee is
\par required to work. Therefore, it is possible that at Mega Manufacturing employees get fewer breaks than
\par Presto employees do. Moreover, perhaps lunch time at Mega Manufacturing is shorter than at Presto. Over
\par Analytical Writing 607
\par the course of a day, then, Presto employees may work the same number of hours as the workers at Mega
\par Manufacturing.
\par Besides failing to consider break times during the workday, the Presto memo also omits important
\par information. The memo should address various concrete factors such as the size of the Presto\rquote s building and
\par the number of employees working there. By comparing this information to the same type of information
\par from Mega Manufacturing, it may be possible to draw an accurate comparison. For example, perhaps
\par Presto\rquote s staff has outgrown their facility while Mega Manufacturing\rquote s small staff enjoys the luxury of
\par private offices and a large spacious warehouse. For Presto, a crowded building could become a hazard.

\par Argument
\par A national news station recently reported the following:
\par \'93Over the past few years, the number of women leaving the workforce to stay at home
\par with their children has increased by 47%. More mothers are exploring this option
\par because they dislike dropping their children off at daycare. Therefore, if companies wish
\par to retain these mothers as employees, they should build onsite daycare centers.\'94
\par Analysis
\par Over the last two decades, women have made great strides in improving the equality between men and
\par women in the workforce. However, although women are climbing the corporate ladder faster and more
\par frequently than ever, a new trend has evolved. A national news station discussed this trend citing the results
\par of a recent survey, which shows a dramatic increase in the number of women who are leaving their careers
\par to stay at home with their children. The news report suggested that mothers are quitting their jobs because
\par they dislike leaving their children at daycare. Therefore, they implored, if companies wish to retain these
\par mothers as employees, they should build onsite daycare centers. Although the survey results in this argument
\par are valid, they are not fully developed and the suggested solution makes generalized assumptions and
\par omits other important avenues companies could explore to retain employees.
\par The news station was accurate in reporting that many women are opting to stay home with their
\par children rather than to go to work. Basing this claim on a survey adds credibility to the report. However, the
\par writers at the news station should have considered investigating the matter more thoroughly and thus fully
\par developing the story. In addition to obtaining the results from the survey that indicated the increase in the
\par number of homemakers, they should have requested more detailed results that would explain the reasons
\par more women are leaving their jobs to stay at home. If these results were not readily available, the station
\par should have considered conducting their own survey to obtain these answers.
\par Had the station obtained more details about the reasons so many women are leaving the workforce,
\par they would not have made the mistaken assumption that mothers\rquote  dislike of daycare is the main reason
\par behind the trend. Perhaps they would have realized that, although it is true that mothers do not like having
\par to drop their children off at daycare, there are more specifics to the dilemma. For example, some families
\par discover that the cost of daycare, commuting, and a work wardrobe surpasses the cost to a one-income
\par family where the father works and the mother saves on the added expense that comes from holding a job.
\par Many mothers are staying home simply because they feel more comfortable being the one to raise their
\par children. They realize that they are missing many important aspects of their children\rquote s lives and make the
\par necessary monetary adjustments to become a one-income family.
\par Clearly, there are many reasons some families are opting to live on one salary, and these reasons go
\par beyond the daycare factor. If the news station had discussed these reasons, they would probably have made
\par several other suggestions to companies who wish to retain these women as employees. For example, companies
\par could explore alternate scheduling options such as flex schedules and part-time work. Flex schedules
\par would allow mothers to take part in important events in their children\rquote s lives by scheduling their workday
\par around their children\rquote s schedules. An employee on a flex schedule could, for example, come in earlier than
\par other employees and leave in time to catch her child\rquote s baseball game. Part-time opportunities not only give
\par mothers more time with their children, but they also help alleviate the cost of daycare and commuting. A
\par part-timer may choose to just work three days a week, spending the other two at home. Many women
\par would likely stay with their company if they were given an opportunity to telecommute. This would be an
\par excellent option for companies to offer to mothers whose jobs require excessive computer work or research
\par as this can easily be done from a remote location.
\par Although the news station\rquote s suggestion that companies should build onsite daycare centers was a
\par viable one, the station should certainly have taken more time to fully address the issue. They should
\par consider giving a follow-up report in which they discuss other reasons women are returning home to be
\par with their children. These details will likely lead to further suggestions they can give to companies struggling
\par with the popular trend of women giving up their careers to be homemakers.

\par Argument
\par The following is from a speech by the president of the Best Charity Club to her club members:
\par \'93Three months ago, the Charity for Youth Club held a bake sale at the annual Fourth of
\par July Bash in town. They raised over $2,000. Our club budget currently has a deficit of
\par $1,000, and we have some pending purchases and contributions which total over $1,000.
\par This brings our monetary need to $2,000. We should hold a bake sale at the annual
\par Christmas Party at the civic center in order to raise the funds we need to cover these
\par costs.\'94
\par Analysis
\par Every year, charities raise thousands of dollars for good causes. Recently in a speech to her club members,
\par the president of the Best Charity Club mentioned that at the last Fourth of July Bash, the Charity for Youth
\par Club raised over $2,000 by conducting a bake sale. To meet monetary needs of $2,000, the president stated
\par that it would be in the best interest of the Best Charity Club to hold a similar fundraiser at the annual
\par Christmas Party. Although the president was probably correct in recounting the profit the Charity for Youth
\par Club made at the Fourth of July Bash, she is too quick to assume that her club can make similar profits; she
\par has failed to analyze specific details about the Charity for Youth Club\rquote s fundraiser to confirm that her club
\par can duplicate the bake sale and its favorable results.
\par The president of the Best Charity Club assumes that her club can duplicate the results of the Charity for
\par Youth Club\rquote s summer bake sale. However, along with this assumption is the presumption that charitable
\par givers will be as willing to donate to her club\rquote s charity as to the cause of the Charity for Youth Club. She
\par does not discuss either cause, so we do not have a reference from which to judge. Perhaps the Charity for
\par Youth Club raises money for children who have cancer. Perhaps the Best Charity Club donates money to
\par political causes. Clearly, children with cancer pull at peoples\rquote  heartstrings more strongly than do politicians.
\par Causes that tug at a person\rquote s heart are more likely to get people to open their wallets as well.
\par Regardless of the specific cause, however, the president of Best Charity assumes that people will be just as
\par likely to give at the Christmas party as at the Fourth of July event. Since people often spend a lot of money
\par on Christmas gifts, they may not be as willing to give to charity as during the summer months.
\par Not only will the Best Charity Club need to plan for a bake sale at a different time of year than the
\par Charity for Youth\rquote s sale, but they will also need to project how many baked goods to prepare and what
\par kinds. The president of the Best Charity Club failed to address these specifics of the Charity for Youth
\par Club\rquote s bake sale. For example, it would be helpful for the Best Charity Club to be knowledgeable about
\par what types of baked goods sold well at the Charity for Youth\rquote s bake sale and what pricing was set for each
\par item. If the president does not address these details, her club\rquote s bake sale may not be as successful.
\par The president must look even further than the pricing her club should set for the baked goods. She
\par must also look at the costs that her club will incur. She has omitted these costs from her speech, but without
\par some knowledge of a budget for baking products and rent for a selling space at the Christmas party, she
\par cannot accurately calculate the profit her club can make. Without this calculation, she will have a difficult
\par time setting goals with her club members.
\par Many specifics still need to be discussed with all club members. The president of Best Charity Club
\par should not assume that her club can hold a bake sale that will add the necessary profit of $2,000 to their
\par bank ledger. Even though another charity has been successful in this way, she cannot guarantee to her club
\par members that they can equal this effort. She must give her club members more details from the Charity for
\par Youth Club\rquote s bake sale such as items sold, pricing, and cost to the club. From there, she should brainstorm
\par with her club about other fundraising ideas in case their bake sale does not ring up the necessary number of
\par sales to meet the deficit in her club\rquote s budget.

\par Argument
\par The following is from a television campaign ad:
\par \'93Residents of Lawrence County should elect Thornton Campbell as school superintendent
\par in the next election. Thornton Campbell has served as superintendent for 16 years in
\par neighboring Downs County. Since he became superintendent, Downs County Schools
\par have improved their test scores by 43%. If we elect Campbell, Lawrence County School
\par test scores will improve.\'94
\par Analysis
\par You\rquote ve seen them on TV around election time\emdash political ads, one after another, bombarding you with the
\par accomplishments of one candidate and the \'93dirt\'94 on another. Knowing what to believe and what to dismiss
\par as mere drivel can be difficult. It is easy to believe things that are stated as fact. For example, in a recent
\par television political ad, supporters of Superintendent Thornton Campbell suggested that he should be elected
\par superintendent of Lawrence County. The ad offered support by reviewing Campbell\rquote s past record as
\par superintendent of neighboring Downs County. Apparently, test scores in this county went up by 43%. The
\par ad suggested, then, that if Campbell were elected superintendent of Lawrence County, their test scores
\par would improve as well. Although the ad states a positive statistic, it does not provide enough information
\par for voters to make a well-informed decision to vote for Campbell as superintendent.
\par The ad does not provide adequate information because its assumptions are misleading. The ad assumes
\par that the improvement in test scores is a direct result of Campbell\rquote s efforts; however, there are other factors
\par that could have played a vital role in the higher scores. For example, perhaps the test has changed.
\par Standardized tests are under continual revision. Revisions over a number of years could result in higher
\par scores as students adapt to the test. This improvement could have coincidentally corresponded with
\par Campbell\rquote s term as superintendent of Down\rquote s County Schools making it seem as though it was a result of
\par Campbell\rquote s service as superintendent.
\par Even if the ad did prove that the improved test scores at Downs County were a direct result of
\par Campbell\rquote s work, it assumes that he can duplicate the results in a different county. The most significant
\par element of any county is its people. There is no mention of the population that makes up each county. For
\par example, suppose Lawrence County is more ethnically diverse than Downs County. Campbell\rquote s strengths
\par may not lie in dealing with a diverse student body and work staff; he may not be as successful in such a
\par situation.
\par Perhaps the ad should have focused on other positive efforts that made Campbell successful when he
\par served as superintendent of Downs County. Many voters may be more interested in knowing how the
\par candidate dealt with violence in Downs County School, for example, than they are in test scores. In addition,
\par if the ad gave voters more information about Campbell\rquote s past, they would be able to compare him
\par more intelligently with other candidates.
\par Voters need many details to make good decisions when they cast their vote. This ad does not provide
\par enough details about Thornton Campbell. Campbell\rquote s supporters should submit another ad that cites
\par examples of programs that Campbell instituted that played a direct role in improving the students\rquote  test
\par scores. In addition, they should expand the ad to include details about other positive efforts that made a
\par difference during Campbell\rquote s term as superintendent in Downs County. From these details, voters can get
\par an idea of what Campbell could bring to Lawrence County Schools that would benefit students and
\par teachers. Voters not only want a superintendent who can help a school system raise test scores, but they
\par also want to be assured that he will effectively combat violence in school, make it a priority to get graduates
\par in to college, improve athletic programs and institute a quality curriculum. Voters must see more details
\par about Thornton Campbell in order to cast a well-informed vote.}{\f37\fs20\insrsid11230344
