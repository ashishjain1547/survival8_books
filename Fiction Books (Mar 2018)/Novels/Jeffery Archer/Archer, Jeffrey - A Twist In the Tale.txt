Jeffrey Archer is a master
storyteller, the author of six
novels which have all been
worldwide bestsellers. NOT A PENNY
MORE, NOT A PENNY LESS was his
first book which achieved instant
success. Next came the tense and
terrifying thriller SHALL WE TELL
THE PRESIDENT? followed by his
triumphant bestseller KANE AND
ABEL. His first collection of short
stories, A QUIVER FULL OF ARROWS,
came next and then THE PRODIGAL
DAUGHTER, the superb sequel to KANE
AND ABEL. This was followed by
FIRST AMONG EQUALS, considered by
The Scotsman to be the finest novel
about Parliament since Trollope,
and most recently by the gripping
chase story, A MATTER OF HONOUR.

His first stage play, BEYOND
REASONABLE DOUBT, opened in London
in September 1987 and played for
two years. His new play, EXCLUSIVE,
has just opened in the West End of
London (see back page).

Jeffrey Archer was born in 1940 and
educated at Wellington School,

Britain in the 100 metres in the
early sixties, and became the
youngest member of the House of
Commons when he won the by-election
at Louth in 1969. He wrote his
first novel, NOT A PENNY MORE, NOT
A PENNY LESS, in 1974. From Septem-
ber 1985-to October 1986 he was
Deputy Chairman of the Conservative
Party. Jeffrey Archer is married

 THE PERFECT MURDER

                IF
I hadn't changed my
mind that night I
would never have
found out the truth.

  I couldn't believe
that Carla had slept
with another man,
that she had lied
about her love for
me - and that I
might be second or
even third in her
affections.

  Carla had phoned
me at the office
during the day,
something I had told
her not to do, but
since I also warned
her never to call me
at home she hadn't
been left with a lot
of choice. As it
turned out; all she
had wanted to let me
know was that she
wouldn't be able to
make it for what the
French so decorously
call a "c~nq a
sept". She had to
visit her sister in
Fulham who had been
taken ill, she
explained.

  I was
disappointed. It had
been another
depressing day, and
now I was being
asked to forgo the
one thing that would
have made it
bearable.

  "I thought you
didn't get on well
with your sister," I
said tartly.

  There was no
immediate reply from
the other end.
Eventually Carla
asked, "Shall we
make it next
Tuesday, the usual
time?"

13

        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  "I don't know if that's
convenient," I said. "I'll call you
on Monday when I know what my plans
are." I put down the receiver.

  Wearily, I phoned my wife to let
her know I was on the way home -
something I usually did from the
phone box outside Carla's flat. It
was a trick I often used to make
Elizabeth feel she knew where I was
every moment of the day.

  Most of the office staff had
already left for the night so I
gathered together some papers I
could work on at home. Since the
new company had taken us over six
months ago, the management had not
only sacked my Number Two in the
accounts department but expected me
to cover his work as well as my
own. I was hardly in a position to
complain, since my new boss made it
abundantly dear that if I didn't
like the arrangement I should feel
free to seek employment elsewhere.
I might have, too, but I couldn't
think of many firms that would
readily take on a man who had
reached that magic age somewhere
between the sought-after and the
available.

  As I drove out of the office car
park and joined the evening rush
hour I began to regret having been
so sharp with Carla. After all, the
role of the other woman was hardly
one she delighted in. The feeling
of guilt persisted, so that when I
reached the corner of Sloane
Square, I jumped out of my car and
ran across the road.

  "A dozen roses," I said, fumbling
with my wallet.

  A man who must have made his
profit from lovers selected twelve
unopened buds without comment. My
choice didn't show a great deal of

                14
                 
        THE PERFECT MURDER

imagination but at least Carla
would know I'd tried.

  I drove on towards her flat,
hoping she had not yet left for
her sister's, that perhaps we
might even find time for a quick
drink. Then I remembered that I
had already told my wife I was on
the way home. A few minutes' delay
could be explained by a

~uvt:r my staying on for a drink.

  When I arrived at Carla's home I
had the usual trouble finding a
parking space, until I spotted a
gap that would just take a Rover
opposite the paper shop. I stopped
and would have backed into the
space had I not noticed a man
coming out of the entrance to her
block of flats. I wouldn't have
given it a second thought if Carla
hadn't followed him a moment later.
She stood there in the doorway,
wearing a loose blue housecoat. She
leaned forward to give her
departing visitor a kiss that could
hardly have been described as
sisterly. As she closed the door I
drove my car round the corner and
doubleparked.

  I watched the man in my rear-view
mirror as he crossed the road, went
into the newsagent and a few
moments later reappeared with an
evening paper and what looked like
a packet of cigarettes. He walked
to his car, a blue BMW, stopped to
remove a parking ticket from his
windscreen and appeared to curse.
How long had the BMW been there? I
even began to wonder if he had been
with Carla when she phoned to tell
me not to come round.

  The man climbed into the BMW,
fastened his seat belt and lit a
cigarette before driving off. I
took

                15
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

his parking meter space in
part-payment for my woman. I didn't
consider it a fair exchange. I
checked up and down the street, as
I always did, before getting out
and walking over to the block of
flats. It was already dark and no
one gave me a second glance. I
pressed the bell marked 'Moorland'.

  When Carla opened the front door
I was greeted with a huge smile
which quickly turned into a frown,
thenjust as quickly back to a
smile. The first smile must have
been meant for the BMW man. I often
wondered why she wouldn't give me a
frontdoor key. I stared into those
blue eyes that had first captivated
me so many months ago. Despite her
smile, those eyes now revealed a
coldness I had never seen before.

  She turned to re-open the door and
let me into her ground-floor flat.
I noticed that under her housecoat
she was wearing the wine-red
negligee I had given her for
Christmas. Once inside the flat I
found myself checking round the
room I knew so well. On the glass
table in the centre of the room
stood the 'Snoopy' coffee mug I
usually drank from, empty. By its
side was Carla's mug, also empty,
and a dozen roses arranged in a
vase. The buds were just beginning
to open.

  I have always been quick to chide
and the sight of the flowers made
it impossible for me to hide my
anger.

"And who was the man who just
left?" I asked.

  "An insurance broker," she
replied, removing the mugs from the
table.

  "And what was he insuring?" I
asked. "Your love-life?"

                16
                 
        THE PERFECT MURDER

  "Why do you automatically assume
he's my lover?" Her voice had begun
to rise.

  "Do you usually have coffee with
an insurance broker in your
negligee? Come to think of it, my
negligee."

  "I'll have coffee with whom I damn
well please," she said, "and
wearing what I damn well please,
especially when you are on your way
home to your wife."

"But I had wanted to come to you -"

  "And then return to your wife. In
any case, you're always telling me
I should lead my own life and not
rely on you," she added, an
argument Carla often fell back on
when she had something to hide.

"You know it's not that easy."

  "I know it's easy enough for you
tojump into bed with me whenever it
suits you. That's all I'm good for,
isn't it?"

"That's not fair."

  "Not fair? Weren't you hoping for
your usual at six so you could
still be home at seven in time for
supper with Elizabeth?"

  "I haven't made love to my wife in
years!" I shouted.

  "We only have your word for that,"
she spat out with scorn.

"I have been utterly faithful to
you."

  "Which means I always have to be
to you, I suppose?"

"Stop behaving like a whore."

  Carla's eyes flashed as she leaped
forward and slapped me across the
face with all the strength she
could muster.

                17
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  I was still slightly off-balance
when she raised her arm a second
time, but as her hand came swinging
towards me I blocked it and was even
able to push her back against the
mantelpiece. She recovered quickly
and came flying at me again.

  In a moment of uncontrolled fury,
just as she was about to launch
herself on me, I clenched my fist
and took a swing at her. I caught
her on the side of the chin, and she
wheeled back from the impact. I
watched her put an arm out to break
her fall. But before she had the
chance to leap back up and
retaliate, I turned and strode out,
slamming the flat door behind me.

  I ran down the hall, out on to the
street, jumped into my car and drove
off quickly. I couldn't have been
with her for more than ten minutes.
Although I felt like murdering her
at the time I regretted having hit
her long before I reached home.
Twice I nearly turned back.
Everything she had complained about
was fair and I wondered if I dared
phone her from home. Although Carla
and I had only been lovers for a few
months, she must have known how much
I cared.

  If Elizabeth had intended to
comment on my being late, she
changed her mind the moment I handed
her the roses. She began to arrange
them in a vase while I poured myself
a large whisky. I waited for her to
say something as I rarely drank
before dinner but she seemed
preoccupied with the flowers.
Although I had already made up my
mind to phone Carla and try to make
amends, I decided I couldn't do it
from home. In any case, if I waited
until the morning when I was back in
the of lice, she might by then have
calmed down a little.

                18
                 
        THE PERFECT MURDER

  I woke early the next day and lay
in bed, considering what form my
apology should take. I decided to
invite her to lunch at the little
French bistro she liked so much,
half way between my office hers.
Carla always appreciated seeing me
in the middle of the day, when she
knew it couldn't be for sex. After
I had shaved and dressed I joined
Elizabeth for breakfast, and seeing
there was nothing interesting on
the front page, I turned to the
financial section. The company's
shares had fallen again, following
City forecasts of poor interim
profits. Millions would undoubtedly
be wiped offour share value
following such a bad piece of
publicity. I already knew that when
it came to publishing the annual
accounts it would be a miracle if
the company didn't declare a loss.

  After gulping down a second cup of
coffee I kissed my wife on the
cheek and made for the car. It was
then that I decided to drop a note
through Carla's letterbox rather
than cope with the embarrassment of
a phone call.

  "Forgive me," I wrote. "Marcel's,
one o'clock. Sole ~croniqzu on a
Friday. Love, Casaneva." I rarely
wrote to Carla, and when I did I
only ever signed it with her chosen
nickname.

  I took a short detour so that I
could pass her home but was held up
by a traffic jam. As I approached
the flat I could see that the
hold-up was being caused by some
sort of accident. It had to be
quite a serious one because there
was an ambulance blocking the other
side of the road and delaying the
flow of oncoming vehicles. A
traffic warden was trying to help
but she was only slowing things
down even more. It was obvious that
it was going to be

                19
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

impossible to park anywhere near
Carla's flat, so I resigned
myselfto phoning her from the of
fice. I did not relish the
prospect.

  I felt a sinking feeling moments
later when I saw that the ambulance
was parked only a few yards from
the front door to her block of
flats. I knew I was being
irrational but I began to fear the
worst. I tried to convince myself
it was probably a road accident and
had nothing to do with Carla.

  It was then that I spotted the
police car tucked in behind the
ambulance.

  As I drew level with the two
vehicles I saw that Carla's front
door was wide open. A man in a long
white coat came scurrying out and
opened the back ofthe ambulance. I
stopped my car to observe more
carefully what was going on, hoping
the man behind me would not become
impatient. Drivers coming from the
other direction raised a hand to
thank me for allowing them to pass.
I thought I could let a dozen or so
through before anyone would start
to complain. The traffic warden
helped by urging them on.

  Then a stretcher appeared at the
end of the hall. Two uniformed
orderlies carried a shrouded body
out on to the road and placed-it in
the back of the ambulance. I was
unable to see the face because it
was covered by the sheet, but a
third man, who could only have been
a detective, walked immediately
behind the stretcher. He was
carrying a plastic bag, inside
which I could make out a red
garment that I feared was the
negligee I had given Carla.

  I vomited my breakfast all over
the passenger seat, my head finally
resting on the steering wheel.

                20
                 
        THE PERFECT MURDER

A moment later they closed the
ambulance door, a siren started up
and the traffic warden began waving
me on. The ambulance moved quickly
off and the man behind me started
to press his horn. He was, after
all, only an innocent
bysitter.Ilurched forward and later
couldn't recall any part of my
journey to the office..

  Once I had reached the office car
park I cleared up the mess on the
passenger seat as best I could and
left a window open before taking a
lift to the washroom on the seventh
floor. I tore my lunch invitation
to Carla into little pieces and
flushed them down the lavatory. I
walked into my room on the twelfth
floor a little after eight thirty,
to find the managing director
pacing up and down in front of my
desk, obviously waiting for me. I
had quite forgotten that it was
Friday and he always expected the
latest completed figures to be
ready for his consideration.

  This Friday it turned out he also
wanted the projected accounts for
the months of May, June and July. I
promised they would be on his desk
by midday. The one thing I needed
was a clear morning and I was not
going to be allowed it.

  Every time the phone rang, the
door opened or anyone even spoke to
me, my heart missed a beatI assumed
it could only be the police. By
midday I had finished some sort of
report for the managing director,
but I knew he would find it neither
adequate nor accurate. As soon as I
had deposited the papers with his
secretary, I left for an early
lunch. I realised I wouldn't be
able to eat anything, but at least
I could get hold of the first
edition of the

                21
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

Standard and search for any news
they might have picked up about
Carla's death.

  I sat in the corner of my local
pub where I knew I couldn't be seen
from behind the bar. A tomato juice
by my side, I began slowly to turn
the pages of the paper.

  She hadn't made page one. She
hadn't made the second, third or
fourth page. And on page five she
rated only a tiny paragraph. "Miss
Carla Moorland, aged 31, was found
dead at her home in Pimlico earlier
this morning." I remember thinking
at the time they hadn't even got
her age right. "Detective Inspector
Simmons, who has been put in charge
of the case, said that an
investigation was being carried out
and they were awaiting the path-
ologist's report but to date they
had no reason to suspect foul
play."

  After that piece of news I even
managed a little soup and a roll.
Once I had read the report a second
time I made my way back to the of
lice car park and sat in my car. I
wound down the other front window
to allow more fresh air in before
turning on the World At One on the
radio. Carla didn't even get a
mention. In the age of pump
shotguns, drugs, Aids and gold
bullion robberies the death of a
thirtytwo-year-old industrial
personal assistant had passed
unnoticed by the BBC.

  I returned to my of lice to find
on my desk a memo containing a
series of questions that had been
fired back from the managing
director, leaving me in no doubt as
to how he felt about my report. I
was able to deal with nearly all
his queries and return the answers
to his secretary before I left the
office that night, despite spending
most of the afternoon trying

                22
                 
        THE PERFECT MURDER

to convince myself that whatever
had caused Carla's death must have
happened after I left and could not
possibly have been connected with
my hitting her. But that red
negligee kept returning to my
thoughts. Was there any way they
could trace it back to me? I had
bought it at Harrods - an
extravagance, but I felt certain it
couldn't be unique and it was still
the only serious present I'd ever
given her. But the note that was
attached - had Carla destroyed it?
Would they discover who Casaneva
was?

  I drove directly home that
evening, aware that I would never
again be able to travel down the
road Carla had lived in. I listened
to the end of the PM programme on
my car radio and as soon as I
reached home switched on the six
o'clock news. I turned to Channel
Four at seven and back to the BBC
at nine. I returned to ITV at ten
and even ended up watching
Newsnight.

  Carla's death, in their combined
editorial opinion, must have been
less important than a
Third-Division football result
between Reading and Walsall.
Elizabeth continued reading her
latest library book, oblivious to
my possible peril.

  I slept fitfully that night, and
as soon as I heard the papers
pushed through the letterbox the
next morning I ran downstairs to
check the headlines.

  "DUKAKIS NOMINATED AS CANDIDATE"
stared up at me from the front page
of The Times.

  I found myself wondering,
irrelevantly, if he would ever be
President. "President Dukakis"
didn't sound quite right to me.

I picked up my wife's Daily Express
and the

                23
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

three-word headline filled the top
of the page: "LOVERS' TIFF MURDER".

  My legs gave way and I fell to my
knees. I must have made a strange
sight, crumpled up on the floor
trying to read that opening
paragraph. I couldn't make out the
words of the second paragraph with-
out my spectacles. I stumbled back
upstairs with the papers and
grabbed the glasses from the table
on my side of the bed. Elizabeth
was still sleeping soundly. Even
so, I locked myself in the bathroom
where I could read the story slowly
and without fear of interruption.

Police are now treating as murder
the death of a beautiful Pimlico
secretary, Carla Moorland, 32, who
was found dead in her flat early
yesterday morning. Detective
Inspector Simmons of Scotland Yard,
who is in charge of the case,
initially considered Carla
Moorland's death to be due to
natural causes, but an X-ray has
revealed a broken jaw which could
have been caused in a fight.

An inquest will be held on April
19th.

  Miss Moorland's daily, Maria
Lucia (4 8), said - exclusively to
the Express- that her employer had
been with a man friend when she had
left the flat at five o'clock on
the night in question. Another
witness, Mrs RitaJohnson, who lives
in - the adjoining block of flats,
stated she had seen a man leaving
Miss Moorland's flat at around six,
before entering the newsagents
opposite and later driving away.
Mrs Johnson added that she couldn't
be sure of the make of the car but
it might have been a Rover . . .

                24
                 
           THE PERFECT MURDER
,

  "Oh, my God," I exclaimed in such a
loud voice that I was afraid it might
have woken Elizabeth. I shaved and
showered quickly, trying to think as
I went along. I was dressed and ready
to leave for work even before my wife
had woken. 1 kissed her on the cheek
but she only turned over, so I
scribbled a note and left it on her
side of the bed, explaining that I
had to spend the morning in the
office as I had an important report
to complete.

  On my journey to work I rehearsed
exactly what I was going to say. I
went over it again and again. I
arrived on the twelfth floor a little
before eight and left my door wide
open so I would be aware of the
slightest intrusion. I felt confident
that I had a clear fifteen, even
twenty minutes before anyone else
could be expected to arrive.

  Once again I went over exactly what
I needed to say. I found the number
in the L-R directory and scribbled it
down on a pad in front of me before
writing five headings in block
capitals, something I always did
before a board meeting.

              BUS STOP
                COAT
               NO. 19
                 BMW
               TICKET

Then I dialled the number.

  I took off my watch and placed it
in front of me. I had read somewhere
that the location of a telephone call
can be traced in about three minutes.

A woman's voice said, "Scotland
Yard."

                 25
                  
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  "Inspector Simmons, please," was
all I volunteered.

"Can I tell him who's calling?"

"No, I would prefer not to give my
name."

  "Yes, of course, sir," she said,
evidently used to such callers.

  Another ringing tone. My mouth
went dry as a man's voice announced
"Simmons" and- I heard the
detective speak for the first time.
I was taken aback to find that a
man with so English a name could
have such a strong Glaswegian
accent.

"Can I help you?" he asked.

  "No, but I think I can help you,"
I said in a quiet tone which I
pitched considerably lower than my
natural speaking voice.

"How can you help me, sir?"

  "Are you the officer in charge of
the Carlawhatever-her-name-is
case?"

"Yes, I am. But how can you help?"
he repeated.

  The second hand showed one minute
had already passed.

"I saw a man leaving her flat that
night."

"Where were you at the time?"

"At the bus stop on the same side
of the road."

  "Can you give me a description of
the man?" Simmons's tone was every
bit as casual as my own.

  "Tall. I'd say five eleven, six
foot. Well built. Wore one of those
posh City coats - you know, the
black ones with a velvet collar."

  "How can you be so sure about the
coat?" the detective asked.

  "It was so cold standing out there
waiting for the No. 19 that I
wished it had been me who was
wearing it."

                26
                 
        THE PERFECT MURDER

  "Do you remember anything in
particular that happened after he
left the flat?"

  "Only that he went into the paper
shop opposite before getting into
his car and driving away."

  "Yes, we know that much," said the
Detective Inspector. "I don't
suppose you recall what make of car
it was?"

  Two minutes had now passed and I
began to watch the second hand more
closely.

"I think it was a BMW," I said.

"Do you remember the colour by any
chance?"

  "No, it was too dark for that." I
paused. "But I saw him tear a
parking ticket offthe windscreen,
so it shouldn't be too hard for you
to trace him."

"And at what time did all this take
place?"

  "Around six fifteen to six thirty,
Inspector," I said.

"And can you tell me . . . ?"

  Two minutes fifty-eight seconds.
I put the phone back on the hook.
My whole body broke out in a sweat.

  "Good to see you in the office on
a Saturday morning," said the
managing director grimly as he
passed my door. "Soon as you're
finished whatever you're doing I'd
like a word with you."

  I left my desk and followed him
along the corridor into his office.
For the next hour he went over my
projected figures, but however hard
I tried I couldn't concentrate. It
wasn't long before he stopped
trying to disguise his impatience.

  "Have you got something else on
your mind?" he asked as he closed
his file. "You seem preoccupied."

  "No," I insisted, "just been doing
a lot of overtime lately," and
stood up to leave.

                27
                 
A TWIST IN THE TALE
                  -
  Once I had returned to my office,
I burnt the piece of paper with the
five headings and left to go home.
In the first edition ofthe
afternoon paper, the "Lovers'
Tilts' story had been moved back to
page seven. They had nothing new to
report.

  The rest of Saturday seemed
interminable but my wife's Sunday
Express finally brought me some
relief.

  "Following up information received
in the Carla Moorland 'Lovers'
Tills murder, a man is helping the
police with their inquiries." The
commonplace expressions I had read
so often in the past suddenly took
on a real meaning.

  I scoured the other Sunday papers,
listened to every news bulletin and
watched each news item on
television. When my wife became
curious I explained that there was
a rumour in the office that the
company might be taken over again,
which meant I could lose my job.

  By Monday morning the Daily
Express had named the man in "The
Lovers' Tiff murder" as Paul
Menzies (51), an insurance broker
from Sutton. His wife was at a
hospital in Epsom under sedation
while he was being held in the
cells of Brixton Prison under
arrest. I began to wonder if Mr
Menzies had told Carla the truth
about his wife and what his
nickname might be. I poured myself
a strong black coffee and left for
the office.

  Later that morning, Menzies
appeared before the magistrates at
the Horseferry Road court, charged
with the murder of Carla Moorland.
The police had been successful in
opposing bail, the Standard
reassured me.

* * *

                28
                 
         THE PERFECT MURDER

It takes six months, I was to
discover, for a case of this gravity
to reach the Old Bailey. Paul
Menzies passed those months on
remand in Brixton Prison. 1 spent
the same period fearful of every
telephone call, every knock on the
door, every unexpected visitor. Each
one created its own nightmare. Inno-
cent people have no idea how many
such incidents occur every day. I
went about my job as best I could,
often wondering if Menzies knew of
my relationship with Carla, if he
knew my name or if he even knew of
my existence.

  It must have been a couple of
months before the trial was due to
begin that the company held its
annual general meeting. It had taken
some considerable creative
accountancy on my part to produce a
set of figures that showed us
managing any profit at all. We
certainly didn't pay our share-
holders a dividend that year.

  I came away from the meeting
relieved, almost elated. Six months
had passed since Carla's death and
not one incident had occurred during
that period to suggest that anyone
suspected I had even known her, let
alone been the cause of her death.
I still felt guilty about Carla,
even missed her, but after six
months I was now able to go for a
whole day without fear entering my
mind. Strangely, I felt no guilt
about Menzies's plight. After all,
it was he who had become the
instrument that was going to keep me
from a lifetime spent in prison. So
when the blow came it had double the
impact.

  It was on August 26th - I shall
never forget itthat I received a
letter which made me realise it
might be necessary to follow every
word of the trial.

        A TWIST IN THE TALE

However much I tried to convince
myself I should explain why I
couldn't do it, I knew I wouldn't
be able to resist it.

  That same morning, a Friday- I
suppose these things always happen
on a Friday- I was called in for
what I assumed was to be a routine
weekly meeting with the managing
director, only to be informed that
the company no longer needed me.

  "Frankly, in the last few months
your work has gone from bad to
worse," I was told.

I didn't feel able to disagree with
him.

  "And you have left me with no
choice but to replace you."

A polite way of saying, "You're
sacked."

  "Your desk will be cleared by five
this evening," the managing
director continued, "when you will
receive a cheque from the accounts
department for œ1 7,500."

I raised an eyebrow.

  "Six months' compensation, as
stipulated in your contract when we
took over the company," he
explained.

  When the managing director
stretched out his hand it was not
to wish me luck, but to ask for the
keys of my Rover.

  I remember my first thought when
he informed me of his decision: at
least I would be able to attend
every day of the trial without any
hassle.

  Elizabeth took the news of my
sacking badly but only asked what
plans I had for finding a new job.
During the next month I pretended
to look for a position in another
company but realised I couldn't
hope to settle down to anything
until the case was over.

                30
                 
        THE PERFECT MURDER

On the morning of the trial all the
popular papers had colourful
background pieces. The Daily Express
even displayed on its front page a
flattering picture of Carla in a
swimsuit on the beach at Marbella:
I wondered how much her sister in
Fulham had been paid for that
particular item. Alongside it was a
profile photo of Paul Menzies which
made him look as if he were already
a convict.

  I was amongst the first to be told
in which court at the Old Bailey the
case of the Crown v. Menzies would
be tried. A uniformed policeman gave
me detailed directions and along
with several others I made my way to
Court No. 4.

  Once I had reached the courtroom I
filed in and made sure that I sat on
the end of my row. I looked round
thinking everyone would stare at me,
but to my relief no one showed the
slightest interest.

  I had a good view of the defendant
as he stood in the dock. Menzies was
a frail man who looked as if he had
recently lost a lot of weight;
fifty-one, the newspapers had said,
but he looked nearer seventy. I
began to wonder how much I must have
aged over the past few months.

  Menzies wore a smart, dark blue
suit that hung loosely on him, a
clean shirt and what I thought must
be a regimental tie. His grey
thinning hair was swept straight
back; a small silver moustache gave
him a military air. He certainly
didn't look like a murderer or much
of a catch as a lover, but anyone
glancing towards me would probably
have come to the same conclusion. I
searched around the sea of faces for
Mrs Menzies but no one in the court
fitted the newspaper description of
her.

We all rose when MrJustice Buchanan
came in.

                31
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

"The Crown v. Menzies," the clerk
of the court read out.

  The judge leaned forward to tell
Menzies that he could be seated and
then turned slowly towards the jury
box.

  He explained that, although there
had been considerable press
interest in the case, their opinion
was all that mattered because they
alone would be asked to decide if
the prisoner were guilty or not
guilty of murder. He also advised
the jury against reading any
newspaper articles concerning the
trial or listening to anyone else's
views, especially those who had not
been present in court: such people,
he said, were always the first to
have an immutable opinion on what
the verdict should be. He went on
to remind the jury how important it
was to concentrate on the evidence
because a man's life was at stake.
I found myself nodding in
agreement.

  I glanced round the court hoping
there was nobody there who would
recognise me. Menzies's eyes
remained fixed firmly on the judge,
who was turning back to face the
prosecuting counsel.

  Even as Sir Humphrey Mountcliff
rose from his place on the bench I
was thankful he was against Menzies
and not me. A man of dominating
height with a high forehead and
silver grey hair, he commanded the
court not only with his physical
presence but with a voice that was
never less than authoritative.

  To a silent assembly he spent the
rest of the morning setting out the
case for the prosecution. His eyes
rarely left the jury box except
occasionally to peer down at his
notes.

He reconstructed the events as he
imagined

                32
                 
        THE PERFECT MURDER

they had happened that evening in
April.

  The opening address lasted two and
a half hours, shorter than I'd
expected. The judge then suggested
a break for lunch and asked us all
to be back in our places by ten past
two.

  After lunch Sir Humphrey called
his first witness, Detective
Inspector Simmons. I was unable to
look directly at the policeman while
he presented his evidence. Each
reply he gave was as if he were
addressing me personally. I wondered
if he suspected all along that there
was another man. Simmons gave a
highly professional account of
himself as he described in detail
how they had found the body and
later traced Menzies through two
witnesses and the damning parking
ticket. By the time Sir Humphrey sat
down few people in that court could
have felt that Simmons had arrested
the wrong man.

  Menzies's defence counsel, who
rose to crossexamine the Detective
Inspector, could not have been in
greater contrast to Sir Humphrey. Mr
Robert Scott, QC, was short and
stocky, with thick bushy eyebrows.
He spoke slowly and without
inflection. I was happy to observe
that one member of the jury was
having difficulty in staying awake.

  For the next twenty minutes Scott
took the Detective Inspector
painstakingly back over his evidence
but was unable to make Simmons
retract anything substantial. As the
Inspector stepped out of the witness
box I felt confident enough to look
him straight in the eye.

  The next witness was a Home Of
lice pathologist, Dr Anthony
Mallins, who, after answering a few
preliminary questions to establish
his professional

                33
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

status, moved on to answer an
inquiry from Sir Humphrey that took
everyone by surprise. The
pathologist informed the court that
there was clear evidence to suggest
that Miss Moorland had had sexual
intercourse shortly before her
death.

"How can you be so certain, Dr
Mallins?"

  "Because I found traces of blood
group B on the deceased's upper
thigh, while Miss Moorland was
later found to be blood group 0.
There were also traces of seminal
fluid on the negligee she was
wearing at the time of her death."

  "Are these common blood groups?"
Sir Humphrey asked.

  "Blood group O is common," Dr
Mallins admitted. "Group B.
however, is fairly unusual."

  "And what would you say was the
cause of her death?" Sir Humphrey
asked.

  "A blow or blows to the head,
which caused a broken jaw, and
lacerations at the base of the
skull which may have been delivered
by a blunt instrument."

  I wanted to stand up and say, "I
can tell you which!" when Sir
Humphrey said, "Thank you, Dr
Mallins. No more questions. Please
wait there."

  Mr Scott treated the doctor with
far more respect than he had
Inspector Simmons, despite Mallins
being the defendant's witness.

  "Could the blow on the back of
Miss Moorland's head have been
caused by a fall?" he asked.

  The doctor hesitated. "Possibly,"
he agreed. "But that wouldn't
explain the broken jaw."

Mr Scott ignored the comment and
pressed on.

  "What percentage of people in
Britain are blood group B?"

                34
                 
          THE PERFECT MURDER

  "About five, six per cent,"
volunteered the doctor.

  "Two and a half million people," said
Mr Scott, and waited for the figure to
sink in before he suddenly changed
tack.

  But as hard as he tried he could not
shift the pathologist on the time of
death or on the fact that sexual
intercourse must have taken place
around the hours his client had been
with Carla.

  When Mr Scott sat down the judge
asked Sir Humphrey if he wished to
re-examine.

  "I do, my Lord. Dr Mallins, you told
the court that Miss Moorland suffered
from a brokenjaw and lacerations on the
back of her head. Could the lacerations
have been caused by falling on to a
blunt object after the jaw had been
broken?"

  "I must object, my Lord," said Mr
Scott, rising with unusual speed. "This
is a leading question."

  MrJustice Buchanan leaned forward and
peered down at the doctor. "I agree, Mr
Scott, but I would like to know if Dr
Mallins found blood group 0, Miss
Moorland's blood group, on any other
object in the room?"

  "Yes, my Lord'" replied the doctor.
"On the edge of the glass table in the
centre of the room."

  "Thank you, Dr Mallins," said Sir
Humphrey. "No more questions."

 '   Sir Humphrey's next witness was
Mrs Rita

Johnson, the lady who claimed she had
seen everything.

  "Mrs Johnson, on the evening of April
7th, did you see a man leave the block
of flats where Miss Moorland lived?"
Sir Humphrey asked.

"Yes, I did."

                  35
                   
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

"At about what time was that?"

"A few minutes after six."

"Please tell the court what
happened next."

  "He walked across the road,
removed a parking ticket, got into
his car and drove away."

"Do you see that man in the court
today?"

  "Yes," she said firmly, pointing
to Menzies, who at this suggestion
shook his head vigorously.

"No more questions."

Mr Scott rose slowly again.

  "What did you say was the make of
the car the man got into?"

  "I can't be sure," MrsJohnson
said, "but I think it was a BMW."

  "Not a Rover as you first told the
police the following morning?"

The witness did not reply.

  "And did you actually see the man
in question remove a parking ticket
from the car windscreen?" Mr Scott
asked.

"I think so, sir, but it all
happened so quickly."

  "I'm sure it did," said Mr Scott.
"In fact, I suggest to you that it
happened so quickly that you've got
the wrong man and the wrong car."

  "No, sir," she replied, but
without the same conviction with
which she had delivered her earlier
replies.

  Sir Humphrey did not re-examine
MrsJohnson. I realised that he
wanted her evidence to be forgotten
by the jury as quickly as possible.
As it was, when she left the
witness box she also left everyone
in court in considerable doubt.

  Carla's daily, Maria Lucia, was
far more convincing. She stated
unequivocally that she had seen

                36
                 
        THE PERFECT MURDER

Menzies in the living room ofthe
flat that afternoon when she
arrived a little before five.
However, she had, she admitted,
never seen him before that day.

  "But isn't it true," asked Sir
Humphrey, "that you usually only
work in the mornings?"

  "Yes," she replied. "Although Miss
Moorland was in the habit of
bringing work home on a Thursday
afternoon so it was convenient for
me to come in and collect my
wages."

  "And how was Miss Moorland dressed
that afternoon?" asked Sir
Humphrey.

"In her blue morning coat," replied
the daily.

  "Is this how she usually dressed
on a Thursday afternoon?"

  "No, sir, but I assumed she was
going to have a bath before going
out that evening."

  "But when you left the flat was
she still with Mr Menzies?"

"Yes, sir."

  "Do you remember anything else she
was wearing that day?"

  "Yes, sir. Underneath the morning
coat she wore a red negligee."

  My negligee was duly produced and
Maria Lucia identified it. At this
point I stared directly at the
witness but she showed not a
flicker of recognition. I thanked
all the gods in the Pantheon that I
had never once been to visit Carla
in the morning.

  "Please wait there," were Sir
Humphrey's final words to Miss
Lucia.

Mr Scott rose to cross-examine.

  "Miss Lucia, you have told the
court that the purpose of the visit
was to collect your wages. How long
were you at the flat on this
occasion?"

                37
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  "I did a little clearing up in the
kitchen and ironed a blouse,
perhaps twenty minutes."

"Did you see Miss Moorland during
this time?"

  "Yes, I went into the drawing room
to ask if she would like some more
coffee but she said no."

"Was Mr Menzies with her at the
time?"

"Yes, he was."

  "Were you at any time aware of a
quarrel between the two of them or
even raised voices?"

"No, sir."

  "When you saw them together did
Miss Moorland show any signs of
distress or need of help?"

"No, sir."

"Then what happened?"

  "Miss Moorland joined me in the
kitchen a few minutes later, gave
me my wages and I let myself out."

  "When you were alone in the
kitchen with Miss Moorland, did she
give any sign of being afraid of
her guest?"

"No, sir."

"No more questions, my Lord."

  Sir Humphrey did not re-examine
Maria Lucia and informed the judge
that he had completed the case for
the prosecution. Mr Justice
Buchanan nodded and said he felt
that was enough for the day; but I
wasn't convinced it was enough to
convict Menzies.

  When I got home that night
Elizabeth did not ask me where I
had been, and I did not volunteer
any information. I spent the
evening pretending to go over job
applications.

                38
                 
        THE PERFECT MURDER

The following morning I had a late
breakfast and read the papers before
returning to my place at the end of
a row in Court No. 4, only a few
moments before the judge made his
entrance.

  MrJustice Buchanan, having sat
down, adjusted his wig before
calling on Mr Scott to open the case
for the defence. Mr Scott, QC, was
once again slow to rise - a man-paid
by the hour, I thought uncharitably.
He started by promising the court
that his opening address would be
brief, and he then remained on his
feet for the next two and a half
hours.

  He began the case for the defence
by going over in detail the relevant
parts, as he saw them, of Menzies's
past. He assured us all that those
who wished to dissect it later would
only find an unblemished record.
Paul Menzies was a happily married
man who lived in Sutton with his
wife and three children, Polly, aged
twenty-one, Michael, nineteen, and
Sally, sixteen. Two of the children
were now at university and the
youngest had just completed her
GCSE. Doctors had advised Mrs
Menzies not to attend the trial,
following her recent release from
hospital. I noticed two of the women
on the jury smile sympathetically.

  Mr Menzies, Mr Scott continued,
had been with the same firm of
insurance brokers in the City of
London for the past six years and,
although he had not been promoted,
he was a much respected member of
the staff. He was a pillar of his
local community, having served with
the Territorial Army and on the
committee of the local camera club.
He had once even stood for the
Sutton council. He could hardly be
described as a serious candidate as
a murderer.

                39
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  Mr Scott then went on to the
actual day of the killing and
confirmed that Mr Menzies had an
appointment with Miss Moorland on
the afternoon in question, but in a
strictly professional capacity with
the sole purpose of helping her with
a personal insurance plan. There
could have been no other reason to
visit Miss Moorland during office
hours. He did not have sexual
intercourse with her and he
certainly did not murder her.

  The defendant had left his client
a few minutes after six. He
understood she had intended to
change before going out to dinner
with her sister in Fulham. He had
arranged to see her the following
Wednesday at his of lice for the
purpose of drawing up the completed
policy. The defence, Mr Scott went
on, would later produce a diary
entry that would establish the truth
of this statement.

  The charge against the accused
was, he submitted, based almost
completely on circumstantial
evidence. He felt confident that,
when the trial reached its
conclusion, the jury would be left
with no choice but to release his
client back into the bosom of his
loving family. "You must end this
nightmare," Mr Scott concluded. "It
has gone on far too long for an
innocent man."

  At this point the judge suggested
a break for lunch. During the meal
I was unable to concentrate or even
take in what was being said around
me. The majority of those who had an
opinion to give now seemed convinced
that Menzies was innocent.

  As soon as we returned, at ten
past two, Mr Scott called his first
witness: the defendant himself.

  Paul Menzies left the dock and
walked slowly over to the witness
box. He took a copy of the New

                40
                 
        THE PERFECT MURDER

Testament in his right hand and
haltingly read the words of the
oath, from a card which he held in
his left.

  Every eye was fixed on him while
MrScott began to guide his client
carefully through the minefield of
evidence.

  Menzies became progressively more
confident in his delivery as the
day wore on, and when at four
thirty the judge told the court,
"That's enough for today," I was
convinced that he would get off,
even if only by a majority verdict.

  I spent a fitful night before
returning to my place on the third
day fearing the worst. Would
Menzies be released and would they
then start looking for me?

  Mr Scott opened the third morning
as gently as he had begun the
second, but he repeated so many
questions from the previous day
that it became obvious he was only
steadying his client in preparation
for prosecuting counsel. Before he
finally sat down he asked Menzies
for a third time, "Did you ever
have sexual intercourse with Miss
Moorland?"

  "No, sir. I had only met her for
the first time that day," Menzies
replied firmly.

"And did you murder Miss Moorland?"

  "Certainly not, sir," said
Menzies, his voice now strong and
confident.

  Mr Scott resumed his place, a look
of quiet satisfaction on his face.

  In fairness to Menzies, very
little which takes place in normal
life could have prepared anyone for
cross-examination by Sir Humphrey
Mountcliff. I could not have asked
for a better advocate.

                41
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  "I'd like to start, if I may, Mr
Menzies," he began, "with what your
counsel seems to set great store by
as proof of your innocence."

  Menzies's thin lips remained in a
firm straight line.

  "The pertinent entry in your diary
which suggests that you made a
second appointment to see Miss
Moorland, the murdered woman" -
three words Sir Humphrey was to
repeat again and again during his
cross-examination - "for the
Wednesday after she had been
killed."

"Yes, sir," said Menzies.

  "This entry was made - correct me
if I'm wrong - following your
Thursday meeting at Miss Moorland's
flat."

  "Yes, sir," said Menzies,
obviously tutored not to add
anything that might later help
prosecuting counsel.

  "So when did you make that entry?"
Sir Humphrey asked.

"On the Friday morning."

"After Miss Moorland had been
killed?"

"Yes, but I didn't know."

"Do you carry a diary on you, Mr
Menzies?"

  "Yes, but only a small pocket
diary, not my large desk one."

"Do you have it with you today?"

"I do."

"May I be allowed to see it?"

  Reluctantly Menzies took a small
green diary out of his jacket
pocket and handed it over to the
clerk of the court, who in turn
passed it on to Sir Humphrey. Sir
Humphrey began to leaf through the
pages.

                42
                 
        THE PERFECT MURDER

  "I see that there is no entry for
your appointment with Miss Moorland
for the afternoon on which she was
murdered?"

  "No, sir," said Menzies. "I put
office appointments only in my desk
diary, personal appointments are
restricted to my pocket diary."

  "I understand," said Sir Humphrey.
He paused and looked up. "But isn't
it strange, Mr Menzies, that you
agreed to an appointment with a
client to discuss further business
and you then trusted it to memory,
when you so easily could have put
it in the diary you carry around
with you all the time before
transferring it?"

  "I might have written it down on
a slip of paper at the time, but as
I explained that's a personal
diary."

  "Is it?" said Sir Humphrey as he
flicked back a few more pages. "Who
is David Paterson?" he asked.

Menzies looked as if he were trying
to place him.

  "Mr David Paterson, 112 City Road,
11.30, January 9th this year," Sir
Humphrey read out to the court.
Menzies looked anxious. "We could
subpoena Mr Paterson if you can't
recall the meeting," said Sir
Humphrey helpfully.

  "He's a client of my firm," said
Menzies in a quiet voice.

  "A client of your firm," Sir
Humphrey repeated slowly. "I wonder
how many of those I could find if I
went through your diary at a more
leisurely pace?" Menzies bowed his
head as Sir Humphrey passed the
diary back to the clerk, having
made his point.

  "Now I should like to turn to some
more important questions . . ."

"Not until after lunch, Sir
Humphrey," the

                43
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

judge intervened. "It's nearly one
and I think we'll take a break
now."

  "As you wish, my Lord," came back
the courteous reply.

  I left the court in a more
optimistic mood, even though I
couldn't wait to discover what
could be more important than that
diary. Sir Humphrey's emphasis on
little lies, although they did not
prove Menzies was a murderer, did
show he was hiding something. I
became anxious that during the
break Mr Scott might advise Menzies
to admit to his affair with Carla,
and thus make the rest of his story
appear more credible. To my relief,
over the meal I learned that under
English law Menzies could not
consult his counsel while he was
still in the witness box. I noticed
when we returned to court that Mr
Scott's smile had disappeared.

  Sir Humphrey rose to continue his
crossexamination.

  "You have stated under oath, Mr
Menzies, that you are a happily
married man."

"I am, sir," said the defendant
with feeling.

  "Was your first marriage as happy,
Mr Menzies?" asked Sir Humphrey
casually. The defendant's cheeks
drained of their colour. I quickly
looked over towards Mr Scott who
could not mask that this was
information with which he had not
been entrusted.

  "Take your time before you
answer," said Sir Humphrey.

All eyes turned to the man in the
witness box.

  "No," said Menzies and quickly
added, "but I was very young at the
time. It was many years ago and all
a ghastly mistake."

                44
                 
THE PERFECT MURDER

_ .

  "All a ghastly mistake?" repeated
Sir Humphrey, looking straight at
the jury. "And how did that marriage
end?"

"In divorce," Menzies said quite
simply.

"And what were the grounds for that
divorce?"

"Cruelty," said Menzies, "but. . ."

  "But . . . would you like me to
read out to the jury what your first
wife swore under oath in court that
day?"

  Menzies stood there shaking. He
knew that "No" would damn him and
"Yes" would hang him.

  "Well, as you seem unable to advise
us I will, with your permission, my
Lord, read the statement made before
MrJustice Rodger on dune 9th, 1961,
at the Swindon County Court by the
first Mrs Menzies." Sir Humphrey
cleared his throat. "'He used to hit
me again and again, and it became so
bad that I had to run away for fear
he might one day kill me."' Sir
Humphrey emphasised the last five
words.

  "She was exaggerating," shouted
Menzies from the witness box.

  "How unfortunate that poor Miss
Carla Moorland cannot be with us
today to let us know if your story
about her is also an exaggeration."

  "I object, my Lord," said Mr Scott.
"Sir Humphrey is harassing the
witness."

  "I agree," said the judge. "Tread
more carefully in future, Sir
Humphrey."

  "I apologise, my Lord," said Sir
Humphrey, sounding singularly
unapologetic. He dosed the file to
which he had been referring and
replaced it on the desk in front of
him before taking up a new

                 45
                  
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

one. He opened it slowly, making
sure all in the court were
following every movement before he
extracted a single sheet of paper.

  "How many mistresses have you had
since you were married to the
second Mrs Menzies?"

  "Objection, my Lord. How can this
be relevant?"

  "My Lord, it is relevant, I
respectfully suggest. I intend to
show that this was not a business
relationship that Mr Menzies was
conducting with Miss Moorland but a
highly personal one."

  "The question can be put to the
defendant," ruled the judge.

  Menzies said nothing as Sir
Humphrey held up the sheet of paper
in front of him and studied t.

  "Take your time because I want the
exact number," Sir Humphrey said,
looking over the top of his
glasses.

The seconds ticked on as we all
waited.

  "Hm - three, I think," Menzies
said eventually in a voice that
just carried. The gentlemen of the
press began scribbling furiously.

  "Three," said Sir Humphrey,
staring at his piece of paper in
disbelief.

"Well, perhaps four."

  "And was the fourth Miss Carla
Moorland?" Sir Humphrey asked.
"Because you had sexual intercourse
with her that evening, didn't you?"

  "No, I did not," said Menzies, but
by this time few in that courtroom
could have believed him.

  "Very well then," continued Sir
Humphrey, as he placed the piece of
paper on the bench in front of him.
"But before I return to your
relationship with

                ~6
                 
         THE PERFECT MURDER

Miss Moorland, let us discover the
truth about the other four."

  I stared at the piece of paper
from which Sir Humphrey had been
reading. From where I was seated I
could see that there was nothing
written on it at all. A blank white
sheet lay before him.

  I was finding it hard to keep a
grin off my face. Menzies's
adulterous background was an unex-
pected bonus for me and the press -
and I couldn't help wondering how
Carla would have reacted if she had
known about it.

  Sir Humphrey spent the rest of the
day making Menzies relate the
details of his previous rela-
tionships with the four mistresses.
The court was agog and the
journalists continued to scribble
away, knowing they were about to
have a field day. When the court
rose Mr Scott's eyes were closed.

  I drove home that night feeling
not a little pleased with myself;
like a man who had just completed a
good day's work.

  On entering the courtroom the
following morning I noticed people
were beginning to acknowledge other
regulars and nod. I found myself
falling into the same pattern and
greeted people silently as I took my
regular position on the end of the
bench.

  Sir Humphrey spent the morning
going over some of Menzies's other
misdemeanours. We discovered that he
had served in the Territorial Army
for only five months and left after
a misunderstanding with his
commanding officer over how many
hours he should have been spending
on exercises during weekends and how
much he had claimed in expenses for
those hours. We also learned that
his attempts to get on the local
council sprung more

                 47
                  
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

from anger at being refused
planning permission to build on a
piece of land adjoining his house
than from an altruistic desire to
serve his fellow men. To be fair,
Sir Humphrey could have made the
Archangel Gabriel look like a
soccer hooligan; but his trump card
was still to come.

  "Mr Menzies, I should now like to
return to your version of what
happened on the night Miss Moorland
was killed."

"Yes," sighed Menzies in a tired
voice.

  "When you visit a client to
discuss one of your policies, how
long would you say such a consulta-
tion usually lasts?"

  "Usually halfan hour, an hour at
the most," said Menzies.

  "And how long did the consultation
with Miss Moorland take?"

"A good hour," said Menzies.

  "And you left her, if I remember
your evidence correctly, a little
after six o'clock."

"That is correct."

"And what time was your
appointment?"

  "At five o'clock, as was shown
clearly in my desk diary," said
Menzies.

  "Well, Mr Menzies, if you arrived
at about five to keep your
appointment with Miss Moorland and
left a little after six, how did
you manage to get a parking fine?"

  "I didn't have any small change
for the meter at the time," said
Menzies confidently. "As I was
already a couple of minutes late, I
just risked it."

  "You just risked it," repeated Sir
Humphrey slowly. "You are obviously
a man who takes risks, Mr Menzies.
I wonder if you would be good
enough

                48
                 
        THE PERFECT MURDER

to look at the parking ticket in
question."

The clerk handed it up to Menzies.

  "Would you read out to the court
the hour and minute that the
traffic warden has written in the
little boxes to show when the
offence occurred."

Once again Menzies took a long time
to reply.

"Four sixteen to four thirty," he
said eventually.

"I didn't hear that," said the
judge.

  "Would you be kind enough to
repeat what you said for the
judge?" Sir Humphrey asked.

Menzies repeated the damning
figures.

  "So now we have established that
you were in fact with Miss Moorland
some time before four sixteen,and
not, as I suggestyou
laterwroteinyourdiary, five
o'clock. That was just another lie,
wasn't it?"

  "No," said Menzies. "I must have
arrived a little earlier than I
realised."

  "At least an hour earlier, it
seems. And I also suggest to you
that you arrived at that early hour
because your interest in Carla
Moorland was not simply
professional?"

"That's not true."

  "Then it wasn't your intention
that she should become your
mistress?"

  Menzies hesitated long enough for
Sir Humphrey to answer his own
question. "Because the business
part of your meeting finished in
the usual half hour, did it not, Mr
Menzies?" He waited for a response
but still none was forthcoming.

"What is your blood group, Mr
Menzies?"

"I have no idea."

  Sir Humphrey without warning
changed tack: "Have you heard of
DNA, by any chance?"

"No," came back the puzzled reply.

                49
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  "Deoxyribonucleic acid is a proven
technique that shows genetic
information can be unique to every
individual. Blood or semen samples
can be matched. Semen, Mr Menzies,
is as unique as any fingerprint.
With such a sample we would know
immediately if you raped Miss
Moorland."

"I didn't rape her," Menzies said
indignantly.

  "Nevertheless sexual intercourse
did take place, didn't it?" said
Sir Humphrey quietly.

Menzies remained silent.

  "Shall I recall the Home Office
pathologist and ask him to carry
out a DNA test?"

Menzies still made no reply.

  "And check your blood group?" Sir
Humphrey paused. "I will ask you
once again, Mr Menzies. Did sexual
intercourse between you and the
murdered woman take place that
Thursday afternoon?"

"Yes, sir," said Menzies in a
whisper.

  "Yes, sir," repeated Sir Humphrey
so that the whole court could hear
it.

  "But it wasn't rape," Menzies
shouted back at Sir Humphrey.

"Wasn't it?" said Sir Humphrey.

"And I swear I didn't kill her."

  I must have been the only person
in that courtroom who knew he was
telling the truth. All Sir Humphrey
said was; "No more questions, my
Lord."

  Mr Scott tried manfully to
resurrect his client's credibility
during re-examination but the fact
that Menzies had been caught lying
about his relationship with Carla
made everything he had said
previously appear doubtful.

If only Menzies had told the truth
about being

                50
                 
        THE PERFECT MURDER

Carla's lover, his story might well
have been accepted. I wondered why
he had gone through the charade- in
order to protect his wife? Whatever
the motive, it had only ended by
making him appear guilty of a crime
he hadn't committed.

  I went home that night and ate the
largest meal I had had for several
days.

  The following morning Mr Scott
called two more witnesses. The
first turned out to be the vicar of
St Peter's, Sutton, who was there
as a character witness to prove
what a pillar of the community
Menzies was. After Sir Humphrey had
finished his cross-examination the
vicar ended up looking like a
rather kind, unworldly old man,
whose knowledge of Menzies was
based on the latter's occasional
attendance at Sunday matins.

  The second was Menzies's superior
at the company they both worked for
in the City. He was a far more
impressive figure but he was unable
to confirm that Miss Moorland had
ever been a client of the company.

  Mr Scott put up no more witnesses
and informed Mr Justice Buchanan
that he had completed the case for
the defence. The judge nodded and,
turning to Sir Humphrey, told him
he would not be required to begin
his final address until the
following morning.

That heralded the signal for the
court to rise.

  Another long evening and an even
longer night had to be endured by
Menzies and myself. As on every
other day during the trial, I made
sure I was in my place the next
morning before the judge entered.

Sir Humphrey's closing speech was
masterful.

                51
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

Every little untruth was logged so
that one began to accept that very
little of Menzies's testimony could
be relied on.

  "We will never know for certain,"
said Sir Humphrey, "for what reason
poor young Carla Moorland was
murdered. Refusal to succumb to
Menzies's advances? A fit of temper
which ended with a blow that caused
her to fall and later die alone?
But there are, however, some
things, members of the jury, of
which we can be quite certain.

  "We can be certain that Menzies
was with the murdered woman that
day before the hour of four sixteen
because of the evidence of the
damning parking ticket.

  "We can be certain that he left a
little after six because we have a
witness who saw him drive away, and
he does not himself deny this
evidence.

  "And we can be certain that he
wrote a false entry in his diary to
make you believe he had a business
appointment with the murdered woman
at five, rather than a personal
assignation some time before.

  "And we can now be certain that he
lied about having sexual
intercourse with Miss Moorland a
short time before she was killed,
though we cannot be certain if
intercourse took place before or
after her jaw had been broken." Sir
Humphrey's eyes rested on the jury
before he continued.

  "We can, finally, establish,
beyond reasonable doubt, from the
pathologist's report, the time of
death and that, therefore, Menzies
was the last person who could
possibly have seen Carla Moorland
alive.

"Therefore no one else could have
killed Carla

                52
                 
        THE PERFECT MURDER

Moorland - for do not forget
Inspector Simmons's evidence - and
if you accept that, you can be in
no doubt that only Menzies could
have been responsible for her
death. And how damning you must
have found it that he tried to hide
the existence of a first wife who
had left him on the grounds of his
cruelty, and the four mistresses
who left him we know not why or
how. Only one less than Bluebeard,"
Sir Humphrey added with feeling.

  "For the sake of every young girl
who lives on her own in our
capital, you must carry out your
duty, however painful that duty
might be. And find Menzies guilty
of murder."

  When Sir Humphrey sat down I
wanted to applaud.

  The judge sent us away for another
break. Voices all around me were
now damning Menzies. I listened
contentedly without offering an
opinion. I knew that if the jury
convicted Menzies the file would be
closed and no eyes would ever be
turned in my direction. I was
seated in my place before thejudge
appeared at ten past two. He called
on Mr Scott.

  Menzies's counsel put up a
spirited defence of his client,
pointing out that almost all the
evidence that Sir Humphrey had come
up with had been circumstantial,
and that it was even possible
someone else could have visited
Carla Moorland after his client had
left that night. Mr Scott's bushy
eyebrows seemed almost to have a
life of their own as he
energetically emphasised that it
was the prosecution's
responsibility to prove their case
beyond reasonable doubt and not his
to disprove it, and that, in his
opinion, his learned friend, Sir
Humphrey, had failed to do so.

                53
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  During his summing-up Scott
avoided any mention of diary
entries, parking tickets, past
mistresses, sexual intercourse or
questions of his client's role in
the community. A latecomer listen-
ing only to the closing speeches
might have been forgiven for
thinking the two learned gentlemen
were summarising different cases.

  Mr Scott's expression became grim
as he turned to face the jury for
his summation. "The twelve of you,"
he said, "hold the fate of my
client in your hands. You must,
therefore, be certain, I repeat,
certain beyond reasonable doubt
that Paul Menzies could have
committed such an evil crime as
murder.

  "This is not a trial about Mr
Menzies's lifestyle, his position
in the community or even his sexual
habits. If adultery were a crime I
feel confident Mr Menzies would not
be the only person in this
courtroom to be in the dock today."
He paused as his eyes swept up and
down the jury.

  "For this reason I feel confident
that you will find it in your
hearts to release my client from
the torment he has been put through
during the last seven months. He
has surely been shown to be an
innocent man deserving of your
compassion."

  Mr Scott sank down on the bench
having, I felt, given his client a
glimmer of hope.

  The judge told us that he would
not begin his own summing-up until
Monday morning.

  The weekend seemed interminable to
me. By Monday I had convinced
myself that enough members of the
jury would feel there just had not
been sufficient evidence to
convict.

As soon as the trial was under way
the judge

                54
                 
THE PERFECT MURDER
                        -
began by explaining once again that
it was the jury alone who must make
the ultimate decision. It was not
his job to let them know how he
felt, but only to advise them on the
law.

  He went back over all the
evidence, trying to put it in
perspective, but he never gave as
much as a hint as to his own
opinions. When he had completed his
summing-up late that afternoon he
sent the jury away to consider their
verdict.

  I waited with nearly as much
anxiety as Menzies must have done
while I listened to others giving
their opinion as the minutes ticked
by in that little room. Then, four
hours later, a note was sent up to
thejudge.

  He immediately asked the jury to
return to their places while the
press flooded back into the court-
room, making it look like the House
of Commons on Budget Day. The clerk
dutifully handed up the note to Mr
Justice Buchanan. He opened it and
read what only twelve other people
in the courtroom could have known.

  He handed it back to the clerk who
then read the note to a silent
court.

  Mr Justice Buchanan frowned before
asking if there were any chance of a
unanimous verdict being reached if
he allowed more time. Once he had
learned that it was proving
impossible he reluctantly nodded his
agreement to a majority verdict.

  The jury disappeared downstairs
again to continue their
deliberations, and did not return to
their places for another three
hours. I could sense the tension in
the court as neighbours sought to
give opinions to each other in noisy
whispers. The clerk called for
silence as thejudge waited for
everyone to settle before he
instructed the clerk to proceed.

                 55
                  
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  When the clerk rose, I could
hear the person next to me
breathing.

"Would the Foreman please stand?"

I rose from my place.

  "Have you reached a verdict on
which at least ten of you are
agreed?"

"We have, sir."

  "Do you find the defendant, Paul
Menzies, guilty or not guilty?"

"Guilty," I replied.

CLEAN SWEEP ICNATIUS

_ .

          I

                 EW
showed much interest
when Ignatius Agarbi
was appointed Niger-
ia's Minister of
Finance. After all,
the cynics pointed
out, he was the
seventeenth person to
hold the office in
seventeen years.

  In Ignatius's first
major policy
statement to
Parliament he
promised to end graft
and corruption in
public life and
warned the electorate
that no one holding
an official position
could feel safe
unless he led a
blameless life. He
ended his maiden
speech with the
words, "I intend to
clear out Nigeria's
Augean stables."

  Such was the impact
of the minister's
speech that it failed
to get a mention in
the Lagos Daily
Times. Perhaps the
editor considered
that, since the paper
had covered the
speeches of the
previous sixteen
ministers in extenso,
his readers might
feel they had heard
it all before.

  Ignatius, however,
was not to be
disheartened by the
lack of confidence
shown in him, and set
about his new task
with vigour and
determination. Within
days of his
appointment he had
caused a minor of
ficial at the
Ministry of Trade to
be jailed

         59
          
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

for falsifying documents relating
to the import of grain. The next to
feel the bristles of Ignatius's new
broom was a leading Lebanese
financier, who was deported without
trial for breach of the exchange
control regulations. A month later
came an event which even Ignatius
considered a personal coup: the
arrest of the Inspector General of
Police for accepting bribes - a
perk the citizens of Lagos had in
the past considered went with
thejob. When four months later the
Police Chief was sentenced to
eighteen months in jail, the new
Finance Minister finally made the
front page of the Lagos Daily
Times. A leader on the centre page
dubbed him "Clean Sweep Ignatius",
the new broom every guilty man
feared. Ignatius's reputation as Mr
Clean continued to grow as arrest
followed arrest and unfounded
rumours began circulating in the
capital that even General Otobi,
the Head of State, was under
investigation by his own Finance
Minister.

  Ignatius alone now checked, vetted
and authorised all foreign
contracts worth over one hundred
million dollars. And although every
decision he made was meticulously
scrutinized by his enemies, not a
breath of scandal ever became
associated with his name.

  When Ignatius began his second
year of office as Minister of
Finance even the cynics began to
acknowledge his achievements. It
was about this time that General
Otobi felt confident enough to call
Ignatius in for an unscheduled
consultation.

  The Head of State welcomed the
Minister to Dodan Barracks and
ushered him to a comfortable chair
in his study overlooking the parade
ground.

                60
                 
       CLEAN SWEEP IGNATIUS

  "Ignatius, I have just finished
going over the latest budget report
and I am alarmed by your conclusion
that the Exchequer is still losing
millions of dollars each year in
bribes paid to gobetweens by foreign
companies. Have you any idea into
whose pockets this money is falling?
That's what I want to know."

  Ignatius sat bolt upright, his
eyes never leaving the Head of
State.

  "I suspect a great percentage of
the money is ending up in private
Swiss bank accounts but I am at
present unable to prove it."

  "Then I will give you whatever
added authority you require to do
so," said General Otobi. "You can
use any means you consider necessary
to ferret out these villains. Start
by investigating every member of my
Cabinet, past and present. And show
no fear or favour in your
endeavours, no matter what their
rank or connections."

  "For such a task to have any
chance of success I would need a
special letter of authority signed
by you, General . . ."

  "Then it will be on your desk by
six o'clock this evening," said the
Head of State.

  "And the rank of Ambassador
Plenipotentiary whenever I travel
abroad."

"Granted."

  "Thank you," said Ignatius, rising
from his chair on the assumption
that the audience was over.

  "You may also need this," said the
General as they walked towards the
door. The Head of State handed
Ignatius a small automatic pistol.
"Because I suspect by now that you
have almost as many enemies as I."

                61
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  Ignatius took the pistol from the
soldier awkwardly, put it in his
pocket and mumbled his thanks.

  Without another word passing
between the two men Ignatius left
his leader and was driven back to
his Ministry.

  Without the knowledge of the
Governor of the Central Bank of
Nigeria and unhindered by any
senior civil servants, Ignatius
enthusiastically set about his new
task. He researched alone at night,
and by day discussed his findings
with no one. Three months later he
was ready to pounce.

  The Minister selected the month of
August to make an unscheduled visit
abroad as it was the time when most
Nigerians went on holiday and his
absence would therefore not be
worthy of comment.

  He asked his Permanent Secretary
to book him, his wife and their two
children on a flight to Orlando,
and to be certain that it was
charged to his personal account.

  On their arrival in Florida the
family checked into the local
Marriott Hotel. He then informed
his wife, without warning or
explanation, that he would be
spending a few days in New York on
business before rejoining them for
the rest of the holiday. The
following morning Ignatius left his
family to the mysteries of Disney
World while he took a flight to New
York. It was a short taxi ride from
La Guardia to Kennedy, where, after
a change of clothes and the
purchase of a return tourist ticket
for cash, Ignatius boarded a
Swissair flight for Geneva
unobserved.

  Once in the Swiss capital Ignatius
booked into an inconspicuous hotel,
retired to bed and slept

                62
                 
       CLEAN SWEEP IGNATIUS

soundly for eight hours. Over
breakfast the following morning he
studied the list of banks he had so
carefully drawn up after completing
his research in Nigeria: each name
was written out boldly in his own
hand. Ignatius decided to start
with Gerber et Cie whose building,
he observed from the hotel bedroom,
took up half the Avenue de
Parchine. He checked the telephone
number with the concierge before
placing a call. The chairman agreed
to see him at twelve o'clock.

  Carrying only a battered
briefcase, Ignatius arrived at the
bank a few minutes before the
appointed hour- an unusual
occurrence for a Nigerian, thought
the young man dressed in a smart
grey suit, white shirt and grey
silk tie, who was waiting in the
marble hall to greet him. He bowed
to the Minister, introducing
himself as the chairman's personal
assistant, and explained that he
would accompany Ignatius to the
chairman's office. The young
executive led the Minister to a
waiting lift and neither man
uttered another word until they had
reached the eleventh floor. A
gentle tap on the chairman's door
elicited "Entree," which the young
man obeyed.

"The Nigerian Minister of Finance,
sir."

  The chairman rose from behind his
desk and stepped forward to greet
his guest. Ignatius could not help
noticing that he too wore a grey
suit, white shirt and grey silk
tie.

  "Good morning, Minister," the
chairman said. "Won't you have a
seat?" He ushered Ignatius towards
a low glass table surrounded by
comfortable chairs on the far side
of the room. "I have ordered coffee
for both of us if that is
acceptable."

               63 '
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  Ignatius nodded, placed the
battered briefcase on the floor by
the side of his chair and stared out
of the large plate-glass window. He
made some smalltalk about the
splendid view of the magnificent
fountain while a girl served all
three men with coffee.

  Once the young woman had left the
room Ignatius got down to business.

  "My Head of State has requested
that I visit your bank with a rather
unusual request," he began. Not a
flicker of surprise appeared on the
face of the chairman or his young
assistant. "He has honoured me with
the task of discovering which
Nigerian citizens hold numbered
accounts with your bank."

  On learning this piece of
information only the chairman's lips
moved. "I am not at liberty to
disclose -"

  "Allow me to put my case," said
the Minister, raising a white palm.
"First, let me assure you that I
come with the absolute authority of
my government." Without another
word, Ignatius extracted an envelope
from his inside pocket with a
flourish. He handed it to the
chairman who removed the letter
inside and read it slowly.

  Once he had finished reading, the
banker cleared his throat. "This
document, I fear, sir, carries no
validity in my country." He replaced
it in the envelope and handed it
back to Ignatius. "I am, of course,"
continued the chairman, "not for one
moment doubting that you have the
full backing of your Head of State,
both as a Minister and an
Ambassador, but that does not change
the bank's rule of confidentiality
in such matters. There are no
circumstances in which we would
release the

                64
                 
       CLEAN SWEEP IGNATIUS

names of any of our account holders
without their authority. I'm sorry
to be of so little help, but those
are, and will always remain, the
bank rules." The chairman rose to
his feet, as he considered the
meeting was now at an end; but he
had not bargained for Clean Sweep
Ignatius.

  "My Head of State," said Ignatius,
softening his tone perceptibly,
"has authorized me to approach your
bank to act as the intermediary for
all future transactions between my
country and Switzerland."

  "We are flattered by your
confidence in us, Minister,"
replied the chairman, who remained
standing. "However, I feel sure
that you will understand that it
cannot alter our attitude to our
customers' confidentiality."

Ignatius remained unperturbed.

  "Then I am sorry to inform you, Mr
Gerber, that our Ambassador in
Geneva will be instructed to make
an official communique to the Swiss
Foreign Of lice about the lack of
co-operation your bank has shown
concerning requests for information
about our nationals." He waited for
his words to sink in. "You could
avoid such embarrassment, of
course, by simply letting me know
the names of my countrymen who hold
accounts with Gerber et Cie and the
amounts involved. I can assure you
we would not reveal the source of
our information."

  "You are most welcome to lodge
such a communique, sir, and I feel
sure that our Minister will explain
to your Ambassador in the most
courteous of diplomatic language
that the Foreign Ministry does not
have the authority under Swiss law
to demand such disclosures."

"If that is the case, I shall
instruct my own

                ~5
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

Ministry of Trade to halt all
future dealings in Nigeria with any
Swiss nationals until these names
are revealed."

  "That is your privilege,
Minister," replied the chairman,
unmoved.

  "And we may also have to
reconsider every contract currently
being negotiated by your countrymen
in Nigeria. And in addition I shall
personally see to it that no
penalty clauses are honoured."

  "Would you not consider such
action a little precipitate?"

  "Let me assure you, Mr Gerber,
that I would not lose one moment of
sleep over such a decision," said
Ignatius. "Even if my efforts to
discover those names were to bring
your country to its knees I would
not be moved."

  "So be it, Minister," replied the
chairman. "However, it still does
not alter the policy or the
attitude of this bank to
confidentiality."

  "If that remains the case, sir,
this very day I shall give
instructions to our Ambassador to
close our Embassy in Geneva and I
shall declare your Ambassador in
Lagos persona non "rata."

  For the first time the chairman
raised his eyebrows.

  "Furthermore," continued Ignatius,
"I will hold a conference in London
which will leave the world's press
in no doubt of my Head of State's
displeasure with the conduct of
this bank. After such publicity I
feel confident you will find that
many of your customers would prefer
to close their accounts, while
others who have in the past
considered you a safe haven may
find it necessary to look
elsewhere."

 66            .

       CLEAN SWEEP IGNATIUS

  The Minister waited but still the
chairman did not respond.

  "Then you leave me no choice,"
said Ignatius, rising from his
seat.

  The chairman stretched out his
arm, assuming that at last the
Minister was leaving, only to watch
with horror as Ignatius placed a
hand in his jacket pocket and
removed a small pistol. The two
Swiss bankers froze as the Nigerian
Minister of Finance stepped forward
and pressed the muzzle against the
chairman's temple.

  "I need those names, Mr Gerber,
and by now you must realise I will
stop at nothing. If you don't
supply them immediately I'm going
to blow your brains out. Do you
understand?"

  The chairman gave a slight nod,
beads of sweat appearing on his
forehead. "And he will be next,"
said Ignatius, gesturing towards
the young assistant, who stood
speechless and paralysed a few
paces away.

  "Get me the names of every
Nigerian who holds an account in
this bank," Ignatius said quietly,
looking towards the young man, "or
I'll blow your chairman's brains
all over his soft pile carpet.
Immediately, do you hear me?" he
added sharply.

  The young man looked towards the
chairman, who was now trembling but
said quite clearly, "Nan, Pierre,
jamais."

"D 'accord," replied the assistant
in a whisper.

  "You can't say I didn't give you
every chance." Ignatius pulled back
the hammer. The sweat was now
pouring down the chairman's face
and the young man had to turn his
eyes away as he waited in terror
for the pistol shot.

                67
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  "Excellent," said Ignatius, as he
removed the gun from the chairman's
head and returned to his seat. Both
the bankers were still trembling
and quite unable to speak.

  The Minister picked up the
battered briefcase by the side of
his chair and placed it on the
glass table in front of him. He
pressed back the clasps and the lid
flicked up.

  The two bankers stared down at the
neatly packed rows of
hundred-dollar bills. Every inch of
the briefcase had been taken up.
The chairman quickly estimated that
it probably amounted to around five
million dollars.

  "I wonder, sir," said Ignatius,
"how I go about opening an account
with your bank?"

A LA CARTE
  ARTHUR
  Hapgood was

demobbed on November
3rd, 1946. Within a
month he was back at
his old workplace on
the shop-floor of
the Triumph factory
on the outskirts of
Coventry.

  The five years
spent in the
Sherwood Foresters,
four of them as a
quartermaster
seconded to a tank
regiment, only
underlined Arthur's
likely post-war
fate, despite having
hoped to find more
rewarding work once
the war was over.
However, on
returning to England
he quickly
discovered that in a
"land fit for
heroes" jobs were
not that easy to
come by, and
although he did not
want to go back to
the work he had done
for five years
before war had been
declared, that of
fitting wheels on
cars, he
reluctantly, after
four weeks on the
dole, went to see
his former works'
manager at Triumph.

  "The job's yours if
you want it,
Arthur," the works'
manager assured him.

"And the future?"

  "The car's no
longer a toy for the
eccentric rich or
even just a
necessity for the
businessman," the

         71
          
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

works' manager replied. "In fact,"
he continued, "management are
preparing for the 'two-car
family'."

  "So they'll need even more wheels
to be put on cars," said Arthur
forlornly.

"That's the ticket."

  Arthur signed on within the hour
and it was only a matter of days
before he was back into his old
routine. After all, he often
reminded his wife, it didn't take a
degree in engineering to screw four
knobs on to a wheel a hundred times
a shift.

  Arthur soon accepted the Act that
he would have to settle for second
best. However, second best was not
what he planned for his son.

  Mark had celebrated his fifth
birthday before his father had even
set eyes on him, but from the
moment Arthur returned home he
lavished everything he could on the
boy.

Arthur was determined that Mark was
not going to end up working on the
shop-floor of a car factory for the
rest of his life. He put in hours
of overtime to earn enough money to
ensure that the boy could have
extra tuition in maths, general
science and English. He felt well
rewarded when the boy passed his
eleven-plus and won a place at King
Henry VIII Grammar School, and that
pride did not falter when Mark went
on to pass five O-levels and two
years later added two A-levels.

  Arthur tried not to show his
disappointment when, on Mark's
eighteenth birthday, the boy
informed him that he did not want
to go to university.

                72
                 
            A LA CARTE

  "What kind of career arc you
hoping to take up then, lad?"
Arthur enquired.

  "I've filled in an application
form to join you on the shop-floor
just as soon as I leave school."

"But why would you -"

  "Why not? Most of my friends
whotre leaving this term have
already been accepted by Triumph,
and they can't wait to get
started."

"You must be out of your mind."

  "Come off it, Dad. The pay's good
and you've shown that there's
always plenty of extra money to be
picked up with overtime. And I
don't mind hard work."

  "Do you think I spent all those
years making sure you got a
first-class education just to let
you end up like me, putting wheels
on cars for the rest of your life?"
Arthur shouted.

  "That's not the whole job and you
know it, Dad."

  "You go there over my dead body,"
said his father. "I don't care what
your friends end up doing, I only
care about you. You could be a
solicitor, an accountant, an army
officer, even a schoolmaster. Why
should you want to end up at a car
factory?"

  "It's better paid than
schoolmastering for a start," said
Mark. "My French master once told
me that he wasn't as well off as
you."

"That's not the point, lad-"

  "The point is, Dad, I can't be
expected to spend the rest of my
life doing a job I don't enjoy just
to satisfy one of your fantasies."

  "Well, I'm not going to allow you
to waste the rest of your life,"
said Arthur, getting up from the

                73
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

breakfast table. "The first thing
I'm going to do when I get in to
work this morning is see that your
application is turned down."

"That isn't fair, Dad. I have the
right to-"

  But his father had already left
the room, and did not utter another
word to the boy before leaving for
the factory.

  For over a week father and son
didn't speak to each other. It was
Mark's mother who was left to come
up with the compromise. Mark could
apply for any job that met with his
father's approval and as long as he
completed a year at that job he
could, if he still wanted to,
reapply to work at the factory. His
father for his part would not then
put any obstacle in his son's way.

  Arthur nodded. Mark also
reluctantly agreed to the solution.

  "But only if you complete the full
year," Arthur warned solemnly.

  During those last days of the
summer holiday Arthur came up with
several suggestions for Mark to
consider, but the boy showed no
enthusiasm for any of them. Mark's
mother became quite anxious that
her son would end up with no job at
all until, while helping her slice
potatoes for dinner one night, Mark
confided that he thought hotel man-
agement seemed the least
unattractive proposition he had
considered so far.

  "At least you'd have a roofover
your head and be regularly fed,"
his mother said.

  "Bet they don't cook as well as
you, Mum," said Mark as he placed
the sliced potatoes on the top of
the Lancashire hot-pot. "Still,
it's only a year."

During the next month Mark attended
several

                74
                 
            A LA CARTE

interviews at hotels around the
country without success. It was
then that his father discovered
that his old company sergeant was
head porter at the Savoy:
immediately Arthur started to pull
a few strings.

  "If the boy's any good," Arthur's
old comradein-arms assured him over
a pint, "he could end up as a head
porter, even a hotel manager."
Arthur seemed well satisfied, even
though Mark was still assuring his
friends that he would be joining
them a year to the day.

  On September I st, 1959, Arthur
and Mark Hapgood travelled together
by bus to Coventry station. Arthur
shook hands with the boy and
promised him, "Your mother and I
will make sure it's a special
Christmas this year when they give
you your first leave. And don't
worry - you'll be in good hands
with 'Serge'. He'll teach you a
thing or two. Just remember to keep
your nose clean."

  Mark said nothing and returned a
thin smile as he boarded the train.
"You'll never regret it . . ." were
the last words Mark heard his
father say as the train pulled out
of the station.

Mark regretted it from the moment
he set foot in the hotel.

  As a junior porter he started his
day at six in the morning and ended
at six in the evening. He was
entitled to a fifteen-minute
mid-morning break, a
forty-five-minute lunch break and
another fifteenminute break around
mid-afternoon. After the first
month had passed he could not
recall when he had been granted all
three breaks on the same day, and
he quickly learned that there was
no one to whom

                75
                 
A TWIST IN THE TALE
                _

he could protest. His duties
consisted of carrying guests' cases
up to their rooms, then lugging
them back down again the moment
they wanted to leave. With an
average of three hundred people
staying in the hotel each night the
process was endless. The pay turned
out to be half what his friends
were getting back home and as he
had to hand over all his tips to
the head porter, however much
overtime Mark put in, he never saw
an extra penny. On the only
occasion he dared to mention it to
the head porter he was met with the
words, "Your time will come, lad."

  It did not worry Mark that his
uniform didn't fit or that his room
was six foot by six foot and
overlooked Charing Cross Station,
or even that he didn't get a share
of the tips; but it did worry him
that there was nothing he could do
to please the head porter- however
clean he kept his nose.

  Sergeant Crann, who considered the
Savoy nor thing more than an
extension of his old platoon,
didn't have a lot of time for young
men under his command who hadn't
done their national service.

  "But I wasn't eligible to do
national service," insisted Mark.
"No one born after 1939 was called
up."

"Don't make excuses, lad."

"It's not an excuse, Sarge. It's
the truth."

  "And don't call me 'Serge'. I'm
'Sergeant Crann' to you, and don't
you forget it."

"Yes, Sergeant Crann."

  At the end of each day Mark would
return to his little box-room with
its small bed, small chair and tiny
chest of drawers, and collapse
exhausted. The only picture in the
room - of the Laughing Cavalier

                76
                 
            A LA CARTE

- was on the calendar that hung
above Mark's bed. The date of
September I st, 1960, was circled
in red to remind him when he would
be allowed to rejoin his friends at
the factory back home. Each night
before falling asleep he would
cross out the offending day like a
prisoner making scratch marks on a
wall.

  At Christmas Mark returned home
for a four-day break, and when his
mother saw the general state of the
boy she tried to talk his father
into allowing Mark to give up the
job early, but Arthur remained
implacable.

  "We made an agreement. I can't be
expected to get him a job at the
factory if he isn't responsible
enough to keep to his part of a
bargain."

  During the holiday Mark waited for
his friends outside the factory
gate until their shift had ended
and listened to their stories of
weekends spent watching football,
drinking at the pub and dancing to
the Everly Brothers. They all
sympathised with his problem and
looked forward to him joining them
in September. "It's only a few more
months," one of them reminded him
cheerfully.

  Far too quickly, Mark was on
thejourney back to London, where he
continued unwillingly to hump cases
up and down the hotel corridors for
month after month.

  Once the English rain had subsided
the usual influx of American
tourists began. Mark liked the
Americans, who treated him as an
equal and often tipped him a
shilling when others would have
given him only sixpence. But
whatever the amount Mark received
Sergeant Crann would still pocket
it with the inevitable, "Your time
will come, lad."

                77
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  One such American for whom Mark
ran around diligently every day
during his fortnight's stay ended
up presenting the boy with a
ten-bob note as he left the front
entrance of the hotel.

  Mark said, "Thank you, sir," and
turned round to see Sergeant Crann
standing in his path.

  "Hand it over," said Crann as soon
as the American visitor was well
out of earshot.

  "I was going to the moment I saw
you," said Mark, passing the note
to his superior.

  "Not thinking of pocketing what's
rightfully mine, was you?"

  "No, I wasn't," said Mark. "Though
God knows I earned it."

  "Your time will come, lad," said
Sergeant Crann without much
thought.

  "Not while someone as mean as you
is in charge," replied Mark
sharply.

  "What was that you said?" asked
the head porter, veering round.

"You heard me the first time,
Sarge."

The clip across the ear took Mark
by surprise.

  "You, lad, have just lost your
job. Nobody, but nobody, talks to
me like that." Sergeant Crann
turned and set off smartly in the
direction of the manager's office.

  The hotel manager, Gerald
Drummond, listened to the head
porter's version of events before
asking Mark to report to his office
immediately. "You realise I have
been left with no choice but to
sack you," were his first words
once the door was closed.

  Mark looked up at the tall,
elegant man in his long, black
coat, white collar and black tie.
"Am I

                78
                 
A LA CARTE
                    -
allowed to tell you what actually
happened, sir?" he asked.

  Mr Drummond nodded, then listened
without interruption as Mark gave
his version of what had taken place
that morning, and also disclosed the
agreement he had entered into with
his father. "Please let me complete
my final ten weeks," Mark ended, "or
my father will only say I haven't
kept my end of our bargain."

  "I haven't got another job vacant
at the moment," protested the
manager. "Unless you're willing to
peel potatoes for ten weeks."

"Anything," said Mark.

  "Then report to the kitchen at six
tomorrow morning. I'll tell the
third chef to expect you. Only if
you think the head porter is a
martinet just wait until you
meetJacques, our mature chef do
cuisine. He won't clip your ear,
he'll cut it off."

  Mark didn't care. He felt confident
that for just ten weeks he could
face anything, and at five thirty
the following morning he exchanged
his dark blue uniform for a white
top and blue and white check
trousers before reporting for his
new duties. To his surprise the
kitchen took up almost the entire
basement of the hotel, and was even
more of a bustle than the lobby had
been.

  The third chef put him in the
corner of the kitchen, next to a
mountain of potatoes, a bowl of cold
water and a sharp knife. Mark peeled
through breakfast, lunch and dinner,
and fell asleep on his bed that
night without even enough energy
left to cross a day off his
calendar.

  For the first week he never
actually saw the fabledJacques. With
seventy people working in the

                 79
                  
A TWIST IN THE TALE
                       -
kitchens Mark feit confident he
could pass his whole period there
without anyone being aware of him.

  Each morning at six he would start
peeling, then hand over the potatoes
to a gangling youth called Terry who
in turn would dice or cut them
according to the third chef's
instructions for the dish of the
day. Monday saute, Tuesday mashed,
Wednesday French-fried, Thursday
sliced, Friday roast, Saturday
croquette... Mark quickly worked out
a routine which kept him well ahead
of Terry and therefore out of any
trouble.

  Having watched Terry do his job
for over a week Mark felt sure he
could have shown the young
apprentice how to lighten his
workload quite simply, but he
decided to keep his mouth closed:
opening it might only get him into
more trouble, and he was certain the
manager wouldn't give him a second
chance.

  Mark soon discovered that Terry
always fell badly behind on
Tuesday's shepherd's pie and
Thursday's Lancashire hot-pot. From
time to time the third chef would
come across to complain and he would
glance over at Mark to be sure that
it wasn't him who was holding the
process up. Mark made certain that
he always had a spare tub of peeled
potatoes by his side so that he
escaped censure.

  It was on the first Thursday
morning in August (Lancashire
hot-pot) that Terry sliced off the
top of his forefinger. Blood spurted
all over the sliced potatoes and on
to the wooden table as the lad began
yelling hysterically.

"Get him out of here!" Mark heard
the maztrc chef

                 80
                  
            A LA CARTE

do bellow above the noise of the
kitchen as he stormed towards them.

  "And you," he said, pointing at
Mark, "clean up mess and start
slicing rest of potatoes. I 'ave
eight hundred hungry customers
still expecting to feed."

"Me?" said Mark in disbelief.
"But-"

  "Yes, you. You couldn't do worse
job than idiot who calls himself
trainee chef and cuts off finger."
The chef marched away, leaving Mark
to move reluctantly across to the
table where Terry had been working.
He felt disinclined to argue while
the calendar was there to remind
him that he was down to his last
twenty-five days.

  Mark set about a task he had
carried out for his mother many
times. The clean, neat cuts were
delivered with a skill Terry would
never learn to master. By the end
of the day, although exhausted,
Mark did not feel quite as tired as
he had in the past.

  At eleven that night the mature
chef do cuisine threw off his hat
and barged out of the swing doors,
a sign to everyone else they could
also leave the kitchen once
everything that was their
responsibility had been cleared up.
A few seconds later the door swung
back open and the chef burst in. He
stared round the kitchen as
everyone waited to see what he
would do next. Having found what he
was looking for, he headed straight
for Mark.

;'Oh, my God," thought Mark. "He's
going to

"How is your name?" the chef
demanded.

  "Mark Hapgood, sir," he managed to
splutter out.

"You waste on 'tatoes, Mark
Hapgood," said the

                81
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

chef. "You start on vegetables in
morning. Report at seven. If that
cretin with half finger ever
returns, put him to peeling
'tatoes."

  The chef turned on his heel even
before Mark had the chance to reply.
He dreaded the thought of having to
spend three weeks in the middle of
the kitchens, never once out of the
maitre chef de cumnc's sight, but he
accepted there was no alternative.

  The next morning Mark arrived at
six for fear of being late and spent
an hour watching the fresh
vegetables being unloaded from
Covent Garden market. The hotel's
supply manager checked every case
carefully, rejecting several before
he signed a chit to show the hotel
had received over three thousand
pounds' worth of vegetables. An
average day, he assured Mark.

  The maztrc chef do cuisine
appeared a few minutes before seven
thirty, checked the menus and told
Mark to score the Brussels sprouts,
trim the French beans and remove the
coarse outer leaves of the cabbages.

  "But I don't know how," Mark
replied honestly. He could feel the
other trainees in the kitchen edging
away from him.

  "Then I teach you," roared the
chef. "Perhaps only thing you learn
is if hope to be good chef, you able
to do everyone's job in kitchen,
even 'tato peeler's."

  "But I'm hoping to be a . . ."
Mark began and then thought better
of it. The chef seemed not to have
heard Mark as he took his place
beside the new recruit. Everyone in
the kitchen stared as the chef began
to show Mark the basic skills of
cutting, dicing and slicing.

                82
                 
A LA CARTE

.

  "And remember other idiot's
finger," the chef said on completing
the lesson and passing the
razor-sharp knife back to Mark.
"Yours can be next."

  Mark started gingerly dicing the
carrots, then the Brussels sprouts,
removing the outer layer before
cutting a firm cross in the stalk.
Next he moved on to trimming and
slicing the beans. Once again he
found it fairly easy to keep ahead
of the chef's requirements.

  At the end of each day, after the
head chef had left, Mark stayed on
to sharpen all his knives in
preparation for the following
morning, and would not leave his
work area until it was spotless.

  On the sixth day, after a curt nod
from the chef, Mark realised he must
be doing something halfright. By the
following Saturday he felt he had
mastered the simple skills of
vegetable preparation and found
himself becoming fascinated by what
the chef himself was up to. Although
Jacques rarely addressed anyone as
he marched round the acre of kitchen
except to grunt his approval or
disapproval - the latter more
commonly- Mark quickly learned to
anticipate his needs. Within a short
space of time he began to feel that
he was part of a team - even though
he was only too aware of being the
novice recruit.

  On the deputy chef's day off the
following week Mark was allowed to
arrange the cooked vegetables in
their bowls and spent some time
making each dish look attractive as
well as edible. The chef not only
noticed but actually muttered his
greatest accolade- "Bon."

During his last three weeks at the
Savoy Mark

        A TWIST IN THE TALE

did not even look at the calendar
above his bed.

  One Thursday morning a message
came down from the under-manager
that Mark was to report to his
office as soon as was convenient.
Mark had quite forgotten that it
was August 31st- his last day. He
cut ten lemons into quarters, then
finished preparing the forty plates
of thinly sliced smoked salmon that
would complete the first course for
a wedding lunch. He looked with
pride at his efforts before folding
up his apron and leaving to collect
his papers and final wage packet.

  "Where you think you're going?"
asked the chef, lookmg up.

"I'm off," said Mark. "Back to
Coventry."

"See you Monday then. You deserve
day off."

"No, I'm going home for good," said
Mark.

  The chef stopped checking the cuts
of rare beef that would make up the
second course of the wedding feast.

  "Going?" he repeated as if he
didn't understand the word.

  "Yes. I've finished my year and
now I'm off home to work."

  "I hope you found first-class
hotel," said the chef with genuine
interest.

"I'm not going to work in a hotel."

"A restaurant, perhaps?"

"No, I'm going to get a job at
Triumph."

  The chef looked puzzled for a
moment, unsure if it was his
English or whether the boy was
mocking him.

"What is - Triumph?"

"A place where they manufacture
cars."

"You will manufacture cars?"

&!

             A LA CARTE
-
"Not a whole car, but I will put
the wheels on." "You put cars on
wheels?" the chef said in
disbelief.

"No," laughed Mark. "Wheels on
cars."

The chef still looked uncertain.

"So you will be cooking for the car
workers?"

  "No. As I explained, I'm going to
put the wheels on the cars," said
Mark slowly, enunciating each word.

"That not possible."

  "Oh yes it is," responded Mark.
"And I've waited a whole year to
prove it."

  "If I offered you job as commis
chef, you change mind?" asked the
chef quietly.

"Why would you do that?"

  "Because you 'ave talent in those
fingers. In time I think you become
chef, perhaps even good chef."

  "No, thanks. I'm off to Coventry
to join my mates."

  The head chef shrugged. " Tant
pits," he said, and without a
second glance returned to the
carcass of beef. He glanced over at
the plates of smoked salmon. "A
wasted talent," he added after the
swing door had closed behind his
potential protege.

  Mark locked his room, threw the
calendar in the wastepaper basket
and returned to the hotel to hand
in his kitchen clothes to the
housekeeper. The final action he
took was to return his room key to
the under-manager.

  "Your wage packet, your cards and
your PAYE. Oh, and the chef has
phoned up to say he would be happy
to give you a reference," said the
undermanager. "Can't pretend that
happens every day."

                ~5
                 
A TWIST IN THE TALE
                    -
     "Won't need that where I'm
going," said Mark.

"But thanks all the same."

  He started off for station at a brisk
pace, his small battered suitcase
swinging by his side, only to find that
each step took a little longer. When he
arrived at Euston he made his way to
Platform 7 and began walking up and
down, occasionally staring at the great
clock above the booking hall. He
watched first one train and then
another pull out of the station bound
for Coventry. He was aware of the
station becoming dark as shadows
filtered through the glass awning on to
the public concourse. Suddenly he
turned and walked offal an even brisker
pace. If he hurried he could still be
back in time to help chef prepare
dinner that night.

Mark trained under Jacques le Renneu
for five years. Vegetables were
followed by sauces, fish by poultry,
meats by patisserie. After eight years
at the Savoy he was appointed second
chef, and had learned so much from his
mentor that regular patrons could no
longer be sure when it was the mature
chef de cuisine's day off. Two years
later Mark became a master chef, and
when in 1971 Jacques was offered the
opportunity to return to Paris and take
over the kitchens of the George Cinq -
an establishment that is to Paris what
Harrods is to London - Jacques agreed,
but only on condition that Mark
accompanied him.

  "It is wrong direction from Coventry,"
Jacques warned him, "and in any case
they sure to offer you my job at the
Savoy."

  "I'd better come along otherwise those
Frogs will never get a decent meal."

Be;

            A LA CARTE

  "Those Frogs," saidJacques, "will
always know when it's my day off."

  "Yes, and book in even greater
numbers," suggested Mark, laughing.

  It was not to be long before
Parisians were flocking to the
George Cinq, not to rest their
weary heads but to relish the
cooking ofthe two-chefteam.

  WhenJacques celebrated his
sixty-fifth birthday the great
hotel did not have to look far to
appoint his successor.

  "The first Englishman ever to be
pantry chef do cuisine at the
George Cinq," said Jacques, raising
a glass of champagne at his
farewell banquet. "Who would
believe it? Of course, you will
have to change your name to Marc to
hold down such a position."

"Neither will ever happen," said
Mark.

  "Oh yes it will, because I 'ave
recommended you."

"Then I shall turn it down."

  "Going to put cars on wheels,
peut-ctrc?" asked Jacques
mockingly.

  "No, but I have found a little
restaurant on the Left Bank. With
my savings alone I can't quite
afford the lease, but with your
help . . ."

  ChezJacques opened on the rue du
Plaisir on the Left Bank on May
1st, 1982, and it was not long
before those customers who had
taken the George Cinq for granted
transferred their allegiance.

  Mark's reputation spread as the
two chefs pioneered "nouvelle
cuisine", and soon the only way
anyone could be guaranteed a table
at the restaurant in under three
weeks was to be a film star or a
Cabinet Minister.

The day Michelin gave ChezJacques
their third

                87
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

star Mark, withJacques's blessing,
decided to open a second
restaurant. The press and customers
then quarrelled amongst themselves
as to which was the finer
establishment. The booking sheets
showed clearly the public felt
there was no difference.

  When in October 1986 Jacques died,
at the age of seventy-one, the
restaurant critics wrote confi-
dently that standards were bound to
fall. A year later the same
journalists had to admit that one
of the five great chefs of France
had come from a town in the British
Midlands they could not even
pronounce.

  Jacques's death only made Mark
yearn more for his homeland, and
when he read in the Daily Telegraph
of a new development to be built in
Covent Garden he called the site
agent to ask for more details.

  Mark's third restaurant was opened
in the heart of London on February
I Ith, 1987.

Over the years Mark Hapgood often
travelled back to Coventry to see
his parents. His father had retired
long since but Mark was still
unable to persuade either parent to
take the trip to Paris and sample
his culinary efforts. But now he
had opened in the country's capital
he hoped to tempt them.

  "We don't need to go up to
London," said his mother, laying
the table. "You always cook for us
whenever you come home, and we read
of your successes in the papers. In
any case, your father isn't so good
on his legs nowadays."

  "What do you call this, son?" his
father asked a few minutes later as
noisette of lamb surrounded by baby
carrots was placed in front of him.

                ~8
                 
            A LA CARTE

"Nouvelle cuisine."

"And people pay good money for it?"

  Mark laughed and the following day
prepared his father's favourite
Lancashire hot-pot.

  "Now that's a real meal," said
Arthur after his third helping.
"And I'll tell you something for
nothing, lad. You cook it almost as
well as your mother."

  A year later Michelin announced
the restaurants throughout the
world that had been awarded their
coveted third star. The Times let
its readers know on its front page
that Chez Jacques was the first
English restaurant ever to be so
honoured.

  To celebrate the award Mark's
parents finally agreed to make the
journey down to London, though not
until Mark had sent a telegram
saying he was reconsidering that
job at British Leyland. He sent a
car to fetch his parents and had
them installed in a suite at the
Savoy. That evening he reserved the
most popular table at ChezJacques
in their name.

  Vegetable soup followed by steak
and kidney pie with a plate of
bread and butter pudding to end on
were not the table d'hote that
night, but they were served for the
special guests on Table 17.

  Under the influence of the finest
wine, Arthur was soon chatting
happily to anyone who would listen
and couldn't resist reminding the
head waiter that it was his son who
owned the restaurant.

  "Don't be silly, Arthur," said his
wife. "He already knows that."

  "Nice couple, your parents," the
head waiter confided to his boss
after he had served them with their
coffee and supplied Arthur with a
cigar.

"What did your old man do before he
retired? Banker, lawyer,
schoolmaster?"

  "Oh no, nothing like that," said
Mark quietly. "He spent the whole
of his working life putting wheels
on cars."

  "But why would he waste his time
doing that?" asked the waiter
incredulously.

  "Because he wasn't lucky enough to
have a father like mine," Mark
replied.

displayed on the back of the
packet.

Walter never got the VC.

Angela Bradbury thought they were
both silly.

  "They're only replicas," she
continually reminded them, "not the
real thing, and I am only
interested in the real thing," she
told them haughtily.

  Neither Gerald nor Walter cared
for Angela's opinion at the time,
both boys still being more
interested in medals than the views
of the opposite sex.

Kellogg's offer of free medals
ended on January

                92
                 
        NOT THE REAL THING

1st, 1950, just at the time when
Gerald had managed to complete the
set.

Walter gave up eating cornflakes.

  Children ofthe Fifties were then
given the opportunity to discover
the world of Meccano. Meccano
demanded eating even more
cornflakes and within a year Gerald
had collected a large enough set to
build bridges, pontoons, cranes and
even an office block.

  Gerald's family nobly went on
munching cornflakes, but when he
told them he wanted to build a
whole town - Kellogg's positively
final offer - it took nearly all
his friends in the fifth form at
Hull Grammar School to assist him
in consuming enough breakfast
cereal to complete his ambition.

Walter Ramsbottom refused to be of
assistance.

Angela Bradbury's help was never
sought.

All three continued on their
separate ways.

Two years later, when Gerald
Haskins won a place at Durham
University, no one was surprised
that he chose to read engineering
and listed as his main hobby
collecting medals.

  Walter Ramsbottom joined his
father in the family jewellery
business and started courting
Angela Bradbury.

  It was during the spring holiday
in Gerald's second year at Durham
that he came across Walter and
Angela again. They were sitting in
the same row at a Bach quintet
concert in Hull Town Hall. Walter
told him in the interval that they
had just become engaged but had not
yet settled on a date for the
wedding.

Gerald hadn't seen Angela for over
a year but

                93
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

this time he did listen to her
opinions, because like Walter he
fell in love with her.

  He replaced eating cornflakes with
continually inviting Angela out to
dinner in an effort to win her away
from his old rival.

  Gerald notched up another victory
when Angela returned her engagement
ring to Walter a few drays before
Christmas.

  Walter spread it around that
Gerald only wanted to marry Angela
because her father was chairman of
the Hull City Amenities Committee
and he was hoping to get ajob with
the council after he'd taken his
degree at Durham. When the
invitations for the wedding were
sent out, Walter was not on the
guest list.

Mr and Mrs Haskins travelled to
Multavia for their honeymoon,
partly because they couldn't afford
Nice and didn't want to go to
Cleethorpes. In any case, the local
travel agent was making a special
offer for those considering a visit
to the tiny kingdom that was
sandwiched between Austria and
Czechoslovakia.

  When the newly married couple
arrived at their hotel in Teske,
the capital, they discovered why
the terms had been so reasonable.

  Multavia was, in 1959, going
through an identity crisis as it
attempted to adjust to yet another
treaty drawn up by a Dutch lawyer
in Geneva, written in French, but
with the Russians and Americans in
mind. However, thanks to King
Alfons III, their shrewd and
popular monarch, the kingdom con-
tinued to enjoy uninterrupted
grants from the Weat and
non-disruptive visits from the
East.

                9œ
                 
         NOT THE REAL THING

  The capital of Multavia, the
Haskins were quickly to discover,
had an average temperature of 92 F
in June, no rainfall and the remains
of a sewerage system that had been
indiscriminately bombed by both
sides between 1939 and 1944. Angela
actually found herself holding her
nose as she walked through the
cobbled streets. The People's Hotel
claimed to have forty-five rooms,
but what the brochure did not point
out was that only three of them had
bathrooms and none of those had bath
plugs. Then there was the food, or
lack of it; for the first time in
his life Gerald lost weight.

  The honeymoon couple were also to
discover that Multavia boasted no
monuments, art galleries, theatres
or opera houses worthy of the name
and the outlying country was flatter
and less interesting than the fens
of Cambridgeshire. The kingdom had
no coastline and the only river, the
Plotz, flowed from Germany and on
into Russia, thus ensuring that none
of the locals trusted it.

  By the end of their honeymoon the
Haskins were only too pleased to
find that Multavia did not boast a
national airline. BOAC got them home
safely, and that would have been the
end of Gerald's experience of
Multavia had it not been for those
sewers - or the lack of them.

Once the Haskins had returned to
Hull, Gerald took up his appointment
as an assistant in the engineering
department of the city council. His
first job was as a third engineer
with special responsibility for the
city's sewerage. Most ambitious
young men would have treated such an
appointment as nothing more than a
step on life's ladder. Gerald

                 g5
                  
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

however did not. He quickly made
contact with all the leading
sewerage companies, their advisers
as well as his opposite numbers
throughout the county.

  Two years later he was able to put
in front of his father-in-law's
committee a paper showing how the
council could save a considerable
amount of the ratepayers' money by
redeveloping its sewerage system.

  The committee were impressed and
decided to carry out Mr Haskins's
recommendation, and at the same
time appointed him second engineer.

  That was the first occasion Walter
Ramsbottom stood for the council;
he wasn't elected.

  When, three years later, the
network of little tunnels and
waterways had been completed,
Gerald's diligence was rewarded by
his appointment as deputy borough
engineer. In the same year his
father-in-law became Mayor and
Walter Ramsbottom became a
councillor.

  Councils up and down the country
were now acknowledging Gerald as a
man whose opinion should be sought
if they had any anxieties about
their sewerage system. This
provoked an irreverent round of
jokes at every Rotary Club dinner
Gerald attended, but they
nevertheless still hailed him as
the leading authority in his field,
or drain.

  When in 1966 the Borough of
Halifax considered putting out to
tender the building of a new
sewerage system they first
consulted Gerald Haskins -Yorkshire
being the one place on earth where
a prophet is with honour in his own
country.

  After spending a day in Halifax
with the town council's senior
engineer and realising how much

                96
                 
         NOT THE REAL THING

had to be spent on the new system,
Gerald remarked to his wife; not for
the first time, "Where there's muck
there's brass." But it was Angela
who was shrewd enough to work out
just how much of that brass her
husband could get hold of with the
minimum of risk. During the next few
days Gerald considered his wife's
proposition and when he returned to
Halifax the following week it was
not to visit the council chambers
but the Midland Bank. Gerald did not
select the Midland by chance; the
manager of the bank was also
chairman of the planning committee
on the Halifax borough council.

  A deal that suited both sides was
struck between the two Yorkshiremen,
and with the bank's blessing Gerald
resigned his position as deputy
borough engineer and formed a
private company. When he presented
his tender, in competition with
several large organisations from
London, no one was surprised that
Haskins of Hull was selected
unanimously by the planning
committee to carry out the job.

  Three years later Halifax had a
fine new sewerage system and the
Midland Bank was delighted to be
holding Haskins of Hull's company
account.

  Over the next fifteen years
Chester, Runcorn, Huddersfield,
Darlington, Macclesfield and York
were jointly and severally grateful
for the services rendered to them by
Gerald Haskins, of Haskins & Co plc.

  Haskins & Co (International) pie
then began contract work in Dubai,
Lagos and Rio deJaneiro. In 1983
Gerald received the Queen's Award
for Industry from a grateful
government, and a year

                 97
                  
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

later he was made a Commander of the
British Empire by a grateful
monarch.

  The investiture took place at
Buckingham Palace in the same year
as King AlEons III of Multavia died
and was succeeded by his son King
Alfons IV. The newly crowned King
decided something had finally to be
done about the drainage problems of
Teske. It had been his father's
dying wish that his people should
not go on suffering those unseemly
smells, and King Alfons IV did not
intend to bequeath the problem to
his son.

  After much begging and borrowing
from the West, and much visiting and
talking with the East, the newly
anointed monarch decided to invite
tenders for a new sewerage system in
the kingdom's capital.

  The tender document supplying
several pages of details and listing
the problems facing any engineer who
wished to tackle the problem arrived
with a thud on most of the boardroom
tables of the world's major
engineering companies. Once the
paperwork had been seriously
scrutinised and the realistic
opportunity for a profit considered,
King Alfons IV received only a few
replies. Nevertheless, the King was
able to sit up all night considering
the merits of the three interested
companies that had been shortlisted.
Kings are also human, and when
Alfons discovered that Gerald had
chosen Multavia for his honeymoon
some twenty-five years before it
tipped the balance. By the time
Alfons IV fell asleep that morning
he had decided to accept Haskins &
Co (International) plc's tender.

  And thus Gerald Haskins made his
second visit to Multavia, this time
accompanied by a site 98

         NOT THE REAL THING

manager, three draughtsmen and
eleven engineers. Gerald had a
private audience with the King and
assured him the job would be
completed on time and for the price
specified. He also told the King how
much he was enjoying his second
visit to his country. However, when
he returned to England he assured
his wife that there was still little
in Multavia that could be described
as entertainment before or after the
hour of seven.

A few years later and after some
considerable haggling over the
increase in the cost of materials,
Teske ended up with one of the
finest sewerage systems in Central
Europe. The King was delighted -
although he continued to grumble
about how Haskins & Co had over-run
the original contract price. The
words "contingency payment" had to
be explained to the monarch several
times, who realised that the extra
two hundred and forty thousand
pounds would in turn have to be
explained to the East and "borrowed"
from the West. After many veiled
threats and "without prejudice"
solicitors' letters, Haskins & Co
received the final payment but not
until the King had been given a
further grant from the British
government, a payment which involved
the Midland Bank, Sloane Street,
transferring a sum of money to the
Midland Bank, High Street, Hull,
without Multavia ever getting their
hands on it. This was after all,
Gerald explained to his wife, how
most overseas aid was distributed.

Thus the story of Gerald Haskins and
the drainage
 problems of Teske might have ended,
had not the
                 99
                  
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

British Foreign Secretary decided
to pay a visit to the kingdom of
Multavia.

  The original purpose of the
Foreign Secretary's European trip
was to take in Warsaw and Prague,
in order to see how glasnost and
percstroi/ra were working in those
countries. But when the Foreign Of
lice discovered how much aid had
been allocated to Multavia and
after they explained to their
minister its role as a buffer
state, the Foreign Secretary
decided to accept King Alfons's
long-standing invitation to visit
the tiny kingdom. Such excursions
to smaller countries by British
Foreign Secretaries usually take
place in airport lounges, a habit
the British picked up from Henry
Kissinger, and later Comrade
Gorbachev; but not on this
occasion. It was felt Multavia
warranted a full day.

  As the hotels had improved only
slightly since the time of Gerald's
honeymoon, the Foreign Secretary
was invited to lodge at the palace.
He was asked by the King to
undertake only two official
engagements during his brief stay:
the opening of the capital's new
sewerage system, and a formal
banquet.

  Once the Foreign Secretary had
agreed to these requests the King
invited Gerald and his wife to be
present at the opening ceremony -
at their own expense. When the day
of the opening came the Foreign
Secretary delivered the appropriate
speech for the occasion. He first
praised Gerald Haskins on a
remarkable piece of work in the
great tradition of British
engineering, then commended
Multavia for her shrewd common
sense in awarding the contract to a
British company in the first place.
The Foreign Secretary omitted to
mention the fact that the

                100
         NOT THE REAL THING

British government had ended up
underwriting the entire project.
Gerald, however, was touched by the
minister's words and said as much
to the Foreign Secretary after the
latter had pulled the lever that
opened the first sluice gate.

  That evening in the palace there
was a banquet for over three
hundred guests, including the am-
bassadorial corps and several
leading British businessmen. There
followed the usual interminable
speeches about "historic links",
Multavia's role in Anglo-Soviet
affairs and the "special
relationship" with Britain's own
royal family.

  The highlight of the evening,
however, came after the speeches
when the King made two investi-
tures. The first was the award of
the Order of the Peacock (Second
Class) to the Foreign Secretary.
"The highest award a commoner can
receive," the King explained to the
assembled audience, "as the Order
of the Peacock (First Class) is
reserved for royalty and heads of
state."

  The King then announced a second
investiture. The Order of the
Peacock (Third Class) was to be
awarded to Gerald Haskins, CBE, for
his work on the drainage system of
Teske. Gerald was surprised and
delighted as he was conducted from
his place on the top table to join
the King, who leaned forward to put
a large gold chain encrusted with
gems of various colours and sizes
over his visitor's head. Gerald
took two respectful paces backwards
and bowed low, as the Foreign
Secretary looked up from his seat
and smiled encouragingly at him.

  Gerald was the last foreign guest
to leave the banquet that night.
Angela, who had left on her own
over two hours before, had already
fallen

                101
                 
A TWIST IN THE TALE

.

asleep by the time Gerald returned
to their hotel room. He placed the
chain on the bed, undressed, put on
his pyjamas, checked his wife was
still asleep and then placed the
chain back over his head to rest on
his shoulders.

  Gerald stood and looked at himself
in the bathroom mirror for several
minutes. He could not wait to return
home.

  The moment Gerald got back to Hull
he dictated a letter to the Foreign
Of fice. He requested permission to
be allowed to wear his new award on
those occasions when it stipulated
on the bottom righthand corner of
invitation cards that decorations
and medals should be worn. The
Foreign Office duly referred the
matter to the Palace where the
Queen, a distant cousin of King
Alfons IV, agreed to the request.

  The next official occasion at
which Gerald was given the
opportunity to sport the Order of
the Peacock was the Mayor-making
ceremony held in the chamber of
Hull's City Hall, which was to be
preceded by dinner at the Guildhall.

  Gerald returned especially from
Lagos for the occasion and even
before changing into his dinner
jacket couldn't resist a glance at
the Order of the Peacock (Third
Class). He opened the box that held
his prize possession and stared down
in disbelief: the gold had become
tarnished and one of the stones
looked as if it were coming loose.
Mrs Haskins stopped dressing in
order to steal a glance at the
order. "It's not gold," she declared
with a simplicity that would have
stopped the IMF in their tracks.

Gerald offered no comment and
quickly fixed the

                 102
                  
        NOT THE REAL THING

loose stone back in place with
Araldite but he had to admit to
himself that the craftmanship
didn't bear careful scrutiny.
Neither of them mentioned the
subject again on their journey to
Hull's City Hall.

  Some of the guests during the
Mayor's dinner that night at the
Guildhall Inquired after the his-
tory of the Order of the Peacock
(Third Class), and although it gave
Gerald some considerable satisfac-
tion to explain how he had come by
the distinction and indeed the
Queen's permission to wear it on of
ficial occasions, he felt one or
two of his colleagues had been less
than awed by the tarnished peacock.
Gerald also considered it was
somewhat unfortunate that they had
ended up on the same table as
Walter Ramsbottom, now the Deputy
Mayor.

  "I suppose it would be hard to put
a true value on it," said Walter,
staring disdainfully at the chain.

"It certainly would," said Gerald
firmly.

  "I didn't mean a monetary value,"
said the jeweller with a smirk.
"That would be only too easy to
ascertain. I meant a sentimental
value, of course."

  "Of course," said Gerald. "And are
you expecting to be the Mayor next
year?" he asked, trying to change
the subject.

  "It is the tradition," said
Walter, "that the Deputy succeeds
the Mayor if he doesn't do a second
year. And be assured, Gerald, that
I shall see to it that you are
placed on the top table for that
occasion." Walter paused. "The
Mayor's chain, you know, is
fourteen-carat gold."

  Gerald left the banquet early that
evening determined to do something
about the Order of the

                103
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

Peacock before it was Walter's turn
to be Mayor.

  None of Gerald's friends would
have described him as an
extravagant man and even his wife
was surprised at the whim of vanity
that was to follow. At nine o'clock
the next morning Gerald rang his
office to say he would not be in to
work that day. He then travelled by
train to London to visit Bond
Street in general and a famed
jeweller in particular.

The door of the Bond Street shop
was opened for Gerald by a sergeant
from the Corps of Commissionaires.
Once he had stepped inside Gerald
explained his problem to the tall,
thin gentleman in a black suit who
had come forward to welcome him. He
was then led to a circular glass
counter in the middle of the shop
finer.

  "Our Mr Pullinger will be with you
in a moment," he was assured.
Moments later Asprey's fine-gems
expert arrived and happily agreed
to Gerald's request to value the
Order of the Peacock (Third Class).
Mr Pullinger placed the chain on a-
black velvet cushion before closely
studying the stones through a small
eye glass.

  After a cursory glance he frowned
with the disappointment of a man
who has won third prize at a
shooting range on Blackpool pier.

  "So what's it worth?" asked Gerald
bluntly after several minutes had
elapsed.

  "Hard to put a value on something
so intricately" - Pullinger
hesitated - "unusual."

  "The stones are glass and the
gold's brass, that's what you're
trying to say, isn't it, lad?"

  Mr Pullinger gave a look that
indicated that he could not have
put it more succinctly himself.

                104
                 
        NOT THE REAL THING

  "You might possibly be able to get
a few hundred pounds from someone
who collects such objects, but . .
."

  "Oh, no," said Gerald, quite
offended. "I have no interest in
selling it. My purpose in coming up
to London was to find out if you
can copy it."

"Copy it?" said the expert in
disbelief.

  "Aye," said Gerald. "First, I want
every stone to be the correct gem
according to its colour. Second, I
expect a setting that would impress
a duchess. And third, I require the
finest craftsman put to work on it
in nothing less than eighteen-carat
gold."

  The expert from Asprey's, despite
years of dealing with Arab clients,
was unable to conceal his surprise.

  "It would not be cheap," he
uttered sotto vocc: the word "cheap" was
one of which Asprey's clearly
disapproved.

  "I never doubted that for one
moment," said Gerald. "But you must
understand that this is a
once-in-a-lifetime honour for me.
Now when could I hope to have an
estimate?"

  "A month, six weeks at the most,"
replied the expert.

  Gerald left the plush carpet of
Asprey's for the sewers of Nigeria.
When a little over a month later he
flew back to London, he travelled
in to the West End for his second
meeting with Mr Pullinger.

  The jeweller had not forgotten
Gerald Haskins and his strange
request, and he quickly produced
from his order book a neatly folded
piece of paper. Gerald unfolded it
and read the tender slowly.
Requirement for customer's request:
twelve diamonds, seven amethysts,
three rubies and a

                105
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

sapphire, all to be of the most
perfect colour and of the highest
quality. A peacock to be sculpted in
ivory and painted by a craftsman.
The entire chain then to be moulded
in the finest eighteencarat gold.
The bottom line read: "Two hundred
and eleven thousand pounds -
exclusive of VAT."

  Gerald, who would have thought
nothing of haggling over an estimate
of a few thousand pounds for roofing
material or the hire of heavy
equipment, or even a schedule of
payments, simply asked, "When will
I be able to collect it?"

  "One could not be certain how long
it might take to put together such
a fine piece," said Mr Pullinger.
"Finding stones of a perfect match
and colour will, I fear, take a
little time." He paused. "I am also
hoping that our senior craftsman
will be free to work on this
particular commission. He has been
rather taken up lately with gifts
for the Queen's forthcoming visit to
Saudi Arabia so I don't think it
could be ready before the end of
March."

  Well in time for next year's
Mayor's banquet, thought Gerald.
Councillor Ramsbottom would not be
able to mock him this time.
Fourteen-carat gold, had he said?

Lagos and Rio de Janeiro both had
their sewers down and running long
before Gerald was able to return to
Asprey's. And he only set his eyes
on the unique prize a few weeks
before Mayor-making day.

  When Mr Pullinger first showed his
client the finished work the
Yorkshireman gasped with

                106
                 
        NOT THE REAL THING

delight. The Order was so
magnificent that Gerald found it
necessary to purchase a string of
pearls from Asprey's to ensure a
silent wife.

  On his return to Hull he waited
until after dinner to open the
green leather box from Asprey's and
surprise her with the new Order.
"Fit for a monarch, lass," he
assured his wife but Angela seemed
preoccupied with her pearls.

  After Angela had left to wash up,
her husband continued to stare for
some time at the beautiful jewels
so expertly crafted and superbly
cut before he finally closed the
box. The next morning he
reluctantly took the piece round to
the bank and explained that it must
be kept safely locked in the vaults
as he would only be requiring to
take it out once, perhaps twice, a
year. He couldn't resist showing
the object of his delight to the
bank manager, Mr Sedgley.

  "You'll be wearing it for
Mayor-making day, no doubt?" Mr
Sedgley enquired.

"If I'm invited," said Gerald.

  "Oh, I feel sure Ramsbottom will
want all his old friends to witness
the ceremony. Especially you, I
suspect," he added without
explanation.

Gerald read the news item in the
Court Circular of The Times to his
wife over breakfast: "It has been
announced from Buckingham Palace
that King Alfons IV of Multavia
will make a state visit to Britain
between April 7th and 1 Ith."

  "I wonder if we will have an
opportunity to meet the King
again," said Angela.

Gerald offered no opinion.

In fact Mr and Mrs Gerald Haskins
received two

                107

invitations connected with King
Alfons's official visit, one to
dine with the King at Claridge's
-Multavia's London Embassy not
being large enough to cater for
such an occasion - and the second
arriving a day later by special
delivery from Buckingham Palace. ~

  Gerald was delighted. The Peacock,
it seemed, was going to get three
outings in one month, as their
visit to the Palace was ten days
before Walter Ramsbottom would be
installed as Mayor.

  The state dinner at Claridge's was
memorable and although there were
several hundred other guests Gerald
still managed to catch a moment
with his host, King Alfons IV who,
he found to his pleasure, could not
take his eyes of Ethe Orderofthe
Peacock (Third Class).

  The trip to Buckingham Palace a
week later was Gerald and Angela's
second, following Gerald's
investiture in 1984 as a Commander
of the British Empire. It took
Gerald almost as long to dress for
the state occasion as it did his
wife. He took some time fiddling
with his collar to be sure that his
CBE could be seen to its full
advantage while the Order ofthe
Peacock still rested squarely on
his shoulders. Gerald had asked his
tailor to sew little loops into his
tailcoat so that the Order did not
have to be continually readjusted.

  When the Haskins arrived at
Buckingham Palace they followed a
throng of bemedalled men and
tiara'd ladies through to the state
dining room where a footman handed
out seating cards to each of the
guests. Gerald unfolded his to find
an arrow pointing to his name. He
took his wife by the arm and guided
her to their places.

                108
                 
        NOT THE REAL THING

  He noticed that Angela's head kept
turning whenever she saw a tiara.

  Although they were seated some
distance away from Her Majesty at an
offshoot of the main table, there
was still a minor royal on Gerald's
left and the Minister of Agriculture
on his right. He was more than
satisfied. In fact the whole evening
went far too quickly, and Gerald was
already beginning to feel that
Mayor-making day would be something
of an anti-climax. Nevertheless,
Gerald imagined a scene where
Councillor Ramsbottom was admiring
the Order of the Peacock (Third
Class), while he was telling him
about the dinner at the Palace.

  After two loyal toasts and two
national anthems the Queen rose to
her feet. She spoke warmly of
Multavia as she addressed her three
hundred guests, and affectionately
of her distant cousin the King. Her
Majesty added that she hoped to
visit his kingdom at some time in
the near future. This was greeted
with considerable applause. She then
concluded her speech by saying it
was her intention to make two
investitures.

  The Queen created King Alfons IV a
Knight Commander of the Royal
Victorian Order (KCVO), and then
Multavia's Ambassador to the Court
of StJames a Commander of the same
order (CVO), both being personal
orders of the monarch. A box of
royal blue was opened by the Court
Chamberlain and the awards placed
over the recipients' shoulders. As
soon as the Queen had completed her
formal duties, King Alfons rose to
make his reply.

  "Your Majesty," he continued after
the usual formalities and thanks had
been completed. "I also

                109
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

would like to make two awards. The
first is to an Englishman who has
given great service to my country
through his expertise and
diligence" - the King then glanced
in Gerald's direction - "a man," he
continued, "who completed a feat of
sanitary engineering that any
nation on earth could be proud of
and indeed, Your Majesty, it was
opened by your own Foreign
Secretary. We in the capital of
Teske will remain in his debt for
generations to come. We therefore
bestow on Mr Gerald Haskins, CBE,
the Order of the Peacock (Second
Class)."

Gerald couldn't believe his ears.

  Tumultuous applause greeted a
surprised Gerald as he made his way
up towards their Majesties. He came
to a standstill behind the throned
chairs somewhere between the Queen
of England and the King of
Multavia. The King smiled at the
new recipient of the Order of the
Peacock (Second Class) as the two
men shook hands. But before
bestowing the new honour upon him,
King Alfons leaned forward and with
some difficulty removed from
Gerald's shoulders his Order of the
Peacock (Third Class).

  "You won't be needing this any
longer," the King whispered in
Gerald's ear.

  Gerald watched in horror as his
prize possession disappeared into a
red leather box held open by the
King's private secretary, who stood
poised behind his sovereign. Gerald
continued to stare at the private
secretary, who was either a
diplomat of the highest order or
had not been privy to the Kingis
plan, for his face showed no sign
of anything untoward. Once Gerald's
magnificent prize had been safely
removed, the box snapped closed
like a safe of

                110
                 
        NOT THE REAL THING

which Gerald had not been told the
combination. Gerald wanted to
protest, but remained speechless.

  King Alfons then removed from
another box the Order of the
Peacock (Second Class) and placed
it over Gerald's shoulders. Gerald,
staring at the indifferent coloured
glass stones, hesitated for a few
moments before stumbling a pace
back, bowing, and then returning to
his place in the great dining room.
He did not hear the waves of
applause that accompanied him; his
only thought was how he could
possibly retrieve his lost chain
immediately the speeches were over.
He slumped down in the chair next
to his wife.

  "And now," continued the King, "I
wish to present a decoration that
has not been bestowed on anyone
since my late father's death. The
Order of the Peacock (First Class),
which it gives me special delight
to bestow on Her Majesty Queen
Elizabeth II."

  The Queen rose from her place as
the King's private secretary once
again stepped forward. In his hands
was held the same red leather case
that had snapped shut so firmly on
Gerald's unique possession. The
case was re-opened and the King
removed the magnificent Order from
the box and placed it on the
shoulders of the Queen. The jewels
sparkled in the candlelight and the
guests gasped at the sheer
magnificence of the piece.

  Gerald was the only person in the
room who knew its true value.

  "Well, you always said it was fit
for a monarch," his wife remarked
as she touched her string of
pearls.

111

        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  "Aye," said Gerald. "But what's
Ramsbottom going to say when he
sees this?" he added sadly,
fingering the Order of the Peacock
(Second Class). "He'll know it's
not the real thing."

"I don't see it matters that much,"
said Angela.

  "What do you mean, lass?" asked
Gerald. "I'll be the laughing stock
of Hull on Mayor-making day."

  "You should start reading the
evening papers, Gerald, and stop
looking in mirrors and then you'd
know Walter isn't going to be Mayor
this year."

"Not going to be Mayor?" repeated
Gerald.

  "No. The present Mayor has opted
to do a second term so Walter won't
be Mayor until next year."

"Is that right?" said Gerald with a
smile.

  "And if you're thinking what I
think you're thinking, Gerald
Haskins, this time it's going to
cost you a tiara."

JUST GOOD FRIENDS
-
                I
woke up before him
feeling slightly
randy but I knew
there was nothing I
could do about it.

  I blinked and my
eyes immediately
accustomed themselves
to the half light. I
raised my head and
gazed at the large
expanse of motionless
white flesh lying
next to me. If only
he took as much
exercise as I did he
wouldn't have that
spare lyre, I thought
unsympathetically.

  Roger stirred
restlessly and even
turned over to face
me, but I knew he
would not be fully
awake until the alarm
on his side of the
bed started ringing.
I pondered for a
moment whether I
could go back to
sleep again or should
get up and find
myself some breakfast
before he woke. In
the end I settled
forjust lying still
on my side
day-dreaming, but
making sure I didn't
disturb him. When he
did eventually open
his eyes I planned to
pretend I was still
asleep- that way he
would end up getting
breakfast for me. I
began to go over the
things that needed to
be done after he had
left for the of fice.
As long as I was at
home ready to greet
him when he

 -     115

        A TWIST IN THE TALE

returned from work, he didn't seem
to mind what I got up to during the
day.

  A gentle rumble emanated from his
side of the bed. Roger's snoring
never disturbed me. My affection for
him was unbounded, and I only wished
I could find the words to let him
know. In truth, he was the first man
I had really appreciated. As I gazed
at his unshaven face I was reminded
that it hadn't been his looks which
had attracted me in the pub that
night.

  I had first come across Roger in
the Cat and Whistle, a public house
situated on the corner of Mafeking
Road. You might say it was our
local. He used to come in around
eight, order a pint of mild and take
it to a small table in the corner of
the room just beyond the dartboard.
Mostly he would sit alone, watching
the darts being thrown towards
double top but more often settling
in one or five, if they managed to
land on the board at all. He never
played the game himself, and I often
wondered, from my vantage point
behind the bar, if he were fearful
of relinquishing his favourite seat
orjust had no interest in the sport.

  Then things suddenly changed for
Roger - for the better, was no doubt
how he saw it - when one evening in
early spring a blonde named
Madeleine, wearing an imitation fur
coat and drinking double gin and
its, perched on the stool beside
him. I had never seen her in the pub
before but she was obviously known
locally, and loose bar talk led me
to believe it couldn't last. You
see, word was about that she was
looking for someone whose horizons
stretched beyond the Cat and
Whistle.

In fact the affair - if that's what
it ever came to -

                116
                 
         JUST GOOD FRIENDS

lasted for only twenty days. I know
because I counted every one of
them. Then one night voices were
raised and heads turned as she left
the small stool just as suddenly as
she had come. His tired eyes
watched her walk to a vacant place
at the corner of the bar, but he
didn't show any surprise at her
departure and made no attempt to
pursue her.

  Her exit was my cue to enter. I
almost leapt from behind the bar
and, moving as quickly as dignity
allowed, was seconds later sitting
on the vacant stool beside him. He
didn't comment and certainly made
no attempt to offer me a drink, but
the one glance he shot in my
direction did not suggest he found
me an unacceptable replacement. I
looked around to see if anyone else
had plans to usurp my position. The
men standing round the dartboard
didn't seem to care. Treble
seventeen, twelve and a five kept
them more than occupied. I glanced
towards the bar to check if the
boss had noticed my absence, but he
was busy taking orders. I saw
Madeleine was already sipping a
glass of champagne from the pub's
only bottle, purchased by a
stranger whose stylish
double-breasted blazer and striped
bow tie convinced me she wouldn't
be bothering with Roger any longer.
She looked well set for at least
another twenty days.

  I looked up at Roger - I had known
his name for some time, although I
had never addressed him as such and
I couldn't be sure that he was
aware of mine. I began to flutter
my eyelashes in a rather
exaggerated way. I felt a little
stupid but at least it elicited a
gentle smile. He leaned over and
touched my cheek, his hands
surprisingly gentle. Neither of us
felt the need to speak. We were
both lonely and it

                117
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

seemed unnecessary to explain why.
We sat in silence, he occasionally
sipping his beer, I from time to
time rearranging my legs, while a
few feet from us the darts pursued
their undetermined course.

  When the publican cried, "Last
orders," Roger downed the remains of
his beer while the dart players
completed what had to be their final
game.

  No one commented when we left
together and I was surprised that
Roger made no protest as I
accompanied him back to his little
semi-detached. I already knew
exactly where he lived because I had
seen him on several occasions
standing at the bus queue in Dobson
Street in a silent line of reluctant
morning passengers. Once I even
positioned myself on a nearby wall
in order to study his features more
carefully. It was an anonymous,
almost commonplace face but he had
the warmest eyes and the kindest
smile I had observed in any man.

  My only anxiety was that he didn't
seem aware of my existence, just
constantly preoccupied, his eyes
each evening and his thoughts each
morning only for Madeleine. How I
envied that girl. She had everything
I wanted - except a decent fur coat,
the only thing my mother had left
me. In truth, I have no right to be
catty about Madeleine, as her past
couldn't have been more murky than
mine.

  All that had taken place well over
a year ago and, to prove my total
devotion to Roger, I have never
entered the Cat and Whistle since.
He seemed to have forgotten
Madeleine because he never once
spoke of her in front of me. An
unusual man, he didn't question me
about any of my past relationships
either.

                118
                 
         JUST GOOD FRIENDS

  Perhaps he should have. I would
have liked him to know the truth
about my life before we'd met,
though it all seems irrelevant now.
You see, I had been the youngest in
a family of four so I always came
last in line. I had never known my
father, and I arrived home one
night to discover that my mother
had run off with another man.
Tracy, one of my sisters, warned me
not to expect her back. She turned
out to be right, for I have never
seen my mother since that day. It's
awful to have to admit, if only to
oneself, that one's mother is a
tramp.

  Now an orphan, I began to drift,
often trying to stay one step ahead
of the law - not so easy when you
haven't always got somewhere to put
your head down. I can't even recall
how I ended up with Derek - if that
was his real name. Derek, whose
dark sensual looks would have
attracted any susceptible female,
told me that he had been on a
merchant steamer for the past three
years. When he made love to me I
was ready to believe anything. I
explained to him that all I wanted
was a warm home, regular food and
perhaps in time a family of my own.
He ensured that one of my wishes
was fulfilled, because a few weeks
after he left me I ended up with
twins, two girls. Derek never set
eyes on them: he had returned to
sea even before I could tell him I
was pregnant. He hadn't needed to
promise me the earth; he was so
good-looking he must have known I
would have been his just for a
night on the tiles.

  I tried to bring up the girls
decently, but the authorities
caught up with me this time and I
lost them both. I wonder where they
are now? God knows. I only hope
they've ended up in a good

                119
                 
         A TWIST IN THE TALE

home. At least they inherited
Derek's irresistible looks, which
can only help them through life.
It's just one more thing Roger will
never know about. His unquestioning
trust only makes me feel more
guilty, and now I never seem able to
find a way of letting him know the
truth.

  After Derek had gone back to sea I
was on my own for almost a year
before getting part-time work at the
Cat and Whistle. The publican was so
mean that he wouldn't have even
provided food and drink for me, if
I hadn't kept to my part of the
bargain.

  Roger used to come in about once,
perhaps twice a week before he met
the blonde with the shabby fur coat.
After that it was every night until
she upped and left him.

  I knew he was perfect for me the
first time I heard him order a pint
of mild. A pint of mild - I can't
think of a better description of
Roger. In those early days the
barmaids used to flirt openly with
him, but he didn't show any
interest. Until Madeleine latched on
to him I wasn't even sure that it
was women he preferred. Perhaps in
the end it was my androgynous looks
that appealed to him.

  I think I must have been the only
one in that pub who was looking for
something more permanent.

  And so Roger allowed me to spend
the night with him. I remember that
he slipped into the bathroom to
undress while I rested on what I
assumed would be my side of the bed.
Since that night he has never once
asked me to leave, let alone tried
to kick me out. It's an easy-going
relationship. I've never known him
raise his voice or scold me
unfairly. Forgive the cliche, but
for once I have fallen on my feet.

                 120
                  
         JUST GOOD FRIENDS

  Brr. Brr. Brr. That damned alarm.
I wished I could have buried it. The
noise would go on and on until at
last Roger decided to stir himself.
I once tried to stretch across him
and put a stop to its infernal
ringing, only ending up knocking the
contraption on to the floor, which
annoyed him even more than the
ringing. Never again, I concluded.
Eventually a long arm emerged from
under the blanket and a palm dropped
on to the top of the clock and the
awful din subsided. I'm a light
sleeper - the slightest movement
stirs me. If only he had asked me I
could have woken him far more gently
each morning. After all, my methods
are every bit as reliable as any
man-made contraption.

  Half awake, Roger gave me a brief
cuddle before kneading my back,
always guaranteed to elicit a smile.
Then he yawned, stretched and
declared as he did every morning,
"Must hurry along or I'll be late
for the office." I suppose some
females would have been annoyed by
the predictability of our morning
routine - but not this lady. It was
all part of a life that made me feel
secure in the belief that at last I
had found something worthwhile.

  Roger managed to get his feet into
the wrong slippers - always a
fifty-fifty chance - before
lumbering towards the bathroom. He
emerged fifteen minutes later, as he
always did, looking only slightly
better than he had when he entered.
I've learned to live with what some
would have called his foibles, while
he has learned to accept my mania
for cleanliness and a need to feel
secure.

  "Get up, lazy-bones," he
remonstrated but then only smiled
when I re-settled myself, refusing
to leave the warm hollow that had
been left by his body.

                121
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  "I suppose you expect me to get
your breakfast before I go to
work?" he added as he made his way
downstairs. I didn't bother to
reply. I knew that in a few
moments' time he would be opening
the front door, picking up the
morning newspaper, any mail, and
our regular pint of milk. Reliable
as ever, he would put on the
kettle, then head for the pantry,
fill a bowl with my
favouritebreakfast food and add my
portion of the milk, leaving
himselfjust enough for two cups of
coffee.

  I could anticipate almost to the
second when breakfast would be
ready. First I would hear the
kettle boil, a few moments later
the milk would be poured, then
finally there would be the sound of
a chair being pulled up. That was
the signal I needed to confirm it
was time for me to join him.

  I stretched my legs slowly,
noticing my nails needed some
attention. I had already decided
against a proper wash until after
he had left for the office. I could
hear the sound of the chair being
scraped along the kitchen lino. I
felt so happy that I literally
jumped off the bed before making my
way towards the open door. A few
seconds later I was downstairs.
Although he had already taken his
first mouthful of cornflakes he
stopped eating the moment he saw
me.

  "Good of you to join me," he said,
a grin spreading over his face.

  I padded over towards him and
looked up expectantly. He bent down
and pushed my bowl towards me. I
began to lap up the milk happily,
my tail swishing from side to side.

  It's a myth that we only swish our
tails when we're angry.

      THE STEAL

               ~
HRISTOPHER and
Margaret Roberts
always spent their
summer holiday as
far away from
England as they
could possibly
afford. However, as
Christopher was the
classics master at
St Cuthbert's, a
small preparatory
school just north of
Yeovil, and Margaret
was the school
matron, their
experience of four
of the five
continents was
largely confined to
periodicals such as
the Nalional
Geographic Magazine
and Time.

  The Roberts'
annual holiday each
August was
nevertheless
sacrosanct and they
spent eleven months
of the year saving,
planning and
preparing for their
one extravagant
luxury. The
following eleven
months were then
spent passing on
their discoveries to
the "offspring": the
Roberts, without
children of their
own, looked on all
the pupils of St
Cuthbert's as
"offspring".

  During the long
evenings when the
"offspring" were
meant to be asleep
in their
dormitories, the
Roberts would pore
over maps, analyse
expert opinion and
then finally come up
with a shortlist to
consider. In recent
expeditions they had
been as far

         125
          
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

afield as Norway, Northern Italy
and Yugoslavia, ending up the
previous year exploring Achilles'
island, Skyros, off the east coast
of Greece.

  "It has to be Turkey this year,"
said Christopher after much
soul-searching. A week later
Margaret came to the same
conclusion, and so they were able
to move on to Phase Two. Every book
on Turkey in the local library was
borrowed, consulted, reborrowed and
re-consulted. Every brochure
obtainable from the Turkish Embassy
or local travel agents received the
same relentless scrutiny.

  By the first day of the summer
term, charter tickets had been paid
for, a car hired, accommodation
booked and everything that could be
insured comprehensively covered.
Their plans lacked only one final
detail.

  "So what will be our 'steal' this
year?" asked Christopher.

  "A carpet," Margaret said, without
hesitation. "It has to be. For over
a thousand years Turkey has
produced the most sought-after
carpets in the world. We'd be
foolish to consider anything else."

"How much shall we spend on it?"

  "Five hundred pounds," said
Margaret, feeling very extravagant.

  Having agreed, they once again
swapped memories about the "steals"
they had made over the years. In
Norway, it had been a whale's tooth
carved in the shape of a galleon by
a local artist who soon after had
been taken up by Steuben. In
Tuscany, it had been a ceramic bowl
found in a small village where they
cast-and fired them to be sold in
Rome at exorbitant prices: a small
blemish which only an expert would
have noticed made it a

                126
                 
             THE STEAL

"steal". Just outside Skopje the
Roberts had visited a local glass
factory and acquired a water jug
moments after it had been blown in
front of their eyes, and in Skyros
they had picked up their greatest
triumph to date, a fragment of an
urn they discovered near an old
excavation site. The Roberts
reported their find immediately to
the authorities, but the Greek
officials had not considered the
fragment important enough to
prevent it being exported to St
Cuthbert's.

  On returning to England
Christopher couldn't resist just
checking with the senior classics
don at his old alma mater. He
confirmed the piece was probably
twelfth century. This latest
"steal" now stood, carefully
mounted, on their drawing room
mantelpiece.

  "Yes, a carpet would be perfect,"
Margaret mused. "The trouble is,
everyone goes to Turkey with the
idea of picking up a carpet on the
cheap. So to find a really good
one...."

  She knelt and began to measure the
small space in front of their
drawing room fireplace.

"Seven by three should do it," she
said.

  Within a few days of term ending,
the Roberts travelled by bus to
Heathrow. The journey took a little
longer than by rail but at half the
cost. "Money saved is money that
can be spent on the carpet,"
Margaret reminded her husband.

"Agreed, Matron," said Christopher,
laughing.

  On arrival at Heathrow they
checked their baggage on to the
charter flight, selected two non-
smoking seats and, finding they had
time to spare, decided to watch
other planes taking off to even
more exotic places.

                127
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  It was Christopher who first
spotted the two passengers dashing
across the tarmac, obviously late.

  "Look," he said, pointing at the
running couple. His wife studied
the overweight pair, still brown
from a previous holiday, as they
lumbered up the steps to their
plane.

  "Mr and Mrs Kendall-Hume,"
Margaret said in disbelief. After
hesitating for a moment, she added,
"I wouldn't want to be uncharitable
about any of the offspring, but I
do find young Malcolm Kendall-Hume
a . . ." She paused.

"'Spoilt little brat'?" suggested
her husband.

  "Quite," said Margaret. "I can't
begin to think what his parents
must be like."

  "Very successful, if the boy's
stories are to be believed," said
Christopher. "A string of second-
hand garages from Birmingham to
Bristol."

"Thank God they're not on our
flight."

  "Bermuda or the Bahamas would be
my guess," suggested Christopher.

  A voice emanating from the
loudspeaker gave Margaret no chance
to offer her opinion.

  "Olympic Airways Flight 172 to
Istanbul is now boarding at Gate
No. 37."

  "That's us," said Christopher
happily as they began their long
route-march to their departure
gate.

  They were the first passengers to
board, and once shown to their
seats they settled down to study
the guidebooks of Turkey and their
three files of research.

  "We must be sure to see Diana's
Temple when we visit Ephesus," said
Christopher, as the plane taxied
out on to the runway.

                128
                 
             THE STEAL

  "Not forgetting that at that time
we shall be only a few kilometres
away from the purported last home
of the Virgin Mary," added
Margaret.

  "Taken with a pinch of salt by
serious historians," Christopher
remarked as if addressing a member
of the Lower Fourth, but his wife
was too engrossed in her book to
notice. They both continued to
study on their own before
Christopher asked what his wife was
reading.

  "Carpets - Fact and Fiction by
Abdul Verizoglu -seventeenth
edition," she said, confident that
any errors would have been
eradicated in the previous sixteen.
"It's most informative. The finest
examples, it seems, are from Hereke
and are woven in silk and are
sometimes worked on by up to twenty
young women, even children, at a
time."

  "Why young?" pondered Christopher.
"You'd have thought experience
would have been essential for such
a delicate task."

  "Apparently not," said Margaret.
"Herekes are woven by those with
young eyes which can discern
intricate patterns sometimes no
larger than a pinpoint and with up
to nine hundred knots a square
inch. Such a carpet," continued
Margaret, "can cost as much as
fifteen, even twenty, thousand
pounds."

  "And at the other end of the
scale? Carpets woven in old
leftover wool by old leftover
women?" suggested Christopher,
answering his own question.

  "No doubt," said Margaret. "But
even for our humble purse there are
some simple guidelines to follow."

Christopher leaned over so that he
could be sure

               11?9
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

to take in every word above the roar
of the engines. "The muted reds and
blues with a green base are
considered classic and are much
admired by Turkish collectors, but
one should avoid the bright yellows
and oranges," read his wife aloud.
"And never consider a carpet that
displays animals, birds or fishes,
as they are produced only to satisfy
Western tastes."

"Don't they like animals?"

  "I don't think that's the point,"
said Margaret. "The Sunni Muslims,
who are the country's religious
rulers, don't approve of graven
images. But if we search diligently
round the bazaars we should still be
able to come across a bargain for a
few hundred pounds."

  "What a wonderful excuse to spend
all day in the bazaars."

  Margaret smiled, before
continuing. "But listen. It's most
important to bargain. The opening
price the dealer offers is likely to
be double what he expects to get and
treble what the carpet is worth."
She looked up from her book. "If
there's any bargaining to be done it
will have to be carried out by you,
my dear. They're not used to that
sort of thing at Marks & Spencer."

Christopher smiled.

 - "And finally," continued his
wife, turning a page of her book,
"if the dealer offers you coffee you
should accept. I t means he expects
the process to go on for some time
as he enjoys the bargaining as much
as the sale."

  "If that's the case they had
better have a very large pot
percolating for us," said
Christopher as he closed his eyes
and began to contemplate the

                130
                 
             THE STEAL

pleasures that awaited him. Margaret
only closed her books on carpets
when the plane touched down at
Istanbul airport, and at once opened
file Number One, entitled
"Pre-Turkey".

  "A shuttle bus should be waiting
for us at the north side of the
terminal. It will take us on to the
local flight," she assured her
husband as she carefully wound her
watch forward two hours.

  The Roberts were soon following
the stream of passengers heading in
the direction of passport control.
The first people they saw in front
of them were the same middle-aged
couple they had assumed were
destined for more exotic shores.

  "Wonder where they're heading,"
said Christopher.

  "Istanbul Hilton, I expect," said
Margaret as they climbed into a
vehicle that had been declared
redundant by the Glasgow Corporation
Bus Company some twenty years
before. It spluttered out black
exhaust fumes as it rewed up before
heading off in the direction of the
local THY flight.

  The Roberts soon forgot all about
Mr and Mrs Kendall-Hume once they
looked out of the little aeroplane
windows to admire the west coast of
Turkey highlighted by the setting
sun. The plane landed in the port of
Izmir just as the shimmering red
ball disappeared behind the highest
hill. Another bus, even older than
the earlier one, ensured that the
Roberts reached their little guest
house just in time for late supper.

  Their room was tiny but clean and
the owner much in the same mould. He
greeted them both with exaggerated
gesturing and a brilliant smile
which augured well for the next
twenty-one days.

                131
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

Early the following morning, the
Roberts checked over their detailed
plans for Day One in file Number
Two. They were first to collect the
rented Fiat that had already been
paid for in England, before driving
off into the hills to the ancient
Byzantine fortress at Selcuk in the
morning, to be followed by the
Temple of Diana in the afternoon if
they still had time.

  After breakfast had been cleared
away and they had cleaned their
teeth, the Roberts left the guest
house a few minutes before nine.
Armed with their hire car form and
guidebook, they headed off for
Beyazik's Garage where their
promised car awaited them. They
strolled down the cobbled streets
past the little white houses,
enjoying the sea breeze until they
reached the bay. Christopher
spotted the sign for Beyazik's
Garage when it was still a hundred
yards ahead of them.

  As they passed the magnificent
yachts moored alongside the
harbour, they tested each other on
the nationality of each flag,
feeling not unlike the "offspring"
completing a geography test.

  "Italian, French, Liberian,
Panamanian, German. There aren't
many British boats," said
Christopher, sounding unusually
patriotic, the way he always did,
Margaret reflected, the moment they
were abroad.

  She stared at the rows of gleaming
hulls lined up like buses in
Piccadilly during the rush hour;
some ofthe boats were even bigger
than buses. "I wonder what kind of
people can possibly afford such
luxury?" she asked, not expecting a
reply.

  "Mr and Mrs Roberts, isn't it?"
shouted a voice from behind them.
They both turned to see a

                132
                 
             THE STEAL

now-familiar figure dressed in a
white shirt and white shorts,
wearing a hat that made him look
not unlike the "Bird's Eye"
captain, waving at them from the
bow of one of the bigger yachts.

  "Climb on board, me hearties," Mr
KendallHume declared
enthusiastically, more in the
manner of a command than an
invitation.

  Reluctantly the Roberts walked the
gangplank.

  "Look who's here," their host
shouted down a large hole in the
middle of the deck. A moment later
Mrs Kendall-Hume appeared from
below, dressed in a diaphanous
orange sarong and a matching bikini
top. "It's Mr and Mrs Roberts - you
remember, from Malcolm's school."

  Kendall-Hume turned back to face
the dismayed couple. "I don't
remember your first names, but this
is Melody and I'm Ray."

  "Christopher and Margaret," the
schoolmaster admitted as handshakes
were exchanged.

"What about a drink? Gin, vodka or
. . . ?"

  "Oh, no," said Margaret. "Thank
you very much, we'll both have an
orange juice."

  "Suit yourselves," said Ray
Kendall-Hume. "You must stay for
lunch."

"But we couldn't impose . . ."

  "I insist," said Mr Kendall-Hume.
"After all, we're on holiday. By
the way, we'll be going over to the
other side of the bay for lunch.
There's one hell of a beach there,
and it will give you a chance to
sunbathe and swim in peace."

"How considerate of you," said
Christopher.

  "And where's young Malcolm?" asked
Margaret.

                 1
                 
         ATWISTIN THE TALK

  "He's on a scouting holiday in
Scotland. Doesn't like to mess
about in boats the way we do."

  For the first time he could recall
Christopher felt some admiration
for the boy. A moment later the
engine started thunderously.

  On the trip across the bay, Ray
Kendall-Hume expounded his theories
about "having to get away from it
all". "Nothing like a yacht to
ensure your privacy and not having
to mix with the hoi polloi." He
only wanted the simple things in
life: the sun, the sea and an
infinite supply of good food and
drink.

  The Roberts could have asked for
nothing less. By the end of the day
they were both suffering from a
mild bout of sunstroke and were
also feeling a little seasick.
Despite white pills, red pills and
yellow pills, liberally supplied by
Melody, when they finally got back
to their room that night they were
unable to sleep.

Avoiding the Kendall-Humes over the
next twenty days did not prove
easy. Beyazik's, the garage where
their little hire car awaited them
each morning and to which it had to
be returned each night, could only
be reached via the quayside where
the Kendall-Humes' motor yacht was
moored like an insuperable barrier
at a gymkhana. Hardly a day passed
that the Roberts did not have to
spend some part of their precious
time bobbing up and down on
Turkey's choppy coastal waters,
eating oily food and discussing how
large a carpet would be needed to
fill the Kendall-Humes' front room.

  However, they still managed to
complete a large part of their
programme and determinedly set
aside

                134
                 
              THE STEAL

the whole ofthe last day ofthe
holiday in their quest for a carpet.
As they did not need Beyazik's car
to go into town, they felt confident
that for that day at least they
could safely avoid their tormentors.

  On the final morning they rose a
little later than planned and after
breakfast strolled down the tiny
cobbled path together, Christopher
in possession of the seventeenth
edition of Carpets - Fact and
Fiction, Margaret with a tape
measure and five hundred pounds in
travellers' cheques.

  Once the schoolmaster and his wife
had reached the bazaar they began to
look around a myriad of little
shops, wondering where they should
begin their adventure. Fez-topped
men tried to entice them to enter
their tiny emporiums but the Roberts
spent the first hour simply taking
in the atmosphere.

  "I'm ready to start the search
now," shouted Margaret above the
babble of voices around her.

  "Then we've found you just in
time," said the one voice they
thought they had escaped.

"We were just about to -"

"Then follow me."

  The Roberts' hearts sank as they
were led by Ray Kendall-Hume out of
the bazaar and back towards the
town.

  "Take my advice, and you'll end up
with one hell of a bargain,"
Kendall-Hume assured them both.
"I've picked up some real beauties
in my time from every corner of the
globe at prices you wouldn't
believe. I am happy to let you take
full advantage of my expertise at no
extra charge."

  "I don't know how you could stand
the noise and smell of that bazaar,"
said Melody, obviously glad

                 155
                  
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

to be back among the familiar signs
of Gucci, Lacoste and Saint
Laurent.

"We rather like . . ."

  "Rescued in the nick oftime," said
Ray KendallHume. "And the place I'm
told you have to start and finish
at if you want to purchase a
serious carpet is Osman's."

  Margaret recalled the name from
her carpet book: "Only to be
visited if money is no object and
you know exactly what you are
looking for." The vital last
morning was to be wasted, she
reflected as she pushed open the
large glass doors of Osman's to
enter a ground-floor area the size
of a tennis court. The room was
covered in carpets on the floor,
the walls, the windowsills, and
even the tables. Anywhere a carpet
could be laid out, a carpet was
there to be seen. Although the
Roberts realised immediately that
nothing on show could possibly be
in their price range, the sheer
beauty of the display entranced
them.

  Margaret walked slowly round the
room, mentally measuring the small
carpets so she could anticipate the
sort of thing they might look for
once they had escaped.

  A tall, elegant man, hands raised
as if in prayer and dressed
immaculately in a tailored worsted
suit that could have been made in
Savile Row, advanced to greet them.

  "Good morning, sir," he said to Mr
KendallHume, selecting the serious
spender without difficulty. "Can I
be of assistance?"

  "You certainly can," replied
Kendall-Hume. "I want to be shown
your finest carpets, but I do not
intend to pay your finest prices."

                136
                 
             THE STEAL

  The dealer smiled politely and
clapped his hands. Six small
carpets were brought in by three
assistants who rolled them out in
the centre of the room. Margaret
fell in love with a muted green-
based carpet with a pattern of tiny
red squares woven around the
borders. The pattern was so
intricate she could not take her
eyes off it. She measured the
carpet out of interest: seven by
three exactly.

  "You have excellent taste, madam,"
said the dealer. Margaret,
colouring slightly, quickly stood
up, took a pace backwards and hid
the tape measure behind her back.

  "How do you feel about that lot,
pet?" asked Kendall-Hume, sweeping
a hand across the six carpets.

  "None of them are big enough,"
Melody replied, giving them only a
fleeting glance.

  The dealer clapped his hands a
second time and the exhibits were
rolled up and taken away. Four
larger ones soon replaced them.

  "Would you care for some coffee?"
the dealer asked Mr Kendall-Hume as
the new carpets lay unfurled at
their feet.

  "Haven't the time," said
Kendall-Hume shortly. "Here to buy
a carpet. If I want a coffee, I can
always go to a coffee shop," he
said with a chuckle. Melody smiled
her complicity.

  "Well, I would like some coffee,"
declared Margaret, determined to
rebel at some point on the holiday.

  "Delighted, madam," said the
dealer, and one of the assistants
disappeared to carry out her wishes
while the Kendall-Humes studied the
new carpets.

                137
                 
A TWIST IN THE TALE

. _

The coffee arrived a few moments
later. She thanked the young
assistant and began to sip the thick
black liquid slowly. Delicious, she
thought, and smiled her
acknowledgment to the dealer.

  "Still not large enough," Mrs
Kendall-Hume insisted. The dealer
gave a slight sigh and clapped his
hands yet again. Once more the
assistants began to roll up the
rejected goods. He then addressed
one of his staffin Turkish. The
assistant looked doubtfully at his
mentor but the dealer gave a firm
nod and waved him away. The
assistant returned a little later
with a small platoon of lesser
assistants carrying two carpets,
both of which when unfolded took up
most of the shop floor. Margaret
liked them even less than the ones
she had just been shown, but as her
opinion was not sought she did not
offer it.

  "That's more like it," said Ray
Kendall-Hume. "Just about the right
size for the lounge, wouldn't you
say, Melody?"

  "Perfect," his wife replied, making
no attempt to measure either of the
carpets.

  "I'm glad we agree," said Ray
Kendall-Hume. "But which one, my
pet? The faded red and blue, or the
bright yellow and orange?"

  "The yellow and orange one," said
Melody without hesitation. "I like
the pattern of brightly coloured
birds running round the outside."
Christopher thought he saw the
dealer wince.

  "So now all we have left to do is
agree on a price," said
Kendall-Hume. "You'd better sit
down, pet, as this may take a
while."

  "I hope not," said Mrs
Kendall-Hume, resolutely standing.
The Roberts remained mute.

                 138
                  
              THE STEAL

  "Unfortunately, sir," began the
dealer, "your wife has selected one
of the finest carpets in our
collection and so I fear there can
be little room for any
re-adjustment."

"How much?" said Kendall-Hume.

  "You see, sir, this carpet was
woven in Demirdji, in the province
of Izmir, by over a hundred seam-
stresses and it took them more than
a year to complete."

  "Don't give me that baloney," said
KendallHume, winking at Christopher.
"Just tell me how much I'm expected
to pay."

  "I feel it my duty to point out,
sir, that this carpet shouldn't be
here at all," said the Turk
plaintively. "It was originally made
for an Arab prince who failed to
complete the transaction when the
price of oil collapsed."

  "But he must have agreed on a
price at the time?"

  "I cannot reveal the exact figure,
sir. It embarrasses me to mention
it."

  "It wouldn't embarrass me," said
KendallHume. "Come on, what's the
price?" he insisted.

  "Which currency would you prefer
to trade in?" the Turk asked.

"Pounds."

  The dealer removed a slim
calculator from his jacket pocket,
programmed some numbers into it,
then looked unhappily towards the
KendallHumes.

  Christopher and Margaret remained
silent, like schoolchildren fearing
the headmaster might ask them a
question to which they could not
possibly know the answer.

                 139
                  
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  "Come on, come on, how much were
you hoping to sting me for?"

  "I think you must prepare yourself
for a shock, sir," said the dealer.

  "How much?" repeated Kendall-Hume,
impatiently.

"Twenty-five thousand."

'iPounds?"

"Pounds."

  "You must be joking," said
Kendall-Hume, walking round the
carpet and ending up standing next
to Margaret. "You're about to find
out why I'm considered the scourge
of the East Midlands car trade," he
whispered to her. "I wouldn't pay
more than fifteen thousand for that
carpet." He turned back to nice the
dealer. "Even if my life depended
on it."

  "Then I fear your time has been
wasted, sir," the Turk replied.
"For this is a carpet intended only
for the cognoscenti. Perhaps madam might
reconsider the red and blue?"

  "Certainly not," said
Kendall-Hume. "The colour's all
faded. Can't you see? You obviously
left it in the window too long, and
the sun has got at it. No, you'll
have to reconsider your price if
you want the orange and yellow one
to end up in the home of a
connoisseur."

  The dealer sighed as his fingers
tapped the calculator again.

  While the transaction continued,
Melody looked on vacantly,
occasionally gazing out of the
window towards the bay.

  "I could not drop a penny below
twenty-three thousand pounds."

                140
                 
             THE STEAL

  "I'd be willing to go as high as
eighteen thousand," said
Kendall-Hume, "but not a penny
more."

  The Roberts watched the dealer tap
the numbers into the calculator.

  "That would not even cover the
cost of what I paid for it myself,"
he said sadly, staring down at the
little glowing figures.

  "You're pushing me, but don't push
me too far. Nineteen thousand,"
said Mr Kendall-Hume. "That's my
final offer."

  "Twenty thousand pounds is the
lowest figure I could consider,"
replied the dealer. "A give-away
price on my mother's grave."

  Kendall-Hume took out his wallet
and placed it on the table by the
side of the dealer.

  "Nineteen thousand pounds and
you've got yourself a deal," he
said.

  "But how will I feed my children?"
asked the dealer, his arms raised
above his head.

  "The same way I feed mine," said
KendallHume, laughing. "By making a
fair profit."

  The dealer paused as if
re-considering, then said, "I can't
do it, sir. I'm sorry. We must show
you some other carpets." The
assistants came forward on cue.

  "No, that's the one I want," said
Mrs KendallHume. "Don't quarrel
over a thousand pounds, pet."

  "Take my word for it, madam," the
dealer said, turning towards Mrs
Kendall-Hume. "My family would
starve if we only did business with
customers like your husband."

  "Okay, you get the twenty
thousand, but on one condition."

                141
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

"Condition?"

  "My receipt must show that the
bill was for ten thousand pounds.
Otherwise I'll only end up paying
the difference in customs duty."

  The dealer bowed low as if to
indicate he did not find the
request an unusual one.

  Mr Kendall-Hume opened his wallet
and withdrew ten thousand pounds in
travellers' cheques and ten
thousand pounds in cash.

  "As you can see," he said,
grinning, "I came prepared." He
removed another five thousand
pounds and, waving it at the
dealer, added, "and I would have
been willing to pay far more."

  The dealer shrugged. "You drive a
hard bargain, sir. But you will not
hear me complain now the deal has
been struck."

  The vast carpet was folded,
wrapped and a receipt for ten
thousand pounds made out while the
travellers' cheques and cash were
paid over.

  The Roberts had not uttered a word
for twenty minutes. When they saw
the cash change hands it crossed
Margaret's mind that it was more
money than the two of them earned
in a year.

  "Time to get back to the yacht,"
said KendallHume. "Dojoin us for
lunch if you choose a carpet in
time."

  "Thank you," said the Roberts in
unison. They waited until the
Kendall-Humes were out of sight,
two assistants bearing the-orange
and yellow carpet in their wake,
before they thanked the dealer for
the coffee and in turn began to
make their move towards the door.

  "What sort of carpet were you
looking for?" asked the dealer.

                142
                 
             THE STEAL

  "I fear your prices are way beyond
us," said Christopher politely.
"But thank you."

  "Well, let me at least find out.
Have you or your wife seen a carpet
you liked?"

  "Yes," replied Margaret, "the
small carpet, but . . ."

  "Ah, yes," said the dealer. "I
remember madam's eyes when she saw
the Hereke."

  He left them, to return a few
moments later with the little
soft-toned, green-based carpet with
the tiny red squares that the
Kendall-Humes had so firmly
rejected. Not waiting for
assistance he rolled it out himself
for the Roberts in inspect more
carefully.

  Margaret thought it looked even
more magnificent the second time
and feared that she could never
hope to find its equal in the few
hours left to them.

"Perfect," she admitted, quite
unashamedly.

  "Then we have only the price to
discuss," said the dealer kindly.
"How much were you wanting to
spend, madam?"

  "We had planned to spend three
hundred pounds," said Christopher,
jumping in. Margaret was unable to
hide her surprise.

"But we agreed -" she began.

  "Thank you, my dear, I think I
should deal with this matter."

  The dealer smiled and returned to
the bargaining.

  "I would have to charge you six
hundred pounds," he said. "Anything
less would be mbbery."

"Four hundred pounds is my final
offer," said

                143
                 
A TWIST IN THE TALE

.

Christopher, trying to sound in
control.

  "Five hundred pounds would have to
be my bottom price," said the
dealer.

"I'll take it!" cried Christopher.

  An assistant began waving his arms
and talking to the dealer noisily in
his native tongue. The owner raised
a hand to dismiss the young man's
protests, while the Roberts looked
on anxiously.

  "My son," explained the dealer,
"is not happy with the arrangement,
but I am delighted that the little
carpet will reside in the home of a
couple who will so obviously
appreciate its true worth."

"Thank you," said Christopher
quietly.

"Will you also require a bill of a
different price?"

  "No, thank you," said Christopher,
handing over ten fifty-pound notes
and then waiting until the carpet
was wrapped and he was presented
with the correct receipt.

  As he watched the Roberts leave
his shop clinging on to their
purchase, the dealer smiled to
himself.

  When they arrived at the quayside,
the KendallHumes' boat was already
half way across the bay heading
towards the quiet beach. The Roberts
sighed their combined relief and
returned to the bazaar for lunch.

It was while they were waiting for
their baggage to appear on the
carousel at Heathrow Airport that
Christopher felt a tap on his
shoulder. He turned round to face a
beaming Ray Kendall-Hume.

"I wonder if you could do mesa
favour, old boy?"

"I will if I can," said Christopher,
who still

                 1H
                  
             THE STEAL
had not fully recovered from their
last encounter.

  "It's simple enough," said
Kendall-Hume. "The old girl and I
have brought back far too many
presents and I wondered if you could
take one of them through customs.
Otherwise we're likely to be held up
all night."

  Melody, standing behind an already
laden trolley, smiled at the two men
benignly.

  "You would still have to pay any
duty that was due on it," said
Christopher firmly.

  "I wouldn't dream of doing
otherwise," said Kendall-Hume,
struggling with a massive package
before pushing it on the Roberts'
trolley. Christopher wanted to
protest as Kendall-Hume peeled off
two thousand pounds and handed the
money and the receipt over to the
schoolmaster.

  "What do we do if they claim your
carpet is worth a lot more than ten
thousand pounds?" asked Margaret
anxiously, coming to stand by her
husband's side.

  "Pay the difference and I'll
refund you immediately. But I assure
you it's most unlikely to arise."

"I hope you're right."

  "Of course I'm right," said
Kendall-Hume. "Don't worry, I've
done this sort of thing before. And
I won't forget your help when it
comes to the next school appeal," he
added, leaving them with the huge
parcel.

  Once Christopher and Margaret had
located their own bags, they
collected the second trolley and
took their place in the red
"Something to Declare" queue.

"Are you in possession of any items
over five

                 145
                  
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

hundred pounds in value?" asked the
young customs official politely.

  "Yes," said Christopher. "We
purchased two carpets when we were
on holiday in Turkey." He handed
over the two bills.

  The customs official studied the
receipts carefully, then asked if
he might be allowed to see the
carpets for himself.

  "Certainly," said Christopher, and
began the task of undoing the
larger package while Margaret
worked on the smaller one.

  "I shall need to have these looked
at by an expert," said the official
once the parcels were unwrapped.
"It shouldn't take more than a few
minutes." The carpets were soon
taken away.

  The "few minutes" turned out to be
over fifteen and Christopher and
Margaret were soon regretting their
decision to assist the
Kendall-Humes, whatever the needs
of the school appeal. They began to
indulge in irrelevant small-talk
that wouldn't have fooled the most
amateur of sleuths.

At last the customs official
returned.

  "I wonder if you would be kind
enough to have a word with my
colleague in private?" he asked.

  "Is that really necessary?" asked
Christopher, reddening.

"I'm afraid so, sir."

  "We shouldn't have agreed to it in
the first place," whispered
Margaret. "We've never been in any
trouble with the authorities
before."

  "Don't fret, dear. It will be all
over in a few minutes, you'll see,"
said Christopher, not sure that he
believed his own words. They
followed the young man out through
the back and into a small room.

                146
                 
             THE STEAL

  "Good afternoon, sir," said a
white-haired man with several gold
rings around the cuffofhis sleeve.
"I am sorry to have kept you
waiting but we have had your
carpets looked at by our expert and
he feels sure a mistake must have
been made."

  Christopher wanted to protest but
he couldn't get a word out.

"A mistake?" managed Margaret.

  "Yes, madam. The bills you
presented don't make any sense to
him."

"Don't make any sense?"

  "No, madam," said the senior
customs officer. "I repeat, we feel
certain a mistake has been made."

  "What kind of mistake?" asked
Christopher, at last finding his
voice.

  "Well, you have come forward and
declared two carpets, one at a
price of ten thousand pounds and
one at a price of five hundred
pounds, according to these
receipts."

"Yes?"

  "Every year hundreds of people
return to England with Turkish
carpets, so we have some experience
in these matters. Our adviser feels
certain that the bills have been
incorrectly made out."

  "I don't begin to understand . .
." said Christopher.

  "Well," explained the senior
officer, "the large carpet, we are
assured, has been spun with a crude
distaff and has only two hundred
ghiordes, or knots, per square
inch. Despite its size we estimate
it to be valued around five
thousand pounds. The small carpet,
on the other hand, we estimate to
have nine hundred knots per square
inch and is a fine example of a
silk hand-woven traditional

                147
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

Herekeand undoubtedly would have
been a bargain at five thousand
pounds. As both carpets come from
the same shop, we assume it must be
a clerical error."

The Roberts remained speechless.

  "It doesn't make any difference to
the duty you will have to pay, but
we felt sure you would want to
know, for insurance purposes."

Still the Roberts said nothing.

  "As you're allowed five hundred
pounds before paying any duty, the
excise will still be two thousand
pounds."

  Christopher quickly handed over
the KendallHumes' wad of notes. The
senior officer counted them while
his junior carefully re-wrapped the
two carpets.

  "Thank you," said Christopher, as
they were handed back the parcels
and a receipt for the two thousand
pounds.

  The Roberts quickly bundled the
large package on to its trolley
before wheeling it through the
concourse and on to the pavement
outside where the Kendall-Humes
impatiently awaited them.

  "You were in there a long time,"
said KendallHume. "Any problems?"

  "No, they were just assessing the
value of the carpets."

  "Any extra charge?" Kendall-Hume
asked apprehensively.

  "No, your two thousand pounds
covered everything," said
Christopher, passing over the
receipt.

  "Then we got away with it, old
fellow. Well done. One hell of a
bargain to add to my collection."
Kendall-Hume turned to bundle the
large package

                148
                 
             THE STEAL

into the boot of his Mercedes
before locking it and taking his
place behind the steering wheel.
"Well done," he repeated through
the open window, as the car drove
off. "I won't forget the school
appeal."

  The Roberts stood and watched as
the silver grey car joined a line
of traffic leaving the airport.

  "Why didn't you tell Mr
Kendall-Hume the real value of his
carpet?" asked Margaret once they
were seated in the bus.

  "I did give it some considerable
thought but I came to the
conclusion that the troth was the
last thing Kendall-Hume wanted to
be told."

  "But don't you feel any guilt?
After all, we've stolen "

  "Not at all, my dear. We haven't
stolen anything. But we did get one
hell of a 'steal'."

                149
                 
Colonel
BullTros

  COLONEL BULLFROG

               THERE
is one cathedral in
England that has
never found it
necessary to launch
a national appeal.

When the Colonel
woke he found
himself tied to a
stake where the
ambush had taken
place. He could feel
a numb sensation in
his leg. The last
thing he could
recall was the
bayonet entering his
thigh. All he was
aware of now were
ants crawling up the
leg on an endless
march towards the
wound.

  It would have been
better to have
remained
unconscious, he
decided.

  Then someone undid
the knots and he
collapsed head first
into the mud. It
would be better
still to be dead, he
concluded. The
Colonel somehow got
to his knees and
crawled over to the
stake next to him.
Tied to it was a
corporal who must
have been dead for
several hours. Ants
were crawling into
his mouth. The
Colonel tore off a
strip from the man's
shirt, washed it in
a large puddle
nearby and cleaned
the wound in his leg
as best he could
before binding it
tightly.

153

        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  That was February 1 7th, 1943, a
date that would be etched on the
Colonel's memory for the rest of
his life.

  That same morning theJapanese
received orders that the newly
captured Allied prisoners were to
be moved at dawn. Many were to die
on the march and even more had
perished before the trek began.
Colonel Richard Moore was
determined not to be counted among
them.

  Twenty-nine days later, one
hundred and seventeen of the
original seven hundred and
thirty-two Allied troops reached
Tonchan. Any man whose travels had
previously not taken him beyond
Rome could hardly have been
prepared for such an experience as
Tonchan. This heavily guarded
prisoner-of-war camp, some three
hundred miles north of Singapore
and hidden in the deepest
equatorial jungle, offered no
possibility of freedom. Anyone who
contemplated escape could not hope
to survive in the jungle for more
than a few days, while those who
remained discovered the odds were
not a lot shorter.

  When the Colonel first arrived,
Major Sakata, the camp commandant,
informed him that he was the senior
ranking officer and would therefore
be held responsible for the welfare
of all Allied troops.

  Colonel Moore had stared down at
theJapanese officer. Sakata must
have been a foot shorter than
himself but after that
twenty-eight-day march the British
soldier couldn't have weighed much
more than the diminutive Major.

  Moore's first act on leaving the
commandant's office was to call
together all the Allied officers.
He discovered there was a good
cross-section from

                154
                 
         COLONEL BULLFROG

Britain, Australia, New Zealand and
America but few could have been
described as fit. Men were dying
daily from malaria, dysentery and
malnutrition. He was suddenly aware
what the expression "dying like
flies" meant.

  The Colonel learned from his staff
of ricers that for the previous two
years of the camp's existence they
had been ordered to build bamboo
huts for the Japanese officers.
These had had to be completed
before they had been allowed to
start on a hospital for their own
men and only recently huts for
themselves. Many prisoners had died
during those two years, not from
illness but from the atrocities
some Japanese perpetrated on a
daily basis. Major Sakata, known
because of his skinny arms as
"Chopsticks", was, however, not
considered to be the villain. His
second-in-command, Lieutenant
Takasaki (the Undertaker), and
Sergeant Ayut (the Pig) were of a
different mould and to be avoided
at all cost, his men warned him.

  It took the Colonel only a few
days to discover why.

  He decided his first task was to
try to raise the battered morale of
his troops. As there was no padre
among those of ricers who had been
captured he began each day by
conducting a short service of
prayer. Once the service was over
the men would start work on the
railway that ran alongside the
camp. Each arduous day consisted of
laying tracks to help Japanese
soldiers get to the front more
quickly soithey could in turn kill
and capture more Allied troops. Any
prisoner suspected of undermining
this work was found guilty of
sabotage and put to death without
trial. Lieutenant Takasalci

                155
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

considered taking an unscheduled
five-minuec break to be sabotage.

  At lunch prisoners were allowed
twenty minutes off to share a bowl
of rice - usually with maggots
-and, if they were lucky, a mug of
water. Although the men returned to
the camp each night exhausted, the
Colonel still set about organising
squads to be responsible for the
cleanliness of their huts and the
state of the latrines.

  After only a few months, the
Colonel was able to organise a
football match between the British
and the Americans, and following
its success even set up a camp
league. But he was even more
delighted when the men turned up
for karate lessons under Sergeant
Hawke, a thick-set Australian, who
had a Black Belt and for good
measure also played the
mouth-organ. The tiny instrument
had survived the march through the
jungle but everyone assumed it
would be discovered before long and
confiscated.

  Each day Moore renewed his
determination not to allow the
Japanese to believe for one moment
that the Allies were beaten -
despite the fact that while he was
at Tonchan he lost another twenty
pounds in weight, and at least one
man under his command every day.

  To the Colonel's surprise the camp
commandant, despite the Japanese
national belief that any soldier
who allowed himself to be captured
ought to be treated as a deserter,
did not place too many unnecessary
obstacles in his path.

  "You are like the British
Bullfrog," Major Sakata suggested
one evening as he watched the
Colonel carving cricket bails out
of bamboo. It was

                156
                 
         COLONEL BULLFROG

one of the rare occasions when the
Colonel managed a smile.

  His real problems continued to
come from Lieutenant Takasaki and
his henchmen, who considered
captured Allied prisoners fit only
to be considered as traitors.
Takasaki was always careful how he
treated the Colonel personally, but
felt no such reservations when
dealing with the other ranks, with
the result that Allied soldiers
often ended up with their meagre
rations confiscated, a rifle butt
in the stomach, or even left bound
to a tree for days on end.

  Whenever the Colonel made an
official complaint to the
commandant, Major Sakata listened
sympathetically and even made an
effort to weed out the main
offenders. Moore's happiest moment
at Tonchan was to witness the
Undertaker and the Pig boarding the
train for the front line. No one
attempted to sabotage that journey.
The commandant replaced them with
Sergeant Akida and Corporal Sushi,
known by the prisoners almost
affectionately as "Sweet and Sour
Pork". However, the Japanese High
Command sent a new Number Two to
the camp, a Lieutenant Osawa, who
quickly became known as "The Devil"
since he perpetrated atrocities
that made the Undertaker and the
Pig look like church fete
organisers.

  As the months passed the Colonel
and the commandant's mutual respect
grew. Sakata even confided to his
English prisoner that he had
requested that he be sent to the
front line and join the real war.
"And if," the Major added, "the
High Command grants my request,
there will be only two NCOs I would
want to accompany me."

                157
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  Colonel Moore knew the Major had
Sweet and Sour Pork in mind, and
was fearful what might become of
his men if the only three Japanese
he could work with were posted back
to active duties to leave
Lieutenant Osawa in command of the
camp.

Colonel Moore realised that
something quite extraordinary must
have taken place for Major Sakata
to come to his hut, because he had
never done so before. The Colonel
put his bowl of rice back down on
the table and asked the three
Allied officers who were sharing
breakfast with him to wait outside.

The Major stood to attention and
saluted.

  The Colonel pushed himself to his
full six feet, returned the salute
and stared down into Sakata's eyes.

  "The war is over," said
theJapanese officer. For a
briefmoment Moore feared the worst.
"Japan has surrendered
unconditionally. You, sir," Sakata
said quietly, "are now in command
of the camp."

  The Colonel immediately ordered
all Japanese officers to be placed
under arrest in the commandant's
quarters. While his orders were
being carried out he personally
went in search of The Devil. Moore
marched across the parade ground
and headed towards the officers'
quarters. He located the
second-in-command's hut, walked up
the steps and threw open Osawa's
door. The sight that met the new
commandant's eyes was one he would
never forget. The Colonel had read
of ceremonial hara-kiri without any
real idea of what the final act
consisted. Lieutenant Osawa must
have cut himself

                158
                 
         COLONEL BULLFROG

a hundred times before he
eventually died. The blood, the
stench and the sight of the
mutilated body would have caused a
Gurkha to be sick. Only the head
was there to confirm that the
remains had once belonged to a
human being.

  The Colonel ordered Osawa to be
buried outside the gates of the
camp.

When the surrender of Japan was
finally signed on board the US
Missouri in Tokyo Bay, all at
Tonchan PoW camp listened to the
ceremony on the single camp radio.
Colonel Moore then called a full
parade on the camp square. For the
first time in two and a half years
he wore his dress uniform which
made him look like a pierrot who
had turned up at a formal party. He
accepted the Japanese flag of
surrender from Major Sakata on
behalf of the Allies, then made the
defeated enemy raise the American
and British flags to the sound of
both national anthems played in
turn by Sergeant Hawke on his
mouth-organ.

  The Colonel then held a short
service of thanksgiving which he
conducted in the presence of all
the Allied and Japanese soldiers.

Once command had changed hands
Colonel Moore waited as week
followed pointless week for news
that he would be sent home. Many of
his men had been given their orders
to start the tenthousand-mile
journey back to England via Bangkok
and Calcutta, but no such orders
came for the Colonel and he waited
in vain to be sent his repatriation
papers.

Then, in January 1946, a smartly
dressed young

                159
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

Guards officer arrived at the camp
with orders to see the Colonel. He
was conducted to the commandant's
office and saluted before shaking
hands. Richard Moore stared at the
young captain who, from his healthy
complexion, had obviously arrived
in the Far East long after
theJapanese had surrendered. The
captain handed over a letter to the
Colonel.

  "Home at last," said the older man
breezily, as he ripped open the
envelope, only to discover that it
would be years before he could hope
to exchange the paddy fields of
Tonchan for the green fields of
Lincolushire.

  The letter requested that the
Colonel.travel to Tokyo and
represent Britain on the
forthcoming war tribunal which was
to be conducted in the Japanese
capital. Captain Ross of the
Coldstream Guards would take over
his command at Tonchan.

The tribunal was to consist of
twelve officers under the
chairmanship of General Matthew
Tomkins. Moore was to be the sole
British representative and was to
report directly to the General, "as
soon as you find it convenient".
Further details would be supplied
to him on his arrival in Tokyo. The
letter ended: "If for any reason
you should require my help in your
deliberations, do not hesitate to
contact me personally." There
followed the signature of Clement
Attlee.

  Staff officers are not in the
habit of disobeying Prime
Ministers, so the Colonel resigned
himselfto a prolonged stay in
Japan.

  It took several months to set up
the tribunal and during that time
Colonel Moore continued

                160
                 
         COLONEL BULLFROG

supervising the return of British
troops to their homeland. The
paperwork was endless and some of
the men under his command were so
frail that he found it necessary to
build them up spiritually as well
as physically before he could put
them on boats to their various
destinations. Some died long after
the declaration of surrender had
been ratified.

  During this period of waiting,
Colonel Moore used Major Sakata and
the two NCOs in whom he had placed
so much trust, Sergeant Akidaand
Corporal Sushi, as his liaison
officers. This sudden change of
command did not affect the
relationship between the two senior
officers, although Sakata admitted
to the Colonel that he wished he
had been killed in the defence of
his country and not left to witness
its humiliations. The Colonel found
the Japanese remained
well-disciplined while they waited
to learn their fate, and most of
them assumed death was the natural
consequence of defeat.

The war tribunal held its first
plenary session in Tokyo on April
19th, 1946. General Tomkins took
over the fifth floor of the old
Imperial Courthouse in the Ginza
quarter of Tokyo - one of the few
buildings that had survived the war
intact. Tomkins, a squat,
short-tempered man who was
described by his own staff officer
as a "pen-pusher from the
Pentagon", arrived in Tokyo only a
week before he began his first
deliberations. The only
rat-a-tat-tat this General had ever
heard, the staffoffficer freely
admitted to Colonel Moore, had come
from the typewriter in his
secretary's office. However, when
it came to those on trial the
General was in no doubt

                161
                 
          A TWIST IN THE TALE

as to where the guilt lay and how the
guilty should be punished.

  "Hang every one of the little
slit-eyed, yellow bastards," turned out
to be one of Tomkins's favourite
expressions.

  Seated round a table in an old
courtroom, the twelve-man tribunal
conducted their deliberations. It was
clear from the opening session that the
General had no intention of considering
"extenuating circumstances", "past
record" or "humanitarian grounds". As
the Colonel listened to Tomkins's views
he began to fear for the lives of any
innocent member of the armed forces who
was brought in front of the General.

 -   The Colonel quickly identified
four Americans

from the tribunal who, like himself,
did not always
concur with the General's sweeping
judgments.
Two were lawyers and the other two had
been
fighting soldiers recently involved in
combat duty.
The five men began to work together to
counteract
the General's most prejudiced
decisions. During
the following weeks they were able to
persuade one
or two others around the table to
commute the
sentences of hanging to life
imprisonment for
several Japanese who had been
condemned for
crimes they could not possibly have
committed.

  As each such case was debated, General
Tomkins left the five men in no doubt
as to his contempt for their views.
"Goddam Nip sympathisers," he often
suggested, and not always under his
breath. As the General still held sway
over the twelve~man tribunal, the
Colonel's successes turned out to be
few in number.

When the time came to determine the
fate of

                  162
                   
COLONEL BULLFROG
                       -
those who had been in command of the
PoW camp at Tonchanthe General
demanded mass hanging for
everyJapanese officer involved
without even the presence of a
proper trial. He showed no surprise
when the usual five tribunal members
raised their voices in protest.
Colonel Moore spoke eloquently of
having been a prisoner at Tonchan
and petitioned in the defence of
Major Sakata, Sergeant Akida and
Corporal Sushi. He attempted to ex-
plain why hanging them would in its
own way be as barbaric as any
atrocity carried out by the
Japanese. He insisted their sentence
should be commuted to life
imprisonment. The General yawned
throughout the Colonel's remarks
and, once Moore had completed his
case, made no attempt to justify his
position but simply called for a
vote. To the General's surprise, the
result was six-all; an American
lawyer who previously had sided with
the General raised his hand to join
the Colonel's five. Without
hesitation the General threw his
casting vote in favour of the
gallows. Tomkins leered down the
table at Moore and said, "Time for
lunch, I think, gentlemen. I don't
know about you but I'm famished. And
no one can say that this time we
didn't give the little yellow
bastards a fair hearing."

  Colonel Moore rose from his place
and without offering an opinion left
the room.

  He ran down the steps of the
courthouse and instructed his driver
to take him to British HQ in the
centre of the city as quickly as
possible. The short journey took
them some time because of the melee
of people that were always thronging
the streets night and day. Once the
Colonel arrived at

                 163
                  
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

his office he asked his secretary
to place a call through to England.
While she was carrying out his
order Moore went to his green
cabinet and thumbed through several
files until he reached the one
marked "Personal". He opened it and
fished out the letter. He wanted to
be certain that he had remembered
the sentence accurately . . .

  "If for any reason you should
require my help in your
deliberations, do not hesitate to
contact me personally."

  "He's coming to the phone, sir,"
the secretary said nervously. The
Colonel walked over to the phone
and waited. He found
himself-standing to attention when
he heard the gentle, cultivated
voice ask, "Is that you, Colonel?"
It took Richard Moore less than ten
minutes to explain the problem he
faced and obtain the authority he
needed.

  Immediately he had completed his
conversation he returned to the
tribunal headquarters. He marched
straight back into the conference
room just as General Tomkins was
settling down in his chair to start
the afternoon proceedings.

  The Colonel was the first to rise
from his place when the General
declared the tribunal to be in
session. "I wonder if I might be
allowed to open with a statement?"
he requested.

  "Be my guest," said Tomkins. "But
make it brief. We've got a lot more
of these Japs to get through yet."

  Colonel Moore looked around the
table at the other eleven men.

  "Gentlemen," he began. "I hereby
resign my position as the British
representative on this commission."

                161
                 
         COLONEL BULLFROG

General Tomkins was unable to
stifle a smile.

  "I do it," the Colonel continued,
"reluctantly, but with the backing
of my Prime Minister, to whom I
spoke only a few moments ago." At
this piece of information Tomkins's
smile was replaced by a frown. "I
shall be returning to England in
order to make a full report to Mr
Attlee and the British Cabinet on
the manner in which this tribunal
is being conducted."

  "Now look here, sonny," began the
General. "You can't-"

  "I can, sir, and I will. Unlike
you, I am unwilling to have the
blood of innocent soldiers on my
hands for the rest of my life."

  "Now look here, sonny," the
General repeated. "Let's at least
talk this through before you do
anything you might regret."

  There was no break for the rest of
that day, and by late afternoon
Major Sakata, Sergeant Akida and
Corporal Sushi had had their
sentences commuted to life
imprisonment.

  Within a month, General Tomkins
had been recalled by the Pentagon
to be replaced by a distinguished
American marine who had been
decorated in combat during the
First World War.

  In the weeks that followed the new
appointment the death sentences of
two hundred and twentynine Japanese
prisoners of war were commuted.

  Colonel Moore returned to
Lincolnshire on November I I th,
1948, having had enough of the
realities of war and the
hypocrisies of peace.

Just under two years later Richard
Moore took holy orders and became a
parish priest in the sleepy

                165
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

hamlet of Weddlebeach, in Suffolk.
He enjoyed his calling and although
he rarely mentioned his wartime
experiences to his parishioners he
often thought of his days in Japan.

  "Blessed are the peacemakers for
they shall . . ." the vicar began
his sermon from the pulpit one Palm
Sunday morning in the early 1960s,
but he failed to complete the
sentence.

  His parishioners looked up
anxiously only to see that a broad
smile had spread across the vicar's
face as he gazed down at someone
seated in the third row.

  The man he was staring at bowed
his head in embarrassment and the
vicar quickly continued with his
sermon.

  When the service was over Richard
Moore waited by the east door to be
sure his eyes had not deceived him.
When they met face to face for the
first time in fifteen years both
men bowed and then shook hands.

  The priest was delighted to learn
over lunch that day back at the
vicarage that Chopsticks Sakata had
been released from prison after
only five years, following the
Allies' agreement with the newly
installed Japanese government to
release all prisoners who had not
committed capital crimes. When the
Colonel enquired after "Sweet and
Sour Pork" the Major admitted that
he had lost touch with Sergeant
Akida (Sweet) but that Corporal
Sushi (Sour) and he were working
for the same electronics company.
"And whenever we meet," he assured
the priest, "we talk of the
honourable man who saved our lives,
'the British Bullfrog'."

                166
                 
         COLONEL BULLFROG

Over the years, the priest and his
Japanese friend progressed in their
chosen professions and regularly
corresponded with each other. In
1971 Ari Sakata was put in charge
of a large electronics factory in
Osaka while eighteen months later
Richard Moore became the Very Revd
Richard Moore, Dean of Lincoln
Cathedral.

  "I read in the London Times that
your cathedral is appealing for a
new roof," wrote Sakata from his
homeland in 1975.

  "Nothing unusual about that," the
Dean explained in his letter of
reply. "There isn't a cathedral in
England that doesn't suffer from
dry rot or bomb damage. The former
I fear is terminal; the latter at
least has the chance of a cure."

  A few weeks later the Dean
received a cheque for ten thousand
pounds from a not-unknown Japanese
electronics company.

  When in 1979 the Very Revd Richard
Moore was appointed to the
bishopric of Taunton, the new
managing director of the largest
electronics company in Japan flew
over to attend his enthronement.

  "I see you have another roof
problem," commented Ari Sakata as
he gazed up at the scaffolding
surrounding the pulpit. "How much
will it cost this time?"

  "At least twenty-five thousand
pounds a year," replied the Bishop
without thought. "Just to make sure
the roof doesn't fall in on the
congregation during my sterner
sermons." He sighed as he passed
the evidence of reconstruction all
around him. "As soon as I've
settled into my new job I intend to
launch a proper appeal to ensure my

                167
                 
         A TWIST IN THE TALE
successor doesn't have to worry about
the roofever

again.'

  The managing director nodded his
understanding. A week later a cheque
for twenty-five thousand pounds
arrived on the churchman's desk.

  The Bishop tried hard to express
his grateful thanks. He knew he must
never allow Chopsticks to feel that
by his generosity he might have done
the wrong thing as this would only
insult his friend and undoubtedly
end their relationship. Rewrite
after rewrite was drafted to ensure
that the final version of the long
hand-written letter would have
passed muster with the Foreign Of
lice mandarin in charge of
theJapanese desk. Finally the letter
was posted.

  As the years passed Richard Moore
became fearful of writing to his old
friend more than once a year as each
letter elicited an even larger
cheque. And, when towards the end of
1986 he did write, he made no
reference to the Dean and Chapter's
decision to designate 1988 as the
cathedral's appeal year. Nor did he
mention his own failing health, lest
the oldJapanese gentleman should
feel in some way responsible, as his
doctor had warned him that he could
never expect to recover fully from
those experiences at Tonchan.

  The Bishop set about forming his
appeal committee in January 1987.
The Prince of Wales became the
patron and the Lord Lieutenant of
the county its chairman. In his
opening address to the members of
the appeal committee the Bishop in-
structed them that it was their duty
to raise not less than three million
pounds during 1988. Some
apprehensive looks appeared on the
faces around the table.

                 168
                  
         COLONEL BULLFROG

  On August 1 Ith, 1987, the Bishop
of Taunton was umpiring a village
cricket match when he suddenly
collapsed from a heart attack. "See
that the appeal brochures are
printed in time for the next
meeting," were his final words to
the captain of the local team.

  Bishop Moore's memorial service
was held in Taunton Cathedral and
conducted by the Archbishop of
Canterbury. Not a seat could be
found in the cathedral that day,
and so many crowded into every pew
that the west door was left open.
Those who arrived late had to
listen to the Archbishop's address
relayed over loudspeakers placed
around the market square.

  Casual onlookers must have been
puzzled by the presence of several
elderly Japanese gentlemen dotted
around the congregation.

  When the service came to an end
the Archbishop held a private
meeting in the vestry of the
cathedral with the chairman of the
largest electronics company in the
world.

  "You must be Mr Sakata," said the
Archbishop, warmly shaking the hand
of a man who stepped forward from
the small cluster of Japanese who
were in attendance. "Thank you for
taking the trouble to write and let
me know that you would be coming. I
am delighted to meet you at last.
The Bishop always spoke of you with
great affection and as a close
friend - 'Chopsticks', if I
remember."

Mr Sakata bowed low.

  "And I also know that he always
considered himself in your personal
debt for such generosity over so
many years."

"No, no, not me," replied the
former Major. "I,

                169
                 
A TWIST IN THE TALE
                      . . _

like my dear friend the late Bishop,
am representative of higher
authority."

The Archbishop looked puzzled.

  "You see, sir," continued Mr
Sakata, "I am only the chairman of
the company. May I have the honour
of introducing my President?"

  Mr Sakata took a pace backwards to
allow an even smaller figure, whom
the Archbishop had originally
assumed to be part of Mr Sakata's
entourage, to step forward.

  The President bowed low and, still
without speaking, passed an envelope
to the Archbishop.

  "May I be allowed to open it?" the
church leader asked, unaware of the
Japanese custom of waiting until the
giver has departed.

The little man bowed again.

  The Archbishop slit open the
envelope and removed a cheque for
three million pounds.

  "The late Bishop must have been a
very close friend," was all he could
think of saying.

  "No, sir," the President replied.
"I did not have that privilege."

  "Then he must have done something
incredible to be deserving of such a
munificent gesture."

  "He performed an act of honour
over forty years ago and now I try
inadequately to repay it."

  "Then he would surely have
remembered you," said the
Archbishop.

  "Is possible he would remember me
but if so only as the sour half of
'Sweet and Sour Pork'."

There is one cathedral in England
that has never found it necessary to
launch a national appeal.

                 170

         ATWISTIN THE TALK

              As she entered the
room every eye turned towards her.

  When admiring a girl some men
start with her head and work down.
I start with the ankles and work
up.

  She wore black high-heeled velvet
shoes and a tight-fitting black
dress that stopped high enough
above the knees to reveal the most
perfectly tapering legs. As my eyes
continued their upward sweep they
paused to take in her narrow waist
and slim athletic figure. But it
was the oval face that I found
captivating, slightly pouting lips
and the largest blue eyes I've ever
seen, crowned with a head of thick,
black, short-cut hair that
literally shone with lustre. Her
entrance was all the more
breathtaking because of the
surroundings she had chosen. Heads
would have turned at a diplomatic
reception, a society cocktail
party, even a charity ball, but at
a chess tournament . . .

  I followed her every movement,
patronisingly unable to accept she
could be a player. She walked
slowly over to the club secretary's
table and signed in to prove me
wrong. She was handed a number to

                172
                 
             CHECKMATE

indicate her challenger for the
opening match. Anyone who had not
yet been allocated an opponent
waited to see if she would take her
place opposite their side of the
board.

  The player checked the number she
had been given and made her way
towards an elderly man who was
seated in the far corner of the
room, a former captain of the club
now past his best.

  As the club's new captain I had
been responsible for instigating
these round-robin matches. We meet
on the last Friday of the month in
a large club-like room on top of
the Mason's Arms in the High
Street. The landlord sees to it
that thirty tables are set out for
us and that food and drink are
readily available. Three or four
other clubs in the district send
half a dozen opponents to play a
couple of blitz games, giving us a
chance to face rivals we would not
normally play. The rules for the
matches are simple enough - one
minute on the clock is the maximum
allowed for each move, so a game
rarely lasts for more than an hour,
and if a pawn hasn't been captured
in thirty moves the game is auto-
matically declared a draw. A short
break for a drink between games,
paid for by the loser, ensures that
everyone has the chance to
challenge two opponents during the
evening.

  A thin man wearing half-moon
spectacles and a dark blue
three-piece suit made his way over
towards my board. We smiled and
shook hands. My guess would have
been a solicitor, but I was wrong
as he turned out to be an
accountant working for a stationery
supplier in Woking.

  I found it hard to concentrate on
my opponent's well-rehearsed Moscow
opening as my eyes kept

                173
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

leaving the board and wandering over
to the girl in the black dress. On
the one occasion our eyes did meet
she gave me an enigmatic smile, but
although I tried again I was unable
to elicit the same response a second
time. Despite being preoccupied I
still managed to defeat the
accountant, who seemed unaware that
there were several ways out of a
seven-pawn attack.

  At the half-time break three other
members of the club had offered her
a drink before I even reached the
bar. I knew I could not hope to play
my second match against the girl as
I would be expected to challenge one
of the visiting team captains. In
fact she ended up playing the
accountant.

  I defeated my new opponent in a
little over forty minutes and, as a
solicitous host, began to take an
interest in the other matches that
were still being played. I set out
on a circuitous route that ensured
I ended up at her table. I could see
that the accountant already had the
better of her and within moments of
my arrival she had lost both her
queen and the game.

  I introduced myself and found that
just shaking hands with her was a
sexual experience. Weaving our way
through the tables we strolled over
to the bar together. Her name, she
told me, was Amanda Curzon. I
ordered Amanda the glass of red wine
she requested and a half-pint of
beer for myself. I began by
commiserating with her over the
defeat.

"How did you get on against him?"
she asked.

  "Just managed to beat him," I
said. "But it was very close. How
did your first game with our old
captain turn out?"

                174
                 
             CHECKMATE

  "Stalemate," said Amanda. "But I
think he was just being courteous."

  "Last time I played him it ended
up in stalemate," I told her.

  She smiled. "Perhaps we ought to
have a game some time?"

  "I'll look forward to that," I
said, as she finished her drink.

  "Well, I must be off," she
announced suddenly. "Have to catch
the last train to Hounslow."

  "Allow me to drive you," I said
gallantly. "It's the least the host
captain can be expected to do."

"But surely it's miles out of your
way?"

  "Not at all," I lied, Hounslow
being about twenty minutes beyond
my flat. I gulped down the last
drop of my beer and helped Amanda
on with her coat. Before leaving I
thanked the landlord for the
efficient organisation of the
evening.

  We then strolled into the car
park. I opened the passenger door
of my Scirocco to allow Amanda to
climb in.

  "A slight improvement on London
Transport," she said as I slid into
my side of the car. I smiled and
headed out on the road northwards.
That black dress that I described
earlier goes even higher up the
legs when a girl sits back in a
Scirocco. It didn't seem to
embarrass her.

  "It's still very early," I
ventured after a few
inconsequential remarks about the
club evening. "Have you time to
drop in for a drink?"

  "It would have to be a quick
one," she replied, looking at her
watch. "I've a busy day ahead of me
tomorrow."

"Of course," I said, chatting on,
hoping she

                175
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

wouldn't notice a detour that could
hardly be described as on the way to
Hounslow.

"Do you work in town?" I asked.

  "Yes. I'm a receptionist for a
firm of estate agents in Berkeley
Square."

"I'm surprised you're not a model."

  "I used to be," she replied
without further explanation. She
seemed quite oblivious to the route
I was taking as she chatted on about
her holiday plans for Ibiza. Once we
had arrived at my place I parked the
car and led Amandathrough my front
gate and up to the flat. In the hall
I helped her off with her coat
before taking her through to the
front room.

"What would you like to drink?" I
asked.

  "I'll stick to wine, if you've a
bottle already open," she replied,
as she walked slowly round, taking
in the unusually tidy room. My
mother must have dropped by during
the morning, I thought gratefully.

  "It's only a bachelor pad," I
said, emphasising the word
"bachelor" before going into the
kitchen. To my relief I found there
was an unopened bottle of wine in
the larder. I joined Amanda with the
bottle and two glasses a few moments
later, to find her studying my chess
board and fingering the delicate
ivory pieces that were set out for
a game I was playing by post.

  "What a beautiful set," she
volunteered as I handed her a glass
of wine. "Where did you find it?"

  "Mexico," I told her, not
explaining that I had won it in a
tournament while on holiday there.
"I was only sorry we didn't have the
chance to have a game ourselves."

                176
                 
            CHECKMATE
-
  She checked her watch. "Time for a
quick one," she said, taking a seat
behind the little white pieces.

  I quickly took my place opposite
her. She smiled, picked up a white
and a black bishop and hid them
behind her back. Her dress became
even tighter and emphasised the
shape of her breasts. She then
placed both clenched fists in front
of me. I touched her right hand and
she turned it over and opened it to
reveal a white bishop.

  "Is there to be a wager of any
kind?" I asked lightheartedly. She
checked inside her evening bag.

"I only have a few pounds on me,"
she said.

"I'd be willing to play for lower
stakes."

"What do you have in mind?" she
asked.

"What can you offer?"

"What would you like?"

"Ten pounds if you win."

''And if I lose?"

"You take something off."

  I regretted the words the moment
I had said them and waited for her
to slap my face and leave but she
said simply, "There's not much harm
in that if we only play one game."

  I nodded my agreement and stared
down at the board.

  She wasn't a bad player - what the
pros call a patter- though her Roux
opening was somewhat orthodox. I
managed to make the game last twenty
minutes while sacrificing several
pieces without making it look too
obvious. When I said "Checkmate",
she kicked off both her shoes and
laughed.

  "Care for another drink?" I asked,
not feeling too hopeful. "After all,
it's not yet eleven."

                177
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  "All right. Just a small one and
then I must be off."

  I went to the kitchen, returned a
moment later clutching the bottle,
and refilled her glass.

"I only wanted half a glass," she
said, frowning.

  "I was lucky to win," I said,
ignoring her remark, "after your
bishop captured my knight.
Extremely close-run thing."

"Perhaps," she replied.

"Care for another game?" I
ventured.

She hesitated.

"Double or quits?"

"What do you mean?"

"Twenty pounds or another garment?"

  "Neither of us is going to lose
much tonight, are we?"

  She pulled up her chair as I
turned the board round and we both
began to put the ivory pieces back
in place.

  The second game took a little
longer as I made a silly mistake
early on, castling on my queen's
side, and it took several moves to
recover. However, I still managed
to finish the game off in thirty
minutes and even found time to
refill Amanda's glass when she
wasn't looking.

  She smiled at me as she hitched
her dress up high enough to allow
me to see the tops of her
stockings. She undid the suspenders
and slowly peeled the stockings
offbefore dropping them on my side
ofthe table.

"I nearly beat you that time," she
said.

  "Almost," I replied. "Want another
chance to get even? Let's say fifty
pounds this time," I suggested,
trying to make the offer sound
magnanimous.

                178
                 
              CHECKMATE

  "The stakes are getting higher for
both of us," -she replied as she
reset the board. I began to wonder
what might be going through her
mind. Whatever it was, she foolishly
sacrificed both her rooks early on
and the game was over in a matter of
minutes.

  Once again she lifted her dress
but this time well above her waist.
My eyes were glued to her thighs as
she undid the black suspender belt
and held it high above my head
before letting it drop and join her
stockings on my side of the table.

  "Once I had lost the second rook,"
she said, "I was never in with a
chance."

  "I agree. It would therefore only
be fair to allow you one more
chance," I said, quickly re-setting
the board. "After all," I added,
"you could win one hundred pounds
this time." She smiled.

  "I really ought to be going home,"
she said as she moved her queen's
pawn two squares forward. She smiled
that enigmatic smile again as I
countered with my bishop's pawn.

  It was the best game she had
played all evening and her use of
the Warsaw gambit kept me at the
board for over thirty minutes. In
fact I damn nearly lost early on
because I found it hard to
concentrate properly on her defence
strategy. A couple of times Amanda
chuckled when she thought she had
got the better of me, but it became
obvious she had not seen Karpov play
the Sicilian defence and win from a
seemingly impossible position.

"Checkmate," I finally declared.

  "Damn," she said, and standing up
turned her back on me. "You'll have
to give me a hand." Trembling, I
leaned over and slowly pulled the
zip

down until it reached the small of
her back. Once again I wanted to
touch the smooth, creamy skin. She
swung round to face me, shrugged
gracefully and the dress fell to the
ground as if a statue were being
unveiled. She leaned forward and
brushed the side of my cheek with
her hand, which had much the same
effect as an electric shock. I
emptied the last of the bottle of
wine into her glass and left for the
kitchen with the excuse of needing
to refill my own. When I returned
she hadn't moved. A gauzy black bra
and pair of panties were now the
only garments that I still hoped to
see removed.

  "I don't suppose you'd play one
more game?" I asked, trying not to
sound desperate.

  "It's time you took me home," she
said with a giggle.

  I passed her another glass of
wine. "Just one more," I begged.
"But this time it must be for both
garments."

  She laughed. "Certainly not," she
said. "I couldn't afford to lose."

  "It would have to be the last
game," I agreed. "But two hundred
pounds this time and we play for
both garments." I waited, hoping the
size of the wager would tempt her.
"The odds must surely be on your
side. After all, you've nearly won
three times."

  She sipped her drink as if
considering the proposition. "All
right," she said. "One last fling."

  Neither of us voiced our feeling
as to what was certain to happen if
she lost.

  I could not stop myself trembling
as I set the board up once again. I
cleared my mind, hoping she hadn't
noticed that I had drunk only one
glass

                 1~
                  
             CHECKMATE

of wine all night. I was determined
to finish this one off quickly.

  I moved my queen's pawn one square
forward. She retaliated, pushing
her king's pawn up two squares. I
knew exactly what my next move
needed to be and because of it the
game only lasted eleven minutes.

  I have never been so
comprehensively beaten in my life.
Amanda was in a totally different
class to me. She anticipated my
every move and had gambits I had
never encountered or even read of
before.

  It was her turn to say
"Checkmate", which she delivered
with the same enigmatic smile as
before, adding, "You did say the
odds were on my side this timed'

  I lowered my head in disbelief.
When I looked up again, she had
already slipped that beautiful
black dress back on, and was
stuffing her stockings and
suspenders into her evening bag. A
moment later she put on her shoes.

  I took out my cheque book, filled
in the name "Amanda Curzon" and
added the figure "œ200", the date
and my signature. While I was doing
this she replaced the little ivory
pieces on the exact squares on
which they had been when she had
first entered the room.

  She bent over and kissed me gently
on the cheek. "Thank you," she said
as she placed the cheque in her
handbag. "We must play again some
time." I was still staring at the
re-set board in disbeliefwhen I
heard the front door close behind
her.

  "Wait a minute," I said, rushing
to the door. "How will you get
home?"

I was just in time to see her
running down the

                181
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

steps and towards the open door of
a BMW. She climbed in, allowing me
one more look at those long
tapering legs. She smiled as the
car door was closed behind her.

  The accountant strolled round to
the driver's side, got in, rewed
up the engine and drove the
champion home.

            Thieves
               
HONOUR AMONG THIEVES

               THE
first occasion I met
Sefton Hamilton was
in late August last
year when my wife
and I were dining
with Henry and
Suzanne Kennedy at
their home in
Warwick Square.

  Hamilton was one
of those unfortunate
men who have
inherited immense
wealth but not a lot
more. He was able
quickly to convince
us that he had
little time to read
and no time to
attend the theatre
or opera. However,
this did not prevent
him from holding
opinions on every
subject from Shaw to
Pavarotti, from
Gorbachev to
Picasso. He remained
puzzled, for
instance, as to what
the unemployed had
to complain about
when their dole
packet was only just
less than what he
was currently paying
the labourers on his
estate. In any case,
they only spent it
on bingo and
drinking, he assured
us.

  Drinking brings me
to the other dinner
guest that night -
Freddie Barker, the
President of the
Wine Society, who
sat opposite my wife
and unlike Hamilton
hardly uttered a
word. Henry had
assured me over the
phone that Barker
had not only managed
to get the Society
back on to a proper

         185
          
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

financial footing but was also
acknowledged as a leading authority
on his subject. I looked forward to
picking up useful bits of inside
knowledge. Whenever Barker was
allowed to get a word in edgeways,
he showed enough knowledge of the
topic under discussion to convince
me that he would be fascinating if
only Hamilton would remain silent
long enough for him to speak.

  While our hostess produced as a
starter a spinach souffle that
melted in the mouth, Henry moved
round the table pouring each of us
a glass of wine.

  Barker sniffed his appreciatively.
"Appropriate in bicentennial year
that we should be drinking an
Australian Chablis of such fine
vintage. I feel sure their whites
will soon be making the French look
to their laurels."

  "Australian?" said Hamilton in
disbelief as he put down his glass.
"How could a nation of beerswiggers
begin to understand the first thing
about producing a half decent
wine?"

  "I think you'll find," began
Barker, "that the Australians -"

  "Bicentennial indeed," Hamilton
continued. "Let's face it, they're
only celebrating two hundred years
of parole." No one laughed except
Hamilton. "I'd still pack the rest
of our criminals off there, given
half a chance."

No one doubted him.

  Hamilton sipped the wine
tentatively, like a man who fears
he is about to be poisoned, then
began to explain why, in his
considered view, judges were far
too lenient with petty criminals. I
found myself concentrating more on
the food than the incessant flow of
my neighbour's views.

1~;

       HONOUR AMONG THIEVES

  I Sways enjoy Beef Wellington, and
Suzanne can produce a pastry that
doesn't flake when cut and meat
that's so tender that once one has
finished a first helping, Oliver
Twist comes to mind. It certainly
helped me to endure Hamilton's
pontificating. Barker managed to
pass an appreciative comment to
Henry on the quality of the claret
between Hamilton's opinions on the
chances of Paddy Ashdown reviving
the Liberal Party and the role of
Arthur Scargill in the trade union
movement, allowing no one the
chance to reply.

  "I don't allow my staff to belong
to any union," Hamilton declared,
gulping down his drink. "I run a
closed shop." He laughed once more
at his own joke and held his empty
glass high in the air as if it
would be filled by magic. In fact
it was filled by Henry with a
discretion that shamed Hamiltonnot
that he noticed. In the brief pause
that followed, my wife suggested
that perhaps the trade union
movement had been born out of a
response to a genuine social need.

  "Balderdash, madam," said
Hamilton. "With great respect, the
trade unions have been the single
most important factor in the
decline of Britain as we know it.
They've no interest in anybody but
themselves. You only have to look
at Ron Todd and the whole Ford
fiasco to understand that."

  Suzanne began to clear the plates
away and I noticed she took the
opportunity to nudge Henry, who
quickly changed the subject.

  Moments later a raspberry meringue
glazed with a thick sauce appeared.
It seemed a pity to cut such a
creation but Suzanne carefully
divided six generous helpings like
a nanny feeding her charges while

                187
                 
         A TWIST IN THE TALE

Henry uncorked a 1981 Sauternes.
Barker literally licked his lips in
anticipation.

  "And another thing," Hamilton was
saying. "The Prime Minister has got
far too many Wets in her Cabinet for
my liking."

  "With whom would you replace
them?" asked Barker innocently.

  Herod would have had little
trouble in convincing the list of
gentlemen Hamilton proffered that
the slaughter of the innocents was
merely an extension of the child
care programme.

  Once again I became more
interested in Suzanne's culinary
efforts, especially as she had
allowed me an indulgence: Cheddar
was to be served as the final
course. I knew the moment I tasted
it that it had been purchased from
the Alvis Brothers' farm in
Keynsham; we all have to be
knowledgeable about something, and
Cheddar is my speciality.

  To accompany the cheese, Henry
supplied a port. which was to be the
highlight of the evening. "Sandeman
1970," he said in an aside to Barker
as he poured the first drops into
the expert's glass.

  "Yes, of course," said Barker,
holding it to his nose. "I would
have known it anywhere. Typical
Sandeman warmth but with real body.
I hope you've laid some down,
Henry," he added. "You'll enjoy it
even more in your old age."

  "Think you're a bit of an
authority on wines, do you?" said
Hamilton, the first question he had
asked all evening.

"Not exactly," began Barker, "but I
-"

"You're all a bunch of humbugs, the
lot of you,"

                 1&8
                  
       HONOUR AMONG THIEVES

interrupted Hamilton. "You sniff
and you swirl, you taste and you
spit, then you spout a whole lot of
gobbledegook and expect us to
swallow it. Body and warmth be
damned. You can't take me in that
easily."

"No one was trying to," said Barker
with feeling.

  "You've been keen to put one over
on us all evening," replied
Hamilton, "with your 'Yes, of
course, I'd have known it anywhere'
routine. Come on, admit it."

"I didn't mean to suggest-" added
Barker.

"I'll prove it, if you like," said
Hamilton.

  The five of us stared at the
ungracious guest and, for the first
time that evening, I wondered what
could possibly be coming next.

  "I have heard it said," continued
Hamilton, "that Sefton Hall boasts
one of the finest wine cellars in
England. It was laid down by my
Other and his father before him,
though I confess I haven't found
the time to continue the
tradition." Barker nodded in
belief. "But my butler knows
exactly what I like. I therefore
invite you, sir, tojoin me for
lunch on the Saturday after next,
when I will produce four wines of
the finest vintage for your
consideration. And I offer you a
wager," he added, looking straight
at Barker. "Five hundred pounds to
fifty a bottle- tempting odds, I'm
sure you'll agree- that you will be
unable to name any one of them." He
stared belligerently at the distin-
guished President of the Wine
Society.

"The sum is so large that I could
not consider-"

  "Unwilling to take up the
challenge, eh, Barker? Then you
are, sir, a coward as well as a
humbug."

                lag
                 
          A TWIST IN THE TALE

  After the embarrassing pause that
followed, Barker replied, "As you wish,
sir. It appears I am left with no
choice but to accept your challenge."

  A satisfied grin appeared on the
other man's face. "You must come along
as a witness, Henry," he said, turning
to our host. "And why don't you bring
along that author johnny?" he added,
pointing at me. "Then he'll really have
something to write about for a change."

  From Hamilton's manner it was obvious
that the feelings of our wives were not
to be taken into consideration. Mary
gave me a wry smile.

  Henry looked anxiously towards me,
but I was quite content to be an
observer of this unfolding drama. I
nodded my assent.

  "Good," said Hamilton, rising from
his place, his napkin still tucked
under his collar. "I look forward to
seeing the three of you at Sefton Hall
on Saturday week. Shall we say twelve
thirty?" He bowed to Suzanne.

  "I won't be able to join you, I'm
afraid," she said, clearing up any
lingering doubt she might have been
included in the invitation. "I always
have lunch with my mother on
Saturdays."

  Hamilton waved a hand to signify that
it did not concern him one way or the
other.

  After the strange guest had left we
sat in silence for some moments before
Henry volunteered a statement. "I'm
sorry about all that," he began. "His
mother and my aunt are old friends and
she's asked me on several occasions to
have him over to dinner. It seems no
one else will."

  "Don't worry," said Barker
eventually. "I'll do my best not to let
you down. And in return for such

 -                 190

HONOUR AMONG THIEVES

.

excellent hospitality perhaps both
of you would be kind enough to leave
Saturday evening free? There is," he
explained, "an inn near Sefton Hall
I have wanted to visit for some
time: the Hamilton Arms. The food,
I'm assured, is more than adequate
but the wine list is . . ." he
hesitated, "considered by experts to
be exceptional."

  Henry and I both checked our
diaries and readily accepted his
invitation.

I thought a great deal about Sefton
Hamilton during the next ten days
and awaited our lunch with a mixture
of apprehension and anticipation. On
the Saturday morning Henry drove the
three of us down to Sefton Park and
we arrived a little after twelve
thirty. Actually we passed through
the massive wrought-iron gates at
twelve thirty precisely, but did not
reach the front door of the house
until twelve thirty-seven.

  The great oak door was opened
before we had a chance to knock by a
tall elegant man in a tail coat,
wing collar and black tie. He
informed us that he was Adams, the
butler. He then escorted us to the
morning room, where we were greeted
by a large log fire. Above it hung a
picture of a disapproving man who I
presumed was Sefton Hamilton's
grandfather. On the other walls was
a massive tapestry of the Battle of
Waterloo and an enormous oil of the
Crimean War. Antique furniture
littered the room and the one
sculpture on display was of a Greek
figure throwing a discus. Looking
around, I reflected that only the
telephone belonged to the present
century.

Sefton Hamilton entered the room as
a gale

                 191
                  
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

might hit an unhappy seaside town.
Immediately he stood with his back
to the fire, blocking any heat we
might have been appreciating,

  "Whisky!" he bellowed as Adams
appeared once again. "Barker?"

"Not for me," said Barker with a
thin smile.

  "Ah," said Hamilton. "Want to keep
your taste buds at their most
sensitive, eh?"

  Barker did not reply. Before we
went into lunch we learned that the
estate was seven thousand acres in
size and had some of the finest
shooting outside of Scotland. The
Hall had one hundred and twelve
rooms, one or two of which Hamilton
had not visited since he was a
child. The roof itself, he assured
us finally, was an acre and a half,
a statistic that will long remain
in my memory as it is the same size
as my garden.

  The 10ngcase clock in the corner
of the room struck one. "Time for
the contest to begin," declared
Hamilton, and marched out of the
room like a general who assumes his
troops will follow him without
question. We did, all the way down
thirty yards of corridor to the
dining room. The four of us then
took our places around a
seventeenth-century oak table that
could comfortably have seated
twenty.

  Adorning the centre of the table
were two Georgian decanters and two
unlabelled bottles. The first
bottle was filled with a clear
white wine, the first decanter with
a red, the second bottle with a
richer white and the second
decanter with a tawny red
substance. In front ofthe four
wines were four white cards. By
each lay a slim bundle of
fifty-pound notes.

                192
                 
       HONOUR AMONG THIEVES

  Hamilton took his place in the
large chair at the top of the table
while Barker and I sat opposite
each other in the centre, facing
the wine, leaving Henry to occupy
the final place at the far end of
the table.

  The butler stood one pace behind
his master's chair. He nodded and
four footmen appeared, bearing the
first course. A fish and prawn
terrine was placed in front of each
of us. Adams received a nod from
his master before he picked up the
first bottle and began to fill
Barker's glass. Barker waited for
the butler to go round the table
and fill the other three glasses
before he began his ritual.

  First he swirled the wine round
while at the same time studying it
carefully. Then he sniffed it. He
hesitated and a surprised look came
over his face. He took a sip.

  "Um," he said eventually. "I
confess, quite a challenge. " He
sniffed it again just to be sure.
Then he looked up and gave a smile
of satisfaction. Hamilton stared at
him, his mouth slightly open,
although he remained unusually
silent.

  Barker took one more sip.
"Montaguy Tete de Cuvee 1985," he
declared with the confidence of an
expert, "bottled by Louis Latour."
We al} looked towards Hamilton who,
in contrast, displayed an unhappy
frown.

  "You're right," said Hamilton. "It
was bottled by Latour. But that's
about as clever as telling us that
Heinz bottle tomato sauce. And as
my father died in 1984 I can assure
you, sir, you are mistaken." He
looked round at his butler to
confirm the statement. Adams's face
remained inscrutable. Barker turned
over the card. It read: "Chevalier
Montrachet Les Demorselles 1983".
He stared at

                193
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

the card, obviously unable to
believe his eyes.

  "One down and three to go,"
Hamilton dedared, oblivious to
Barker's reaction. The footmen
reappeared and took away the fish
plates, to replace them a few
moments later with lightly cooked
grouse. While its accompaniments
were being served Barker did not
speak. He just stared at the other
three decanters, not even hearing
his host inform Henry who his guests
were to be for the first shoot of
the season the following week. I
remember that the names corresponded
roughly with the ones Hamilton had
suggested for his ideal Cabinet.

  Barker nibbled at the grouse as he
waited for Adams to fill a glass
from the first decanter. He had not
finished his terrineafter the
opening failure, only taking the
occasional sip of water.

  "As Adams and I spent a
considerable part of our morning
selecting the wines for this little
challenge, let us hope you can do
better this time," said Hamilton,
unable to hide his satisfaction.
Barker once again began to swirl the
wine round. He seemed to take longer
this time, sniffing it several times
before putting his glass to his lips
and finally sipping from it.

  A smile of instant recognition
appeared on his face and he did not
hesitate. "Chateau la Louviere
1978."

  "This time you have the correct
year, sir, but you have insulted the
wine."

  Immediately Barker turned the card
over and read it out incredulously:
Chateau Lafite 1978. Even I knew
that to be one of the finest clarets
one might ever hope to taste. Barker
lapsed into a deep silence and
continued to nibble at his food.

                194
                 
       HONOUR AMONC THIEVES

Hamilton appeared to be enjoying
the wine almost as much as the
half-time score. "One hundred
pounds to me, nothing to the
President of the Wine Society," he
reminded us. Embarrassed, Henry and
I tried to keep the conversation
going until the third course had
been served - a lemon and lime
souffle which could not compare in
presentation or subtlety with any
of Suzanne's offerings.

  "Shall we move on to my third
challenge?" asked Hamilton crisply.

  Once again, Adams picked up a
decanter and began to pour the
wine. I was surprised to see that
he spilled a little as he filled
Barker's glass.

"Clumsy oaf," barked Hamilton.

  "I do apologise, sir," said Adams.
He removed the spilled drop from
the wooden table with a napkin. As
he did so he stared at Barker with
a desperate look that I felt sure
had nothing to do with the spilling
of the wine. However, he remained
mute as he continued to circle the
table.

  Once again Barker went through his
ritual, the swirling, the sniffing
and finally the tasting. This time
he took even longer. Hamilton
became impatient and drummed the
greet Jacobean table with his podgy
fingers.

"It's a Sauternes," began Barker.

  "Any half-wit could tell you
that," said Hamilton. "I want to
know the year and the vintage."

His guest hesitated.

"Chateau Guiraud 1976," he said
flatly.

  "At least you are consistent,"
said Hamilton. "You're always
wrong."

Barker flicked over the card.

"Chateau d'Yquem 1980," he said in
disbelief. It

                195
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

was a vintage that I had only seen
at the bottom of wine lists in
expensive restaurants and had never
had the privilege of tasting. It
puzzled me greatly that Barker
could have been wrong about the
Mona Lisa of wines.

  Barker quickly turned towards
Hamilton to protest and must have
seen Adams standing behind his
master, all six foot three of the
man trembling, at exactly the same
time I did. I wanted Hamilton to
leave the room so I could ask Adams
what was making him so fearful, but
the owner of Sefton Hall was now in
full cry.

  Meanwhile Barker gazed at the
butler for a moment more and,
sensing his discomfort, lowered his
eyes and contributed nothing else
to the conversation until the port
was poured some twenty minutes
later.

  "Your last chance to avoid
complete humiliation," said
Hamilton.

  A cheese board, displaying several
varieties, was brought round and
each guest selected his choiceI
stuck to a Cheddar that I could
have told Hamilton had not been
made in Somerset. Meanwhile the
port was poured by the butler, who
was now as white as a sheet. I
began to wonder if he was going to
faint, but somehow he managed to
fill all four glasses before
returning to stand a pace behind
his master's chair. Hamilton
noticed nothing untoward.

  Barker drank the port, not
bothering with any of his previous
preliminaries.

"Taylors," he began.

  "Agreed," said Hamilton. "But as
there are only three decent
suppliers of port in the world, the
year

                196
                 
        HONOUR AMONG THIEVES

can be all that matters - as you, in
your exalted position, must be well
aware, Mr Barker."

  Freddie nodded his agreement.
"Nineteen seventy-five," he said
firmly, then quickly flicked the
card over.

"Taylors 1927", I read upside-down.

  Once again Barker turned sharply
towards his host, who was rocking
with laughter. The butler stared
back at his master's guest with
haunted eyes. Barker hesitated only
for a moment before removing a
cheque book from his inside pocket.
He filled in the name "Sefton
Hamilton" and the figure of œ200. He
signed it and wordlessly passed the
cheque along the table to his host.

  "That was only half the bargain,"
said Hamilton, enjoying every moment
of his triumph.

Barker rose, paused and said, "I am
a humbug."

"You are indeed, sir," said
Hamilton.

  After spending three of the most
unpleasant hours of my life, I
managed to escape with Henry and
Freddie Barker a little after four
o'clock. As Henry drove away from
Sefton Hall neither of us uttered a
word. Perhaps we both felt that
Barker should be allowed the first
comment.

  "I fear, gentlemen," he said
eventually, "I shall not be good
company for the next few hours, and
so I will, with your permission,
take a brisk walk and join you both
for dinner at the Hamilton Arms
around seven thirty. I have booked
a table for eight o'clock." Without
another word, Barker signalled that
Henry should bring the car to a halt
and we watched as he climbed out and
headed off clown a country lane.
Henry did not drive on until his
friend was well out of sight.

                 197
                  
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  My sympathies were entirely with
Barker, although I remained puzzled
by the whole affair. How could the
President of the Wine Society make
such basic mistakes? After all, I
could read one page of Dickens and
know it wasn't Graham Greene.

  Like Dr Watson, I felt I required
a fuller explanation.

Barker found us sitting round the
fire in the private bar at the
Hamilton Arms a little after seven
thirty that night. Following his
exercise, he appeared in far better
spirits. He chatted about nothing
consequential and didn't once
mention what had taken place at
lunchtime.

  It must have been a few minutes
later, when I turned to check the
old clock above the door, that I
saw Hamilton's butler seated at the
bar in earnest conversation with
the innkeeper. I would have thought
nothing of it had I not noticed the
same terrified look that I had
witnessed earlier in the afternoon
as he pointed in our direction. The
innkeeper appeared equally anxious,
as if he had been found guilty of
serving half-measures by a customs
and excise officer.

  He picked up some menus and walked
over to our table.

  "We've no need for those," said
Barker. "Your reputation goes
before you. We are in your hands.
Whatever you suggest we will
happily consume."

  "Thank you, sir," he said and
passed our host the wine list.

  Barker studied the contents inside
the leatherbound covers for some
time before a large smile

                198
                 
       HONOUR AMONG THIEVES

appeared on his face. "I think you
had better select the wines as
well," he said, "as I have a
feeling you know the sort of thing
I would expect."

  "Of course, sir," said the
innkeeper as Freddie passed back
the wine list leaving me totally
mystified, remembering that this
was Barker's first visit to the
inn.

  The innkeeper left for the
kitchens while we chatted away and
didn't reappear for some fifteen
minutes.

  "Your table is ready, gentlemen,"
he said, and we followed him into
an adjoining dining room. There
were only a dozen tables but as
ours was the last to be filled
there was no doubting the inn's
popularity.

  The innkeeper had selected a light
supper of consomme, followed by
thin slices of duck, almost as if
he had known that we would be
unable to handle another heavy meal
aRer our lunch at the Hall.

  I was also surprised to find that
all the wines he had chosen were
served in decanters and I assumed
that the innkeeper must therefore
have selected the house wines. As
each was poured and consumed I
admit that, to my untutored palate,
they seemed far superior to those
which I had drunk at Sefton Hall
earlier that day. Barker certainly
seemed to linger over every
mouthful and on one occasion said
appreciatively, "This is the real
McCoy."

  At the end of the evening when our
table had been cleared we sat back
and enjoyed a magnificent port and
smoked cigars.

  It was at this point that Henry
mentioned Hamilton for the first
time.

                199
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  "Are you going to let us into the
mystery of what really happened at
lunch today?" he asked.

  "I'm still not altogether sure
myself," came back Barker's reply,
"but I am certain of one thing: Mr
Hamilton's father was a man who
knew his wines, while his son
doesn't."

  I would have pressed Barker
further on the subject if the
innkeeper had not arrived by his
side at that moment.

  "An excellent meal," Barker
declared. "And as for the wine -
quite exceptional."

  "You are kind, sir," said the
innkeeper, as he handed him the
bill.

  My curiosity got the better of me,
I'm sorry to admit, and I glanced
at the bottom of the slim strip of
paper. I couldn't believe my eyes -
the bill came to two hundred
pounds.

  To my surprise, Barker only
commented, "Very reasonable,
considering." He wrote out a cheque
and passed it over to the
innkeeper. "I have only tasted
Chateau d'Yquem 1980 once before
today;" he added, "and Taylors 1927
never."

  The innkeeper smiled. "I hope you
enjoyed them both, sir. I feel sure
you wouldn't have wanted to see
them wasted on a humbug."

Barker nodded his agreement.

  I watched as the innkeeper left
the dining room and returned to his
place behind the bar.

  He passed the cheque over to Adams
the butler, who studied it for a
moment, smiled and then tore it
into little pieces.

                200
                 


      A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS
                 W

              nE first met Patrick
Travers on our annual winter
holiday to Verbier. We were waiting
at the ski lift that first Saturday
morning when a man who must have
been in his early forties stood
aside to allow Caroline to take his
place, so that we could travel up
together. He explained that he had
already completed two runs that
morning and didn't mind waiting. I
thanked him and thought nothing
more of it.

  As soon as we reach the top my
wife and I always go our separate
ways, she to the A-slope to join
Marcel, who only instructs advanced
skiers- she has been skiing since
the age of seven - I to the B-slope
and any instructor who is
available- I took up skiing at the
age of forty-one - and frankly the
B-slope is still too advanced for
me though I don't dare admit as
much, especially to Caroline. We
always meet up again at the ski
lift after completing our different
runs.

  That evening we bumped into
Travers at the hotel bar. Since he
seemed to be on his own we invited
him tojoin us for dinner. He proved
to be an amusing companion and we
passed a pleasant

                203
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

enough evening together. He flirted
politely with my wife without ever
overstepping the mark and she
appeared to be flattered by his
attentions. Over the years I have
become used to men being attracted
to Caroline and I never need
reminding how lucky I am. During
dinner we learned that Travers was
a merchant banker with an of lice
in the City and a flat in Eaton
Square. He had come to Verbier
every year since he had been taken
on a school trip in the late
Fifties, he told us. He still
prided himselfon being the first on
the ski lift every morning, almost
always beating the local blades up
and down.

  Travers appeared to be genuinely
interested in the fact that I ran a
small West End art gallery; as it
turned out, he was something of a
collector himself, specialising in
minor Impressionists. He promised
he would drop by and see my next
exhibition when he was back in
London.

  I assured him that he would be
most welcome but never gave it a
second thought. In fact I only saw
Travers a couple of times over the
rest of the holiday, once talking
to the wife of a friend of mine who
owned a gallery that specialises in
oriental rugs, and later I noticed
him following Caroline expertly
down the treacherous A-slope.

It was six weeks later, and some
minutes before I could place him
that night at my gallery. I had to
rack that part of one's memory
which recalls names, a skill
politicians rely on every day.

  "Good to see you, Edward," he
said. "I saw the write-up you got
in the Independent and remembered
your kind invitation to the private
view."

                204
                 
      A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS

  "Glad you could make it, Patrick,"
I replied, rememberingjust in time.

  "I'm not a champagne man myself,"
he told me, "but I'll travel a long
way to see a Vuillard."

"You think highly of him?"

  "Oh yes. I would compare him
favourably with Pissarro and
Bonnard, and he still remains one
of the most underrated of the
Impressionists."

  "I agree," I replied. "But my
gallery has felt that way about
Vuillard for some considerable
time."

  "How much is 'The Lady at the
Window'?" he asked.

"Eighty thousand pounds," I said
quietly.

  "It reminds me of a picture of his
in the Metropolitan," he said, as
he studied the reproduction in the
catalogue.

  I was impressed, and told Travers
that the Vuillard in New York had
been painted within a month of the
one he so admired.

He nodded. "And the small nude?"

"Forty-seven thousand," I told him.

  "Mrs Hensell, the wife of his
dealer and Vuillard's second
mistress, if I'm not mistaken. The
French are always so much more
civilised about these things than
we are. But my favourite painting
in this exhibition," he continued,
"compares surely with the finest of
his work." He turned to face the
large oil of a young girl playing a
piano, her mother bending to turn a
page of the score.

  "Magnificent," he said. "Dare I
ask how much?"

  "Three hundred and seventy
thousand pounds," I said, wondering
if such a price tag put it out of
Travers's bracket.

                 2
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  "What a super party, Edward," said
a voice from behind my shoulder.

  "Percy!" I cried, turning round.
"I thought you said you wouldn't be
able to make it."

  "Yes I did, old fellow, but I
decided I couldn't sit at home
alone all the time, so I've come to
drown my sorrows in champagne."

  "Quite right too," I said. "Sorry
to hear about Diana," I added as
Percy moved on. When I turned back
to continue my conversation with
Patrick Travers he was nowhere to
be seen. I searched around the room
and spotted him standing in the far
corner of the gallery chatting to
my wife, a glass of champagne in
his hand. She was wearing an
off-the-shoulder green dress that I
considered a little too modern.
Travers's eyes seemed to be glued
to a spot a few inches below the
shoulders. I would have thought
nothing of it had he spoken to
anyone else that evening.

  The next occasion on which I saw
Travers was about a week later on
returning from the bank with some
petty cash. Once again he was
standing in front of the Vuillard
oil of mother and daughter at the
piano.

"Good morning, Patrick," I said as
Ijoined him.

  "I can't seem to get that picture
out of my mind," he declared, as he
continued to stare at the two
figures.

"Understandably. "

  "I don't suppose you would allow
me to live with them for a week or
two until I can finally make up my
mind? Naturally I would be quite
happy to leave a deposit."

"Of course," I said. "I would
require a bank

                2~
                 
      A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS

reference as well and the deposit
would be twentyfive thousand
pounds."

  He agreed to both requests without
hesitation so I asked him where he
would like the picture delivered.
He handed me a card which revealed
his address in Eaton Square. The
following morning his bankers
confirmed that three hundred and
seventy thousand pounds would not
be a problem for their client.

  Within twenty-four hours the
Vuillard had been taken round to
his home and hung in the dining
room on the ground floor. He phoned
back in the afternoon to thank me
and asked if Caroline and I would
care to join him for dinner; he
wanted, he said, a second opinion
on how the painting looked.

  With three hundred and seventy
thousand pounds at stake I didn't
feel it was an invitation I could
reasonably turn down, and in any
case Caroline seemed eager to
accept, explaining that she was
interested to see what his house
was like.

  We dined with Travers the
following Thursday. We turned out
to be the only guests, and I remem-
ber being surprised that there
wasn't a Mrs Travers or at least a
resident girlfriend. He was a
thoughtful host and the meal he had
arranged was superb. However, I
considered at the time that he
seemed a little too solicitous with
Caroline, although she certainly
gave the impression of enjoying his
undivided attention. At one point I
began to wonder if either of them
would have noticed if I had
disappeared into thin air.

  When we left Eaton Square that
night Travers told me that he had
almost made up his mind about

                207
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

the picture, which made me feel the
evening had served at least some
purpose.

  Six days later the painting was
returned to the gallery with a note
attached explaining that he no
longer cared for it. Travers did
not elaborate on his reasons, but
simply ended by saying that he
hoped to drop by some time and
reconsider the other Vuillards.
Disappointed, I returned his
deposit, but realised that
customers often do come back,
sometimes months, even years later.

But Travers never did.

  It was about a month later that I
learned why he would never return.
I was lunching at the large centre
table at my club, as in most
all-male establishments the table
reserved for members who drift in
on their own. Percy Fellows was the
next to enter the dining room so he
took a seat opposite me. I hadn't
seen him to talk to since the
private view of the Vuillard
exhibition and we hadn't really had
much of a conversation then. Percy
was one of the most respected
antique dealers in England and I
had once even done a successful
barter with him, a Charles II
writing desk in exchange for a
Dutch landscape by Utrillo.

I repeated how sorry I was to learn
about Diana.

  "It was always going to end in
divorce," he explained. "She was in
and out of every bedroom in London.
I was beginning to look a complete
cuckold, and that bloody man
Travers was the last straw."

"Travers?" I said, not
understanding.

  "Patrick Travers, the man named in
my divorce petition. Ever come
across him?"

"I know the name," I said
hesitantly, wanting to

                Me
                 
      A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS

hear more before I admitted to our
slight acquaintanceship.

  "Funny," he said. "Could have
sworn I saw him at the private
view."

  "But what do you mean, he was the
last straw?" I asked, trying to
take his mind off the opening.

  "Met the bloody fellow at Ascot,
didn't we? Joined us for lunch,
happily drank my champagne, ate my
strawberries and cream and then
before the week was out had bedded
my wife. But that's not the half of
it."

"The half of it?"

  "The man had the nerve to come
round to my shop and put down a
large deposit on a Georgian table.
Then he invites the two of us round
to dinner to see how it looks.
After he's had enough time to make
love to Diana he returns them both
slightly soiled. You don't look too
well, old fellow," said Percy
suddenly. "Something wrong with the
food? Never been the same since
Harry left for the Carlton. I've
written to the wine committee about
it several times but-"

  "No, I'm fine," I said. "I just
need a little fresh air. Please
excuse me, Percy."

  It was on the walk back from my
club that I decided I would have to
do something about Mr Travers.

The next morning I waited for the
mail to arrive and checked any
envelopes addressed to Caroline.
Nothing seemed untoward but then I
decided that Travers wouldn't have
been foolish enough to commit
anything to paper. I also began to
eavesdrop on her telephone
conversations, but he was not among

                209
                 
         ATWISTIN THE TALK

the callers, at least not while I
was at home. I even checked the
mileometer on her Mini to see if
she had driven any long distances,
but then Eaton Square isn't all
that far. It's often what you don't
do that gives the game away, I
decided: we didn't make love for a
fortnight, and she didn't comment.

  I continued to watch Caroline more
carefully over the next fortnight
but it became obvious to me that
Travers must have tired of her
about the same time as he had
returned the Vuillard. This only
made me more angry.

  I then formed a plan of revenge
that seemed quite extraordinary to
me at the time and I assumed that
in a matter of days I would get
over it, even forget it. But I
didn't. If anything, the idea grew
into an obsession. I began to
convince myself that it was my
bounder duty to do away with
Travers before he besmirched any
more of my friends.

  I have never in my life knowingly
broken the law. Parking fines annoy
me, dropped litter offends me and I
pay my VAT on the same day the
frightful buff envelope drops
through the letterbox.

  Nevertheless once I'd decided what
had to be done I set about my task
meticulously. At first I had
considered shooting Travers until I
discovered how hard it is to get a
gun licence and that if I did
thejob properly, he would end up
feeling very little pain, which
wasn't what I had planned for him;
then

. .

po~somag crossed my mind - but that
requires a witnessed prescription
and I still wouldn't be able to
watch the long slow death I
desired. Then strangling, which I
decided would necessitate too much
courage - and in any case he was a
bigger man than me so I might end
up being the one who

                210
                 
      A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS

was strangled. Then drowning, which
could take years to get the man
near any water and then I might not
be able to hang around to make sure
he went under for the third time. I
even gave some thought to running
over the damned man, but dropped
that idea when I realised
opportunity would be almost nil and
besides, I wouldn't be left any
time to check if he was dead. I was
quickly becoming awarejust how hard
it is to kill someoneand get away
with it.

  I sat awake at night reading the
biographies of murderers, but as
they had all been caught and found
guilty that didn't fill me with
much confidence. I turned to
detective novels which always
seemed to allow for a degree of
coincidence, luck and surprise that
I was unwilling to risk, until I
came across a rewarding line from
Conan Doyle: "Any intended victim
who has a regular routine
immediately makes himselfmore
vulnerable". And then I recalled
one routine of which Travers was
particularly proud. It required a
further six-month wait on my part
but that also gave me more time to
perfect my plan. I used the
enforced wait well because whenever
Caroline was away for more than
twenty-four hours, I booked in for
a skiing lesson on the dry slope at
Harrow.

  I found it surprisingly easy to
discover when Travers would be
returning to Verbier, and I was
able to organise the winter holiday
so that our paths would cross for
only three days, a period of time
quite sufficient for me to commit
my first crime.

Caroline and I arrived in Verbier
on the second Friday inJanuary. She
had commented on the state

                211
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

of my nerves more than once over the
Christmas period, and hoped the
holiday would help me relax. I could
hardly explain to her that it was
the thought of the holiday that was
making me so tense. It didn't help
when she asked me on the plane to
Switzerland if I thought Travers
might be there this year.

  On the first morning after our
arrival we took the ski lift up at
about ten thirty and, once we had
reached the top, Caroline duly
reported to Marcel. As she departed
with him for the A-slope I returned
to the B-slope to work on my own. As
always we agreed to meet back at the
ski lift or, if we missed each
other, at least for lunch.

  During the days that followed I
went over and over the plan I had
perfected in my mind and practiced
so diligently at Harrow until I felt
sure it was foolproof. By the end of
the first week I had convinced
myself I was ready.

The night before Travers was due to
arrive I was the last to leave the
slopes. Even Caroline commented on
how much my skiing had improved and
she suggested to Marcel that I was
ready for the A-slope with its
sharper bends and steeper mclmes.

  "Next year, perhaps," I told her,
trying to make light of it, and
returned to the B-slope.

  During the final morning I skied
over the first mile of the course
again and again, and became so
preoccupied with my work that I
quite forgot tojoin Caroline for
lunch.

  In the afternoon I checked and
rechecked the placing of every red
flag marking the run, and once

                212
                 
      A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS

I was convinced the last skier had
left the slope for the evening I
collected about thirty of the flags
and replaced them at intervals I
had carefully worked out. My final
task was to check the prepared
patch before building a large mound
of snow some twenty paces above the
chosen spot. Once my preparations
were complete I skied slowly down
the mountain in the fading light.

  "Are you trying to win an Olympic
gold medal or something?" Caroline
asked me when I eventually got back
to our room. I closed the bathroom
door so she couldn't expect a
reply.

Travers checked in to the hotel an
hour later.

  I waited until the early- evening
before I joined him at the bar for
a drink. He seemed a little nervous
when he first saw me, but I quickly
put him at ease. His old
self-confidence soon returned,
which only made me more determined
to carry out my plan. I left him at
the bar a few minutes before
Caroline came down for dinner so
that she would not see the two of
us together. Innocent surprise
would be necessary once the deed
had been done.

  "Unlike you to eat so little,
especially as you missed your
lunch," Caroline commented as we
left the dining room that night.

  I made no comment as we passed
Travers seated at the bar, his hand
on the knee of another innocent
middle-aged woman.

  I did not sleep for one second
that night and I crept out of bed
just before six the next morning,
careful not to wake Caroline.
Everything was laid out on the
bathroom floor just as I had left
it the night before. A few moments
later I was dressed and ready. I
walked down the back stairs of the

                213
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

hotel, avoiding the lift, and crept
out by the "fire exit", realising
for the first time what a thief
must feel like. I had a woollen cap
pulled well down over my ears and a
pair of snow goggles covering my
eyes: not even Caroline would have
recognised me.

  I arrived at the bottom ofthe ski
lift forty minutes before it was
due to open. As I stood alone
behind the little shed that housed
the electrical machinery to work
the lift I realised that everything
now depended on Travers's-sticking
to his routine. I wasn't sure I
could go through with it if my plan
had to be moved on to the following
day. As I waited, I stamped my feet
in the freshly fallen snow, and
slapped my arms around my chest to
keep warm. Every few moments I kept
peering round the corner of the
building in the hope that I would
see him striding towards me. At
last a speck appeared at the bottom
of the hill by the side of the
road, a pair of skis resting on the
man's shoulders. But what if it
didn't turn out to be Travers?

  I stepped out from behind the shed
a few moments later to join the
warmly wrapped man. It was Travers
and he could not hide his surprise
at seeing me standing there. I
started up a casual conversation
about being unable to sleep, and
how I thought I might as well put
in a few runs before the rush
began. Now all I needed was the ski
lift to start up on time. A few
minutes after seven an engineer
arrived and the vast oily mechanism
cranked into action.

  We were the first two to take our
places on those little seats before
heading up and over the deep
ravine. I kept turning back to
check there was still no one else
in sight.

                214
                 
      A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS

  "I usually manage to complete a
full run even before the second
person arrives," Travers told me
when the lift had reached its
highest point. I looked back again
to be sure we were now well out of
sight of the engineer working the
lift, then peered down some two
hundred feet and wondered what it
would be like to land head first in
the ravine. I began to feel dizzy
and wished I hadn't looked down.

  The ski lift jerked slowly on up
the icy wire until we finally
reached the landing point.

  "Damn," I said, as wejumpedoffour
little seats. "Marcel isn't here."

  "Never is at this time," said
Travers, making off towards the
advanced slope. "Far too early for
him."

  "I don't suppose you would come
down with me?" I said, calling
after Travers.

He stopped and looked back
suspiciously.

  "Caroline thinks I'm ready to join
you," I explained, "but I'm not so
sure and would value a second
opinion. I've broken my own record
for the B-slope several times, but
I wouldn't want to make a fool of
myself in front of my wife."

"Well, I -"

  "I'd ask Marcel if he were here.
And in any case you're the best
skier I know."

"Well, if you -" he began.

  "Just the once, then you can spend
the rest of your holiday on the
A-slope. You could even treat the
run as a warm-up."

"Might make a change, I suppose,"
he said.

  "Just the once," I repeated.
"That's all I'll need. Then you'll
be able to tell me if I'm good
enough."

"Shall we make a race of it?" he
said, taking me

                215
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

by surprise just as I began
clamping on my skis. I couldn't
complain; all the books on murder
had warned me to be prepared for
the unexpected. "That's one way we
can find out if you're ready," he
added cockily.

  "If you insist. Don't forget, I'm
older and less experienced than
you," I reminded him. I checked my
skis quickly because I knew I had
to start offin front of him.

  "But you know the B-course
backwards," he retorted. " I've
never even seen it before."

  "I'll agree to a race, but only if
you'll consider a wager," I
replied.

  For the first time I could see I
had caught his interest. "How
much?" he asked.

  "Oh, nothing so vulgar as money,"
I said. "The winner gets to tell
Caroline the truth."

"The truth?" he said, looking
puzzled.

  "Yes," I replied, and shot offdown
the hill before he could respond. I
got a good start as I skied in and
out of the red flags, but looking
back over my shoulder I could see
he had recovered quickly and was
already chasing hard after me. I
realised that it was vital for me
to stay in front of him for the
first third of the course, but I
could already feel him cutting down
my lead.

  After half a mile of swerving and
driving he shouted, "You'll have to
go a lot faster than that if you
hope to beat me." His arrogant
boast only pushed me to stay ahead
but I kept the lead only because of
my advantage of knowing every twist
and turn during that first mile.
Once I was sure that I would reach
the vital newly marked route before
he could I began to relax. After
all, I had practiced

                216
                 
      A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS

over the next two hundred metres
fifty times a day for the last ten
days, but I was only too aware that
this time was the only one that
mattered.

  I glanced over my shoulder to see
he was now about thirty metres
behind me. I began to slow slightly
as we approached the prepared ice
patch, hoping he wouldn't notice or
would think I'd lost my nerve. I
held back even more when I reached
the top of the patch until I could
almost feel the sound of his
breathing. Then, quite suddenly,
the moment before I would have hit
the ice I ploughed my skis and came
to a complete halt in the mound of
snow I had built the previous
night. Travers sailed past me at
about forty miles an hour, and
seconds later flew high into the
air over the ravine with a scream I
will never forget. I couldn't get
myselfto look over the edge as I
knew he must have broken every bone
in his body the moment he hit the
snow some hundred feet below.

  I carefully leveled the mound of
snow that had saved my life and
then clambered back up the mountain
as fast as I could go, gathering
the thirty flags that had heralded
my false route. Then I skied from
side to side replacing them in
their correct positions on the
B-slope, some one hundred metres
above my carefully prepared ice
patch. Once each one was back in
place I skied on down the hill,
feeling like an Olympic champion.
When I reached the base of the
slope I pulled up my hood to cover
my head and didn't remove my snow
goggles. I unstrapped my skis and
walked casually towards the hotel.
I re-entered the building by the
rear door and was back in bed by
seven forty.

I tried to control my breathing but
it was some

                217
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

time before my pulse had returned
to normal. Caroline woke a few
minutes later, turned over and put
her arms round me.

  "Ugh," she said, "you're frozen.
Have you been sleeping without the
covers on?"

  I laughed. "You must have pulled
them off during the night."

"Go and have a hot bath."

  After I had had a quick bath we
made love and I dressed a second
time, double-checking that I had
left no clues of my early flight
before going down to breakfast.

  As Caroline was pouring my second
cup of coffee, I heard the
ambulance siren at first coming
from the town and then later
returning.

  "Hope it wasn't a bad accident,"
my wife said, as she continued to
pour her coffee.

  "What?" I said, a little too
loudly, glancing up from the
previous day's Times.

  "The siren, silly. There must have
been an accident on the mountain.
Probably Travers," she said.

"Travers?" I said, even more
loudly.

  "Patrick Travers. I saw him at the
bar last night. I didn't mention it
to you because I know you don't
care for him."

"But why Travers?" I asked
nervously.

  "Doesn't he always claim he's the
first on the slope every morning?
Even beats the instructors up to
the top."

"Does he?" I said.

  "You must remember. We were going
up for the first time the day we
met him when he was already on his
third run."

"Was he?"

                218
                 
      A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS

  "You are being dim this morning,
Edward. Did you get out of bed the
wrong side?" she asked, laughing.

I didn't reply.

  "Well, I only hope it is Travers,"
Caroline added, sipping her coffee.
"I never did like the man."

"Why not?" I asked, somewhat taken
aback.

"He once made a pass at me," she
said casually.

I stared across at her, unable to
speak.

"Aren't you going to ask what
happened?''

  "I'm so stunned I don't know what
to say," I replied.

  "He was all over me at the gallery
that night and then invited me out
to lunch after we had dinner with
him. I told him to get lost,"
Caroline said. She touched me gently
on the hand. "I've never mentioned
it to you before because I thought
it might have been the reason he
returned the Vuillard, and that only
made me feel guilty."

  "But it's me who should feel
guilty," I said, fumbling with a
piece of toast.

  "Oh, no, darling, you're not
guilty of anything. In any case, if
I ever decided to be unfaithful it
wouldn't be with a lounge lizard
like that. Good heavens no. Diana
had already warned me what to expect
from him. Not my style at all."

  I sat there thinking of Travers on
his way to a morgue, or even worse,
still buried under the snow, knowing
there was nothing I could do about
it.

  "You know, I think the time really
has come for you to tackle the
A-slope," Caroline said as we
finished breakfast. "Your skiing has
improved beyond words."

                219
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

"Yes," I replied, more than a
little preoccupied. I hardly spoke
another word as we made our way
together to the foot of the
mountain.

  "Are you all right, darling?"
Caroline asked as we travelled up
side by side on the lift.

  "Fine," I said, unable to look
down into the ravine as we reached
the highest point. Was Travers
still down there, or already in the
morgue?

  "Stop looking like a frightened
child. After all the work you've
put in this week you're more than
ready to join me," she said
reassuringly.

  I smiled weakly. When we reached
the top, I jumped off the ski lift
just a moment too early, and knew
immediately I took my second step
that I had sprained an ankle.

  I received no sympathy from
Caroline. She was convinced I was
putting it on in order to avoid
attempting the advanced run. She
swept past me and sped on down the
mountain while I returned in
ignominy via the lift. When I
reached the bottom I glanced
towards the engineer but he didn't
give me a second look. I hobbled
over to the First Aid post and
checked in. Caroline joined me a
few minutes later.

  I explained to her that the duty
orderly thought it might be a
fracture and it had been suggested
I report to the hospital
immediately.

  Caroline frowned, removed her
skis and went off to find a taxi to
take us to the hospital. It wasn't
a longjourney but it was one the
taxi driver evidently had done many
times before from the way he took
the slippery bends.

"I ought to be able to dine out on
this for about a

                220
                 
    A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS
-
year," Caroline promised me as we
entered the double doors of the
hospital.

  "Would you be kind enough to wait
outside, madam?" asked a male
orderly as I was ushered into the
X-ray room.

  "Yes, but will I ever see my poor
husband again?" she mocked as the
door was closed in front of her.

  -I entered a room full of
sophisticated machinery presided
over by an expensively dressed
doctor. I told him what I thought
was wrong with me and he lifted the
offending foot gently up on to an
X-ray machine. Moments later he was
studying the large negative.

  "There's no fracture there," he
assured me, pointing to the bone.
"But if you are still in any pain
it might be wise for me to bind the
ankle up tightly." The doctor then
pinned my X-ray next to five others
hanging from a rail.

  "Am I the sixth person already
today?" I asked, looking up at the
row of X-rays.

  "No, no," he said, laughing. "The
other five are all the same man. I
think he must have tried to fly
over the ravine, the fool."

"Over the ravine?"

  "Yes, showing off, I suspect," he
said as he began to bind my ankle.
"We get one every year but this
poor fellow broke both his legs and
an arm, and will have a nasty scar
on his face to remind him of his
stupidity. Lucky to be alive in my
opinion."

"Lucky to be alive?" I repeated
weakly.

  "Yes, but only because he didn't
know what he was doing. My
fourteen-year-old skis over that
ravine and can land like a seagull
on water. He, on

the other hand," the doctor pointed
to the X-rays, "won't be skiing
again this holiday. In fact, he
won't be walking for at least six
months."

"Really?" I said.

  "And as for you," he added, after
he finished binding me up, "just
rest the ankle in ice every three
hours and change the bandage once a
day. You should be back on the
slopes again in a couple of days,
three at the most."

  "We're flying back this evening,"
I told him as I gingerly got to my
feet.

"Good timing," he said, smiling.

  I hobbled happily out of the X-ray
room to find Caroline head down in
Ellc.

  "You look pleased with yourself,"
she said, looking up.

  "I am. It turns out to be nothing
worse than two broken legs, a
broken arm and a scar on the face."

  "How stupid of me," said Caroline,
"I thought it was a simple sprain."

  "Not me," I told her. "Travers-
the accident this morning, you
remember? The ambulance. Still,
they assure me he'll live," I
added.

  "Pity," she said, linking her arm
through mine. "After all the
trouble you took, I was rather
hoping you'd succeed."

isn't the version I
heard," said Philip.

  One of the club
members seated at
the bar glanced
round at the sound
of raised voices,
but when he saw who
was involved only
smiled and continued
his conversation.

  The Haslemere Golf
Club was fairly
crowded that
Saturday morning.
And just before
lunch it was often
difficult to find a
seat in the spacious
clubhouse.

  Two of the members
had already ordered
their second round
and settled
themselves in the
alcove overlooking
the first hole long
before the room
began to fill up.
Philip Masters and
Michael Gilmour had
finished their
Saturday morning
game earlier than
usual and now seemed
engrossed in
conversation.

  "And what did you
hear?" asked Michael
Gilmour quietly, but
in a voice that
carried.

  "That you weren't
altogether blameless
in the matter."

  "I most certainly
was," said Michael.
"What are you
suggesting?"

         225
          
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  "I'm not suggesting anything,"
said Philip. "But don't forget, you
can't fool me. I employed you
myself once and I've known you for
far too long to accept everything
you say at face value."

  "I wasn't trying to fool anyone,"
said Michael. "It's common
knowledge that I lost my job. I've
never suggested otherwise."

  "Agreed. But what isn't common
knowledge is how you lost your job
and why you haven't been able to
find a new one."

  "I haven't been able to find a new
one for the simple reason jobs
aren't that easy to come by at the
moment. And by the way, it's not my
fault you're a success story and a
bloody millionaire."

  "And it's not my fault that you're
penniless and always out of work.
The truth is that jobs are easy
enough to come by for someone who
can supply references from his last
employer."

"Just what are you hinting at?"
said Michael.

"I'm not hinting at anything."

  Several members had stopped taking
part in the conversation in front
of them as they tried to listen to
the one going on behind them.

  "What I am saying," Philip
continued, "is that no one will
employ you for the simple reason
that you can't find anyone who will
supply you with a reference - and
everybody knows it."

  Everybody didn't know it, which
explained why most people in the
room were now trying to find out.

"I was made redundant," insisted
Michael.

  "In your case redundant was just
a euphemism for sacked. No one
pretended otherwise at the time."

                226
                 
           THE LOOPHOLE

  "I was made redundant," repeated
Michael, "for the simple reason
that the company profits turned out
to be a little disappointing this
year."

  "A little disappointing? That's
rich. They were non-existent."

  "Simply because we lost one or two
of our major accounts to rivals."

  "Rivals who, I'm informed, were
only too happy to pay for a little
inside information."

  By now most members of the club
had cut short their own
conversations as they leaned,
twisted, turned and bent in an
effort to capture every word coming
from the two men seated in the
window alcove of the club room.

  "The loss of those accounts was
fully explained in the report to
shareholders at this year's AGM,"
said Michael.

  "But was it explained to those
same shareholders how a former
employee could afford to buy a new
car only a matter of days after
being sacked?" pursued Philip. "A
second car, I might add." Philip
took a sip of his tomato juice.

  "It wasn't a new car," said
Michael defensively. "It was a
second-hand Mini and I bought it
with part of my redundancy pay when
I had to return the company car.
And in any case, you know Carol
needs her own car for the job at
the bank."

  "Frankly, I am amazed Carol has
stuck it for so long as she has
after all you've put her through."

  "All I've put her through; what
are you implying?" asked Michael.

  "I am not implying anything,"
Philip retorted. "But the fact is
that a certain young woman who
shall remain nameless" - this piece
of information

                227
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

seemed to disappoint most
eavesdroppers - "also became
redundant at about the same time,
not to mention pregnant."

  The barman had not been asked for
a drink for nearly seven minutes,
and by now there were few members
still affecting not to be listening
to the altercation between the two
men. Some were even staring in open
disbelief.

"But I hardly knew her," protested
Michael.

  "As I said, that's not the version
I heard. And what's more I'm told
the child bears a striking
resemblance -"

"That's going too far-"

  "Only if you have nothing to
hide," said Philip grimly.

"You know I've nothing to hide."

  "Not even the blonde hairs Carol
found all over the back seat of the
new Mini. The girl at work was a
blonde, wasn't she?"

  "Yes, but those hairs came from a
golden retriever."

"You don't have a golden
retriever."

  "I know, but the dog belonged to
the last owner."

  "That bitch didn't belong to the
last owner, and I refuse to believe
Carol fell for that old chestnut."

"She believed it because it was the
truth."

  "The truth, I fear, is something
you lost contact with a long time
ago. You were sacked, first because
you couldn't keep your hands off
anything in a skirt under forty,
and second, because you couldn't
keep your fingers out of the till.
I ought to know. Don't forget I had
to get rid of you for the same
reasons.

                228
                 
           THE LOOPHOLE

  Michael jumped up, his cheeks
almost the colour of Philip's
tomato juice. He raised his
clenched fist and was about to take
a swing at Philip when Colonel
Mather, the club president,
appeared at his side.

  "Good morning, sir," said Philip
calmly, rising for the Colonel.

  "Good morning, Philip," the
Colonel barked. "Don't you think
this little misunderstanding has
gone quite far enough?"

  "Little misunderstanding?"
protested Michael. "Didn't you hear
what he's been saying about me?"

  "Every word, unfortunately, like
any other member present," said the
Colonel. Turning back to Philip, he
added, "Perhaps you two should
shake hands like good fellows and
call it a day."

  "Shake hands with that
philandering, doublecrossing
shyster? Never," said Philip. "I
tell you, Colonel, he's not fit to
be a member ofthis club, and I can
assure you that you've only heard
half the story."

  Before the Colonel could attempt
another round of diplomacy Michael
sprang on Philip and it took three
men younger than the club president
to prise them apart. The Colonel
immediately ordered both men off
the premises, warning them that
their conduct would be reported to
the house committee at its next
monthly meeting. And until that
meeting had taken place, they were
both suspended.

  The club secretary, Jeremy Howard,
escorted the two men off the
premises and watched Philip get
into his Rolls-Royce and drive
sedately down the drive and out
through the gates. He had to wait

                229
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

on the steps of the club for
several minutes before Michael
departed in his Mini. He appeared
to be sitting in the front seat
writing something. When he had
eventually passed through the club
gates, the secretary turned on his
heels and made his way back to the
bar. What they did to each other
after they left the grounds was
none of his business.

  Back in the clubhouse, the
secretary found that the
conversation had not returned to
the likely winner of the
President's Putter, the seeding of
the Ladies' Handicap Cup, or who
might be prevailed upon to sponsor
the Youth Tournament that year.

  "They seemed in a jolly enough
mood when I passed them on the
sixteenth hole earlier this
morning," the club captain informed
the Colonel.

  The Colonel admitted to being
mystified. He had known both men
since the day they joined the club
nearly fifteen years before. They
weren't bad lads, he assured the
captain; in fact he rather liked
them. They had played a round of
golf every Saturday morning for as
long as anyone could remember, and
never a cross word had been known
to pass between them.

  "Pity," said the Colonel. "I was
hoping to ask Masters to sponsor
the Youth Tournament this year."

  "Good idea, but I can't see you
pulling that off now."

  "I can't imagine what they thought
they were up to."

  "Can it simply be that Philip is
such a success story and Michael
has fallen on hard times?" sug-
gested the captain.

"No, there's more to it than that,"
replied the

                230
                 
            THE LOOPHOLE

Colonel. "This morning's little
episode requires a fuller
explanation," he added sagely.

  Everyone in the club was aware that
Philip Masters had built up his own
business from scratch

  after he had left his first job as a
kitchen salesman. "Ready-Fit
Kitchens" had started in a shed at
the end of Philip's garden and ended
up in a factory on the other side of
town which employed over three
hundred people. After Ready-Fit went
public the financial press
speculated that Philip's shares
alone had to be worth a couple of
million. When five years later the
company was taken over by the John
Lewis Partnership, it became public
knowledge that Philip had walked
away from the deal with a cheque for
seventeen million pounds and a five-
year service contract that would
have pleased a pop star. Some of the
windfall had been spent on a
magnificent Georgian house in sixty
acres of woodland just outside
Haslemere: he could even see the
golf course from his bedroom. Philip
had been married for over twenty
years and his wife Sally was
chairman of the regional branch of
the Save the Children Fund and aJP.
Their son had just won a place at St
Anne's College, Oxford.

Michael was the boy's godfather.

  Michael Gilmour could not have
been a greater contrast. On leaving
school, where Philip had been his
closest friend, he had drifted from
job tojob. He started out as a
trainee with Watneys, but lasted
only a few months before moving on
to work as a rep with a publishing
company. Like Philip, he married his
childhood sweetheart, Carol West,
the daughter of a local doctor.

When their own daughter was born,
Carol

                 231
                  
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

complained about the hours Michael
spent away from home so he left
publishing and signed on as a
distribution manager with a local
soft drinks firm. He lasted for a
couple of years until his deputy
was promoted over him as area
manager, at which decision Michael
left in a huff. After his first
spell on the dole, Michael joined a
grain-packing company, but found he
was allergic to corn and, having
been supplied with a medical
certificate to prove it, collected
his first redundancy cheque. He
then joined Philip as a Ready-Fit
Kitchens rep but left without
explanation within a month of the
company being taken over. Another
spell of unemployment followed
before he took up the job of sales
manager with a company that made
microwave ovens. He seemed to have
settled down at last until, without
warning, he was made redundant. It
was true that the company profits
had been halved that year, while
the company directors were sorry to
see Michael go - or that was how it
was expressed in their in-house
magazine.

  Carol was unable to hide her
distress when Michael was made
redundant for the fourth time. They
could have done with the extra cash
now that their daughter had been
offered a place at art school.

Philip was the girl's godfather.

"What are you going to do about
it?" asked Carol anxiously, when
Michael had told her what had taken
place at the club.

  "There's only one thing I can do,"
he replied. "After all, I have my
reputation to consider. I shall sue
the bastard."

                232
                 
           THE LOOPHOLE

  "That's a terrible way to talk
about your oldest friend. And
anyway we can't afford to go to
law," said Carol. "Philip's a
millionaire and we're penniless."

  "Can't be helped," said Michael.
"I'll have to go through with it,
even if it means selling up every-
thing."

  "And even if the rest of your
family has to suffer along with
you?"

  "None of us will suffer when he
ends up paying my costs plus
massive damages."

  "But you could lose," said Carol.
"Then we would end up with nothing-
worse than nothing."

  "That's not possible," said
Michael. "He made the mistake of
saying all those things in front of
witnesses. There must have been
over fifty members in the clubhouse
this morning, including the presi-
dent of the club and the editor of
the local paper, and they couldn't
have failed to hear every word."

  Carol remained unconvinced, and
she was relieved that during the
next few days Michael didn't
mention Philip's name once. She
hoped that her husband had come to
his senses and the whole affair was
best forgotten.

  But then the Haslemere Chronicle
decided to print its version of the
quarrel between Michael and Philip.
Under the headline "Fight breaks
out at golf club" came a carefully
worded account of what had taken
place on the previous Saturday. The
editor of the Haskmere Chronicle
knew only too well that the
conversation itself was unprintable
unless he also wanted to be sued,
but he managed to include enough
innuendo in the article to give a
full flavour of what had happened
that morning.

                233
                 
A TWIST IN THE TALE

.

  "That's the final straw," said
Michael, when he finished reading
the article for a third time. Carol-
realised that nothing she could say
or do was going to stop her husband
now.

  The following Monday, Michael
contacted a local solicitor,
Reginald Lomax, who had been at
school with them both. Armed with
the article, Michael briefed Lomax
on the conversation that the
Chronicle had felt injudicious to
publish in any great detail. Michael
also gave Lomax his own detailed
account of what had happened at the
club that morning, and handed him
four pages of handwritten notes to
back his claims up.

Lomax studied the notes carefully.

"When did you write these?"

  "In my car, immediately after we
were suspended."

  "That was circumspect of you,"
said Lomax. "Most circumspect." He
stared quizzically at his client
over the top of his half-moon
spectacles. Michael made no comment.
"Of course you must be aware that
the law is an expensive pastime,"
Lomax continued. "Suing for slander
will not come cheap, and even with
evidence as strong as this" -he
tapped the notes in front of him-
"you could still lose. Slander
depends so much on what other people
remember or, more important, will
admit to remembering."

  "I'm well aware of that," said
Michael. "But I'm determined to go
through with it. There were over
fifty people in the club within
earshot that morning.

  "So be it," said Lomax. "Then I
shall require five thousand pounds
in advance as a contingency

                 234
                  
           THE LOOPHOLE

fee to cover all the immediate
costs and the preparations for a
court case." For the first time
Michael looked hesitant.

  "Returnable, of course, but only
if you win the case."

  Michael removed his cheque book
and wrote out a figure which, he
reflected, would only just be
covered by the remainder of his
redundancy pay.

  The writ for slander against
Philip Masters was issued the next
morning by Lomax, Davis and Lomax.

  A week later the writ was accepted
by another firm of solicitors in
the same town, actually in the same
building.

Back at the club, debate on the
rights and wrongs of Gilmour v.
Masters did not subside as the
weeks passed.

  Club members whispered furtively
among themselves whether they might
be called to give evidence at the
trial. Several had already received
letters from Lomax, Davis and Lomax
requesting statements about what
they could recall being said by the
two men that morning. A good many
pleaded amnesia or dearness but a
few turned in graphic accounts of
the quarrel. Encouraged, Michael
pressed on, much to Carol's dismay.

  One morning about a month later,
after Carol had left for the bank,
Michael Gilmour received a call
from Reginald Lomax. The
defendant's solicitors, he was
informed, had requested a "without
prejudice" consultation.

  "Surely you're not surprised by
that after all the evidence we've
collected?" Michael replied.

                235
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  "It's only a consultation," Lomax
reminded him.

  "Consultation or no consultation
I won't settle for less than one
hundred thousand pounds."

  "Well, I don't even know that
they-" began Lomax.

  "I do, and I also know that for
the last eleven weeks I haven't
been able to even get an interview
for a job because of that bastard,"
Michael said with contempt.
"Nothing less than one hundred
thousand pounds, do you hear me?"

  "I think you are being a trifle
optimistic, in the circumstances,"
said Lomax. "But I'll call you and
let you know the other side's
response as soon as the meeting has
taken place."

  Michael told Carol the good news
that evening, but like Reginald
Lomax she was sceptical. The
ringing of the phone interrupted
their discussion on the subject.
Michael, with Carol standing by his
side, listened carefully to Lomax's
report. Philip, it seemed, was
willing to settle for twenty-five
thousand pounds and had agreed to
paying both sides' costs.

  Carol nodded her grateful
acceptance, but Michael only
repeated that Lomax was to hold out
for nothing less than one hundred
thousand. "Can't you see that
Philip's already worked out what
it's going to cost him if this case
ends up in court? And he knows only
too well that I won't give in."

  Carol and Lomax remained
unconvinced. "It's much more touch
and go than you realise," the
solicitor told him. "A High Court
jury might consider the words were
only meant as banter."

                236
                 
           THE LOOPHOLE

  "Banter? But what about the fight
that followed the banter?" said
Michael.

  "Started by you," Lomax pointed
out. "Twentyfive thousand is a good
figure in the circumstances," he
added.

  Michael refused to budge, and
ended the conversation by repeating
his demand for one hundred thousand
pounds.

  Two weeks passed before the other
side offered fifty thousand in
exchange for a quick settlement.
This time Lomax was not surprised
when Michael rejected the offer out
of hand. "Quick settlement be
damned. I've told you I won't
consider less than a hundred
thousand." Lomax knew by now that
any plea for prudence was going to
fall on deaf ears.

  It took three more weeks and
several more phone calls between
solicitors before the other side
accepted that they were going to
have to pay the full one hundred
thousand pounds. Reginald Lomax
rang Michael to inform him of the
news late one evening, trying to
make it sound as if he had scored a
personal triumph. He assured
Michael that the necessary papers
could be drawn up immediately and
the settlement signed in a matter
of days.

  '`Naturally all your costs will be
covered," he added.

"Naturally," said Michael.

  "So all that is left for you to do
now is agree on a statement."

  A short statement was penned and,
with the agreement of both sides,
issued to the Haslemerc Chronicle.
The paper printed the contents the
following Friday on its front page.
"The writ for slander between
Gilmour and Masters," the

                237
                 
         A TWIST IN THE TALE

Chronicle "has been withdrawn with
the agreement of both sides but only
after a substantial out-of-court
settlement by the defendant. Philip
Masters has withdrawn unreservedly
what was said at the club that
morning and has given an
unconditional apology; he has also
made a promise that he will never
repeat the words used again. Mr-
Masters has paid the plaintiffs
costs in full."

  Philip wrote to the Colonel the
same day, admitting perhaps he had
had a little too much to drink on
the morning in question. He
regretted his impetuous outburst,
apologised and assured the club's
president it would never happen
again.

  Carol was the only one who seemed
to be saddened by the outcome.

  "What's the matter, darling?"
asked Michael. "We've won, and
what's more it's solved our
financial problems."

  "I know," said Carol, "but is it
worth losingyour closest friend for
one hundred thousand pounds?"

  On the following Saturday morning
Michael was pleased to find an
envelope among his morning post with
the GolfClub crest on the flap. He
opened it nervously and pulled out
a single sheet of paper. It read:

Dear Mr Gilmour,

At the monthly committee meeting
held last

Wednesday Colonel Mather raised the
matter of

your behaviour in the clubhouse on
the morning

of Saturday, April 16th.

It was decided to minute the
complaints of.

several members, but on this
occasion only to

issue a severe reprimand to you
both. Should a

           THE LOOPHOLE

similar incident occur in the
future, loss of membership would
be automatic.

  The temporary suspension issued
by Colonel Matheron April 16th is
now lifted. Yours sincerely,

Jay 4~ -
Jeremy Howard (Secretary)

  "I'm offto do the shopping,"
shouted Carol from the top of the
stairs. "What are your plans for
the morning?"

  "I'm going to have a round of
golf," said Michael, folding up the
letter.

  "Good idea," said Carol to herself
as she wondered whom Michael would
find to play against in the future.

Quite a few members noticed Michael
and Philip teeing up at the first
hole that Saturday morning. The
club captain commented to the
Colonel that he was glad to observe
that the quarrel had been sorted
out to everyone's satisfaction.

  "Not to mine," said the Colonel
under his breath. "You can't get
drunk on tomato juice."

  "I wonder what the devil they can
be talking about?" the club captain
said as he stared at them both
through the bay windows. The
Colonel raised his binoculars to
take a closer look at the two men.

"How could you possibly miss a
four-foot putt, dummy?" asked
Michael when they had reached the
first green. "You must be drunk
again."

                239
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

  "As you well know," replied
Philip, "I never drink before
dinner, and I therefore suggest
that your allegation that I am
drunk again is nothing less than
slander."

  "Yes, but where are your
witnesses?" said Michael as they
moved up on to the second tee. "I
had over fifty, don't forget."

Both men laughed.

  Their conversation ranged over
many subjects as they played the
first eight holes, never once
touching on their past quarrel
until they reached the ninth green,
the farthest point from the club-
house. They both checked to see
there was no one within earshot.
The nearest player was still
putting out some two hundred yards
behind them on the eighth hole. It
was then that Michael removed a
bulky brown envelope from his golf
bag and handed it over to Philip.

  "Thank you," said Philip, dropping
the package into his own golf bag
as he removed a putter. "As neat a
little operation as I've been
involved in for a long time,"
Philip added as he addressed the
ball.

  "I end up with forty thousand
pounds," said Michael grinning,
"while you lose nothing at all."

  "Only because I pay tax at the
highest rate and can therefore
claim the loss as a legitimate
business expense," said Philip,
"and I wouldn't have been able to
do that if I hadn't once employed
you."

  "And I, as a successful litigant,
need pay no tax at all on damages
received in a civil case."

  "A loophole that even this
Chancellor hasn't caught on to,"
said Philip.

  "Even though it went to Reggie
Lomax, I was sorry about the
solicitors' fees," added Michael.

                240
                 
           THE LOOPHOLE

  "No problem, old fellow. They're
also one hundred per cent claimable
against tax. So as you see, I
didn't lose a penny and you ended
up with forty thousand pounds tax
free."

  "And nobody the wiser," said
Michael, laughing.

The Colonel put his binoculars back
into their case. "Had your eye on
this year's winner of the
President's Putter, Colonel?" asked
the club captain.

  "No," the Colonel replied. "The
certain sponsor of this year's
Youth Tournament."

 CHRISTINA ROSENTHAL

               THE
rabbi knew he
couldn't hope to
begin on his sermon
he'd read the
letter. He had been
sitting at his desk
in front of a blank
sheet of paper for
over an hour and
still couldn't come
up with a first
sentence. Lately he
had been unable to
concentrate on a
task he had carried
out every Friday
evening for the last
thirty years. They
must have realised
by now that he was
no longer up to it.
He took the letter
out of the envelope
and slowly unfolded
the pages. Then he
pushed his half-moon
spectacles up the
bridge of his nose
and started to read.

My dear Father,

  'Jew boy.'Jew
boy.'Jew boy!" were
the first words I
ever heard her say
as I ran past her on
the f rst lap of the
race. She was
standing behind the
railing at the
beginning of the
home straight, hands
cupped around her
lips to be sure I
couldn't miss the
chant. She must have
come from another
school because I
didn't recognise
her, but it only
took a fleeting
glance to see that
it was Greg Reynolds
who was standing by
her side.

Afterioeyears of
having to tolerate
his mice comments

245

        A TWIST IN THE TALE

and bullying at school all I wanted
to retaliate with was, "Nazi, Nazi,
Nazi, " butyou had always taught me
to rise above such provocation.

  I tried to put them both out of my
mind as I mooed into the second lap.
I had dreamedforyears of winning the
mile in the West Mount High School
championships, and I was determined
not to let them do anything to stop
me.

  As I came into the back straight
a second time I took a more careful
look at her. She was standing amid
a cluster of friends who were
wearing the scarves of Marianapolis
Gnoeat. She must have been about
sixteen, and as slim as a willow. I
wonder if you would inane chastised
me had l only shouted, "No breasts,
no breasts, no breasts, " in the
hope it might at least provoke the
boy standing next to her into a
fight. Then I would have been able
to tellyou truthfully that be had
thrown the f rst punch but the
momentyou had learned that it was
Greg Reynoldsyou would ham realised
how little provocation I needed.

  As I reached the back straight I
once again prepared myself for the
chants. Chanting at track meetings
had become fashionable in the lad
1950s when "Zat-o-pek, Zat-o-pek,
Zat-o-pek " had been roared in
adulation across running stadiums
around the world for the great Czech
champion. Not for me was there to be
the shout of "Ros-en-thal,
Ros-en-thal, Ros-en-thal" as I came
into earshot.

  'Jew boy!Jew boy!Jew boy!"she
said, sounding like a gramophone
record that had got stuck. Herfriend
Greg, who would nowadays be
described as a preppie, began
laughing. I knew he hadput her up to
it, and how I would life to have
removed that smug grin from his
face. I reached the half-mile mark
in two minutes seventeen seconds,
comfortably inside the pace
necessary to break the school
record, and If elt that was the best
way to put the tauntinggirl and that

                216
                 
        CHRISTINA ROSENTHAL

fascist Reynolds in their place. I
couldn't ,ieip thinking at the time
how unfair it all was. I was a real
Canadian, born and bred in this
county, while she was just an
immigrant. After all,you, Father,
had escapedfrom Hamburg in 1937 and
started with nothing. Her parents
did not land on these shores until
1949, by which timeyou were a
resieetedigure in the community.

  I gritted my teeth and tried to
concentrate. Zatotek had written in
his autobiography that no runner
can afford to lose his
concentration during a race. When I
reached the penultimate bend the
inevitable chanting began again,
but this time it only made me steed
up and even more determined to
break that record. Once I was back
in the safety of the home straight
I could hear some of my friends
roaring, "Come on, Benjamin,you can
do it," and the timekeeper called
out, "Three twenty-three, three
twenty-four, three twenty-/ye" as I
passed the bell to begin the last
lap.

  I knew that the record -four
thirty-two - was now well within my
"rasp and all those dark nights
oSwinter training suddenly seemed
worthwhile. As I reached the back
straight I took the lead, and
eoenSeit that I couldface thegirl
again. I summoned up my strength
for one last effort. A quick glance
over my shoulder confirmed I was
alreadyyards in front of any of my
rivals, so it was only me against
the clock. Then I heard the
chanting, but this time it was even
louder than before, '~Jew boy! Jew
boy! Jew boy!" It was louder
because the two of them were now
working in unison, and just as I
came round the bend Reynolds raised
his ann in a flagrant Nazi salute.

  If I had only carried onfor
another twentyyards I would hare
reached the safety of the home
straight and the cheers of
myfriends, the cup and the record.
But they had made me so angy that I
could no longer control myself

I shot of A the track and ran
across the grass over the

                247
                 
         A TWIST IN THE TALE

long-jump pit and straight towards
them. At Cast my crazy decision
stopped their charting because
Reynolds lowered his arm and just
stood there staring pathetically at
me from behind the small railing
that surrounded the outer perimeter
of the track. I leaped right over it
and landed in front of my adversay.
With all the energy I had saved for
the final straight I took an
almighty swing at him. My fist
landed an inch below his left eye
and he buckled and jell to the
ground by herside. Quickly she knelt
down and, staring up, gave me a look
of such hatred that no words could
have matched it. Once I was sure
Greg wasn't going to get up, I
walled slowly back on to the track
as the last of the runners were
coming round theinal bend.

  "Last again, Jew boy, " I heard
her shout as I jogged down the home
straight, so far behind the others
that they didn't coen bother to
record my time.

  How often since haveyou quoted me
those words: "Still have I borne it
with a patient shrug, for sufferance
is the badge of all our tribe ". Of
courseyou were right, but I was only
seventeen then, and even after I had
learned the truth about Christina's
father I still couldn't understand
how anyone who had comefrom a
defeated Germany, a Germany
condemned by the rest of the
worldfor its treatment of the Jews,
could still behave in such a manner.
And in those days I really believed
herfamily were Nazis, but I
remcmberyou patiently explaining to
me that her father had been an
admiral in the German navy, and had
won an Iron Crossfor sinking Allied
ships. Doyou remember me asking how
could you tolerate such a man, let
alone allow him to settle down in
our county?

  You went on to assure me that
Admiral non Braumer, who camefrom an
old Roman Catholiefamily andprobably
despised the Nazis as much as we
did, had acquitted himself
honourably as an of ficcr and a
gentleman throughout his life

as a German sailor. But I still
couldn't aceeptyourattitudr, or
didn't want to.

  It didn't help, Father, that you
always saw the other man's point of
view, and even though Mother had
died prematurely because of those
bastardsyou could stilly nd it
inyou to forgive.

  If you had been born a
Christian,you would have been a
saint.

The rabbi put the letter down and
rubbed his tired eyes before he
turned over another page written in
that fine script that he had taught
his only son so many years before.
Benjamin had always learned
quickly, everything from the Hebrew
scriptures to a complicated
algebraic equation. The old man had
even begun to hope the boy might
become a rabbi.

Do you remember my asking you that
evening why people couldn't
understand that the world had
changed? Didn't the girl realise
that she was no better than we
were? I shall never forgetyour
reply. She is,you said, far better
than us, if the only wayyou can
ptooeyoursuperiority is to punch
herfriend in the face.

  I returned to my room angered
byyour weakness. It was to be many
years before I understoodyour
strength.

  When I wasn't pounding round that
track I rarely had time for
anything other than working for a
scholarship to McGill, so it came
as a surprise that her path crossed
mine again so soon.

  It must have been about a week
later that I saw her at the local
swimming pool. She was standing at
the deep end, just under the diving
board, when I came in. Her long
fair hair was dancing on her
shoulders, her bright eyes eagerly
taking in everything going on
around her. Greg was by her side. I

                249
                 
         A TWIST IN THE TALE

was pleased to notice a deep purple
patch remained under his left eye
for all to sec. I also remember
chuckling to myself because she
really did have the flattest chest
I had doer seen on a
sixteen-year-old girl, though I have
to confess she had fantastic legs.
Perhaps she's a freak, I thought. I
turned to go in to the changing room
- a split second before I hit the
water. When I came up for breath
there was no sign of who had pushed
me in, just a group of grinning but
innocent faces. I didn't need a law
degree to work out who it must haac
been, but as you constantly reminded
me, Father, without evidence there
is no proof . . . I wouldn't have
minded that much about being pushed
into the pool if I hadn't been
wearing my best suit - in truth, my
only suit with long trousers, the
one I wore on days I was going to
the synagogue.

  I climbed out of the water but
didn't waste any time looking
roundfor him. I knew Greg would be
a long way off by then. I walked
home through the back streets,
avoiding taking the bus in case
someone saw me and toldyou what a
state I was in. As soon as I got
home I crept pastyour study and on
upstairs to my room, changing
beforcyou had the chance to discover
what had taken place.

  Old Isaac Cohen gaac me a
disapproving look when I turned up
at the synagogac an hour later
wearing a blazer and jeans.

  I took the suit to the cleaners
the next morning. It cost me three
weeks' pocket money to be sure
thatyou were never aware of what had
happened at the swimming pool that
day.

The rabbi picked up the picture of
his seventeenyear-old son in that
synagogue suit. He well remembered
Benjamin turning up to his service
in a blazer and jeans and Isaac
Cohen's outspoken reprimand. The
rabbi was thankful that Mr. Atkins,

                 250
                  
        CHRISTINA ROSENTHAL

the swimming instructor, had phoned
to warn him of what had taken place
that afternoon so at least he
didn't add to Mr Cohen's harsh
words. He continued gazing at the
photograph for a long time before
he returned to the letter.

The next occasion l saw Christina -
by now I hadfound out her name -
was at the end-of-term dance held
in the school gymnasium. I thought
I looted pretty cool in my neatly
pressed suit until I saw Greg
standing by her side in a smart new
dinner jacket. I remember wondering
at the time if I would ever be able
to afford a dinnerjaciet. Greg had
been offered a place at McGill and
was announcing the fact to Depone
who cared to listen, which made me
all the more determined to win a
scholarship there the
followingyear.

  I stared at Christina. She was
wearing a long red dress that
completely covered those beautiful
Iegs. A thin gold belt emphasized
her tiny waist and the only
jewelers she wore was a simple gold
necklace. I knew if I waited a
moment longer I wouldn't have the
courage to go through with it. I
clenched my fists, walled over to
where they were sitting, and asyou
had always taught me, Father, bowed
slightly before I asked, "May I
have the pleasure of this dance?"

  She stared into my eyes. I swear
if she had told me to go out and
kill a thousand men before I dared
ask her again I would inane done
it.

  She didn't even speak, but Greg
leaned over her shoulder and said,
"Why don 'tyougo and.findyourself a
niceJewish girl?" I thought I saw
her scowl at his remark, but I only
blushed like someone who's been
caught with their hands in the
cookie jar. I didn't dance with
anyone that night. I walled
straight out of the gymnasium and
ran home.

I was convinced then that I hated
her.

That last week of term I broke the
school recordfor the

                251
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

mile. You were there to watch me
but, thank heavens, she wasn't.
That was the holiday we drone over
to Ottawa to steed our summer
vacation with Aunt Rebecca. I was
told by a schoolfriend that
Christina had spent hers in
Vancouver with a Germanfamily. At
least Greg had notgone with her,
thefriend assured me.

  You went on reminding me of the
importance of a good education,
butyou didn't need to, because eoey
time I saw Greg it made me more
determined to win that scholarship.

  I worded even harder in the summer
of '65 when you explained that, for
a Canadian, a place at McGill was
like going to Harvard or Oxford and
would clear a path for the rest of
my days.

For theirst time in my life running
too/r. second place.

  Although I didn't see much of
Christina that term she was often
in my mind. A classmate told me
that she and Greg were no longer
seeing each other, but could give
me no reason for this sudden change
of heart. At the time I had a
so-called girlfriend who always sat
on the other side of the synagogue
- Naomi Goldblatz,you remember her
- but it was she who dated me.

  As my exams drew nearer, I
wasgrateful thatyou always found
time to go over my essays and tesk
after I had finished them. What you
couldn't know was that I inevitably
returned to my own room to do them
a third time. Often I wouldfall
asleep at my desk. When I woke I
would turn over the page and read
on.

  Evenyou, Father, who have not an
ounce of vanity inyou, found it
hard to disguise fromyour
congregation the pride you took in
my eight straight "A 's" and the
award of a top scholarship to
McGill. I wondered if Christina was
aware of it. She mast have been. My
name was painted up on the Honours
Board in fresh gold leaf the
following week, so someone would
have told her.

CHRISTINA ROSENTHAL

.

It must have been three months
lakercn I was in my.first term at
McGill that I saw her next. Do you
remember taking me to St Joan at the
Centaur Theatrc? There she was,
seated a few rows in front of us with
her parents and a sophomore called
Bob Richards. The admiral and his
wife looked strait-laced and vcy
stern but not unsympathetic. In the
interval I watched her laughing and
joking with them: she had obviously
enjoyed herself. I hardly saw St
Joan, and although I couldn't take my
eyes off Christina she Ricer ones
noticed mc. I just wanted to be on
the stage playing the Dauphin so she
would have to look up at mc.

  When the curtain came down she and
Bob Richards left her parents and
hcadedfor the exit. If ollowed the
two of them out of thefoyer and into
the carpark, and watched them get
into a Thunderbird. A Thunderbird! I
remember thinking I might one day he
able to afford a dinner jacket, but
nencr a Thunderbird.

  From that moment she was in my
thoughts wicneucr I trained, wherever
I worded and corn when I slept. If
ound out cocrything I could about Bob
Richards and discovered that he was
liked by all who knew him.

For the first time in my life I hated
being a Jcw.

  When I next saw Christina I dreaded
what might happen. It was the start
of the mile against the University of
T7ancouncr and as a freshman I had
been lucky to be selected for McGill.
When I came out on to the track to
warm up I saw her sitting in the
third row of the stand alongside
Richards. They were holding hands.

  I was last off when the starter's
gun fired but as we went into the
back straight mooed up intofifth
position. It was the largest crowd I
had hoer run in front of, and when I
reached the home straight I waitedfor
the chant 'Jew boy.'Jcw boy! Jew
boy!" but nothing happened. I
wondered if she had failed to notice
that I was in the race. But she had
noticed

                 253
                  
         A TWIST IN THE TALE

because as I came round the bend I
could hear her mice clearly. "Come
on, Benjamin, you've got to winl"
she shouted.

  I wanted to look back to make sure
it was Christina who had called
those words; it would be another
quarter of a mile before I could
pass her again. By the time I did so
I had mooed up into third place, and
I could hear her clearly: "Come on,
Benjamin,you can do it!"

  I immediately took the lead
because all I wanted to do was get
back to her. I charged on without
thought of who was behind me, and by
the time Ipassed her the third time
I was seoeralyards ahead of they'll
"You 're going to win!"she shouted
as I ran on to reach the bell in
three minutes eight seconds, eleven
seconds faster than I had ever done
before. 1 remember thinking that
they ought to put something in those
training manuals about lone being
worth two to three seconds a lap.

  I watched her all the way down the
back straight and when I came into
thermal bendfor the last time the
crowd rose to theirieet. I turned to
searchforier. She wasjumping up and
down shouting, "Look out! Look out!"
which I didn't understand until I
was overtaken on the inside by the
VancouaerNumber One string who the
coach had warned me was renownedfor
his strong finish. I staggered over
the line a fewyards behind him in
second place but went on running
until I was safely inside the
changing room. I sat alone by my
locker. Four minutes seventeen,
someone told me: six seconds faster
than I had ever run before. It
didn't help. I stood in the
showerfor a long time, tying to work
out what could possibly have changed
her attitude.

  When I walked back on to the track
only the ground staff were still
around I took one last look at the
finishing line before I strolled
over to the Forsyth Library. If elt
unable to face the usual team
get-together, so I bird to settle
down to

        CHRISTINA ROSENTHAL

write an essay on the rights of
married women.

  The libray was almost empty that
Saturday horning and I was well
into my third page when I heard a
voice say, "I hole I'm not
intcrruptingyou butyou didn't come
to Joe's. " Hooked up to see
Christina standing on the other
side of the table. Father, I didn't
know what to say. Ijwt stared up at
the beautiful creature in
herfashionable blue mini-skirt and
tight-.fitting sweater that
emphasised the most perfect
breasts, and said nothing.

  "I was the one who shouted 'Jew
boy 'whenyou were still at High
School. I've felt ashamed about it
ever sines. I wanted to apologist
toyou on the night of the prom
dance but couldn't summon up the
courage with Greg standing there. "
I nodded my understanding - I
couldn't think of any words that
seemed appropriate. "I near spoke
to him again, " she said. "But I
don't supposeyou even remember
Greg. "

  Ijust smiled. "Careforcoffee?"l
asked, tying to sound as if I
wouldn't mint if she replied, "I'm
very, I must get back to Bob. "

"I'd like that very much, " she
said.

  I took her to the library coffee
shop, which was about all I could
afford at the time. She never
bothered to explain what had
happened to Bob Richards, and I
never asked.

  Christina seemed to know so much
about me that Ifelt embarrassed.
She asked me to forgive her for
what she had shouted on the track
that day twoyears before. She made
no excuses, placed the blame on no
one else, just asked to be
forgiocn.

  Christina told me she was hoping
to join me at McGill in September,
to major in German. "Bit of a
cheek," she admitted, "as it is my
native tongue. "

  Wc spent the rest of that summer
in each other's company. Wc saw St
Joan again, and coen queuedfor a
film called Dr No that was all the
craze at the time. Wc worked

                255
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

together, we together, we played
together, but we slept alone.

  I said littic about Christina
toyou at the time, but I'd bet you
knew already how much I loved her;
I could netter hide
anythingfromyou. And after allyour
teaching offorgiacncss and
understandingyou could hard)
disapprove.

The rabbi paused. His heart ached
because he knew so much of what was
still to come although he could not
have foretold what would happen in
the end. He had never thought he
would live to regret his Orthodox
upbringing but when Mrs Goldblatz
first told him about Christina he
had been unable to mask his
disapproval. It will pass, given
time, he told her. So much for
wisdom.

Wheneocr I went to Christina's home
I was always toward with courtesy
but her family were unabic to hide
their disapproval. They stirred
words they didn't belieoc in an
attempt to show that they were not
anti-semitic, and wicncocr I
brought up the subject with
Christina she told me I was
oncr-rcacting. We both knew I
wasn't. They quip simply thought I
was unworthy of their daughter.
They were right, but it had nothing
to do with my being Jewish.

  I shall neocrforget thcirst time
we made loan. It was tic day that
Christina learned she had won a
place at McGill.

  We had gone to my room at three
o'clock to changcfor a game of
tennis. I took her in my armsfor
what I thought would be a brief
moment and we didn't part until the
next morning. Nothing had been
planned. But how could it had been,
when it was the first timefor both
of us?

  I told her I would marry her-
don't all men thcfirst time? - only
I meant it.

Then afew weeks later she missed
her period I begged

                256
                 
        CHRISTINA ROSENTHAL

her not to panic, and we both
waitedfor another month because she
was fearful of going to see any
doctor in Montreal.

  If l had toldyou cacrything then,
Father, perhaps my life would have
taken a different course. But I
didn't, and have only myself to
blame.

  I began to plan for a marriage
that neither Christina's family
noryou couldpossibly haarfound
acceptable, but we didn't care. Loon
knows no parents, and certainly no
religion. When she missed her second
period I agreed Christina should
tell her mother. I asked her if she
would like me to be with her at the
time, but she simply shook her head,
and explained that shefelt she had
tofacc them on her own.

"I'll wait here untilyou return, "
I promised.

  She smiled. "I'll be back coen
beforcyou'vc had the time h
changryour mind about marrying mc.
"

  I sat in my room at McGill all
that afternoon reading and pacing -
mostly pacing - but she never came
back, and I didn'tgo in search of
her until it was dark. I crept round
to her home, all the while trying to
convince myself there must be some
simple explanation as to why she
hadn't rctururd

  When I reached her road I could
see a light on in her bedroom but
nowhere else in the house so I
thought she must be alone. I marched
through the gate and up to the front
porch, knocked on the door and
waited.

Her father answered the door.

  "What doyou want?" he asked, his
eyes never leaving me for a moment.

  "I loncyour daughter, "I told
him, "and I want to marry her. "

  "She will never marry a Jew, " he
said simply and closed the door. I
remember that be didn't slam it;
Adjust closed it, which made it
somehow born worse.

                257
                 
         A TWIST IN THE TALE

  l stood outside in the road
staring up at her roomfor over an
hour until the light went out. Then
I walked home. I recall there was a
light drizzle that night andirw
pcopic were on the streets. I tried
to work out what I should do next,
although the situation seemed
hopeless to mc. I went to bed
thatnighthopingfora miracle. I
hadforgotten that miracles arefor
Christians, not Jews.

  By the next morning I had worked
out a plan. I phoned Christina's
home at eight and nearly put the
phone down when I heard the voice at
the other end.

"Mrs con Braumer, " she said.

"Is Christina there?" I asked in a
whisper.

  "No, she's not," came back the
controlled impersonal reply.

"When arcyou expecting her back?" 1
asked.

  "Notfor some time, " she said, and
then the phone went dead.

  "Notforsomc timc"turned out to be
oocraycar. I wrote, tcirphoned,
asked friends from school and
uniocrsity but could ncocr~ind out
where they had taken her.

  Then one day, unannounced, she
returned to Montreal accompanied by
a husband and my child. I learned
the bitter detailsfrom thatfont of
all knowledge, Naomi Goldblatz, who
had already seen all three of them.

  I reccioed a short notefrom
Christina about a week later begging
me not to matc any attempt to
contact her.

  I had just begun my lastyear at
McGill and like some
eightecnth-centay gentleman I
honoured her wish to the letter and
turned all my energies to the final
exams. She still continued to
preoccupy my thoughts and I
considered myself lucky at the end
of theyear to be offered a place at
Harvard Law School.

I left Montrealfor Boston on
September 12th, 1968.

You must have wondered why I never
came home onsc

                 258
                  
        CHRISTINA ROSENTHAL

during those three years. I knew of
your disapproval. Thanks to Mrs
Goldblatz cocryonc was aware who the
father of Christina's child was and
I felt an cuforecd absence might
male life a little easier foryou.

The rabbi paused as he remembered
Mrs Goldblatz letting him know what
she had considered was "only her
duty".

  "You're an interfering old
busybody," he had told her. By the
following Saturday she had moved to
another synagogue and let everyone
in the town know why.

  He was more angry with himself
than with Benjamin. He should have
visited Harvard to let his son know
that his love for him had not
changed. So much for his powers of
forgiveness.

He took up the letter once again.

Throughout thoseyears at law school
I hadplenty offricads of both sexes,
but Christina was rarely out of my
mindfor more than afew hours at a
time. I wrote oocrforty letters to
her while I was in Boston, but
didn't post one of them. I coen
phoned, but it was never her voice
that answered. Wit had been, I'm not
even sure I would haac said
anything. I just wanted to hear her.

  Wcrcyou cocr curious about the
women in my life? I had affairs with
bright gird from Radeliffc who were
reading law, histoy or science, and
ones with a shop assistant who Ricer
read anything. Can you imagine, in
the very act of making loon, always
thinking of another woman? I seemed
to be doing my work on autopilot,
and corn my passion for running
became reduced to an hour's jagging
a day.

  Long before the cud of my
lastyrar, leading lawf rms in New
York, Chicago and Toronto were
turning up to

                259
                 
        A TWIST IN THE TALE

interview us. The Harvard tom-tome
can beelird on to beat across the
world, but even I was surprised by
a visitfrom the senior partner of
Graham Douglas &? Wilkins of
Toronto. It's not a firm knownfor
itsJewish partners, but l liked the
idea of their letterhead one day
reading "Graham Douglas Wilkins (Y
Rosenthal". Even herfather would
surely have been impressed by that.

  At least if I lived and worked in
Toronto, I convinced myself, it
would befar enough awayfor me
toforget her, and perhaps with luck
find someone eye I couldfeel that
way about.

  Graham Douglas &, Wilkins found me
a spacious apartment overlooking the
park and started me off at a
handsome salad. In return I worked
all the hours God -whoeoer's God -
made. Hi thought they had pushed me
at McGill or Harvard, Father, it
turned out to be no more than a dy
run for the real world. I didn't
complain. The work was exciting, and
the rewards beyond my expectation.
Only now that I could afford a
Thunderbird l didn't want one.

  New girlfriends came, and went as
soon as they talked of marriage. The
Jewish ones usually raised the
subject within a week, the Gentiles,
If ound, waited a little longer. I
even began living with one of them,
Rebecca Hertz, but that too ended -
on a Thursday.

  I was driving to the of dice that
morning - it must have been a little
after eight, which was latefor me -
when I saw Christina on the other
side of the busy highway, a barrier
separating us. She was standing at
a bus stop holding the hand of a
little boy, who must have been
aboutfive - my son.

  The heavy morning traffic allowed
me a little longer to stare in
disbelief If ound that I wanted to
look at them both at once. She wore
a long lightweight coat that showed
she had not lost her figure. Her
face was serene and only reminded me
why she was rarely out of my
thoughts. Her son

                260
                 
        CHRISTINA ROSENTHAL

- our son - was wrapped up in an
oversizeuffle coat and his head was
covered by a baseball hat that
informed me that he supported the
Toronto Dolphins. Sadly, it really
stopped me seeing what he looked
like. You can't be in Toronto, I
remember thinking, you're meant to
be in Montreal. I watched them both
in my side-mirror as they climbed
on to a bus. That particular
Thursday I must have been an appal-
ling counsellor to eoey client who
sought my advice.

  For the next week I passed by that
bus stop evey morning within
minutes of the time I had seen them
standing there but never saw them
again. I began to wonder if I had
imagined the whole scene. Then I
spotted Christina again when I was
returning across the city, having
visited a client. She was on her
own and I braked hard as I watched
her entering a shop on Bloor
Street. This time I double-parted
the car and walked quickly across
the roadJeeling like a sleazy
private detective who steeds his
life peeping through keyholes.

  What I saw took me by surprise -
not to find her in a beautiful
dress shop, but to discover it was
where she worded.

  The moment I saw that she was
serving a customer I hurried back
to my car. Once I had reached my
ounce I asked my secretary if she
knew of a shop called "Willing's".

  My secretay laughed. "You must
pronounce it the German way, the W
becomes a V, " she explained, "thus
'Villing's'. If you were marriedyou
would know that it's the most
expensive dress shop in town, " she
added.

  "Doyou know anything else about
the place?" 1 asked, tying to sound
casual.

  "Not a lot," she said. "Only that
it is owned by a wealthy German

  I didn't need to ask my secretay
any more questions and I won't
trouble you, Father, with my

        A TWIST IN THE TALE

 armed with those snippets of
information, it didn't talc me long
to discover warm Christina liacd,
that her husband was an overseas
director with BMW, and that they
only hat the one child.

 The old rabbi breathed deeply as
he glanced up at the clock on his
desk, more out of habit than any
desire to know the time. He paused
for a moment before returning to
the letter. He had been so proud of
his lawyer son then; why hadn't he
made the first step towards a
reconciliation? How he would have
liked to have seen his grandson.

 My ultimate decision did not
require an acute legal mind, just a
little common sense - although a
lawyer who advises himself
undoubtedly has a fool for a
client. Contact, I decided, had to
be direct and a letter was the only
method I felt Christina would find
aceeptabic.

  I wrote a simple message that
Monday morning, then rewrote it
several times before I telephoned
"Fleet Dcliveries"and asked them to
hand it to her in person at the
shop. When theyoung man left with
the letter I wanted tofollow him,
just to be certain he had given it
to the right person. I can still
repeat it wordfor word.

Dear Christina,

  You must know I live and work in
Toronto. Can we meet? I will
waitforyou in the lounge of the
Royal York Hotel every evening
between six and seven this week. If
you don't come be assured I will
never trouble you again.

         CHRISTINA ROSENTHAL

  I arrived that evening nearly
thirty minutes early. I remember
taking a scat in a large impersonal
lounge jwt off the main hall and
ordering coffee.

"Will anyone be joiningyou, sir?"
the waiter asked.

  "I can't besurc,"I told him. No
one didjoin me, but I still hung
around until seven forty.

  By Thursday the wailer had stopped
asking if anyone would be joining me
as I sat alone and allowedyet
another cup of coffer to grow cold.
Every few minutes I checked my
watch. Each time a woman with blonde
hair entered the lounge my heart
Caped but it was never the woman I
hosed Jor.

  It was jwt before seven on Friday
that l.[nally saw Christina standing
in the doorway. Shc WOK a smart blue
suit buttoned up almost to the neck
and a while blouse that made her
look as if she were on her way to a
business confcrcnec. Her long fair
hair was pulled back behind her cars
to give an impression of severity,
but however hard she tried she could
not be other than beautiful. I stood
and raised my arm. Shc walked
quickly over and took the seat
beside mc. We didn't kiss or shake
hands andfor some time didn't corn
steak.

"Thankyou for coming," I said.

"I shouldn't have, it was foolish.
"

Some time passed before either of us
spoke again.

"Can I pouryou a comics?" l asked.

"Yes, thankyou."

"Black?"

"Yes. "

"You haven't changed. "

  How banal it all would have
sounded to anyone cacesdropping.

Shc sipped her cosmic.

I should haul taken her in my arms
right then but I had no
              263

way of knowing that that was what
she wanted. For several minutes we
of inconsequential maters, always
avoiding each other's eyes, until I
suddenly said, "Doyou realist that
I still loveyou?"

  Tears filled her eyes as she
replied, "Of course l do. And l
stillfeel the same aboutyou now as
I did the day we parted. And don't
forget I have to see you every day,
through Nicholas. "

  She leanedforward and spoke almost
in a whisper. She told me about the
meeting with her parents that had
taken place more thaniveyeaN before
as if we had not been parted in
between. Herfather had shown no
anger when he learned she was
pregnant but thefamily still leftfor
Vancouver the following morning.
There they had stayed with the Will-
ings, a family also from Munich, who
were oldiricuds of the non Braumers.
Their son, Claw, had always been
besotted with Christina and didn't
care about her being pregnant, or
even the fact she felt nothing for
him. He was confident that, given
time, it would all work outfor the
best.

  It didn't, because it couldn't.
Christina had always known it would
never work, however hard Claus
tried. They even left Montreal in an
attempt to make a go of it. Klaus
bought her the shop in Toronto and
evey luxuy that money could afford,
but it made no difference. Their
marriage was an obvious sham. Yet
they could not bring themselves to
distress their families further with
a divorce so they had led separate
lives from the beginning.

  As soon as Christinafinished her
stop I touched her cheek and she
took my hand and kissed it. From
that moment on we saw each other
evey spare moment that could be
stolen, day or night. It was the
happiestyear of my life, and I was
unable to hide from anyone how If
elt.

  Our affair-for that's how the
gossips were describing it -
inevitably became public. However
discreet we tried to be,

                 2~
                  
         CHRISTINA ROSENTHAL

Toronto, I quickly discovered, a DCy
small place, full of people who took
pleasure in informing those whom we
also loved that we had been seen
together regularly, even leaving my
home in the early hours.

  Then quite suddenly we were left
with no choice in the matter:
Christina told me she was pregnant
again. Only this time it held no
fears for either of us.

  Once she had told Klaus the
settlement went through as quickly
as the best divorce lawyer at Graham
Douglas 69 Wilkins could negotiate.
We were married only a few days
after the.[nal papers were signed.
We both regretted that Christina's
parents felt unable to attend the
wedding but 1 couldn't understand
whyyou didn't come.

The rabbi still could not believe
his own intolerance and
short-sightedness. The demands on an
Orthodox Jew should be waived if it
meant losing one's only child. He
had searched the Talmud in vain for
any passage that would allow him to
break his lifelong vows. In vain.

The only sad part of the divorce
settlement was that Klaus was given
custody of our child. He also
demanded, in exchange for a quick
divorce, that I not be allowed to
see Nicholas before his
twenty-.first birthday, and that he
should not be told that I was his
realfather. At the time it seemed a
hard price to pay, even for such
happiness. We both knew that we had
been left with no choice but to
accept his teens.

  I used to wonder how each day
could be so much better than the
last. If I was apart from Christina
for more than a few hours I always
missed her. If theirm sent me out of
town on business for a night I would
phone her two, three, perhaps four
times, and if it was for more than
a night then she came with me. I
rememberyou once describingyour low

                 265
                  
         A TWIST IN THE TALE

for my mother and wondering at the
time if I could ever hope to achieve
such happiness.

  We began to matc plans for the
birth of our child William, if it
was a boy - her choice; Deborah, if
it was a girl - mine. I painted the
spare room pink, assuming I had
already won.

  Christina had to stop me buying
too many baby clothes, but I warned
her that it didn 't matter as we
were going to have a dozen more
children. Jews, I reminded her,
believed in dynasties.

  She attended her exercise classes
regularly, dieted carcJully, rested
sensibly. I told her she was doing
far more than was required of a
mother, even of my daughter. I asked
if I could be present when our child
was born and her gynaccologist
seemed reluctant atheist, but then
agreed By the time the ninth month
came the hospital must have thought
from the amount offuss I was making
they were preparingfor the birth of
a royal prince.

  I drool Christina into Womcn's
College Hospital on the way to work
last Tuesday. Although I went on to
the of her I found it impossible to
concentrate. The hospital rang in
the afternoon to say they thought
the child would be born early that
evening: obviously Deborah did not
wish to disrupt the working hours of
Graham Douglas (Y Wilkins. However,
I still arrived at the hospitalfar
too early. I sat on the end of
Christina's bed until her
contractions started coming cacti
minute and then to my surprise they
asked me to Inane. They needed to
rupture her membranes, a nurse
explained. I asked her to remind the
midwife that I wanted to be present
to witness the birth.

  I went out into the corridor and
began pacing up and down, the way
expectantfathersdo inB-movies.
Christina's gynaecologist arrived
about half an hour later and gave me
a huge smile. I noticed a cigar in
his top pocket, obviously

         CHRISTINA ROSENTHAL
-
reserordfor expectantfathers. "It's
about to happen, " was all he said

  A second doctor whom I had never
seen before arrived a few minutes
later and went quickly into her
room. He only gave me a nod. If elt
like a man in the dock waiting to
hear the jury's verdict.

  It must have been at least another
fifteen minutes before I saw the
unit being rushed down the corridor
by a team of threryoung interns.
They didn't even give me so much as
a second glance as they disappeared
into Christina's room.

  I heard the screams that suddenly
gave way to the plaintive cry of a
new-born child. I thanked my God and
hers. When the doctor came out of
her room I remember noticing that
the cigar had disappeared.

  "It's a girl, "he said quietly. I
was overjoyed. "No need to repaint
the bedroom immediately"~!ashed
through my mind.

"Can I see Christina now?" I asked.

  He took me by the arm and led me
across the corridor and into his of
fice.

  "Wouldyou like to sit down?" he
asked. "I'm afraid I have some sad
news. "

"Is she all right?"

  "I am sorry, so vey sorry, to
teilyou thatyour wife is dead. "

  At first I didn't believe him, I
refused to believe him. Why? Why? I
wanted to scream.

"We did warn her, " he added.

"Warn her? Warn her of what?"

  "That her bloodpressure might not
stand up to it a second time. "

  Christina had never told me what
the doctor went on to explain - that
the birth of our irst child had been

                267
                 
         A TWIST IN THE TALE

complicated, and that the doctors
had advised her against becoming
pregnant again.

  "Why hadn't she told me?" l
demanded Then I realized why. She
had risked Scything for me -
foolish, stylish, thoughtless me-
and l had ended up killing the one
person I loved.

  They allowed me to hold Deborah
in my arms for just a moment before
they put her into an incubator and
told me it would be another
twenty-four hours 6cforc she came
off the danger list.

  You will never know how much it
meant to me, Father, thatyou came to
the hospital so quickly. Christina
pardons arrived later that morning.
They were magnificent. He beggedfor
my forgiocncss - beggedfor my
forgiveness. It could never have
happened, he kept reseating, if he
hadn't been so stupid and
prejudiced.

  His wife took my hand and asked
if she might be allowed to see
Deborah from time to time. Of course
I agreed They Ieftjust before
midnight. I sat, walked, slept in
that corridor for the next
twenty-four hours until they told me
that my daughter was off the danger
list. She would have to remain in
the hospitalfor a few more days,
they explained, but she was now
managing to suck milk from a bottle.

  Christina's father kindly took
over the funeral arrangements.

  You must have wondered why I
didn't appear and I owe you an
explanation. I thought I would just
drop into the hospital on my way to
thefuneral so that I could spend
anew moments with Deborah. I had
already transferred my lone.

  The doctor couldn 't get the
words out. It took a brave man to
tell me that her heart had stopped
beating a few minutes before my
arrival. Even the senior surgeon was
in tears. When I left the hospital
the corridors were empty.

I wantyou to know, Father, that I
loocyou with all my

                 268
                  
        CHRISTINA ROSENTHAL

heart, but I hare no desire to
spend the rest of my liSc without
Christina or Deborah.

  I only ask to 6c buried beside my
wife and daughter and to 6c
remcmtcred as their husband and
father. That way unthinking people
might learn from our love. And
whenyou finish this better,
remember only that I had such total
happiness when I was with her that
death holds nofearsfor mc.

Your son,

Benjamin.
