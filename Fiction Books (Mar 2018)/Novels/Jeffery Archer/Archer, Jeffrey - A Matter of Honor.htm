<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Jeffrey Archer is a master storyteller, the author of six novels which have all been worldwide bestsellers. NOT A PENNY MORE, NOT A PENNY LESS was his first book which achieved instant success. Next came the tense and terrifying thriller SHALL WE TELL THE PRESIDENT? followed by his triumphant bestseller KANE AND ABEL. His first collection of short stories, A QUIVER FULL OF ARROWS, came next and then THE PRODIGAL DAUGHTER, the superb sequel to KANE AND ABEL. This was followed by FIRST AMONG EQUALS, considered by <I>The Scotsman </I>to be the finest novel about Parliament since Trollope, and more recently by the gripping chase story, A MATTER OF HONOUR. His latest collection of short stories is called A TWIST IN THE TALE.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He is the author of two stage plays: BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT which opened in London in September 1987 and played for two years and, more recently, EXCLUSIVE.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>

He represented Great Britain in the 100 metres in the early sixties, and became the youngest member of the House of Commons when he won the by-election at Louth in 1969. He wrote his first novel, NOT A PENNY MORE, NOT A PENNY LESS, in 1974. From September 1985 to October 1986 he was Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party.

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's a fake,&quot; said the Russian leader, staring down at the small exquisite painting he held in his hands.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That isn't possible,&quot; replied his Politburo colleague. &quot;The Tsar's icon of St George and the Dragon has been in the Winter Palace at Leningrad under heavy guard for over fifty years.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;True, Comrade Zaborski,&quot; said the old man, &quot;but for fifty years we've been guarding a fake. The Tsar must have removed the original some time before the Red Army entered St Petersburg and overran the Winter Palace.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The head of State Security moved restlessly in his chair as the cat and mouse game continued. Zaborski knew, after years of running the KGB, who had been cast as the mouse the moment his phone had rung at four that morning to say that the General Secretary required him to report to the Kremlin - immediately.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How can you be so sure it's a fake, Leonid Ilyich?&quot; the diminutive figure enquired.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Because, my dear Zaborski, during the past eighteen momhs, the age of all the treasures in the Winter</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Palace has been tested by carbon-dating, the modern scientific process that does not call for a second opinion,&quot; said Brezhnev, displaying his new-found knowledge. &quot;And what we have always thought to be one of the nation's masterpieces,&quot; he continued, &quot;turns out to have been painted five hundred years after Rublev's original.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But by whom and for what purpose?&quot; asked the Chairman of State Security, incredulous.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The experts tell me it was probably a court painter,&quot; replied the Russian leader, &quot;who must have been commissioned to execute the copy only months before the Revolution took place. It has always worried the curator at the Winter Palace that the Tsar's traditional silver crown was not attached to the back of the frame, as it was to all his other masterpieces,&quot; added Brezhnev.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But I always thought that the silver crown had been removed by a souvenir hunter even before we had entered St Petersburg.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No,&quot; said the General Secretary drily, his bushy eyebrows rising every time he had completed a statement. &quot;It wasn't the Tsar's silver crown that had been removed, but the painting itself.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then what can the Tsar have done with the original?&quot; the Chairman said, almost as if he were asking himself the question.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That is exactly what I want to know, Comrade,&quot; said Brezhnev, resting his hands each side of the little painting that remained in front of him. &quot;And you are the one who has been chosen to come up with the answer,&quot; he added.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">For the first time the Chairman of the KGB looked unsure of himself.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But do you have anything for me to go on?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Very little,&quot; admitted the General Secretary, flicking open a file that he removed from the top drawer of his desk. He stared down at the closely typed notes headed 'The Significance of the Icon in Russian History'. Someone had been up all through the night preparing a ten-page report that the leader had only found time to scan. Brezhnev's real interest began on page four. He quickly turned over the first three pages before reading aloud: &quot;'At the time of the Revolution, Tsar Nicholas II obviously saw Rublev's masterpiece as his passport to freedom in the West. He must have had a copy made which he then left on his study wall where the original had previously hung.'&quot; The Russian leader looked up. &quot;Beyond that we have little to go on.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The head of the KGB looked perplexed. He remained puzzled as to why Brezhnev should want State Security involved in the theft of a minor masterpiece. &quot;And how important is it that we find the original?&quot; he asked, trying to pick up a further clue.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Leonid Brezhnev stared down at his Kremlin colleague.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nothing could be more important, Comrade,&quot; came back the unexpected reply. &quot;And I shall grant you any resources you may consider necessary in terms of people and finance to discover the whereabouts of the Tsar's icon.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But if I were to take you at your word, Comrade General Secretary,&quot; said the head of the KGB, trying to disguise his disbelief, &quot;I could so easily end up spending far more than the painting is worth.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That would not be possible,&quot; said Brezhnev, pausing for effect, &quot;because it's not the icon itself that I'm after.&quot; He turned his back on the Chairman of State Security and stared out of the window. He had always</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">disliked not being able to see over the Kremlin wall and into Red Square. He waited for some moments before he proclaimed, &quot;The money the Tsar might have raised from selling such a masterpiece would only have kept Nicholas in his accustomed lifestyle for a matter of months, perhaps a year at the most. No, it's what we believe the Tsar had secreted <I>inside </I>the icon that would have guaranteed security for himself and his family for the rest of their days.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A little circle of condensation formed on the window pane in front of the General Secretary.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What could possibly be that valuable?&quot; asked the Chairman.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Do you remember, Comrade, what the Tsar promised Lenin in exchange for his life?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, but it turned out to be a bluff because no such document was hidden . . .&quot; He stopped himself just before saying &quot;in the icon&quot;.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Zaborski stood silently, unable to witness Brezhnev's triumphant smile.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You have caught up with me at last, Comrade. You see, the document was hidden in the icon all the time. We just had the wrong icon.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The Russian leader waited for some time before he turned back and passed over to his colleague a single sheet of paper. &quot;This is the Tsar's testimony indicating what we would find hidden in the icon of St George and the Dragon. At the time, nothing was discovered in the icon, which only convinced Lenin that it had been a pathetic bluff by the Tsar to save his family from execution.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Zaborski slowly read the hand-written testimony that had been signed by the Tsar hours before his execution. Zaborski's hands began to tremble and a bead of sweat appeared on his forehead long before he</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">had reached the last paragraph. He looked across at the tiny painting, no larger than a book, that remained in the centre of the Chairman's desk.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not since the death of Lenin,&quot; continued Brezhnev, &quot;has anyone believed the Tsar's claim. But now, there can be little doubt that if we are able to locate the genuine masterpiece, we will undoubtedly also be in possession of the promised document.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And with the authority of those who signed that document, no one could question our legal claim/' said Zaborski.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That would undoubtedly prove to be the case, Comrade Chairman,&quot; replied the Russian leader. &quot;And I also feel confident that we would receive the backing of the United Nations and the World Court if the Americans tried to deny us our right. But I fear time is now against us.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why?&quot; asked the Chairman of State Security.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Look at the completion date in the Tsar's testimony and you will see how much time we have left to honour our part of the agreement,&quot; said Brezhnev.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Zaborski stared down at the date scrawled in the hand of the Tsar-June 20, 1966. He handed back the testimony as he considered the enormity of the task with which his leader had entrusted him. Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev continued his monologue.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So, as you can see, Comrade Zaborski, we have only one month left before the deadline, but if you can discover the whereabouts of the original icon, President Johnson's defence strategy would be rendered virtually useless, and the United States would then become a pawn on the Russian chessboard.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="5"><I>June 1966</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And to my dearly beloved and only son, Captain Adam Scott, MC, I bequeath the sum of five hundred pounds.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Although Adam had anticipated the amount would be pitiful, he nevertheless remained bolt upright in his chair as the solicitor glanced over his half-moon spectacles.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The old lawyer who was seated behind the large partners' desk raised his head and blinked at the handsome young man before him. Adam put a hand nervously through his thick black hair, suddenly conscious of the lawyer's stare. Then Mr Holbrooke's eyes returned to the papers in front of him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And to my dearly beloved daughter, Margaret Scott, I bequeath the sum of four hundred pounds.&quot; Adam was unable to prevent a small grin spreading across his face. Even in the minutiae of his final act, father had remained a chauvinist.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;To the Hampshire County Cricket Club,&quot; droned on Mr Holbrooke, unperturbed by Miss Scott's relative misfortunes, &quot;twenty-five pounds, life membership.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Finally paid up, thought Adam. &quot;To the Old Con-temptibles, fifteen pounds. And to the Appleshaw Parish Church, ten pounds.&quot; Death membership, Adam mused. &quot;To Wilf Proudfoot, our loyal gardener part time, ten pounds, and to Mrs Mavis Cox, our daily help, five pounds.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And finally, to my dearly beloved wife Susan, our marital home, and the remainder of my estate.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">This pronouncement made Adam want to laugh out loud because he doubted if the remainder of Pa's estate, even if they sold his premium bonds and the pre-war golf clubs, amounted to more than another thousand pounds.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">But mother was a daughter of the Regiment and wouldn't complain, she never did. If God ever announced the saints, as opposed to some Pope in Rome, Saint Susan of Appleshaw would be up there with Mary and Elizabeth. All through his life 'Pa', as Adam always thought of him, had set such high standards for the family to live up to. Perhaps that was why Adam continued to admire him above all men. Sometimes the very thought made him feel strangely out of place in the swinging sixties.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam began to move restlessly in his chair, assuming that the proceedings were now drawing to a close. The sooner they were all out of this cold, drab little office the better, he felt.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mr Holbrooke looked up once more and cleared his throat, as if he were about to announce who was to be left the Goya or the'Hapsburg diamonds. He pushed his half-moon spectacles further up the bridge of his nose and stared back down at the last paragraphs of his late client's testament. The three surviving members of the Scott family sat in silence. What could he have to add? thought Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Whatever it was, the solicitor had obviously pondered the final bequest several times, because he delivered the words like a well-versed actor, his eyes returning to the script only once.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And I also leave to my son,&quot; Mr Holbrooke paused, &quot;the enclosed envelope,&quot; he said, holding it up, &quot;which I can only hope will bring him greater happiness than it did me. Should he decide to open the envelope it must be on the condition that he will never divulge its contents to any other living person.&quot; Adam caught his sister's eye but she only shook her head slightly, obviously as puzzled as he was. He glanced towards his mother who looked shocked. Was it fear or was it distress? Adam couldn't decide. Without another word, Mr Holbrooke passed the yellowed envelope over to the Colonel's only son.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Everyone in the room remained seated, not quite sure what to do next. Mr Holbrooke finally closed the thin file marked Colonel Gerald Scott, DSO, QBE, MC, pushed back his chair and walked slowly over to the widow. They shook hands and she said, &quot;Thank you,&quot; a faintly ridiculous courtesy, Adam felt, as the only person in the room who had made any sort of profit on this particular transaction had been Mr Holbrooke, and that on behalf of Holbrooke, Holbrooke and Gascoigne.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He rose and went quickly to his mother's side.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You'll join us for tea, Mr Holbrooke?&quot; she was asking.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I fear not, dear lady,&quot; the lawyer began, but Adam didn't bother to listen further. Obviously the fee hadn't been large enough to cover Holbrooke taking time off for tea.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Once they had left the office and Adam had ensured his mother and sister were seated comfortably in the</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">back of the family Morris Minor, he took his place behind the steering wheel. He had parked outside Mr Holbrooke's office in the middle of the High Street. No yellow lines in the streets of Appleshaw - yet, he thought. Even before he had switched on the ignition his mother had offered matter-of-factly, &quot;We'll have to get rid of this, you know. I can't afford to run it now, not with petrol at six shillings a gallon.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Don't let's worry about that today,&quot; said Margaret consolingly, but in a voice that accepted that her mother was right. &quot;I wonder what can be in that envelope, Adam,&quot; she added, wanting to change the subject.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Detailed instructions on how to invest my five hundred pounds, no doubt,&quot; said her brother, attempting to lighten their mood.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Don't be disrespectful of the dead,&quot; said his mother, the same look of fear returning to her face. &quot;I begged your father to destroy that envelope,&quot; she added, in a voice that was barely a whisper.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam's lips pursed when he realised this must be <I>the </I>envelope his father had referred to all those years ago when he had witnessed the one row between his parents that he had ever experienced. Adam still remembered his father's raised voice and angry words just a few days after he had returned from Germany.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I have to open it, don't you understand?&quot; Pa had insisted.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Never,&quot; his mother had replied. &quot;After all the sacrifices I have made, you at least owe me that.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He turned right and continued to drive out of the village for a mile or so down a winding country lane before bringing the old Morris Minor to a halt. Adam leapt out and opened the trellised gate whose path led through a neat lawn to a little thatched cottage.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm sure you ought to be getting back to London,&quot; were his mother's first words as she entered the drawing room.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm in no hurry, mother. There's nothing that can't wait until tomorrow.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Just as you wish, my dear, but you don't have to worry yourself over me,&quot; his mother continued. She stared up at the tall young man who reminded her so much of Gerald. He would have been as good-looking as her husband if it wasn't for the slight break in his nose. The same dark hair and deep brown eyes, the same open, honest face, even the same gentle approach to everyone he came across. But most of all the same high standards of morality that had brought them to their present sad state. &quot;And in any case I've always got Margaret to take care of me,&quot; she - ided. Adam looked across at his sister and wondered how she would now cope with Saint Susan of Appleshaw.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Margaret had recently become engaged to a City stockbroker, and although the marriage had been postponed, she would soon be wanting to start a life of her own.

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Now that you're no longer in the army, my dear, I do hope you'll be able to find a worthwhile job,&quot; his mother said uneasily, as she recalled how difficult that had proved to be for his father.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm sure everything will be just fine, mother,&quot; he replied. &quot;The Foreign Office have asked to see me again,&quot; he added, hoping to reassure her.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Still, now that you've got five hundred pounds of your own,&quot; she said, &quot;that should make things a little easier for you.&quot; Adam smiled fondly at his mother, wondering when she had last spent a day in London. His share of the Chelsea flat alone was four pounds a week and he still had to eat occasionally. She raised her eyes and, looking up at the clock on the mantelpiece, said, &quot;You'd better be getting along, my dear, I don't like the thought of you on that motorbike after dark.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam bent down to kiss her on the cheek. &quot;I'll give you a call tomorrow,&quot; he said. On his way out he stuck his head around the kitchen door and shouted to his sister, &quot;I'm off and I'll be sending you a cheque for fifty pounds.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why?&quot; asked Margaret, looking up from the sink.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Just let's say it's my blow for women's rights.&quot; He shut the kitchen door smartly to avoid the dishcloth that was hurled in his direction. Adam revved .up his BSA and drove down the A303 through Andover and on towards London. As most of the traffic was coming west out of the city, he was able to make good time on his way back to the flat in Ifield Road.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">he felt he could be blase about the little ceremony. After all, in a way, he had waited most of his life to discover what could possibly be in the envelope he had now inherited.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam had been told the story of the family tragedy by his father a thousand times — &quot;It's all a matter of honour, old chap,&quot; his father would repeat, lifting his chin and squaring his shoulders. Adam's father had not realised that he had spent a lifetime overhearing the snide comments of lesser men and suffering the side-long glances from those officers who had made sure they were not seen too regularly in his company. Petty men with petty minds. Adam knew his father far too well to believe, even for a moment, that he could have been involved in such treachery as was whispered. Adam took one hand off the handlebars and fingered the envelope in his inside pocket like a schoolboy the day before his birthday feelirfg the shape of a present in the hope of discovering some clue as to its contents. He felt certain that whatever it contained would not be to anyone's advantage now his father was dead, but it did not lessen his curiosity.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He tried to piece together the few facts he had been told over the years. In 1946, within a year of his fiftieth birthday, his father had resigned his commission from the army. <I>The Times </I>had described Pa as a brilliant tactical officer with a courageous war record. His resignation had been a decision that had surprised <I>The Times </I>correspondent, astonished his immediate family and shocked his regiment, as it had been assumed by all who knew him that it was only a matter of months before crossed swords and a baton would have been sewn on to his epaulette.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">fiction. When asked, all the colonel would offer was that he had had enough of war, and felt the time had come to make a little money on which Susan and he could retire before it was too late. Even at the time, few people found his story credible, and that credibility was not helped when the only job the colonel managed to secure for himself was as secretary of the local golf club.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">It was only through the generosity of Adam's late grandfather, General Sir Pelham Westlake, that he had been able to remain at Wellington College, and thereby be given the opportunity to continue the family tradition and pursue a military career.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">After leaving school, Adam was offered a place at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. During his days at the RMA, Adam was to be found diligently studying military history, tactics, and battle procedure while at weekends he concentrated on rugby and squash, although his greatest success came whenever he completed the different cross-country courses he encountered. For two years, panting cadets from Cranwell and Dartmouth only saw his mud-spattered back as Adam went on to become the Inter-Services champion. He also became the middleweight boxing champion despite a Nigerian cadet breaking his nose in the first round of the final. The Nigerian made the mistake of assuming the fight was already over.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When Adam passed out of Sandhurst in August 1956, he managed ninth place in the academic order of merit, but his leadership and example outside the classroom was such that no one was surprised when he was awarded the Sword of Honour. Adam never doubted from that moment he would now follow his father and command the regiment.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">son soon after he had been awarded his regular commission. Adam quickly gained the respect of the soldiers and popularity with those officers whose currency was not to deal in rumour. As a tactical officer in the field he had no equal, and when it came to combat duty it was clear he had inherited his father's courage. Yet, when six years later the War Office published in the <I>London Gazette </I>the names of those subalterns who had been made up to Captain, Lieutenant Adam Scott was not to be found on the list. His contemporaries were genuinely surprised, while senior officers of the regiment remained tight-lipped. To Adam it was becoming abundantly clear that he was not to be allowed to atone for whatever it was his father was thought to have done.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Eventually Adam was made up to captain, but not before he had distinguished himself in the Malayan jungle in hand-to-hand fighting against the never-ending waves of Chinese soldiers. Having been captured and held prisoner by the Communists, he endured solitude and torture of the kind that no amount of training could have prepared him for. He escaped eight months after his incarceration only to discover on returning to the front line that he had been awarded a posthumous Military Cross. When, at the age of twenty-nine, Captain Scott passed his staff exam but still failed to be offered a regimental place at the staff college, he finally accepted he could never hope to command the regiment. He resigned his commission a few weeks later; there was no need to suggest that the reason he had done so was because he needed to earn more money.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">While he was serving out his last few months with the regiment, Adam learned from his mother that Pa only had weeks to live. Adam made the decision not</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">to inform his father of his resignation. He knew Pa would only blame himself and he was at least thankful that he had died without being aware of the stigma that had become part of his son's daily life.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When Adam reached the outskirts of London his mind returned, as it had so often lately, to the pressing problem of finding himself gainful employment. In the seven weeks he had been out of work Adam had already had more interviews with his bank manager than with prospective employers. It was true that he had another meeting lined up with the Foreign Office, but he had been impressed by the standard of the other candidates he had encountered on the way, and was only too aware of his lack of a university qualification. However, he felt the first interview had gone well and he had been quickly made aware of how many ex-officers had joined the service. When he discovered that the chairman of the selection board had a Military Gross, Adam assumed he wasn't being considered for desk work.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As he swung the motorbike into the King's Road Adam once again fingered the envelope in his inside jacket pocket hoping, uncharitably, that Lawrence would not yet have returned from the bank. Not that he could complain: his old school friend had been extremely generous in offering him such a pleasant room in his spacious flat for only four pounds a week.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You can start paying more when they make you an ambassador,&quot; Lawrence had told him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You're beginning to sound like Rachmann,&quot; Adam had retorted, grinning at the man he had so admired during their days at Wellington. For Lawrence - in direct contrast to Adam - everything seemed to come so easily - exams, jobs, sport and women, especially women. When he had won his place at Balliol and</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">gone on to take a first in PPE, no one was surprised. But when Lawrence chose banking as a profession, his contemporaries were unable to hide their disbelief. It seemed to be the first time he had embarked on anything that might be described as mundane.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam parked his motorbike just off Ifield Road, aware that, like his mother's old Morris Minor, it would have to be sold if the Foreign Office job didn't materialise. As he strolled towards the flat a girl who passed gave him a second look: he didn't notice. He took the stairs in threes and had reached the fifth floor, and was pushing his Yale key into the lock when a voice from inside shouted, &quot;It's on the latch.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Damn,&quot; said Adam under his breath.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How did it go?&quot; were Lawrence's first words as he entered the drawing room.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Very well, considering,&quot; Adam replied, not quite sure what else he could say as he smiled at his flatmate. Lawrence had already changed from his City clothes into a blazer and grey flannels. He was slightly shorter and stockier than Adam with a head of wiry fair hair, a massive forehead and grey thoughtful eyes that always seemed to be enquiring.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I admired your father so much,&quot; he added. &quot;He always assumed one had the same standards as he did.&quot; Adam could still remember nervously introducing Lawrence to his father one Speech Day. They had become friends immediately. But then Lawrence was not a man who dealt in rumours.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Able to retire on the family fortune, are we?&quot; asked Lawrence in a lighter vein.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Only if that dubious bank you work for has found a way of converting five hundred pounds into five thousand in a matter of days.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam smiled as he looked across at his friend. Although taller than him now, he could still recall those days when Lawrence seemed to him like a giant.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Late again, Scott,&quot; he would say as Adam scampered past him in the corridor. Adam had looked forward to the day when he could do everything in the same relaxed, superior style. Or was it just that Lawrence was superior? His suits always seemed to be well-pressed, his shoes always shone and he never had a hair out of place. Adam still hadn't fathomed out how he did it all so effortlessly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam heard the bathroom door open. He glanced interrogatively towards Lawrence.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's Carolyn,&quot; whispered Lawrence. &quot;She'll be staying the night... I think.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When Carolyn entered the room Adam smiled shyly at the tall, beautiful woman. Her long, blonde hair bounced on her shoulders as she walked towards them, but it was the faultless figure that most men couldn't take their eyes off. How did Lawrence manage it?</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Care to join us for a meal?&quot; asked Lawrence, putting his arm round Carolyn's shoulder, his voice suddenly sounding a little <I>too </I>enthusiastic. &quot;I've discovered this Italian restaurant that's just opened in the Fulham Road.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I might join you later,&quot; said Adam, &quot;but I still have one or two papers left over from this afternoon that I ought to check through.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Forget the finer details of your inheritance, my boy. Why not join us and spend the entire windfall in one wild spaghetti fling?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh, have you been left lots of lovely lolly?&quot; asked Carolyn, in a voice so shrill and high-pitched nobody</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not,&quot; said Adam, &quot;when considered against my present overdraft.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Lawrence laughed. &quot;Well, come along later if you discover there's enough over for a plate of pasta.&quot; He winked at Adam - his customary sign for &quot;Be sure you're out of the flat by the time we get back. Or at least stay in your own room and pretend to be asleep.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, do come,&quot; cooed Carolyn, sounding as if she meant it - her hazel eyes remained fixed on Adam as Lawrence guided her firmly towards the door.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam didn't move until he was sure he could no longer hear her penetrating voice echoing on the staircase. Satisfied, he retreated to his bedroom and locked himself in. Adam sat down on the one comfortable chair he possessed and pulled his father's envelope out of his inside pocket. It was the heavy, expensive type of stationery Pa had always used, purchasing it at Smythson of Bond Street at almost twice the price he could have obtained it at the local W. H. Smith's. 'Captain Adam Scott, MC' was written in his father's neat copperplate hand.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam opened the envelope carefully, his hand shaking slightly, and extracted the contents: a letter in his father's unmistakable hand and a smaller envelope which was clearly old as it was faded with time. Written on the old envelppe in an unfamiliar hand were the words 'Colonel Gerald Scott' in faded ink of indeterminate colour. Adam placed the old envelope on the little table by his side and, unfolding his father's letter, began to read. It was undated.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">nations for my sudden departure from the regiment. Most of them will have been farcical, and a few of them slanderous, but I always considered it better for all concerned to keep my own counsel. I feel, however, that I owe you a fuller explanation, and that is what this letter will set out to do.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As you know, my last posting before I resigned my commission was at Nuremberg from November 1945 to October 1946. After four years of almost continuous action in the field, I was given the task of commanding the British section which had responsibility for those senior ranking Nazis who were awaiting trial for war crimes. Although the Americans had overall responsibility, I came to know the imprisoned officers quite well and after a year or so I had even grown to tolerate some of them - Hess, Doenitz and Speer in particular - and I often wondered how the Germans would have treated us had the situation been reversed. Such views were considered unacceptable at the time. 'Fraternisation' was often on the lips of those men who are never given to second thoughts.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Among the senior Nazis with whom I came into daily contact was Reichsmarshal Hermann Goering, but unlike the three other officers I have previously mentioned, here was a man I detested from the first moment I came across him. I found him arrogant, overbearing and totally without shame about the barbaric acts he had carried out in the name of war. And I never once found any reason to change my opinion of him. In fact, I sometimes wondered how I controlled my temper when I was in his presence.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The night before Goering was due to be executed, he requested a private meeting with me. It was a Monday, and I can still recall every detail of that</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">22</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">encounter as if it were only yesterday. I received the request when I took over the Russian watch from Major Vladimir Kosky. In fact Kosky personally handed me the written request. As soon as I had inspected the guard and dealt with the usual paperwork, I went along with the duty corporal to see the Reichsmarshal in his cell. Goering stood to attention by his small low bed and saluted as I entered the room. The sparse, grey-painted, brick cell always made me shudder.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You asked to see me?&quot; I said. I never could get myself to address him by his name or rank.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied. &quot;It was kind of you to come in person, Colonel. I simply wish to make the last request of a man condemned to death. Would it be possible for the corporal to leave us?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Imagining it was something highly personal I asked the corporal to wait outside. I confess I had no idea what could be so private when the man only had hours to live but as the door closed he saluted again and then passed over the envelope you now have in your possession. As I took it, all he said was, &quot;Would you be good enough not to open this until after my execution tomorrow.&quot; He then added, &quot;I can only hope it will compensate for any blame that might later be placed on your shoulders.&quot; I had no idea what he could be alluding to at the time and presumed some form of mental instability had overtaken him. Many of the prisoners confided in me during their last few days, and towards the end, some of them were undoubtedly on the verge of madness.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam stopped to consider what he would have done in the same circumstances, and decided to read on to</FONT><BR>

<P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">discover if father and son would have taken the same course.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">However, Goering's final words to me as I left his cell seemed hardly those of a madman. He said quite simply: &quot;Be assured. It is a masterpiece; do not underestimate its value.&quot; Then he lit up a cigar as if he was relaxing at his club after a rather good dinner. We all had different theories as to who smuggled the cigars in for him, and equally wondered what might also have been smuggled out from time to time.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">I placed the envelope in my jacket pocket and left him to join the corporal in the corridor. We then checked the other cells to see that all the prisoners were locked up for the night. The inspection completed, I returned to my office. As I was satisfied that there were no more immediate duties I settled down to make out my report. I left the envelope in the jacket pocket of my uniform with every intention of opening it immediately after Goering's execution had been carried out the following morning. I was checking over the orders of the day when the corporal rushed into my office without knocking. &quot;It's Goer-ing, sir, it's Goering,&quot; he said, frantically. From the panic on the man's face, I didn't need to ask for any details. We both ran all the way back to the Reichsmarshal's cell.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">I found Goering lying face downwards on his bunk. I turned him over to find he was already dead. In the commotion that immediately followed I quite forgot Goering's letter. An autopsy a few days later showed that he had died from poisoning; the court came to the conclusion that the cyanide capsule</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">that had been found in his body must have been implanted in one of his cigars.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As I had been the last to see him alone and privately, it took only a few whispers before my name was linked with his death. There was, of course, no truth in the accusation. Indeed I never doubted for one moment that the court had delivered the correct verdict in his case and that he justly deserved to be hanged for the part he had played in the war.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">So stung was I by the continual behind-the-back accusations that I might have helped Goering to an easy death by smuggling in the cigars that I felt the only honourable thing to do in the circumstances was to resign my commission immediately for fear of bringing further dishonour to the regiment. When I returned to England later that year, and finally decided to throw out my old uniform, I came across the envelope again. When I explained to your mother the details of the incident she begged me to destroy the envelope as she considered it had brought enough dishonour to our family already, and even if it did point to whoever had been responsible for helping Goering to his suicide, in her opinion such knowledge could no longer do anyone any good. I agreed to comply with her wishes and although I never opened the envelope I could never get myself to destroy it, remembering the last sentence Goering had uttered about it being a masterpiece. And so finally I hid it among my personal papers.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam read the letter over once again, realising how much trust his father had placed in him. His heart thumped in his chest as he considered how Pa's life had been wasted by the murmurings and innuendoes of lesser men - the same men who had also succeeded in bringing his own career to a premature halt. When he had finished reading the missive for a third time he folded it up neatly and slipped it back into its envelope.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He then picked up the second envelope from the side table. The words 'Colonel Gerald Scott' were written in a faded bold script across it.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam removed a comb from his inside pocket and wedged it into the corner of the envelope. Slowly he began to slit it open. He hesitated for a moment before extracting two pieces of paper, both yellowed with age. One appeared to be a letter while the other seemed to be a document of some sort. The crest of the Third Reich was embossed at the head of the letterpaper</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As the black Ghaika limousine drove out under the Spasskaya Bashnya and on to Red Square, two Kremlin guards in khaki uniforms sprang to attention and presented arms. A shrill whistle sounded which ensured that Yuri Efimovich Zaborski would experience no delays ort his route back to Dzerzhinsky Square.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Zaborski touched the corner of his black felt hat in automatic acknowledgment of the salute although his thoughts were elsewhere. As the car rumbled over the cobbled stones, he didn't even glance at the long snake-like queue that stretched from Lenin's Tomb to the edge of Red Square. The first decision he had to make would undoubtedly be the most important: which of his senior operatives should be charged with the task of heading the team to find the Tsar's icon? He continued to ponder the problem as his driver took him across Red Square, passing the grey facade of the GUM department store away to his left before driving along Neitsa Kuibysheva.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Within moments of leaving his leader, the Chairman of State Security had formed in his own mind a shortlist of two. Which of those two, Valchek or Romanov, should be given the nod still taxed him. In normal circumstances he would have spent at least a week</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">making such a decision but the General Secretary's deadline of June 20 left him with no such freedom. He knew he would have to make the choice even before he reached his office. The driver cruised through another green light past the Ministry of Culture and into Cherkasskiy Bolshoy Pereulok lined with its imposing block-like, grey buildings. The car remained in the special inside lane that could be used only by senior Party officials. In England, he was amused to learn that they had plans for such a traffic lane - but it would only be for the use of buses.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The car came to an abrupt halt outside KGB headquarters. It hadn't helped that they had been able to cover the three kilometre journey in less than four minutes. The driver ran round and opened the back door to allow his master to step out but Zaborski didn't move. The man who rarely changed his mind had already done so twice on the route back to Dzerzhinsky Square. He knew he could call on any number of bureaucrats and academics to do the spade work but someone with flair was going to have to lead them and be responsible for reporting back to him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">His professional intuition told him to select Yuri Valchek, who had proved over the years to be a trusty and reliable servant of the State. He was also one of the Chairman's longest serving heads of department. Slow, methodical and reliable, he had completed a full ten years as an agent in the field before confining himself to a desk job.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">In contrast, Alex Romanov, who had only recently become head of his own section, had shown flashes of brilliance in the field but they had been so often outweighed by a lack of personal judgment. At twenty-nine, he was the youngest and, without question, the most ambitious of the Chairman's select team.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Zaborski stepped out on to the pavement and walked towards another door held open for him. He strode across the marble floor and stopped only when he reached the lift gates. Several silent men and women had also been waiting for the lift but when it returned to the ground floor and the Chairman stepped into the little cage, none of them made any attempt to join him. Zaborski travelled slowly up towards his office, never failing to compare it unfavourably with the speed of the one American elevator he had experienced. They could launch their rockets before you could get to your office, his predecessor had warned him. By the time Zaborski had reached the top floor and the gates had been pulled back for him, he had made up his mind. It would be Valchek.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A secretary helped him off with his long black coat and took his hat. Zaborski walked quickly to his desk. The two files he had asked for were awaiting him. He sat down and began to pore over Valchek's file. When he had completed it, he barked out an order to his hovering secretary: &quot;Find Romanov.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Comrade Romanov lay flat on his back, his left arm behind his head and his opponent's right over his throat preparing for a double knee-thrust. The coach executed it perfectly and Romanov groaned as he hit the floor with a thud.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">An attendant came rushing over to them and bent down to whisper in the coach's ear. The coach reluctantly released his pupil who rose slowly as if in a daze, bowed to the coach and then in one movement of right arm and left leg took the legs from under him and left him flat on the gymnasium floor before making his way quickly to the off-the-hook phone in the office.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">phone. &quot;I'll be with him as soon as I have had a shower,&quot; was all she heard him say. The girl who had taken the call had often wondered what Romanov looked like in the shower. She, like all the other girls in the office, had seen him in the gymnasium a hundred times. Six foot tall with that long, flowing blond hair - he resembled a Western film star. And those eyes, 'piercing blue' the friend who shared her desk described them.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He's got a scar on his . . .&quot; the friend confided.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How do you know that?&quot; she had asked, but her friend had only giggled in reply.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The Chairman meanwhile had opened Romanov's personal file for a second time, and was still perusing the details. He began to read the different entries that made up a candid character assessment which Romanov would never see unless he became Chairman:</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alexander Petrovich Romanov. Born Leningrad, March 12, 1937. Elected full Party member 1958. Father: Peter Nicholevich Romanov, served on the Eastern Front in 1942. On returning to Russia in 1945 refused to join Communist Party. After several reports of anti-State activities supplied by his son he was sentenced to ten years in prison. Died in jail October 20, 1948.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Zaborski looked up and smiled - a child of the State.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The Revolution had taken place between the princely • grandfather and the reluctant comrade father.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alex, as he preferred to be known, had nevertheless inherited the Romanov ambition so he enrolled for the Party's Pioneer organisation at the age of nine. By the age of eleven, he had been offered a place at a special school at Smolensk - to the disgust of some of the lesser Party workers who considered such privileges should be reserved for the sons of loyal Party officials, not the sons of those in jail. Romanov immediately excelled in the classroom, much to the dismay of the Director who had been hoping to disprove any Darwinian theories. And at fourteen he was selected as one of the Party's elite and made a member of the Komsomol.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">By the age of sixteen, Romanov had won the Lenin language medal and the junior gymnastics prize and despite the Director's attempts to undermine young Alex's achievements, most members of the school board recognised Romanov's potential and ensured that he was still allowed to take up a place at university. As an undergraduate he continued to excel in languages, specialising in English, French and German. Natural flair and hard work kept him near the top of every subject he specialised in.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Zaborski picked up the phone by his side. &quot;I asked to see Romanov,&quot; he said curtly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He was completing his morning work-out at the gymnasium, Chairman,&quot; replied the secretary. &quot;But he left to change the moment he heard you wanted to see him.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The Chairman replaced the phone and his eyes returned to the file in front of him. That Romanov</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">could be found in the gymnasium at all hours came as no surprise: the man's athletic prowess had been acknowledged far beyond the service.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">During his first year as a student, Romanov had continued diligently with his gymnastics and even gone on to represent the State side until the university coach had written in bold letters across one of his reports, &quot;This student is too tall to be considered for serious Olympic competition.&quot; Romanov heeded the coach's advice and took up judo. Within two years, he had been selected for the 1958 Eastern Bloc games in Budapest and within a further two years found other competitors preferred not to be drawn against him on his inevitable route to the final. After his victory at the Soviet games in Moscow the Western press crudely described him as 'The Axe'. Those who were already planning his long-term future felt it prudent not to enter him for the Olympics.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Once Romanov had completed his fifth year at the university and obtained his diploma (with distinction), he remained in Moscow and joined the diplomatic service.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Zaborski had now reached the point in the file at which he had first come across the self-confident young man. Each year the KGB were able to second from the diplomatic service any person they considered to be of exceptional talent. Romanov was an obvious candidate. Zaborski's rule, however, was not to enlist anyone who didn't consider the KGB to be the elite. Unwilling candidates never made good operatives and sometimes even ended up working for the other side. Romanov showed no such doubt. He had always wanted to be an officer of the KGB. During the next six years he carried out tours at their embassies in Paris, London, Prague and Lagos. By the time he had returned to</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Moscow to join the headquarters staff he was a sophisticated operative who was as relaxed at an ambassadorial cocktail party as he was in the gymnasium.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Zaborski began to read some of the comments he himself had added to the report during the last four years - in particular how much Romanov had changed during his time on the Chairman's personal staff. As an operative, he had reached the rank of major, having served successfully in the field before being appointed head of a department. Two red dots were placed by his name indicating successful missions. A defecting violinist attempting to leave Prague and a general who had thought he was going to be the next head of a small African state. What impressed Zaborski most about his protege's efforts was that the Western press thought the Czechs were responsible for the first and the Americans for the second. Romanov's most significant achievement, however, had been the recruitment of an agent from the British Foreign Office whose parallel rise had only assisted Romanov's career. Romanov's appointment as head of a department had surprised no one, himself included, although it soon became clear to Zaborski that he missed the raw excitement of field work.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The Chairman turned to the last page, a character assessment, in which the majority of contributors were in accord: ambitious, sophisticated, ruthless, arrogant but not always reliable were the words that appeared with regularity in almost every summation.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">There was an assertive rap on the door. Zaborski closed the file and pressed a button under his desk. The doors clicked open to allow Alexander Petrovich Romanov to enter the room.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good morning, Comrade Chairman,&quot; said the elegant young man who now stood to attention in</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">front of him. Zaborski looked up at the man he had selected and felt a little envy that the gods had bestowed so much on one so young. Still, it was he who understood how to use such a man to the State's best advantage.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He continued to stare into those clear blue eyes and considered that if Romanov had been born in Hollywood he would not have found it hard to make a living. His suit looked as if it had been tailored in Savile Row - and probably had been. Zaborski chose to ignore such irregularities although he was tempted to ask the young man where he had his shirts made.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You called for me,&quot; said Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The Chairman nodded. &quot;I have just returned from the Kremlin,&quot; he said. &quot;The General Secretary has entrusted us with a particularly sensitive project of great importance to the State.&quot; Zaborski paused. &quot;So sensitive in fact that you will report only to me. You can hand-select your own team and no resources will be denied you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I am honoured,&quot; said Romanov, sounding unusually sincere.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You will be,&quot; replied the Chairman, &quot;ifyou succeed in discovering the whereabouts of the Tsar's icon.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam walked over to the side of his bed and removed from the bookshelf the Bible his mother had given him as a Confirmation present. As he opened it a layer of dust rose from the top of the gold-leaf-edged pages. He placed the envelope in Revelation and returned the Bible to the shelf.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam strolled through to the kitchen, fried himself an egg and warmed up the other half of the previous day's tinned beans. He placed the unwholesome meal on the kitchen table, unable to put out of his mind the slap-up meal Lawrence and Carolyn must now be enjoying at the new Italian restaurant. After Adam had finished and cleared his plate away, he returned to his room and lay on the bed thinking. Would the contents of the faded envelope finally prove his father's innocence? A plan began to form in his mind.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When the grandfather clock in the hall chimed ten times, Adam lifted his long legs over the end of the bed and pulled the Bible back out of the bookshelf. With some apprehension Adam removed the envelope. Next, he switched on the reading light by the side of the small writing desk, unfolded the two pieces of paper and placed them in front of him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">One appeared to be a personal letter from Goering</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">to Adam's father, while the other had the look of an older, more official document. Adam placed this second document to one side and began to go over the letter line by line. It didn't help.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He tore a blank piece of paper from a notepad that he found on Lawrence's desk and started to copy down the text of Goering's letter. He left out only the greeting and what he assumed to be a.valediction - <I>'hochachtungs-voll' - </I>followed by the Reichsmarshal's large, bold signature. He checked over the copy carefully before replacing the original in its faded envelope. He had just begun the same process with the official document, using a separate sheet of paper, when he heard a key turning, followed by voices at the front door. Both Lawrence and Carolyn sounded as if they had drunk more than the promised bottle of wine, and Carolyn's voice in particular had ascended into little more than a series of high-pitched giggles.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam sighed and switched off the light by the side of the desk so they wouldn't know he was still awake. In the darkness he became more sensitive to their every sound. One of them headed towards the kitchen, because he heard the fridge door squelch closed and, a few seconds later, the sound of a cork being extracted — he presumed from his last bottle of white wine, as they were unlikely to be so drunk that they had started on the vinegar.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Reluctantly he rose from his chair, and circling his arms in front of him, he made his way back to the bed. He touched the corner of the bedstead and quietly lowered himself on to the mattress, then waited impatiently for Lawrence's bedroom door to close.</FONT><BR>

He eased himself off the bed gingerly, feeling more than a little crumpled and weary. Slowly he groped his way back towards the desk, banging his knee on the corner of a chest of drawers during his travels. He couldn't stop himself cursing. He fumbled for the light switch, and when the bulb first glowed it made him blink several times. The faded envelope looked sp insignificant - and perhaps it was. The official document was still laid out on the centre of the table alongside the first few lines of his handwritten duplicate.</FONT><BR>

<P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The early information had come in almost by the hour and the researchers had quickly been able to establish that the Tsar's icon had remained in his private quarters at the Winter Palace at Petrograd until as late as December 1914. Romanov studied religiously a photo of the small delicate painting of St George and the Dragon. St George in tiny mosaic patterns of blue and gold while the dragon was in fiery red and yellow. Although he had never shown any interest in art, Romanov could well understand why people could be moved by the little masterpiece. He continued to read details of the icon's history, but still couldn't work out why it was so important to the State. He wondered if even Zaborski knew the reason.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A royal servant who had testified before the People's Court a year after the Revolution claimed that the Tsar's icon had disappeared for a few days in 1915 after the visit of Ernst Ludwig, Grand Duke of Hesse. At the time, the inquisitors had taken scant interest in the misplaced icon because it was still on the wall of the Tsar's study when they had stormed the Winter Palace. What concerned the court more was why, in the middle of a fierce war with the Kaiser's Germany, the Grand Duke of Hesse should want to visit the Tsar at all.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The Professor of History at the university had immediately been asked for his opinion. The great academic was puzzled by the request, as the KGB had never shown any interest in the nation's past history before. Nevertheless, he briefed Romanov on everything that was known of the incident. Romanov pored over his report once again. The Grand Duke, it was thought, had been on a secret visit to his sister Alexan-</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">There was no proof that the Tsar made any promises on behalf of his people but the Grand Duke, it seemed, did not return to Germany empty-handed. As the reports of the proceedings of the People's Court showed, another palace servant had been instructed to wrap up the Tsar's icon and pack it with the Grand Duke's belongings. However, no one on the palace staff could properly explain to the court how a few days later the icon reappeared in its rightful place on the wall of the Tsar's private study.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov's chief researcher, Professor Oleg Kon-stantinov, having studied the professor's notes and the other researchers' contributions, had underlined his own conclusion in red ink.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The Tsar must have replaced the original painting with a brilliant copy, having handed over the real icon for safe-keeping to his brother-in-law, the Grand Duke.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But why,&quot; asked Romanov, &quot;when the Tsar had a palace full of Goyas, El Grecos, Titians and Rubens did he bother to smuggle out one icon and why does Brezhnev want it back so badly?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov instructed the professor and his twenty-four researchers to turn their talents to the Royal House of Hesse in the hope of tracing what had then happened to the Tsar's icon. Within ten days, they possessed between them more information about the Grand Duke and his family than any professor at any university had managed to gather in a lifetime.

He came to a dead end when, after the Grand Duke's death, the painting had been left to his son who was tragically killed in a plane crash. Nothing had been seen or heard of the icon after that day.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">By the beginning of the third week, Romanov had reached the reluctant conclusion that there was nothing new on the whereabouts of the icon to be discovered. He was preparing his final report for the Chairman of the KGB when one researcher, Comrade Petrova, whose mind did not work in parallel lines, stumbled across an article in the London <I>Times </I>of Wednesday, November 17,1937. Petrova bypassed the research leader and handed the relevant photocopy to Romanov personally, who, over the next few hours, read the news item so often that he came to know it off by heart.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">In keeping with the Thunderer's tradition, the foreign correspondent remained anonymous. The article carried the dateline 'Ostend, November 16, 1937'.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">It was the next paragraph that the researcher had circled boldly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Some of the late Grand Duke's personal belongings, including several wedding presents for Prince Louis and his bride, were scattered for miles in the vicinity of the crashed aircraft.

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov immediately called for the young researcher. When Anna Petrova arrived a few minutes later she gave no impression of being overawed by her head of department. She accepted that it would be hard to make any impression on him with the clothes she could afford. However, she had put on the prettiest outfit she possessed and cut her hair in the style of an American actress called Mia Farrow whom she had seen in one of the few films not banned by the authorities. She hoped Romanov would notice.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Within twenty-four hours Comrade Petrova barged back into Romanov's office without even bothering to knock. Romanov merely raised his eyebrows at the discourtesy before devouring an article she had discovered in the Berlin <I>die Zeit </I>of Saturday, January 19, 1938.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The investigation into the crash last November of the Sabena aircraft that was carrying the Hesse royal family to London has now been concluded. All personal possessions belonging to the family that were discovered in the vicinity of the wreckage have been returned to the Grand Duke, Prince Louis, who, it is understood, was particularly saddened by the loss of a family heirloom that was to have been a wedding gift from his brother, the late Grand Duke. The gift, a painting known as the 'Tsar's Icon', had once belonged to his uncle, Tsar Nicholas II. The icon of St George and the Dragon, although only a copy of Rublev's masterpiece, was considered to be one of the finest examples of early twentieth-century craftsmanship to come out of Russia since the Revolution.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov looked up at the researcher. &quot;Twentieth-century copy be damned,&quot; he said. &quot;It was the fifteenth-century original and none of them realised it at the time - perhaps not even the old Grand Duke himself. No doubt the Tsar had other plans for the icon had he managed to escape.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He stared down at the photograph above the <I>Zeitung </I>report. The young Grand Duke was shaking hands with the general in charge of the salvage team which had been successful in returning so many of the Prince's family possessions. &quot;But did he return them all?&quot; Romanov said out loud.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked the young researcher. Romanov waved his hand as he continued to stare at the pre-war, faded photograph of the two men. Although the general was unnamed, every schoolboy in Germany would have recognised the large, impassive, heavy-jowled face with the chilling eyes which had become infamous to the Allied powers.</FONT><BR>

For the next thirty-four minutes he pounded the pavement down to the Embankment, across Albert Bridge, through Battersea Park to return by way of Chelsea Bridge. Only one thought was going through his mind. After twenty years of gossip and innuendo was this going to be the one chance to clear his father's name? The moment he arrived back at the flat, Adam checked his pulse: 150 beats a minute. Sixty seconds later it was down to 100, another minute 70, and before the fourth minute was up it was back to a steady 58. It's the recovery that proves fitness, not your speed, his old Physical Training Instructor at Aldershot had drummed into him.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Only the obvious,&quot; Anna Petrova replied in an offhand manner.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov considered reprimanding the young girl for such insolence, but said nothing on this occasion. After all, Comrade Petrova had proved to be far the most innovative of his team of researchers.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And what was so obvious?&quot; enquired Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's common knowledge that Hitler put Goering in charge of all the art treasures captured on behalf of the Third Reich. But as the Fiihrer had such fixed personal opinions as to what constituted quality, many of the world's masterpieces were judged as 'depraved' and therefore unworthy to be put on public view for the delectation of the master race.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So what happened to them?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Hitler ordered them to be destroyed. Among those works condemned to death by burning were such masters as Van Gogh, Manet, Monet - and especially the young Picasso who was considered unworthy of the blue-blooded Aryan race Hitler was grooming to rule the world.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You are not suggesting Goering could have stolen the Tsar's icon,&quot; asked Romanov, staring up at the ceiling, &quot;only then to burn it?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, no. Goering was not that stupid. As we now know, he didn't always obey the Fiihrer's every word.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Goering failed to carry out Hitler's orders?&quot; said Romanov in disbelief.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Depends from which  standpoint you view it,&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Petrova replied. &quot;Was he to behave as his lunatic master demanded or turn a blind eye and use his common sense?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Stick to the facts,&quot; said Romanov, his voice suddenly sharp.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, Comrade Major,&quot; said the young researcher in a tone that suggested she believed herself to be indispensable, at least for the time being.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;When it came to it,&quot; Petrova continued, &quot;Goering did not destroy any of the denounced masterpieces. He held some public burnings in Berlin and Diisseldorf of lesser known German artists, who would never have fetched more than a few hundred marks on the open market in the first place. But the masterpieces, the real works of genius, were moved discreetly over the border and deposited in the vaults of Swiss banks.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So there's still an outside chance that having found the icon . . .&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He then had it placed in a Swiss bank,&quot; added Petrova. &quot;I wish it were that simple, Comrade Major,&quot; said the researcher, &quot;but unfortunately Goering wasn't quite as naive as the newspaper cartoonists of the time made him out to be. I think he deposited the paintings and antiques in several Swiss banks and to date no one has ever been able to discover which banks or the aliases he used.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then <I>we </I>shall have to do so,&quot; said Romanov. &quot;Where do you suggest we start?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, since the end of the war many of the paintings have been found and restored to their rightful owners, including the galleries of the German Democratic Republic. Others, however, have appeared on walls as far-flung as the Getty Museum in California and the Gotoh in Tokyo, sometimes without a fully satisfactory explanation. In fact, one of Renoir's major works</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">50</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">can currently be seen hanging on the walls of the Metropolitan Museum in New York. It undoubtedly passed through Goering's hands although the curator of the museum has never been willing to explain how the gallery came into possession of it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Have all the missing pictures now been found?&quot; asked Romanov anxiously.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Over seventy per cent, but there are still many more to be accounted for. Some may even have been lost or destroyed, but my guess is that there are still a large number that remain lodged in Swiss banks.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How can you be so certain?&quot; demanded Romanov, fearful that his last avenue might be closing.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Because the Swiss banks always return valuables when they can be certain of a nation's or individual's right of possession. In the case of the Grand Duke of Hesse and the Tsar's icon there was no proof of ownership, as the last official owner was Tsar Nicholas II and he, as every good Russian knows, Comrade, had no successors.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then I must do exactly what Goering did and retrace his steps by going direct to the banks. What has been their policy to date?&quot; asked Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That differs from establishment to establishment,&quot; said Petrova. &quot;Some banks wait for twenty years or more and then try either by extensive research or advertising to contact the owner or their next of kin. In the case of the Jews who lost their lives under the Nazi regime, it has often proved impossible to trace a legitimate owner. Although I have been unable to prove it, I suspect they kept the rewards and split the proceeds among themselves,&quot; said Petrova. &quot;Typical capitalists.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That is neither fair nor accurate, Comrade,&quot; said Romanov, glad to show that he had also been doing</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">some research. &quot;Because that is another of the great myths perpetrated by the poor. In fact, when the banks have been unable to discover the rightful owner of any treasure left with them they have handed it over to the Swiss Red Cross to auction.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But if the Tsar's icon had ever been auctioned we would have heard about it by now through one of our agents?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Precisely,&quot; said Romanov. &quot;And I've already checked through the.inventory of the Red Cross: four icons have been disposed of during the last twenty years and none of them was St George and the Dragon.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then that can only mean some unscrupulous bankers have disposed of the icon privately once they felt sure no one was going to make a claim.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Another false premise, I suspect, Comrade Pet-rova.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How can you be so certain?&quot; the young researcher asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;For one simple reason, Comrade. The Swiss banking families all know each other intimately and have never in the past shown any propensity for breaking the law. Swiss justice, in our experience, is as tough on corrupt bankers as it is on murderers, which is precisely why the Mafia was never happy about laundering its money through the established banks. The truth is that Swiss bankers make so much money dealing with honest people that it has never been in their best interests to become involved with crooks. There are remarkably few exceptions to this rule, which is the reason so many people are willing to do business with the Swiss.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So, if Goering stole the Tsar's icon and deposited it in a Swiss bank vault, it could be anywhere in the world by now?&quot; said Petrova.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">52</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I doubt it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why?&quot; sighed Petrova, a little peeved that her deductions were now proving wide of the mark.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Because for the past three weeks I have had heaven knows how many operatives combing Europe for the Tsar's icon. They have spoken to nearly every major curator, keeper, dealer and crook in the art world and yet they still haven't come up with a single lead. And why not? Because the only people who have seen the icon since 1917 were the Hesses and Goering, which leaves me with only one hope if it was not destroyed when the Grand Duke's plane crashed,&quot; said Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Namely?&quot; asked Petrova.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That while the rest of the world is under the illusion that the original still hangs in the Winter Palace, it has, for the past twenty years, been lodged in a Swiss bank waiting for someone to claim it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A long shot,&quot; said the researcher.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I am quite aware of that,&quot; said Romanov sharply, &quot;but don't forget that many Swiss banks have a twenty-five-year rule before disclosure, some even thirty. One or two even have no deadline at all as long as enough money has been deposited to cover the housing of the treasure.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">It took Adam only a few more minutes before he had checked over both documents again. He put the original back in the faded envelope and replaced it in the Bible on his bookshelf. Finally he folded his duplicated copy of Goering's letter into three horizontal pieces and cut it carefully along the folds into strips which he placed in a clean envelope and left on his bedside table. Adam's next problem was how to obtain a translation of the document and Goering's letter without arousing unnecessary curiosity. Years of army training had taught him to be cautious when faced with an unknown situation. He quickly dismissed the German Embassy, the German Tourist Board and the German Press Agency as all three were too official, and therefore likely to ask unwanted questions. Once he was dressed he went to the hall and began to flick through the pages in the London E-K Directory until his finger reached the column he had been searching for.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">His eye passed over 'German Technical Translations' and stopped at a more promising entry. The address was given as Bayswater House, 35 Craven Terrace, W2. He checked his watch.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam left the flat a few minutes before ten, the three pieces of the letter now safely lodged in the inside pocket of his blazer. He strolled down Edith Grove and into the King's Road, enjoying the morning sun. The street had been transformed from the one he had known as a young subaltern. Boutiques had taken the place of antiquarian bookshops. Record shops had replaced the local cobbler, and Dolcis had given way to Mary Quant. Take a fortnight's holiday, and you couldn't be sure anything would still be there when you returned, he reflected ruefully.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Crowds of people spilled out from the pavement on to the road, staring or hoping to be stared at, according to their age. As Adam passed the first of the record shops he had no choice but to listen to 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' as it blared into the ears of everyone within shouting distance.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">By the time Adam reached Sloane Square the world had almost returned to normal - Peter Jones, W. H. Smith's and the London Underground. The words his mother sang so often over the kitchen sink came back to him every time he walked into the square.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He opened the gate, walked up the drive and strode confidently through the front door. He was stopped by a porter standing in the hallway.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Can I help you, guv'nor?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam put on an exaggerated military accent and explained that he was looking for a young man called Hans Kramer.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Never 'card of 'im, sir,&quot; said the porter, almost standing to attention when he recognised the regimental tie. He turned to a book that lay open on the desk. &quot;'E isn't registered,&quot; he added, a Woodbine-stained thumb running down the list of names in front of him. &quot;Why don't you try the lounge or the games room?&quot; he suggested, gesturing with the thumb to a door on the right.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Adam, not dropping the plummy tones. He walked smartly across the hall and through the swing doors - which, judging from the lack of paint on the base, looked as if they had been kicked open more often than they had been pushed. He glanced around the room. Several students were lounging about reading German papers and magazines. He wasn't sure where to start, until he spotted a studious-looking girl on her own in a corner, poring over a copy of <I>Time</I></FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How?&quot; enquired the girl, sounding a little apprehensive.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I just need something translated.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">She looked relieved. &quot;I will see if I can help. Have you brought something with you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes I have, I hope it isn't too difficult,&quot; Adam said. He took the envelope from his inside pocket and extracted the first paragraph of Goering's letter.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Then he put the envelope back in his pocket, took out a little notebook and waited expectantly. He felt like a cub reporter.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">She read the paragraph over two or three times, then seemed to hesitate.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Is anything wrong?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not exactly,&quot; she replied, still concentrating on the words in front of her. &quot;It's just that it's a little bit old-fashioned so that I might not be able to give you the exact sense.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam breathed a sigh of relief.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">She repeated each sentence slowly, first in German and then in English as if wanting to feel the meaning as well as just translating the words.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Over the last . . . past year we have come to know . . . each other somewhat. . . no, no,&quot; she said, &quot;quite well.&quot; Adam wrote each word down as the girl translated them.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You have never disguised - perhaps a better meaning is 'hidden' -&quot; she added, &quot;your distaste for the National Socialist Party.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">She raised her head and stared at Adam. &quot;It's only out of a book,&quot; he assured her. She didn't look convinced but nevertheless continued. &quot;But you have at every time . . . no, at all times, behaved with the courtesy of an officer and a gentleman.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The girl looked up, even more puzzled, as she had now reached the last word.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Is that all?&quot; she asked. &quot;It doesn't make sense. There has to be more.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, that's it,&quot; said Adam, quickly taking back the sheet of paper. &quot;Thank you,&quot; he added. &quot;It was most kind of you to help.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He left the girl and was relieved to see her shrug resignedly and return to her copy of <I>Time. </I>Adam went in search of the games room.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When he swung the door open he found a young man in a World Cup T-shirt and brown suede shorts. He was tapping a table tennis ball up and down listlessly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Care for a game?&quot; said the boy, not looking at all hopeful.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sure,&quot; said Adam, removing his jacket and picking up the table tennis bat at his end of the table. For twenty minutes Adam had to play flat out to make sure he lost 18-21, 21-12, 17-21. As he replaced his jacket and congratulated his opponent he felt sure he had gained the young man's confidence.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You put up good fight,&quot; said the German. &quot;Give me good game.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's from a book, so it may seem a little out of context,&quot; Adam said, unconvincingly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Okay, I try.&quot; As the boy began to study the paragraph, the girl who had already translated the first section came into the games room. She made her way towards them.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;This hard to make out, I am not good translation for,&quot; the young man said. &quot;My girlfriend better, I think. I ask her. <I>Liebling, kannst Du dies fur den Herrn ins Englische?&quot; </I>Without looking at Adam he passed the second paragraph over to the girl who immediately said, &quot;I knew there was more.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, no, don't bother,&quot; said Adam, and grabbed the piece of paper away from the girl. He turned back to the boy and said, &quot;Thank you for the game. Sorry to have bothered you,&quot; and walked hurriedly out into the corridor, heading for the front door.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Did you find 'im, sir?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Find him?&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Hans Kramer,&quot; said the porter.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh, yes, thank you,&quot; said Adam. As he turned to leave he saw the young boy and his girlfriend were following close behind.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam ran down the drive and hailed a passing taxi.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where to?&quot; said the cabbie.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The Royal Cleveland Hotel.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But that's only just round the corner.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam only relaxed when the cab turned the corner and they were out of sight.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">In less than a minute the taxi had drawn up outside the Royal Cleveland. Adam handed the cabbie half a crown and waited for the change. Then he pushed through the revolving doors of the hotel and hung around in the foyer for a few moments before returning to the pavement again. He checked his watch: twelve thirty. Easily enough time for lunch, he thought, before going on to his interview with the Foreign Office. He headed across the Bayswater Road into the park at a brisk pace, knowing he couldn't hope to find a pub until he reached Knightsbridge.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam recalled the table tennis match. Damn, he thought. I should have thrashed him. At least that would have given him something else to think about.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov's eye ran down the list of the fourteen banks. There was still an outside chance that one of them might be in possession of the Tsar's icon, but the names meant nothing to him. It was another world, and he knew he would now have to seek advice from an expert. He unlocked the top drawer of his desk and flicked through the red book held only by the most senior ranking officers in the KGB. Manv names had been scratched out or overwritten as regimes came and went but Aleksei Andreovich Poskonov had remained in his present position as Chairman of the National Bank for nearly a decade, and only Gromyko the Foreign Secretary had served in any office longer. Romanov dialled a number on his private line and asked to be put through to the Chairman of Gosbank. It was some</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">considerable time before another voice came on the line.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Comrade Romanov, what can I do for you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I urgently need to see you,&quot; said Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Really.&quot; The gravelly tones that came from the other end of the line sounded distinctly unimpressed. Romanov could hear pages being flicked over. &quot;I could manage Tuesday, say eleven thirty?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I said it was urgent,&quot; repeated Romanov. &quot;It concerns a State matter that can't wait.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We are the nation's bankers and do have one or two problems of our own, you might be surprised to hear,&quot; came back the unrepentant voice. Romanov checked himself and waited. There was more flicking of pages. &quot;Well, I suppose I could fit you in at three forty-five today, for fifteen minutes,&quot; said the banker. &quot;But I must warn you that I have a long-standing engagement at four.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Three forty-five it is then,&quot; said Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;In my office,&quot; said Poskonov. The phone went dead.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov cursed out loud. Why did everyone feel obliged to prove their manhood with the KGB? He began to write down the questions he needed answered in order to put his plan into operation. He couldn't afford to waste even a minute of his allocated fifteen. An hour later he asked to see the Chairman of the KGB. This time he was not kept waiting.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Trying to play the capitalists at their own game, are we?&quot; said Zaborski, once Romanov had outlined his intentions. &quot;Be careful. They've been at it a lot longer than we have.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I realise that,&quot; said Romanov. &quot;But if the icon is in the West I'm left with little choice but to use their methods to get my hands on it.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said the Chairman. &quot;But with your name such an approach could be misunderstood.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov knew better than to interrupt the brief silence that ensued. &quot;Don't worry, I'll give you all the backing you need - although I've never had a request quite like this one before.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Am I allowed to know why the icon is so important?&quot; Romanov enquired.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The Chairman of the KGB frowned. &quot;I do not have the authority to answer that question, but as Comrade Brezhnev's enthusiasm for the arts is well known you must have been able to work out that it is not the painting itself that we are after.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">What secret can the painting hold? thought Romanov, and decided to press on. &quot;I wondered if...&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The Chairman of the KGB shook his head firmly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Bugs don't have eyes, thought Romanov, but you know what that something is, don't you?</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The Chairman rose from his desk and walked over to the wall and tore another page from the calendar. &quot;Only ten days left to find the damn thing,&quot; he said. &quot;The General Secretary has taken to phoning me at one o'clock every morning.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;One o'clock in the morning?&quot; said Romanov joining in the game.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, the poor man can't sleep, they tell me,&quot; said the Chairman, returning to his desk. &quot;It comes to all of us in time - perhaps even you, Romanov, and maybe earlier than you expect if you don't stop asking questions.&quot; He gave his young colleague a wry smile.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov left the Chairman a few minutes later and returned to his office to go over the questions that did need to be answered by the Chairman of Gosbank. He</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">couldn't help becoming distracted by thoughts of what could possibly be the significance of such a small painting, but accepted that he must concentrate his efforts on finding it and then perhaps the secret it contained would become obvious.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov reached the steps of Neglinnaya 12 at three thirty because he knew he needed more than the fifteen minutes he had been allocated if he was to get all his questions answered. He only hoped Poskonov would agree to see him immediately.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">After announcing himself at the reception desk he was accompanied by a uniformed guard up the wide marble staircase to the first floor, where Poskonov's secretary was waiting to greet him. Romanov was led to an anteroom. &quot;I will inform the Chairman of the bank that you have arrived, Comrade Romanov,&quot; the secretary said, and then disappeared back into his own office. Romanov paced up and down the small anteroom impatiently, but the secretary did not return until the hands on the clock were in a straight line. At three fifty, Romanov was ushered into the Chairman's room.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The young major was momentarily taken aback by the sheer opulence of the room. The long red velvet curtains, the marble floor and the delicate French furniture wouldn't, he imagined, have been out of place in the Governor's rooms at the Bank of England. Romanov was reminded not for the first time that money still remained the most important commodity in the world - even in the Communist world. He stared at the old stooped man with the thinning grey hair and bushy walrus moustache who controlled the nation's money. The man of whom it was said that he knew of one skeleton in everyone's cupboard. Everyone's ex-</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What can I do for you, Comrade Romanov?&quot; enquired the banker with a sigh, as if addressing a tiresome customer who was seeking a small loan.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I require one hundred million American dollars' worth of gold bullion immediately,&quot; he announced evenly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The chairman's bored expression suddenly changed. He went scarlet and fell back into his chair. He took several short, sharp breaths before pulling open a drawer, taking out a square box and extracting a large white pill from it. It took fully a minute before he seemed calm again.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Have you gone out of your mind, Comrade?&quot; the old man enquired. &quot;You ask for an appointment without giving a reason, you then charge into my office and demand that I hand over one hundred million American dollars in gold without any explanation. For what reason do you make such a preposterous suggestion?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That is the business of the State,&quot; said Romanov. &quot;But, since you have enquired, I intend to deposit equal amounts in a series of numbered accounts across Switzerland.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And on whose authority do you make such a request?&quot; the banker asked in a level tone.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The General Secretary of the Party.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Strange,&quot; said Poskonov. &quot;I see Leonid Ilyich at least once a week and he has not mentioned this to me,&quot; the chairman looked down at the pad in the middle of his desk, &quot;that a Major Romanov, a middle-ranking&quot; - he stressed the words - &quot;officer from the KGB would be making such an exorbitant demand.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov stepped forward, picked up the phone by Poskonov's side and held it out to him. &quot;Why don't you ask Leonid Ilyich yourself and save us all a lot of time?&quot; He pushed the phone defiantly towards the banker. Poskonov stared back at him, took the phone and placed it to his ear. Romanov sensed the sort of tension he only felt in the field.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A voice came on the line. &quot;You called, Comrade Chairman?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes,&quot; replied the old man. &quot;Cancel my four o'clock appointment, and see that I am not disturbed until Major Romanov leaves.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, Comrade Chairman.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Poskonov replaced the phone and, without another word, rose from behind his desk and walked around to Romanov's side. He ushered the young man into a comfortable chair on the far side of the room below a bay window and took the seat opposite him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I knew your grandfather,&quot; he said in a calm, matter-of-fact tone. &quot;I was a junior commodity clerk when I first met him. I had just left school and he was very kind to me but he was just as impatient as you are. Which was why he was the best fur trader in • Russia and thought to be the worst poker player.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov laughed. He had never known his grandfather and the few books that referred to him had long ago been destroyed. His father talked openly of his wealth and position which had only given the authorities ammunition finally to destroy him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You'll forgive my curiosity, Major, but if I am to hand over one hundred million dollars in gold I should like to know what it is to be spent on. I thought only the CIA put in chits for those sort of expenses without explanation.&quot;</FONT><BR>

When he had completed his story he handed over the names of the fourteen banks. The banker studied the list closely while Romanov outlined the course of action he proposed to take, showing how the money would be returned intact as soon as he had located the missing icon.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But how can one small icon possibly be that important to the State?&quot; Poskonov asked out loud, almost as if Romanov were no longer in the room.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I have no idea,&quot; replied Romanov truthfully and then briefed him on the results of his research.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">There was an exasperated grunt from the other chair when Romanov had finished. &quot;May I be permitted to suggest an alternative to your plan?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Please do,&quot; said Romanov, relieved to be gaining the older man's co-operation.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Do you smoke?&quot; asked the banker, taking a packet of Dunhill cigarettes from his coat pocket.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No,&quot; said Romanov, his eyebrows lifting slightly at the sight of ihe red box.</FONT><BR>
</P>

You suspect that lodged in one of these fourteen Swiss banks&quot; - the Chairman tapped the list with his index finger - &quot;is the original Tsar's icon. You therefore want me to deposit large amounts of gold with each bank in the hope that it will give you immediate access to the head of the family, or chairman. You will then offer the chairman the chance to control the entire hundred million if they promise to co-operate with you?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Romanov. &quot;Bribery is surely something the West has always understood.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I would have said 'naive' if I hadn't known your grandfather, though to be fair it was he who ended up making millions of roubles, not me. Nevertheless, how much do you imagine is a lot of money to a major Swiss bank?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov considered the question. &quot;Ten million, twenty million?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;To the Moscow Narodny Bank perhaps,&quot; said Poskonov. &quot;But every one of the banks you hope to deal with will have several customers with deposits of over a hundred million each.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov was unable to hide his disbelief.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I confess,&quot; continued the chairman, &quot;that our revered General Secretary showed no less incredulity when I informed him of these facts some years ago.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then I will need a thousand million?&quot; asked Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, no, no. We must approach the problem from a different standpoint. You do not catch a poacher by offering him rabbit stew.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But if the Swiss are not moved by the offer of vast amounts of money, what <I>will </I>move them?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The simple suggestion that their bank has been used for criminal activity,&quot; said the chairman.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But how . . .&quot; began Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Let me explain. You say that the Tsar's icon hanging in the Winter Palace is not the original but a copy. A good copy, painted by a twentieth-century court painter, but nevertheless a copy. Therefore why not explain to each of the fourteen banks privately that, after extensive research, we have reason to believe that one of the nation's most valuable treasures has been substituted with a copy and the original is thought to</FONT><BR>

And rather than cause a diplomatic incident — the one thing every Swiss banker wishes to avoid at any cost - perhaps they would, in the interests of good relationships, consider checking in their vaults items that have not been claimed for over twenty years.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov looked straight at the old man, realising why he had survived several purges. &quot;I owe you an apology, Comrade Poskonov.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, no, we each have our own little skills. I am sure I would be as lost in your world as you appear to be in mine. Now, if you will allow me to contact each of the chairmen on this list and tell them no more than the truth - a commodity I am always obliged to trade in although I imagine your counterparts are not so familiar with - namely that I suspect the Tsar's icon is in <I>their </I>bank, most of them will be disinclined to hold on to the masterpiece if they believe in so doing a crime has been perpetrated against a sovereign state.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I cannot overstress the urgency,&quot; said Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Just like your grandfather,&quot; Poskonov repeated. &quot;So be it. If they can be tracked down, I shall speak to every one of them today. At least that's one of the advantages of the rest of the world waking up after us. Be assured I shall be in touch with you the moment I have any news.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Romanov, rising to leave. &quot;You have been most helpful.&quot; He was about to add, as he normally did in such circumstances, I shall so inform my Chairman, but he checked himself, realising the old man wouldn't have given a damn.</FONT><BR>
</P>

I doubt if I have ten million dollars' worth of gold left in the vaults at this moment. The General Secretary has already ordered me to fly every available ounce to the Bank of New York — so cleverly was his ploy disguised that the CIA had been informed about the deposit within an hour of its arrival. It's hard to hide over 700 million dollars in gold, even in America. I tried to tell him. The chairman watched Romanov's car drive away. Of course if, like your grandfather, you read the <I>Washington Post </I>as well as <I>Pravda, </I>you would already have known this. He returned to his desk and checked the names of the fourteen banks.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said the girl, &quot;you're a little early, but do have a seat over there.&quot; She gestured towards a chair in the corner, then her eyes moved on to Adam and she smiled.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; she repeated. &quot;Could you join the other gentleman?

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam soon became bored with flicking through endless issues <I>of Punch </I>and took a more careful look at Wainwright. &quot;Do you by any chance speak German?&quot; Adam asked suddenly, turning to face the other interviewee.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;German, French, Italian and Spanish,&quot; Wainwright replied, looking up. &quot;I assumed that was how I managed to get this far,&quot; he added somewhat smugly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then perhaps you could translate a paragraph from a German letter for me?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Delighted, old fellow,&quot; said Adam's companion, who proceeded to remove the pair of thick-lensed glasses from his nose, and waited for Adam to extract the middle paragraph of the letter from his envelope.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Now, let me see,&quot; Wainwright said, taking the little slip of paper and replacing the glasses. &quot;Quite a challenge. I say, old fellow, you're not part of the interviewing team by any chance?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, no,&quot; said Adam, smiling. &quot;I'm in exactly the same position as you — except I don't speak German, French, Italian or Spanish.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;'During the past year you cannot have failed to . . . notice that I have been receiving from one of the guards a regular, regular . . . regular supply',&quot; he said suddenly, &quot;yes, 'supply of Havana cigars. One of the few pleasures I have been allocated' - no, 'allowed', better still 'permitted' - 'despite my . . . incarceration'. That's the nearest I can get,&quot; Wainwright added. &quot; 'The cigars themselves have also served another purpose',&quot; Wainwright continued, obviously enjoying himself, &quot;'as they contained tiny capsules . . .'&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Alex Romanov was not a patient man at the best of times, and with the General Secretary now ringing up his chief twice a day, these were not the best of times. While he waited for results of the chairman of Gosbank's enquiries he re-read the research papers that had been left on his desk, and checked any new intelligence that had been sent back by his agents in the field. Romanov resented the scraps of information the chairman of Gosbank must have been receiving by the hour, but he made no attempt to pester the old man despite his time problem.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Then the chairman of the bank called.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">On this occasion Romanov was driven straight over to the State Bank at Neglinnaya 12 and ushered up to the finely furnished room without a moment's delay.

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You must have wondered if I had forgotten you,&quot; were Poskonov's opening words as he ushered Romanov to the comfortable chair. &quot;But I wanted to have some positive news to give you rather than waste your time. You don't smoke, if I remember correctly,&quot; he added, taking out his packet of Dunhill cigarettes.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, thank you,&quot; Romanov said, wondering if the chairman's doctor realised how much the old man smoked.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The chairman's secretary entered the room and placed two empty glasses, a frosted flask and a plate of caviar in front of them.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov waited in silence.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I have, over the past two days, managed to talk to the chairmen of twelve of the banks on your original list,&quot; Poskonov began, as he poured two vodkas, &quot;but I have avoided making contact with the remaining two.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Avoided?&quot; repeated Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Patience, Comrade,&quot; said Poskonov, sounding like a benevolent uncle. &quot;You have longer to live than I so if there is any time to be wasted it must be yours.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I avoided one of the chairmen,&quot; Poskonov continued, &quot;because he is in Mexico showing President Ordaz how not to repay their loan to Chase Manhattan while at the same time borrowing even more dollars from the Bank of America.

The second gentleman I have avoided because he is officially in Chicago, closing a major Eurobond deal with Continental Illinois, while in fact he is booked in at the St Francis Hotel in San Francisco with his mistress. I feel certain you would agree, Comrade Major, that it would not advance our cause to disturb either of these gentlemen at this precise moment. The first has enough problems to be going on with for the rest of the week, while the second may well have his phone tapped - and we wouldn't want the Americans to discover what we are searching for, would we?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Agreed, Comrade,&quot; said Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good. Anyway as they both return to Switzerland early next week we have quite enough to be going on with for now.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, but what —&quot; Romanov began.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It will please you to know,&quot; continued Poskonov, &quot;that of the twelve remaining chairmen all have agreed to co-operate with us and five have already phoned back. Four to say they have run a thorough check on the possessions of customers who have been out of contact with the bank for over twenty years, but have come up with nothing that remotely resembles an icon. In fact, one of them opened a deposit box in the presence of three other directors that had not been touched since 1931 only to discover it contained nothing but a cork from a 1929 bottle of Taylor's port.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Only a cork?&quot; said Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, 1929 was a vintage year,&quot; admitted the chairman.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And the fifth?&quot; enquired Romanov.</FONT><BR>

He adjusted his spectacles with the forefinger of his right hand before continuing. &quot;Herr Dieter Bischoff of Bischoff et Cie&quot; - he looked up at his guest, as if Romanov might have recognised the name - &quot;an honourable man with whom I have dealt many times in the past - honourable, that is, by Western standards of course, Comrade,&quot; added the chairman, obviously enjoying himself. &quot;Bischoff has come up with something that was left with the bank in 1938. It is unquestionably an icon, but he has no way of knowing if it is the one we are looking for.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov leapt up from his seat in excitement. &quot;Then I had better go and see for myself,&quot; said Romanov. &quot;I could fly out today,&quot; he added. The chairman waved him back into his chair.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The plane you require does not leave Sheremtyevo airport until four thirty-five. In any case, I have already booked two seats on it for you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Two?&quot; enquired Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You will obviously need an expert to accompany you, unless you know considerably more about icons than you do about banking,&quot; Poskonov added. &quot;I also took the liberty of booking you on the Swissair flight. One should never fly Aeroflot if it can be avoided. It has managed only one aviation record consistently every year since its inception, namely that of losing the most passengers per miles flown, and a banker never believes in going against known odds. I have fixed an appointment for you to see Herr Bischoff at ten o'clock tomorrow morning - unless, of course, you have something more pressing to keep you in Moscow, Comrade?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">I also recommend that you stay at the St Gothard while you are in Zurich. Jacques Pontin will take excellent care of you. Nationality has never been a problem for the Swiss, only currency. And so that brings my little investigation up to date, and I shall be in touch again as soon as the two itinerant chairmen return to Switzerland next Monday. All I can do for the moment however, is wish you luck in Zurich.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Romanov. &quot;May I be permitted to add how much I appreciate your thoroughness.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My pleasure, Comrade, let's just say that I still owe your grandfather a favour, and perhaps one day you will find you owe me one, and leave it at that.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov tried to fathom the meaning of the old man's words. There was no clue to be found in Pos-konov's expression and so he left without another word. But as Romanov walked down the wide marble staircase, he considered the banker's sentiment again and again because throw-away lines were never delivered to an officer of the KGB.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">By the time Romanov had returned to Dzerzhinsky Square, his secretary informed him that Herr BischofTs assistant had telephoned from Zurich to confirm his appointment with the chairman at ten o'clock the following morning. Romanov asked him to call the manager at the St Gothard Hotel and book two rooms. &quot;Oh, and confirm my flight with Swissair,&quot; he added before walking up two floors to see the Chairman and brief him on the meeting he had had with the head of the National Bank.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank God for that,&quot; were Zaborski's first words. &quot;With only nine days left at least you've given me something to discuss with the General Secretary when he calls at one tomorrow morning.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When Adam emerged from the interview he felt quietly confident. The chairman's final words had been to ask him if he would be available for a thorough medical in a week's time. Adam had told them he could think of nothing that would stop him attending. He looked forward to the opportunity of serving in the British Foreign Service.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Back in the waiting room Wainwright looked up and handed him back his piece of paper.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you very much,&quot; said Adam, trying to look casual by slipping it into his inside pocket without looking at the results.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What was it like, old chap?&quot; his companion asked cautiously.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No trouble for a man who has German, French, Spanish and Italian as part of his armoury,&quot; Adam assured him. &quot;Best of luck, anyway.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Mr Wainwright,&quot; said the secretary, &quot;the Board will see you now.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam took the lift to the ground floor and decided to walk home, stopping on the corner of Wilton Place to buy a bag of apples from a barrow boy who seemed to spend most of his time on the lookout for the police. Adam moved on, going over in his mind the Board's</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">questions and his answers - a pointless exercise he decided, although he still felt confident the interview had gone well. He came to such a sudden halt that the pedestrian behind only just stopped himself bumping into Adam. What had attracted his attention was a sign which read: 'The German Food Centre'. An attractive girl with a cheerful smile and laughing eyes was sitting at the cash register by the doorway. Adam strode into the shop and went straight over to her without attempting to purchase a single item.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You have not bought anything?&quot; she enquired with a slight accent.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, I'm just about to,&quot; Adam assured her, &quot;but I wondered, do you speak German?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Most girls from Mainz do,&quot; she replied, grinning.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, I suppose they would,&quot; said Adam, looking at the girl more carefully. She must have been in her early twenties, Adam decided, and he was immediately attracted by her friendly smile and manner. Her shiny, dark hair was done up in a pony tail with a big red bow. Her white sweater and neat pleated skirt would have made any man take a second look. Her slim legs were tucked under the chair. &quot;I wonder if you would be kind enough to translate a short paragraph for me?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I try,&quot; she said, still smiling.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam took the envelope containing the final section of the letter out of his pocket and handed it over to her.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The style is a bit old-fashioned,&quot; she said, looking serious. &quot;It may take a little time.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'll go and do some shopping,&quot; he told her, and started walking slowly round the long stacked shelves. He selected a little salami, frankfurters, bacon, and some German mustard, looking up now and then to see how the girl was progressing. From what he could</FONT><BR>

Nearly twenty minutes passed before he saw her put the piece of paper on one side. Adam immediately went over to the cash register and placed his purchases on the counter.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;One pound two shillings and sixpence,&quot; she said. Adam handed over two pounds and she returned his change and the little piece of paper.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;This I consider a rough translation, but I think the meaning is clear.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I don't know how to thank you,&quot; said Adam, as an elderly woman joined him in the queue.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You could invite me to share with you your frankfurters,&quot; she laughed.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What a nice idea,&quot; said Adam. &quot;Why don't you join me for dinner tonight?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I was not serious,&quot; she said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I was,&quot; smiled Adam. Another person joined the queue and the old lady immediately behind him began to look restive.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam grabbed a leaflet from the counter, retreated towards the back of the store, and began to scribble down his name, address and phone number. He waited for the two customers in front of him to pay, then handed over to her a 'once in a lifetime' Persil offer.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What's this?&quot; the girl asked innocently.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I've put my name and address on the centre page,&quot; Adam said. &quot;I will expect you for dinner at about eight this evening. At least you know what's on the menu.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">She looked uncertain. &quot;I really was only joking.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I won't eat you,&quot; said Adam. &quot;Only the sausages.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">She looked at the leaflet in her hand and laughed. &quot;I'll think about it.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He was back at the flat in time to watch the five forty-five news. Mrs Gandhi, the new Prime Minister of India, was facing open revolt in her cabinet and Adam wondered if Britain could ever have a woman Prime Minister. England were 117 for seven in their first innings, with the West Indies still well on top. He groaned and turned off the television. Once he had put the food in the fridge he went into his bedroom to assemble the full text of the Goering letter. After he had read through all the little slips of paper he took out his notepad and began to copy out the translations in order: first, the paragraph supplied by the girl from the YMCA, then Wainwright's handwritten words from the notepad, and finally the section of the letter translated by the lovely girl from Mainz. He read the completed draft through slowly a second time.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Bloody traffic,&quot; said Lawrence cheerfully. &quot;I can't wait to be appointed chairman of the bank and be given that luxury flat on the top floor, not to mention the chauffeur and the company car.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam laughed. &quot;Had another hard day at the office, darling?&quot; he mimicked, before joining him in the kitchen. Adam started removing food from the fridge.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Guess who's coming to dinner,&quot; said Lawrence as each new delicacy appeared.</FONT><BR>
</P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A rather attractive German girl, I hope,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What do you mean, 'hope'?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, it could hardly have been described as a formal invitation so I'm not even certain she'll turn up.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;If that's the situation I may as well hang around in case she gives you the elbow and you need someone to help you eat that lot.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Carolyn was yesterday's girl, to quote the esteemed Harold Wilson. How did you come across <I>yourgnddiges Frdulein?&quot;</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;She was serving at a food store in Knightsbridge.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I see. We're down to shop assistants now.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I have no idea what she is or even what her name is, come to that,&quot; said Adam. &quot;But I am hoping to find out tonight. As I said, your turn to disappear.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Naturlich. </I>As you see, you can rely on me-to provide a helping hand if you need anything translated.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Just put the wine in the fridge and lay the table.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Are there no serious jobs for a man of my accomplishments to be entrusted with?&quot; chuckled Lawrence.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When eight o'clock chimed, the table was set and Adam had everything ready on the boil. By eight thirty both of them stopped pretending and Adam served up two plates of frankfurters, salami and lettuce with a baked potato and sauerkraut sauce. He then hung up his Goons apron behind the kitchen door and took the chair opposite Lawrence, who had begun pouring the wine.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh, <I>mein liebes Mddchen, </I>you look ravishing in that Harris tweed jacket,&quot; said Lawrence, raising his glass.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam was just about to retaliate with the vegetable spoon when there was a loud knock on the front door. The two men stared at each other before Adam leaped to open it. Standing in the doorway was a man well over six foot with shoulders like a professional bouncer. By his side, dwarfed by him, was the girl that Adam had invited to dinner.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;This is my brother, Jochen,&quot; she explained. Adam was immediately struck by how beautiful she looked</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">in a dark blue patterned blouse and pleated blue skirt that fell just below the knee. Her long dark hair, now hanging loose, looked as if it had just been washed and shone even under the forty watt light bulb that hung in the hall.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Welcome,&quot; said Adam, more than a little taken aback.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Jochen is just dropping me off.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; said Adam. &quot;Do come in and have a drink, Jochen.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, I thank you. I have a date as well, but I will pick up Heidi at eleven o'clock, if all right by you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Fine by me,&quot; said Adam, at last learning her name.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The giant bent down and kissed his sister on both cheeks. He then shook hands with Adam before leaving them both on the doorstep.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I am sorry to be late,&quot; said Heidi. &quot;My brother did not get back from work until after seven.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It was no problem,&quot; said Adam, leading her into the flat. &quot;If you had come any earlier I wouldn't have been ready for you. By the way, this is my flatmate, Lawrence Pemberton.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;In England the men also need a chaperone?&quot; said Heidi.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Both men laughed. &quot;No, no,&quot; said Lawrence. &quot;I was just on my way out. Like your brother, I already have a date. As you can see the table is only laid for two. I'll be back around eleven, Adam, just to make sure you're safe.&quot; He smiled at Heidi, put on his coat and closed the door behind him before either could object.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I hope I don't drive him away,&quot; said Heidi.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, no,&quot; said Adam, as she took Lawrence's place at the table. &quot;He's already late for his girlfriend. Charming girl called Carolyn, a social worker.&quot; He</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So I am going to eat my own sausages, after all,&quot; she said, laughing. And the laughter didn't stop for the rest of the evening, as Adam learned about Heidi's life in Germany, her family and the holiday job she had taken while on vacation from Mainz University.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My parents only allow me to come to England because my brother is already in London; it is to help my languages course. But now, Adam, I would like to know what you are doing when you are not picking up girls in food stores.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I was in the army for nine years and I'm now hoping to join the Foreign Office.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;In what capacity, if that is the right expression?&quot; Heidi asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's the right expression, but I'm not sure I know the right answer,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;When someone says that about the Foreign Service it usually means they are a spy.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I don't know what it means, to be honest, but they're going to tell me next week. In any case, I don't think I'd make a very good spy. But what are you going to do when you return to Germany?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Complete my final year at Mainz and then I hope to find a job as a television researcher.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What about Jochen?&quot; asked Adam.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He will join my father's law practice as soon as he is arriving home.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So how long will you be in London?&quot; he found himself asking.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Another two months,&quot; she said. &quot;If I can stand the job.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So do I,&quot; she replied, smiling.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When Jochen arrived back punctually at eleven o'clock, he found Adam and Heidi washing the dishes.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you for a most interesting evening,&quot; she said, wiping her hands.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not a good word,&quot; reprimanded Jochen. &quot;Not interesting, I think. Lovely, happy, delightful, enjoyable perhaps, but not interesting.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It was all those things,&quot; said Adam, &quot;but it was also interesting.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">She smiled.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;May I come and buy some more sausages tomorrow?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I would like that,&quot; said Heidi, &quot;but don't hold up any sour old women this time with translation demands. By the way, you never tell me why you needed the strange paragraph translated. I have been wondering who is this Rosenbaum and what it is he left to someone.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Next time perhaps,&quot; said Adam, looking a little embarrassed.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And next time you can bring my sister home yourself,&quot; said Jochen, as he shook Adam's hand firmly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">After Heidi had left, Adam sat down and finished off the last glass of wine, aware that he hadn't spent such a lovely, happy, delightful, enjoyable and interesting evening for a long time.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A black limousine with dark windows and unlit number plates remained parked in the VIP area of Zurich Kloten. Fastidious Swiss policemen had twice gone up to the car and checked the driver's credentials before Major Romanov and Anna Petrova emerged from the</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">It was already dark as the driver moved off towards the neon glow of the city. When the car drew up outside the St Gothard Hotel the only words that passed between Romanov and the driver were, &quot;I shall return to Moscow on the Tuesday morning flight.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Jacques Pontin, the manager of the hotel, was stationed at the door waiting to greet the new arrivals; he introduced himself immediately, and as soon as he had checked them both in he banged a little bell with the palm of his hand to summon a porter to assist the guests with their bags. A moment later a young man in his early twenties, dressed in green livery, appeared.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Suite seventy-three and room seventy-four,&quot; Jacques instructed before turning back to Romanov. &quot;I do hope your stay will prove to be worthwhile, Herr Romanov,&quot; he said. &quot;Please do not hesitate to call upon me if there is anything you need.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Romanov as he turned to join the porter who stood sentinel-like by the door of an open lift. Romanov stood to one side to allow Anna to go in first. The lift stopped at the seventh floor and the porter led the way down a long corridor to a corner suite. He turned the key in the lock and invited the two guests to go in ahead of him. The suite was as Romanov had expected, in a different league from the finest hotels he ever experienced in either Moscow or Leningrad. When he saw the array of gadgets in the marble bathroom he reflected that even prosperous travellers to Russia, if seasoned visitors, brought their own bath plugs with them.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Your room is through there, madam,&quot; the porter informed the researcher, and unlocked an adjoining door. Although smaller in size, the room maintained</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">the same unassuming elegance. The porter returned to Romanov, handed him his key and asked if there would be anything else he would require. Romanov assured him there was nothing and passed over a five-franc note.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Once again the porter gave a slight bow, and closing the door behind him, left Romanov to unpack while Anna Petrova went to her own room.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov started to undress and then disappeared into the bathroom. He studied himself in the mirror. Although he was vain about his looks, he was even more vain about the state of his physique. At twenty-nine, despite being six feet, he still only weighed 165 pounds on Western scales, and his muscles remained hard and taut.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">By the time Romanov had returned to the bedroom, he could hear the shower beating down in the adjoining bathroom. He crept over to the door and edged it open. He could see quite clearly the outline of Anna standing in the steaming shower. He smiled and noiselessly moved back across the thick carpet, slipped under the sheets and into the researcher's bed. He waited for her to turn off the steaming shower.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam stepped out of the freezing shower. Within minutes he was dressed and joined Lawrence in the kitchen for breakfast.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Still unable to charge you for hot water, am I?&quot; Lawrence said as Adam peered over his flatmate's shoulder, trying to take in the latest Test score.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why can't we produce any really fast fast bowlers?&quot; he asked rhetorically.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Left on his own, Adam boiled himself an egg and burned some toast before he turned to the newspaper to learn of the latest casualties in Vietnam and President Johnson's proposed tour of the Far East. At this rate he decided he wasn't going to win the <I>Daily Mail's </I>'Housewife of the Year' competition. He eventually cleared away in the kitchen, made his bed and tidied up behind Lawrence - nine years of self-discipline wasn't going to change old habits that quickly - then he settled down to plan another day.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He realised he could no longer avoid making a decision. He sat once again at his desk and began to consider how to get the official document translated without arousing further suspicion.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Almost absent-mindedly he removed the Bible from the bookshelf and extracted the letter he had read the night before. The final paragraph still puzzled him. He considered Heidi's translation once again:</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">All that will be required of you is to present yourself at the address printed on the top right-hand corner of the enclosed document, with some proof that you are Colonel Gerald Scott.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam turned his attention to the document. He was still quite unable to discern what the bequest could possibly be, let alone whether it was of any value.

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov gathered the blankets together and in one movement hurled them on to the floor to expose Anna curled up like a child, knees almost touching her exposed breasts. Anna's hand groped for a corner'of the sheet to cover her naked body.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Breakfast in bed?&quot; she murmured hopefully.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Dressed in ten minutes, or no breakfast at all,&quot; came back the reply. Anna lowered her feet gingerly on to the thick carpet and waited for the room to stop going round in circles before heading off towards the bathroom. Romanov heard the shower burst forth its jets. &quot;Ahhh,&quot; came the pitiful cry. Romanov smiled when he remembered that he had left the indicator locked on dark blue.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">During breakfast in the dining room they mulled over the approach he intended to take with the bank if Petrova were able to confirm that the icon was in fact Rublev's original masterpiece. He kept looking up from the table and then suddenly, without warning, said, &quot;Let's go.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why?&quot; Anna asked, as she bit into another slice of toast. Romanov rose from the table and without bothering to offer an explanation strode out of the room and headed straight for the lift. Petrova caught up with her master only moments before the lift gate closed. &quot;Why?&quot; she asked again, but Romanov did not speak until they were both back in his suite. He then threw open the large window that overlooked the railway station.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Ah, it's outside your room,&quot; he said, looking to his right, and quickly walked through to the adjoining bedroom. He marched past the dishevelled double bed,</FONT><BR>

Once Romanov had reached the bottom rung of the fire escape, he ran to a passing tram. Petrova would never have made it if she hadn't been lifted bodily on to the tram by Romanov's sheer strength.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What's going on?&quot; she asked, still puzzled.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I can't be sure,&quot; said Romanov, looking out of the back of the tram. &quot;All I do know for certain is what the local CIA agent looks like.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The researcher looked back in the direction of the hotel, but all she could see was a mass of anonymous people walking up and down the pavement.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov remained on the tram for about a mile before he jumped off and hailed a passing taxi going in the opposite direction.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Bischoff et Cie,&quot; he said as he waited for his puffing assistant to join him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The cab headed back in the direction of the hotel, winding in and out of the morning traffic, until it came to a halt in front of a large brown granite building that filled the entire block. Romanov paid off the driver and stood in front of imposing doors made of thick glass and covered in wrought iron welded to look like the branches of a tree. By the side of the doors, carved inconspicuously into the stone and inlaid with gilt, were the words 'Bischoff et Cie'. There was no other clue as to what kind of establishment lay within.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov turned the heavy wrought-iron knob and the two Russians stepped into a spacious hall. On the left-hand side of the hall stood a solitary desk behind which a smartly dressed young man was seated.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Guten Morgen, mein Hen&quot;, </I>he said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good morning,&quot; said Romanov. &quot;We have an appointment with Herr Dieter Bischoff.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, Heir Romanov,&quot; said the receptionist, checking the list of names in front of him. &quot;Will you please take the lift to the fifth floor where you will be met by Herr BischofFs secretary.&quot; When the two of them stepped out of the lift they were greeted by a lady in a neat plain suit. &quot;Will you please follow me,&quot; she said, without any trace of accent. The two Russians were escorted along a picture-lined corridor to a comfortable room which more resembled the reception room of a country house than a bank.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Herr Bischoff will be with you in a moment,&quot; the lady said, withdrawing. Romanov remained standing while he took in the room. Three black-and-white framed photographs of sombre old men in grey suits, trying to look like sombre old men in grey suits, took up most of the far wall, while on the other walls were discreet but pleasant oils of town and country scenes of nineteenth-century Switzerland. A magnificent oval Louis XIV table with eight carved mahogany chairs surrounding it dominated the centre of the room. Romanov felt a twinge of envy at the thought that he could never hope to live in such style.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The door opened and a man in his mid-sixties, followed by three other men in dark grey suits, entered the room. One look at Herr BischofF and Romanov knew whose photograph would eventually join that of the other three grey, sombre men.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What an honour for our little bank, Mr Romanov,&quot; were Bischoff's first words as he bowed and shook the Russian by the hand. Romanov nodded and introduced his assistant, who received the same courteous bow and handshake. &quot;May I in turn present my son and two of my partners, Herr Muller and Herr Weizkopf.&quot; The three men bowed in unison, but remained standing while Bischoff took his seat at the head of the table.</FONT><BR>
</P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">At his gesture both Romanov and Anna sat down beside him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I wonder if I might be permitted to check your passport?&quot; asked Bischoff, as if to show that the formal business had begun. Romanov took out the little blue passport with a soft cover from his inside pocket and handed it over. Bischoff studied it closely, as a philatelist might check an old stamp, and decided it was mint. &quot;Thank you,&quot; he said, as he returned it to its owner</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Bischoff then raised his hand and one of the partners immediately left them. &quot;It will only take a moment for my son to fetch the icon we have in safe-keeping,&quot; he confided. &quot;Meanwhile perhaps a little coffee - Russian,&quot; he added.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Coffee appeared within moments borne by yet another smartly dressed lady.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Petrova, clearly a little overawed, but Romanov didn't speak again until Herr Bischoff's son reappeared with a small box and handed it over to his father.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You will understand that I have to treat this matter with the utmost delicacy,&quot; the old man confided. &quot;The icon may not turn out to be the one your Government is searching for.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I understand,&quot; said Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;This magnificent example of Russian art has been in our possession since 1938, and was deposited with the bank on behalf of a Mr Emmanuel Rosenbaum.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Both visitors looked shocked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Nevozmozhno,&quot; </I>said Anna, turning to her master. &quot;He would never . . .&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I suspect that's exactly why the name was chosen in the first place,&quot; Romanov said curtly to Anna, annoyed at her indiscretion. &quot;Can't you see? It makes</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">perfect sense. May I see the icon now?&quot; said Romanov, turning back to the bank's Chairman.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Herr Bischoff placed the box in the centre of the table. The three men in grey suits each took a pace forward. Romanov looked up. &quot;Under Swiss law we must have three witnesses when opening a box in someone else's name,&quot; explained the old man.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov nodded curtly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Herr Bischoff proceeded to unlock the metal box with a key he produced from his pocket, while his son leaned over and undid a second lock with a different key. The Jittle ceremony completed, Herr Bischoff pushed up the lid of the box and turned it round to face his guests. Romanov placed his hands into the box like an expectant child does with a Christmas stocking, and drew out the icon. He stared at the beautiful painting. A small wooden rectangle that was covered in tiny pieces of red, gold and blue making up the mosaic of a man who looked as if he had all the worries of the world on his shoulders. The face, although sad, still evoked a feeling of serenity. The painting Romanov held in his hand was quite magnificent, as fine as any he had seen at the Winter Palace. No one in the room was quite sure what would happen next as Romanov offered no opinion.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">It was Anna who finally spoke.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A masterpiece it is,&quot; she said, &quot;and undoubtedly fifteenth century but as you can see it's not St George and the Dragon.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov nodded his agreement, still unable to let go of the little painting. &quot;But do you know the origin of this particular icon?&quot; Romanov asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes,&quot; Anna replied, glad to be appreciated for the first time. &quot;It is the Icon of St Peter, you see he holds the keys . . . painted by Dionisiy in 1471, and although</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">it is undoubtedly one of the finest examples of his work, it is not the Tsar's icon.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But does it belong to the Russian people?&quot; asked Romanov, still hopeful of some reward for all his trouble.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, Comrade Major,&quot; said the researcher emphatically. &quot;It belongs to the Munich Gallery, from where it has been missing since the day Hitler was appointed Reichschancellor.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Herr Bischoff scribbled a note on a piece of paper in front of him. At least one bank in Munich was going to be happy to do business with him in the future.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov reluctantly handed back the icon to Herr Bischoff, only just managing to say, &quot;Thank you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not at all,&quot; said Herr Bischoff imperturbably, replacing the icon in the box and turning his key in his lock. His son completed the same routine with his own key and then departed with the unclaimed treasure. Romanov rose, as he considered nothing more could be gained from the meeting - although he believed he had discovered Goering's alias, or one of them.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I wonder if I might be permitted to have a word with you in private, Herr Romanov,&quot; asked the elderly banker.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Of course.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It is rather a delicate matter I wish to put to you,&quot; said Herr Bischoff, &quot;so I thought you might prefer your associate to leave us.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That won't be necessary,&quot; said Romanov, unable to think of anything Bischoff might have to say that he wouldn't later need to discuss with Petrova.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;As you wish,&quot; said Bischoff. &quot;I am curious to discover if there was any other reason behind your request to see me.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">96</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I don't understand what you mean,&quot; said Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I felt perhaps I knew the real reason you had selected this bank in particular to start your enquiry.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I didn't select you,&quot; said Romanov. &quot;You were only one of-&quot; he stopped himself.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I see,&quot; said Bischoff, himself now looking somewhat bemused. &quot;Then may I be permitted to ask you a few questions?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, if you must,&quot; said Romanov, now impatient to get away.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You are Alexander Petrovich Romanov?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And grandson of Count Nicholai Alexandrovich Romanov?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Is this to be a history lesson on my family tree?&quot; asked Romanov, visibly irritated.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, I just wanted to be sure of my facts as I am even more convinced it would be wise for your associate to leave us for a moment,&quot; the old man suggested diffidently.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Certainly not,&quot; said Romanov. &quot;In the Soviet Union we are all equal,&quot; he added pompously.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; said Bischoff, glancing quickly at Anna before continuing. &quot;Did your father die in 1946?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes. He did,&quot; said Romanov, beginning to feel distinctly uncomfortable.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And you are the only surviving child?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I am,&quot; confirmed Romanov proudly.</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Petrova was now sitting on the edge of her seat, enjoying every moment of the unfolding drama. She had already anticipated exactly what was going to happen and was disappointed when Romanov turned to speak to her.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You will wait outside,&quot; was all he said. Petrova pouted and rose reluctantly to leave them, closing the door behind her.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Bischoff waited until he was certain the door was closed, then slid the file across the table. Romanov opened it gingerly. On the top of the first page was his grandfather's name underlined three times. Below the name were printed row upon row of incomprehensible figures.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I think you will find that we have carried out your grandfather's instructions in maintaining a conservative portfolio of investments with his funds.&quot; BischofT leaned across and pointed to a figure showing that the bank had achieved an average increase of 6-7 per cent per annum over the previous forty-nine years.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What does this figure at the foot of the page represent?&quot; asked Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The total value of your stocks, bonds and cash at nine o'clock this morning. It has been updated every Monday since your grandfather opened an account with this bank in 1916.&quot; The old man looked up proudly at the three pictures on the wall.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;May I presume from your comment that you are not displeased with our stewardship?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov was speechless.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It may also interest you to know that we are in possession of several boxes, the contents of which we have no knowledge. Your father also visited us on one occasion soon after the war. He appeared satisfied and assured me that he would return, but we never heard from him again. We were saddened to learn of his death. You might also prefer in the circumstances to return and investigate the boxes at another time,&quot; the banker continued.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Romanov quietly. &quot;Perhaps I could come back this afternoon?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The bank will always be at your service, Your Excellency,&quot; replied Herr Bischoff.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">No one had addressed a Romanov by his title since the Revolution. He sat in silence for some time.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Eventually he rose and shook hands with Herr Bischoff. &quot;I will return this afternoon,&quot; he repeated before joining his companion in the corridor.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Neither uttered a word until they were back on the street outside the bank.

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">It turned out to be a stark room dominated by a wooden table and several wooden chairs that didn't match. A small black crucifix was the only ornament on the blank whitewashed walls. Two of the unmatching chairs were now occupied by Adam and the pastor. Adam sat bolt upright while the man of God, clad from head to toe in a black cassock, elbows on the table and head in hands, stared down at the copy of the document.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then there is no way of knowing the value of this particular icon?&quot; asked Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I wouldn't venture an opinion, but no doubt the art auctioneers Sotheby's or Christie's might be willing to do so. After all, they claim in their advertisements that they have an expert in every field waiting to advise you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then I shall put their claim to the test,&quot; said Adam, &quot;and pay them a visit.&quot; He rose from his chair, shook hands with the pastor and said, &quot;You have been most kind.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not at all,&quot; said the pastor. &quot;I was only too pleased to assist you. It makes a change from Frau Gerber's marital problems and the size of the churchwarden's marrows.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam took a bus up to Hyde Park Corner and jumped off as it turned left into Knightsbridge. He walked through the subway and continued briskly down Piccadilly towards the Ritz. He had read somewhere that Sotheby's was in Bond Street, although he couldn't, remember having ever seen it.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He walked another hundred yards before turning left, where he shortened his stride to check all the signs on both sides of the road. He passed Gucci's, Gartier's, Asprey's and was beginning to wonder if his memory had failed him and whether he should check in the telephone directory. He continued on past the Irish Tourist Board and Celines before he finally spotted the gold lettering above a little newspaper kiosk on the far side of the road.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He crossed the one-way street and entered the front door by the side of the kiosk. He felt like a boy on his first day at a new school, unsure of his surroundings and not certain to whom he should turn for advice. Most of the people who passed him went straight up the stairs and he was just about to follow them when he heard a voice say, &quot;Up the stairs and straight through, madam. The auction is due to start in a few minutes.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam turned and saw a man in a long, green coat. The name 'Sotheby' was embroidered over his left-hand pocket.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where do I go if I want something valued?&quot; Adam asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Straight along the passage, sir, as far as you can go and you'll see a girl on the left-hand side in reception,&quot; barked his informant. Adam thanked him, presuming that the guide's former place of work could only have been on an Aldershot drill square . . . He walked along</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">to the reception area. An old lady was explaining to one of the girls behind the counter that her grandmother had left the vase to her several years before and she wondered what it might be worth.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The girl only glanced at the heirloom before asking, &quot;Can you come back in about fifteen minutes? By then our Mr Makepeace will have had time to look at it and will be able to give you an estimate.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you, my dear,&quot; said the old lady expectantly. The girl picked up the large ornate vase and carried it to a room in the back. She returned a few moments later to be faced with Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;May I help you, sir?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm not sure,&quot; began Adam. &quot;I need some advice concerning an icon.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Have you brought the piece with you, sir?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, it's still abroad at the moment.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Do you have any details?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Details?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Artist's name, date, size. Or better still do you have a photograph of the piece?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No,&quot; said Adam sheepishly. &quot;I only know its title but I do have some documentation,&quot; he added, handing over the receipt he had shown the pastor.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not a lot to go on,&quot; said the girl, studying the German transcript. &quot;But I'll ask Mr Sedgwick, the head of our Russian and Greek Icon department, if he can help you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Adam, as the girl picked up the phone.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Is Mr Sedgwick able to advise a customer?&quot; the girl enquired. She listened for a moment then replaced the phone.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Mr Sedgwick will be down in a few moments, if you would care to wait.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Adam, feeling something of a fraud. While the girl attended to the next customer Adam waited for Mr Sedgwick and studied the pictures on the wall. There were several photos of items that had come under the auctioneer's hammer in recent sales. A large painting by Picasso called 'Trois Baigneuses' had been sold for fourteen thousand pounds. As far as Adam could make out the brightly coloured oil was of three women on a beach dancing. He felt confident they were women because they had breasts even if they weren't in the middle of their chests. Next to the Picasso was a Degas of a girl at a ballet lesson; this time there was no doubt it was a girl. But the painting that most caught Adam's eye was a large oil by an artist he had never heard of called Jackson Pollock that had come under the hammer for eleven thousand pounds. Adam wondered what sort of people could afford to spend such sums on works of art.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Wonderful example of the artist's brushwork,&quot; said a voice behind him. Adam turned to face a tall, cadaverous figure with a ginger moustache and thinning red hair. His suit hung on him as if from a coathanger. &quot;My name is Sedgwick,&quot; he announced in a donnish voice.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Scott,&quot; said Adam, offering his hand.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, Mr Scott, why don't we sit over here and then you can let me know how I can help you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm not sure you can,&quot; admitted Adam, taking the seat opposite him. &quot;It's just that I have been left an icon in a will and I was hoping it might turn out to be valuable.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A good start,&quot; said Sedgwick, unfolding a pair of spectacles which he had removed from his top pocket.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It may not be,&quot; said Adam, &quot;because I know</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">nothing about paintings and I wouldn't want to waste your time.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You won't be wasting my time,&quot; Sedgwick assured Adam. &quot;We sell many items for less than ten pounds, you know.&quot; Adam hadn't known and Sedgwick's gentle voice made him feel less apprehensive. &quot;Now am I to understand you do not have a photograph of this particular icon?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's right,&quot; said Adam. &quot;The icon is still abroad, and to be honest I've never laid eyes on it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I see,&quot; said Sedgwick, folding up his glasses. &quot;But can you tell me anything of its provenance?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A little. It is known as 'The Tsar's Icon' and the subject is St George and the Dragon.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How strange,&quot; said Sedgwick. &quot;Someone else was enquiring after that particular painting only last week but he wouldn't leave his name.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Someone else wanted to know about the Tsar's icon?&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, a Russian gentleman, if I wasn't mistaken.&quot; Sedgwick tapped his glasses on his knee. &quot;I checked on it extensively for him but found little that wasn't already well documented. The man wondered if it had ever passed through our hands, or even if we had heard of it. I was able to explain to him that the great work by Rublev remains in the Winter Palace for all to see. One can always be certain that it's an original from the Winter Palace because the Tsar's silver crown will be embedded in the back of the frame. Since the fourteenth century many copies of Rublev's masterpiece have been made and they vary greatly in quality and value; but the one he seemed interested in was a copy made for Tsar Nicholas by a court painter circa 1914. I was unable to find any trace of such an icon in any of the standard works on the subject. Do you have</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">any documentation on your icon?&quot; Sedgwick enquired.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not a lot,&quot; said Adam. &quot;Although I do have a copy of the receipt that was left to me in the will,&quot; he added, and handed it over.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mr Sedgwick once again unfolded his glasses before studying the paper for several moments. &quot;Excellent, quite excellent,&quot; he said eventually. &quot;It seems to me that, as long as Roget et Cie will release it, a copy of the Tsar's icon painted by the court painter of the time, belongs to you. But you will have to go and pick it up yourself, that's for certain.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But is it worth all that trouble?&quot; asked Adam. &quot;Can you give me any idea of its value?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Hard to be precise without actually seeing it,&quot; Sedgwick said, returning the document.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So what is the lowest figure I might expect to get for it?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The older man frowned. &quot;Ten,&quot; he said, after considerable thought. &quot;Perhaps fifteen, but with an absolute top of twenty.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Twenty pounds,&quot; said Adam, unable to hide his disappointment. &quot;I'm sorry to have wasted your time, Mr Sedgwick.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, no, no, Mr Scott, you misunderstand me. I meant twenty <I>thousand </I>pounds.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A little more caviar, Comrade?&quot; enquired Petrova across the lunch table.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov frowned. His pretence at 'strictly confidential information' only to be passed on at the highest level had merely elicited a knowing smile from his companion who was also not inclined to believe that her boss had a pressing appointment at the Consulate that afternoon, an appointment that he had forgotten to mention to her before.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Anna held out a spoon brimming with caviar and pushed it towards Romanov as if she was trying to feed a reluctant baby.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you - no,&quot; said Romanov firmly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Suit yourself,&quot; said the young woman before it disappeared down her own throat. Romanov called for the bill. When he was presented with the slip of paper he couldn't help thinking that for that price he could have fed a Russian family for a month. He paid without comment.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'll see you back in the hotel later,&quot; he said curtly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Of course,&quot; said Petrova, still lingering over her coffee. &quot;What time shall I expect you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov frowned again. &quot;Not before seven,&quot; he replied.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And do you have any plans for me this afternoon, Comrade Major?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You may do as you please,&quot; said Romanov, and left the table without further word. Once on the street, he set off in the opposite direction to the bank, but he doubted if he had fooled the researcher, who was still eyeing him suspiciously through the restaurant window; or the agent, who had waited patiently on the far side of the road for nearly two hours.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">By three o'clock Romanov was once again seated in the private room on the fifth floor looked down on by the three photographs of the Herr Bischoffs, and with the fourth Herr Bischoff sitting opposite him and the fifth Herr Bischoff standing behind him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We are in possession of. . .&quot; began Herr Bischoff, in the same deliberate, formal way that had dictated the pace of the morning session, &quot;. . . five boxes which have remained unopened since your father visited us in 1945. Should it be your desire to inspect the contents ...&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why else would I have returned?&quot; asked Romanov, already made impatient by the measured voice and studied ritual.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Indeed,&quot; said Herr Bischoff, seemingly unaware of any discourtesy. &quot;Then all we now require is that you sign a disclaimer in order to legalise the situation under Swiss law.&quot; Romanov looked apprehensive. &quot;It is only a formality.&quot; The Russian still didn't speak. &quot;You can rest assured, Your Excellency, that you are not the only one of your countrymen who from time to time sits in that chair.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Herr Bischoff slid a sheet of paper across the table. There were over twenty clauses of German, all in small print. Romanov scrawled his signature between the two X's with the proffered gold pen. He</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Perhaps you will be kind enough to accompany me,&quot; said Herr Bischoff, quickly passing the sheet of paper to his son who left immediately. He rose and led Romanov silently back to the corridor. But on this occasion they travelled down in the chairman's private lift all the way to the basement.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When the doors opened Romanov might have thought they had entered a jail had the bars not been made of highly polished steel. A man who was seated behind a desk on the far side of the bars jumped up the moment he saw the chairman and turned the lock on the steel door with a long-shafted key. Romanov followed Herr Bischoff through the open door then waited until they were both locked inside. The guard preceded them down a corridor, not unlike that of a wine cellar with temperature and humidity gauges every few yards. The light was barely bright enough to ensure that they did not lose their footing. At the end of the corridor, they found Herr BischofFs son waiting in front of a vast circular steel door. The old man nodded and the younger Herr Bischoff placed a key in a lock and turned it. Then the chairman stepped forward and undid a second lock. Father and son pushed open the nine inch thick door but neither made any attempt to enter the vault.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You are in possession of five boxes. Numbers 1721, 1722, 1723, 1724.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And 1725, no doubt,&quot; interrupted Romanov.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">your envelope and the key inside it will open all five boxes.&quot; Romanov took the envelope and turned towards the open cavern. &quot;But we must open the bank's lock first before you proceed,&quot; said Herr Bis-choff. &quot;Will you be kind enough to follow us?&quot; Romanov nodded and both Herr Bischoffs proceeded into the vault. Romanov ducked his head and stepped in after them. Young Mr Bischoff opened the upper lock of the five boxes, three small ones above two large ones, making a perfect cube. &quot;Once we have left, Your Excellency,&quot; said the old man, &quot;we shall pull the door closed, and when you require it to be opened you have only to press the red button on the side wall to alert us. But I must warn you that at six o'clock the vault locks itself automatically and it cannot be reopened until nine the following morning. However, a warning alarm will sound at five forty-five.&quot; Romanov checked the clock on the wall: three seventeen. He couldn't believe he would need over two hours to find out what was in the five boxes. The two Herr Bischoffs bowed and left.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov waited impatiently for the vast door to close behind him. Once alone in the Aladdin's cave he looked around the room and estimated there must have been two or three thousand boxes filling the four walls, giving them the appearance of a library of safes, He suspected there was more private wealth in that one vault than most countries on earth could call on. He checked the numbers of his own boxes and stood waiting like an orphan who has been told there will be second helpings.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He decided to start with one of the small boxes. He turned the key and heard the lock click before pulling out the stiff drawer to discover it was full of papers. He flicked through them to find they were title deeds</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">to many large tracts of land in Bohemia and Bulgaria - once worth millions, now controlled by the Socialist State. As he checked each document, the old saying 'not worth the paper they were written on' sprang to mind. Romanov moved to the second box which he discovered contained the bond certificates of companies once managed by His Excellency Count Nicholai Alexandrovich Romanov. The last time they had declared a profit was in 1914. He cursed the system he had been born under as he moved on to the third box which contained only one document, his grandfather's will. It took only moments to discover that it had all been left to his father and therefore he was the lawful owner of everything - and nothing.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Dismayed, Romanov knelt down to study the two larger boxes, both of which looked big enough to hold a cello. He hesitated before placing his key in the lock of the first, turning it and pulling out the vast container.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He stared down in anticipation.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">It was empty. He could only presume that it had been that way for over fifty years unless his father had removed everything and there was no reason to believe that. He quickly unlocked the fifth box and in desperation pulled it open.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The box was split into twelve equal compartments. He raised the lid of the first compartment and stared down in disbelief. Before him lay precious stones of such size, variety and colour that would have made anyone who was not royal gasp. Gingerly he lifted the lid off the second compartment, to find it contained pearls of such quality that one single string of them would have transformed a plain girl into a society beauty. As he opened the third box his amazement did not lessen and he understood for the first time why his grandfather had been considered one of the most</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">enterprising merchants of the century. And now it all belonged to Alex Romanov, an impecunious Government official who was already wondering how he could possibly enjoy such riches.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">It took Romanov a further hour to go through the contents of the remaining nine compartments. When he reached the last one - almost an anti-climax, in that it contained nothing but gold coins - he felt thoroughly exhausted. He checked the clock on the wall: five thirty. He began to replace the lids on each of the compartments, but during the treasure hunt he had come across one object of such magnificence that he could not resist removing it. He paused as he held up the long heavy gold chain weighted by a medallion, also made of solid gold, that hung from it. On one side was an engraved picture of his grandfather - Count Nicholai Alexandrovich Romanov, a proud, handsome man - while on the other was a profile of his grandmother, so beautiful that she surely could have worn any of the jewellery in that treasure trove with distinction.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">For some time, Romanov held the chain in his hand before finally placing it over his head and letting the medallion fall from his neck. He gave the piece one last look before tucking it under his shirt. When he had replaced the lid on the last compartment he slid the box back into place and locked it.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">For the second time that day Romanov's thoughts returned to his father and the decision he must have made when faced with such a fortune. He had gone back to Russia with his secret. Had he planned to rescue Alex from the life of drudgery that was all he could look forward to? His father had always assured him that he had an exciting future but there were secrets he was too young to share and he, in turn, had</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">passed that information on to the authorities. His reward a place at the Komsomol. But his father must have taken that secret to the grave because Alex would never have learned of the fortune if it had not been for Poskonov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">His mind turned to the old banker. Had he known all along or was it just a coincidence that he had been sent by Poskonov to this bank first? Members of his chosen profession didn't survive if they believed in coincidence.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A false move and the State would not hesitate to send him to the same grave as his father and grandfather. He would have to be at his most skilful when he next came into contact with the old banker, otherwise he might not live to choose between power in his homeland or wealth in the West.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;After I have found the Tsar's icon I will make my decision,&quot; he said, quite audibly. He turned suddenly as the alarm bell's piercing sound rang out. He checked the clock and was surprised by how much time he had spent in the locked room. He walked towards the vault door and on reaching it pressed the red button without looking back. The great door swung open to reveal two anxious-looking Herr Bischoffs. The son stepped quickly into the vault, walked over to the five boxes and made safe the bank's locks.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We were beginning to get quite worried about the time,&quot; said the old man. &quot;I do hope you found everything to your satisfaction.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Entirely,&quot; said Romanov. &quot;But what happens if I am unable to return for some considerable time?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's of no importance,&quot; Herr Bischoff replied. &quot;The boxes will not be touched again until you come back, and as they are all hermetically sealed your possessions will remain in perfect condition.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Ten degrees Celsius,&quot; said Herr Bischoff, somewhat puzzled by the question.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Are they airtight?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Certainly,&quot; replied the banker. &quot;And watertight, not that the basement has ever been flooded,&quot; he added quite seriously.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So anything left in them is totally safe from any investigation?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You are only the third person to look inside those boxes in fifty years,&quot; came back the firm response.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Excellent,&quot; said Romanov, looking down at Herr Bischoff. &quot;Because there is just a possibility that I shall want to return tomorrow morning, with a package of my own to deposit.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Can you put me through to Mr Pemberton, please?&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">There was a long pause. &quot;We don't have a Mr Pemberton working here, sir.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That is Barclays International in the City, isn't it?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Mr Lawrence Pemberton. I feel certain I've got the right branch.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The silence was even longer this time. &quot;Ah, yes,&quot; came back the eventual reply. &quot;Now I see which department he works in. I'll find out if he's in.&quot; Adam heard the phone ringing in the background.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He doesn't seem to be at his desk at the moment, sir, would you like to leave a message?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No thank you,&quot; said Adam, and replaced the receiver. He sat alone thinking, not bothering to switch on the light as it grew darker. If he was to carry through</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A key turned in the door and Adam watched Lawrence enter and switch the light on. He looked startled when he saw Adam seated in front of him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How does one open a Swiss bank account?&quot; were Adam's first words.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I can't imagine one would find it that easy if all you have to offer is next week's unemployment cheque,&quot; said Lawrence. &quot;Mind you, they usually keep a code name for English customers,&quot; he added, as he put his copy of the <I>Evening News </I>on the table. &quot;Yours could be 'pauper'.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It may surprise you to learn that it was a serious question,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well,&quot; said Lawrence, taking the question seriously, &quot;in truth, anyone can open a Swiss bank account as long as they have a worthwhile sum to deposit. And by worthwhile I mean at least ten thousand pounds.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, but how would you go about getting the money out?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That can be done over the phone or in person, and in that way Swiss banks don't differ greatly from any bank in England. Few customers, however, would risk the phone, unless they're resident in a country where there are no tax laws to break. In which case why would they need the gnomes of Zurich in the first place?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What happens when a customer dies and the bank can't be sure who the rightful owner of the assets is?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They would do nothing but a claimant would have to prove that they were the person entitled to inherit any deposits the bank held. That's not a problem if you're in possession of the correct documentation such</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">as a will and proof of identity. We deal with such matters every day.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But you just admitted that it's illegal!&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not for those clients resident overseas, or when it becomes necessary to balance our gold deposits, not to mention the bank's books. But the Bank of England keeps a strict watch over every penny that goes in and out of the country.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So, if I were entitled to a million pounds' worth of gold left to me by an Argentinian uncle deposited in a Swiss bank, and I was in possession of the right legal documents to prove I was the beneficiary, all I would have to do is go and claim it?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nothing to stop you,&quot; said Lawrence. &quot;Although under the law as it currently stands, you would have to bring it back to this country, and sell the gold to the Bank of England for the sum they deemed correct, and then pay death duty on that sum.&quot; Adam remained silent. &quot;If you do have an Argentinian uncle who has left you all that gold in Switzerland, your best bet would be to leave it where it is. Under this Government, if you fulfilled the letter of the law, you would end up with about seven and a half per cent of its true value.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Pity I haven't got an Argentinian uncle,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He doesn't have to be Argentinian,&quot; said Lawrence, watching his friend's every reaction closely.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thanks for the information,&quot; said Adam and disappeared into the bedroom.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The last pieces of the jigsaw were beginning to fit into place. He was in possession of Roget's receipt of the icon originally meant for his father; all he needed now was a copy of the will to show that the document</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">had been left to him. He could then prove that he was the owner of a worthless or priceless - he still had no way of being sure which - copy of the Tsar's icon. He lay awake that night recalling the words in his father's letter. &quot;If there is anything to be gained from the contents of this envelope I make only one request of you, namely that your mother should be the first to benefit from it without ever being told how such good fortune came about.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When Romanov returned to the hotel, via the Russian Consulate, he found Petrova in her room dressed in jeans and a bright pink jersey, sitting in a corner reading, her legs dangling over the side of the chair.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I hope you had a fruitful afternoon?&quot; he enquired, politely.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I certainly did,&quot; Anna replied. &quot;The galleries in Zurich are well worthy of a visit. But tell me about <I>your </I>afternoon. Did it also turn out to be fruitful?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It was a revelation, my little one, nothing less. Why don't we have a quiet supper in my room so I can tell you all about it while we celebrate in style?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What a magnificent idea,&quot; said the researcher. &quot;And may I be responsible for ordering dinner?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Petrova dropped her book on the floor and began to concentrate on the extensive <I>a la carte </I>menu that had been left by Romanov's bedside table. She spent a considerable time selecting each dish for their banquet and even Romanov was impressed when it finally appeared.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Anna had chosen as an entree gravad lax edged with dill sauce. Accompanying it was a half-bottle of Premier Cru Chablis 1958. Between mouthfuls Romanov told her of the contents of his family</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">inheritance and as he described each new treasure the researcher's eyes grew larger and larger.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov's monologue was only once interrupted, by a waiter who wheeled in a trolley on which sat a silver salver. The waiter lifted the salver to reveal a rack of lamb surrounded by courgettes and tiny new potatoes. To accompany this particular dish, the hotel had provided a Gevrey Chambertin.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The final course, a fluffy raspberry souffle, required in the researcher's view only the finest Chateau Yquem. She had selected the 'forty-nine, which only made her lapse into singing Russian folk songs which Romanov felt, given the circumstances, was somewhat inappropriate.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As she drained the last drop of wine in her glass Petrova rose and, slightly unsteady, said, &quot;To Alex, the man I love.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov nodded his acknowledgment and suggested it might be time for them to go to bed, as they had to catch the first flight back to Moscow the following morning. He wheeled the trolley out into the corridor and placed -a 'Do not disturb' sign over the door knob.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A memorable evening,&quot; smiled the researcher, as she flicked off her shoes. Romanov stopped to admire her as she began to remove her clothes, but when he unbuttoned his shirt, the researcher stopped undressing and let out a gasp of surprise.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's magnificent,&quot; she said in awe. Romanov held up the gold medallion. &quot;A bauble compared with the treasures I left behind,&quot; he assured her.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Comrade lover,&quot; Anna said in a childlike voice, pulling him towards the bed, &quot;you realise how much I adore, admire and respect you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Um,&quot; said Romanov.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And you also know,&quot; she continued, &quot;that I have never asked you for any favour in the past.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But I have a feeling you are about to now,&quot; said Romanov as she lifted back the sheet.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Only that if the gold chain is nothing more than a mere bauble, perhaps you might allow me to wear it occasionally?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Occasionally?&quot; said Romanov, staring into Anna's eyes. &quot;Why occasionally? Why not permanently, my darling?&quot; and without another word he removed the gold chain from around his neck and placed it over the young girl's head. Anna sighed as she fingered the thick gold rings that made up the chain that Romanov didn't let go of.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You're hurting me, Alex,&quot; she said with a little laugh. &quot;Please let go.&quot; But Romanov only pulled the chain a little tighter. Tears began to run down her cheeks as the metal began to bite into her skin.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I can't breathe properly,&quot; gasped the researcher. &quot;Please stop teasing.&quot; But Romanov only continued to tighten the chain around her throat until Anna's face began to turn red as it filled with blood.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You wouldn't tell anyone about my windfall, would you, my little one?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, never, Alex. No one. You can rely on me,&quot; she choked out desperately.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Can I feel absolutely certain?&quot; he asked with an edge of menace now in his voice.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, yes of course, but please stop now,&quot; she piped, her delicate hands clutching desperately at her master's blond hair, but Romanov only continued to squeeze and squeeze the heavy gold chain around her neck like a rack and pinion, tighter and tighter. Romanov was not aware of the girl's hands clinging desperately to his hair, as he twisted the chain a</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">On his morning run along the Embankment, Adam mulled over the tasks that still needed to be carried out next.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">If he took the morning flight out of Heathrow on Wednesday, he could be back in London by the same evening, or Thursday at the latest. But there were still several things that had to be organised before he could leave for Geneva.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He came to a halt on the pavement outside his block and checked his pulse, before climbing the stairs to the flat.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Three letters for you,&quot; said Lawrence. &quot;None for me. Mind you,&quot; he added as his flatmate joined him in the kitchen, &quot;two of them are in buff envelopes.&quot; Adam picked up the letters and left them on the end of his bed en route to the shower. He survived five minutes of ice-cold water before towelling down. Once he was dressed he opened the letters. He began with the white one, which turned out to be a note from Heidi thanking him for dinner, and hoping she would be seeing him again some time. He smiled and tore open the first of the buff envelopes, which was yet another missive from the Foreign Office Co-ordination Staff.</FONT><BR>

When Adam checked through the account it showed that at one point he had, for the first time in his life, run up an overdraft - a situation that he knew would have been frowned upon had he still been in the army, for as little as twenty years before it was in some regiments a court-martial offence for an officer to be overdrawn.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">What would his brother officers have said if he told them he was about to remove two hundred pounds from the account with no real guarantee of a return?</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Once Adam had finished dressing, he rejoined Lawrence in the kitchen.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How was the Shah of Iran?&quot; he asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh, very reasonable really,&quot; said Lawrence, turning a page of the <I>Daily Telegraph, </I>&quot;considering the circumstances. Promised he would do what he could about his current financial embarrassment, but he was a bit pushed until the West allowed him to raise the price of oil.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where did you eventually take him to lunch?&quot; asked Adam enjoying the game.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I offered him a shepherd's pie at the Green Man, but the bloody fellow became quite snotty. It seems he and the Empress had to pop along to Harrods to be measured up for a new throne. Would have gone along with him, of course, but my boss wanted his wastepaper basket emptied, so I missed out on the Harrods deal as well.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So what are you up to today?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I shouldn't let you in on this,&quot; said Lawrence,</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And what are your views?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I've already explained to the fellow that the only 2401 know is the bus that runs between Golders Green and Edgware, and if I don't get a move on I'll miss my beloved 14,&quot; said Lawrence, checking his watch. Adam laughed as he watched his friend slam his briefcase shut and disappear out of the door.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Lawrence had changed considerably over the years since he had left Wellington. Perhaps it was that Adam could only remember him as school captain and then leaving with the top classics scholarship to Balliol. He had seemed so serious in those days and certainly destined for greater things. No one would have thought it possible that he would end up as an investment analyst at Barclays DCO. At Oxford contemporaries half joked about him being a cabinet minister. Was it possible that one always expected too much of those idols who were only a couple of years older than oneself? On leaving school their friendship had grown. And when Adam was posted to Malaya, Lawrence never accepted the army report that posted his friend as missing presumed dead. And when Adam announced that he was leaving the army, Lawrence asked for no explanation and couldn't have been kinder about his unemployment problem. Adam hoped that he would be given the chance to repay such friendship.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam fried himself an egg and a couple of rashers of bacon. There wasn't much more he could do before nine thirty, although he did find time to scribble a note to his sister, enclosing a cheque for fifty pounds.</FONT><BR>

And Holbrooke sounded even more surprised by his request. &quot;No doubt connected in some way with that envelope,&quot; he muttered, but agreed to put a copy of his father's will in the post that afternoon.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam's other requirements could not be carried out over the phone, so he locked up the flat and jumped on a bus heading up the King's Road. He left the double-decker at Hyde Park Corner and made his way to Lloyds Bank in Pall Mall, where he joined a queue at the Foreign Exchange counter.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;May I help you?&quot; asked a polite assistant when he finally reached the front.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The girl entered some calculations on a large desktop machine before cranking the handle round several times. She looked at the result, then disappeared for a few moments to return with a copy of the bank statement Adam had received in the morning post.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The total cost, including our charges, will be &pound;202.1s.8d. That would leave your account in credit with &pound;70.16s.4d.,&quot; she informed him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Adam, but didn't add that in truth it would only be &pound;20.16s.4d. the moment his sister presented her cheque.

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That will be thirty-one pounds please, sir.&quot; Adam paid in cash and placed the ticket in his inside pocket, before returning to the flat for a light lunch. During the afternoon he called Heidi who agreed to join him for dinner at the Chelsea Kitchen at eight o'clock. There was one more thing Adam needed to be certain about before he joined Heidi for dinner.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov was woken by the ringing of the phone.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes,&quot; he said.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good morning, Comrade Romanov, it's Melinski, the Second Secretary at the Embassy.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's about Comrade Petrova,&quot; Romanov smiled at the thought of her now lying in the bath. &quot;Have you come across the girl since you reported her missing?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No,&quot; replied Romanov. &quot;And she didn't sleep in her bed last night.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I see,&quot; said the Second Secretary. &quot;Then your suspicions that she might have defected are beginning to look a serious possibility.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I fear so,&quot; said Romanov, &quot;and I shall have to make a full report of the situation to my superiors the moment I get back to Moscow.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, of course, Comrade Major.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I shall also point out that you have done everything possible to assist me with this problem, Comrade Second Secretary.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you, Comrade Major.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And brief me the moment you come up with any information that might lead us to where she is.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Of course, Comrade Major.&quot; Romanov replaced the phone and walked across to the bathroom in the adjoining room. He stared down at the body hunched up in the bath. Anna's eyes were bulging in their sockets, her face contorted and the skin already grey. After throwing a towel over the dead researcher's head and locking the door, he went into his own bathroom for an unusually long shower.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He returned and sat on his side of the bed, only a towel around his waist, and picked up the phone. He ordered breakfast which arrived fifteen minutes later, by which time he had dressed. Once he had finished orange juice and croissants he returned to the phone trying to recall the name of the hotel's manager. It came back to him just as the receptionist said, <I>&quot;Guten Morgen, mein Hen.&quot;</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Jacques, please,&quot; was all Romanov said. A moment later he heard the manager's voice, &quot;Good morning, Herr Romanov.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I have a delicate problem that I was hoping you might be able to help me with.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I shall certainly try, sir,&quot; came back the reply.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I am in possession of a rather valuable object that I wish to deposit with my bank and I wouldn't want. . .&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I understand your dilemma entirely,&quot; said the manager. &quot;And how can I be of assistance?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I require a large container in which to place the object.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Would a laundry basket be large enough?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Ideal, but does it have a secure lid?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; replied Jacques. &quot;We often have to drop them off down lift shafts.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Perfect,&quot; said Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then it will be with you in a matter of moments,&quot; said Jacques. &quot;I shall send a porter to assist you. May I also suggest that it is taken down in the freight elevator at the rear of the hotel, thus ensuring that no one will see you leaving?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Very considerate,&quot; said Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Will a car be calling to collect you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No,&quot; said Romanov. &quot;I -&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then I shall arrange for a taxi to be waiting. When will you require it?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;In no more than half an hour.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You will find it parked outside the freight entrance in twenty minutes' time.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You have been most helpful,&quot; said Romanov, before adding, &quot;the Chairman of the State Bank did not exaggerate his praise of you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You are too kind, Heir Romanov,&quot; said Jacques. &quot;Will there be anything else?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Perhaps you would be good enough to have my account prepared so that there will be no delay.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Certainly.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov put the phone down wishing he could export such service to Moscow. He only waited a moment before he dialled the first of two local numbers. On both occasions his wishes were immediately granted. As he replaced the phone for the third time there was a gentle tap on the door. Romanov went quickly over to answer it. A young porter stood in the corridor, a large laundry basket by his side. He smiled politely. Romanov merely nodded and pulled in the</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">basket. &quot;Please return as soon as the taxi has arrived,&quot; said Romanov. The porter bowed slightly, but said nothing.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As soon as the porter had left, Romanov locked the door and put the chain in place before wheeling the laundry basket into the main bedroom and leaving it by the side of the bed. He undid the tough leather straps and threw open the lid.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Next, he unlocked the bathroom door and lifted Petrova's stiff body in his arms before trying to cram it into the basket. Rigor mortis had already gripped the body; the legs refused to bend and the researcher didn't quite fit in. Romanov placed the naked Petrova on the floor. He held his fingers out straight and suddenly brought them down with such force on the right leg that it broke like a branch in a storm. He repeated the action on her left leg. Like the guillotine, it didn't require a second attempt. He then tucked the legs under her body. It amused Romanov to consider that, had it been he who had been murdered, Anna Petrova would never have been able to get him in the basket whatever she had tried to break. Romanov then wheeled the trolley into the researcher's bedroom and, after emptying all her drawers, including Anna's clothes, clean and dirty, her shoes, her toilet bag, toothbrush and even an old photograph of himself he hadn't realised she possessed he threw them in the basket on top of her. Once he had removed the gold medallion from around her neck and was certain that there was nothing of the researcher's personal belongings left, he covered up the body with a hotel bath towel, and sprayed it with a liberal amount of Chanel No. 5 that had been left courtesy of the hotel.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">wheeled the creaking basket out and left it by the outer door.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov began to pack his own case but there was a knock on the door before he had finished.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Wait,&quot; he said firmly. There was a muffled reply of <I>&quot;Ja, mein Hen.&quot; </I>A few moments later Romanov opened the door. The porter entered, nodded to him and began to tug at the laundry basket, but it took a firm shove from Romanov's foot before it got moving. The porter sweated his way down the corridor as Romanov walked by the side of the basket, carrying his suitcase. When they reached the rear of the hotel Romanov watched as the basket was wheeled safely into the freight elevator before he stepped in himself.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When the ground floor doors opened Romanov was relieved to be greeted by Jacques who was standing by a large Mercedes waiting for him with the boot already open. The taxi driver and the porter lifted up the laundry basket and wedged it into the boot, but Romanov's suitcase could not be fitted in as well so it had to be put in the front of the car alongside the driver's seat.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Shall we forward your bill to the Consulate, <I>mein Herr?&quot; </I>asked Jacques.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, that would be helpful . . .&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I do hope everything has worked out to your satisfaction,&quot; said Jacques, as he held open the back door of the Mercedes for his departing guest.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Entirely,&quot; said Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good, good. And will your young colleague be joining you?&quot; asked the manager, looking back over his shoulder towards the hotel.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, she won't,&quot; said Romanov. &quot;She has already gone on to the airport ahead of me.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Of course,&quot; said Jacques, &quot;but I am sorry to have missed her. Do please pass on my best wishes.&quot; •*</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I certainly will,&quot; said Romanov, &quot;and I look forward to returning to your hotel in the near future.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you sir,&quot; the manager said as Romanov slipped into the back seat leaving Jacques to close the door behind him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When Romanov arrived at the Swissair office his suitcase was checked in and he waited only moments -before continuing on to the bank. Herr BischofFs son, accompanied by another man, also clad in a grey suit, was waiting in the hall to greet him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How pleasant to see you again so soon,&quot; volunteered the young Herr Bischoff. His deep voice took Romanov by surprise. The taxi driver waited by the open boot while Herr BischofFs companion, a man of at least six foot four and heavily built, lifted out the laundry basket as if it were a sponge cake. Romanov paid the fare and followed Herr Bischoff into the far lift.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We are fully prepared for your deposition following your phone call,&quot; said Herr Bischoff. &quot;My father was only sorry not to be present personally. He had a long-standing engagement with another customer and only hopes that you will understand.&quot; Romanov waved his hand.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The lift travelled straight to the ground floor where the guard, on seeing young Herr Bischoff, unlocked the great steel cage. Romanov and the two bankers proceeded at a leisurely pace down the corridor, while the giant carried the basket in their wake.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Standing with folded arms by the vault door was another of the partners Romanov recognised from the previous day. Herr Bischoff nodded and the partner placed his key in the top lock of the vault door without</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">a word. Herr Bischoffthen turned the second lock and together they pushed open the massive steel door. Herr Bischoff and his partner walked in ahead of Romanov and opened the top lock of all five of his boxes, while the guard placed the laundry basket on the floor beside them.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Will you require any assistance?&quot; asked Herr Bischoff as he handed his Russian client a personal sealed envelope.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No thank you,&quot; Romanov assured him, but did not relax until he had seen the vast door close behind him and all four of his Swiss helpers left invisibly on the other side.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Once he felt certain he was alone, he stared down at the one large box he knew to be empty: it was smaller than he had recalled. Beads of sweat appeared on his forehead as he unlocked it, pulled it out and raised the airtight lid. It was going to be a tight fit. Romanov unstrapped the laundry basket and removed everything except the body. He stared down at the contorted face, the deep marks in the skin around the neck had turned to a dark blue. He bent over and lifted the researcher up by her waist, but as no part of the body moved other than her broken legs he had to drop her into the box head first. Even then he had to adjust her various limbs in order that the box could be shut: had Anna been even an inch taller the exercise would have proved pointless. He then stuffed the girl's belongings down at the sides of her body, leaving only the Chanel-covered towel behind in the laundry basket.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov proceeded to replace the lid on the airtight box, before pushing it back securely in place and locking it. He then double-checked it could not be opened without his own personal key. He was relieved to find he could not budge it. He hesitated for a moment</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">glancing at the second large box, but accepted that this was not the time to indulge himself: that would have to wait for another occasion. Satisfied that everything was back in place, he closed and strapped down the lid of the laundry basket and wheeled it back to the entrance of the vault. He pressed the little red button.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I do hope you found everything in order,&quot; said the young Herr BischofFonce he had returned from locking the five boxes.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, thank you,&quot; said Romanov. &quot;But would it be possible for someone to return the laundry basket to the St Gothard Hotel?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Of course,&quot; said the banker, who nodded towards the large man.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And I can be assured that the boxes will not be touched in my absence?&quot; he asked as they walked down the corridor.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Naturally, Your Excellency,&quot; said Herr BischofF, looking somewhat aggrieved at such a suggestion. &quot;When you return,&quot; he continued, &quot;you will find everything exactly as you left it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Well, not exactly, Romanov thought to himself.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When they stepped out of the lift on the ground floor, Romanov spotted Herr BischofFs father with another customer.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A Rolls-Royce accompanied by a police motorcycle whisked the Shah of Iran quickly away, and the chairman discreetly waved his farewell.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When they reached the entrance to the bank, the young Herr BischofF bowed. &quot;We shall look forward to seeing you again when you are next in Zurich, Your Excellency,&quot; he said.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not much hope of that,&quot; muttered Adam as he bounced into the centre of the ring.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The lean, muscle-bound instructor stood waiting for him. &quot;Let's have a few rounds and see how you make out, sir.&quot; Adam bobbed and weaved around the Physical Training Instructor looking for an opening.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam led with a left and received a tap on the nose for his trouble. &quot;Keep your guard up,&quot; said the sergeant major. Adam led again, catching the instructor a full blow on the chest, but was punished with a sharp left jab into the side of his head. He wobbled and his ear tingled but this time he managed to keep his guard up when a right and left followed. &quot;You're feeble, sir, that's your problem. You couldn't knock the skin off a rice pudding.&quot; Adam feinted with his right and then swung a left with such force that when it caught the sergeant major full on the chin he staggered and fell.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The corporal standing by the side of the ring smirked as the instructor remained on the floor. Eventually he managed to get back on his feet.</FONT><BR>

A technical knockout, to be accurate, so I'll have to wait for a day or two to seek my revenge.&quot; Adam breathed a sigh of relief and lowered his guard. &quot;But that doesn't mean you're off the hook. It's weight training for you now, sir. Beam work and floor exercises.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">For the next hour the sergeant major chased, kicked, harried and badgered Adam until he finally collapsed in a heap on the floor, incapable of lifting an evening paper.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not bad, sir. I feel sure the Foreign Office will be able to find some niche for you. Mind you,&quot; he added, &quot;as most of that lot are about as wet as a dishcloth evenj'oa'll have a chance to shine.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You are most flattering, Sergeant Major,&quot; said Adam from a supine position.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Up, sir,&quot; the instructor bellowed. Adam unwillingly got to his feet as quickly as his tired body would allow.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Don't tell me, Sergeant Major.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's the recovery that proves fitness, not the speed,&quot; they said in unison.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sad day when you left the army,&quot; said the instructor to Adam once they were back in the Queen's Club changing room. &quot;Can't name a lot of officers who have put me on the floor.&quot; The instructor touched his chin tenderly. &quot;That will teach me to underestimate a man who survived nine months of Chink food. So let's hope the Foreign Office doesn't underestimate you as well.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The Chairman of the KGB studied the report on the desk in front of him: something didn't ring true. He looked up at Romanov. &quot;Your reason for visiting Bis-choff et Cie was because they claimed to be in possession of a fifteenth-century icon that might have fitted the description of the one we are searching for?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That is correct, Comrade, and the chairman of Gosbank will confirm that he personally arranged the meeting.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But the icon turned out to be of St Peter and not of St George and the Dragon.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Also confirmed by Comrade Petrova in her report.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Ah, yes, Comrade Petrova,&quot; said Zaborski, his eyes returning to the sheet of paper in front of him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, Comrade.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And later that evening Comrade Petrova mysteriously failed to keep an appointment with you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Inexplicably,&quot; said Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But which you reported to Comrade Melinski at the Embassy.&quot; He paused. &quot;You were responsible for selecting Petrova yourself, were you not?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That is correct, Comrade Chairman.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Does that not reveal a certain lack of judgment on your part?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov made no attempt to reply.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The Chairman's eyes returned to the file. &quot;When</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">you awoke the next morning, there was still no sign of the girl?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;She also failed to turn up to breakfast as arranged,&quot; said Romanov, &quot;and when I went to her room all her personal belongings had gone.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Which convinced you she had defected.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But the Swiss police,&quot; said Zaborski, &quot;can find no trace of her. So I keep asking myself why would she want to defect? Her husband and her immediate family live in Moscow. They are all employed by the State, and it is not as if this was her first visit to the West.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov didn't offer an opinion.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Perhaps Petrova disappeared because she might have been able to tell us something you didn't want us to hear.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Still Romanov said nothing.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The Chairman's gaze once again returned to the file. &quot;I wonder what it was that young Petrova wanted to tell us? Who else you were sleeping with that night, perhaps?&quot; Romanov felt a shiver of fear as he wondered how much Zaborski really knew. Zaborski paused and pretended to be checking something else in the report. &quot;Perhaps she could tell us why you felt it necessary to return to Bischoffet Cie a second time.&quot; Once again, Zaborski paused. &quot;I think I may have to open an enquiry into the disappearance of Comrade Petrova. Because, Comrade Romanov, by the time you returned to the bank a third time,&quot; said the Chairman, his voice rising with each word, &quot;every second-rate spy from here to Istanbul knew that we were searching for something.&quot; The Chairman paused. Romanov was still desperate to find out if Zaborski had any real evidence. Neither man spoke for some time. &quot;You have always been a loner, Major Romanov, and I do not deny that</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I am a file man, a paper man. I make reports in triplicate, I answer queries in quadruplicate, explain decisions in quintuplicate.

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov remained silent, something the KGB had taken several years to instil into him. He began to feel confident that Zaborski was only guessing. If he had suspected the truth the interview would have taken place in the basement where a less intellectual approach to questioning was carried out.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;In the USSR,&quot; continued Zaborski, now rising from his chair, &quot;despite our image in the Western world, we investigate a suspicious death,&quot; he paused, &quot;or defection more scrupulously than any other nation on earth. You, Comrade Romanov, would have found your chosen profession easier to follow had you been born in Africa, South America or even Los Angeles.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Still Romanov did not venture an opinion.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The General Secretary informed me at one o'clock this morning that he is not impressed by your latest efforts, distinctly unimpressed were the exact words he used, especially after your excellent start. All he is interested in, however, is finding the Tsar's icon, and so, for the time being, Comrade, he has decided there will be no investigation. But if you ever act in such an irresponsible way again it will not be an enquiry you are facing, but a tribunal, and we all know what happened to the last Romanov that faced a tribunal.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Very clear, Comrade Chairman,&quot; said Romanov, and turning smartly on his heel quickly left the room.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The Chairman of the KGB waited for the door to close before his eyes settled back on the file. What was Romanov up to, Zaborski needed to know, suddenly realising that his own career might now be on the line. He flicked down a switch on the little console by his side. &quot;Find Major Valchek,&quot; he ordered.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I've never actually had champagne and caviar,&quot; admitted Adam, as he looked up at the beautiful girl who sat opposite him across the table. He loved the way she tied her hair, and the way she dressed, the way she laughed, but most of all the way she smiled.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, don't get frightened, because I can't imagine caviar will ever find its place on this particular menu,&quot; teased Heidi. &quot;But perhaps soon when you are the proud owner of the Tsar's icon, that is if Mr Rosenbau ...&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam put a finger to his lips. &quot;No one else knows about that, not even Lawrence.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That may be wise,&quot; Heidi whispered. &quot;He will only expect you to invest all the money you make from the sale in his boring bank.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What makes you think I'd sell it?&quot; asked Adam, trying to discover how much she had worked out.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, please. Two cappuccinos,&quot; said Adam. He turned his gaze back to Heidi. &quot;Funnily enough,&quot; he continued as the waiter retreated, &quot;the only time I've ever rung Lawrence at the bank the telephonist couldn't immediately locate him.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What's so surprising about that?&quot; asked Heidi.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It was as if they had never heard of him,&quot; said Adam, &quot;but perhaps I was imagining it.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That might turn out to be more significant than sharing your sausages.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I would hope so and in any case, you could be most useful.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You really mean it, don't you?&quot; said Heidi, sounding serious for the first time. &quot;But women are not impulsive creatures.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, but if the icon turns out to be worthless you will let me refund the price of my ticket.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It couldn't be worth less than thirty-one pounds, so I agree to your terms,&quot; said Adam. He leaned over and kissed Heidi on the lips. &quot;Perhaps it will take more than one day,&quot; he said. &quot;Then what would you say?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I would demand separate hotels,&quot; replied Heidi, &quot;if it wasn't for the high cost of the Swiss franc,&quot; she added.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Like a Polish tractor. The bits that worked were fine.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;From that I assume the bits that didn't work failed to produce the Tsar's icon,&quot; the chairman said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Correct, but Bischoff turned out to be most helpful, as was Jacques. My every need was catered for.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Your every need?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good man, Bischoff,&quot; said the banker. &quot;That's why I sent you to him first.&quot; The old man slumped down into his chair.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Was there any other reason you sent me to him first?&quot; asked Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Five other reasons,&quot; said Poskonov, &quot;but we'll not bother with any of them until you have found your icon.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Perhaps I'd like to bother now,&quot; said Romanov firmly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I've outlived two generations of Romanovs,&quot; said the old man raising his eyes. &quot;I wouldn't want to outlive a third. Let's leave it at that for now, I'm sure we can come to an understanding when the spotlight is no longer on you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov nodded.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, you will be pleased to learn that I have not been idle in your absence. But I fear my results also resemble a Polish tractor.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The banker waved Romanov to a seat before he reopened his file which had grown in size since he had last seen it. &quot;Originally,&quot; the chairman began, &quot;you presented me with a list of fourteen banks, eleven of which have now confirmed that they are not in possession of the Tsar's icon.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I have been wondering about that - is their word to be taken at face value?&quot; asked Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not necessarily,&quot; said the banker. &quot;But on balance the Swiss prefer not to become involved rather than tell a deliberate lie. In time the liar is always found out, and I still, from this office, control the cash flow of eight nations. I may not wield what they would call financial clout but I can still put the odd spanner in the works of the capitalist monetary system.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That still leaves us with three banks?&quot; said Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Correct, Comrade. The first is BischofF et Cie, whom you have already visited. But the other two have refused to co-operate in any way.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why is it your influence does not extend to them?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The most obvious of reasons,&quot; replied Poskonov. &quot;Other interests exert a stronger influence. If, for example, your major source of income emanates from the leading Jewish families, or alternatively the Americans, no amount of pressure will ever allow you to deal with the Soviet Union.&quot; Romanov nodded his understanding. &quot;That being the case,&quot; continued Poskonov, &quot;there still has to be an outside chance that one of these two banks is in possession of the Tsar's icon, and as they are never going to admit as much to Mother Russia I am not sure what I can recommend you do next.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You have given me an idea,&quot; said Romanov. &quot;I think the Americans would describe it as a 'long shot'. But if I'm right, it will be the Russians who will get the home run.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Baseball is a game that I've never understood but I am, however, glad to have been of some use today. Although I suspect you will still need this, whatever your long shot.&quot; Poskonov removed a single piece of paper from his file and handed it over to Romanov. On it were the words: Simon et Cie, Zurich (refused), Roget et Cie, Geneva (refused).</FONT><BR>

A large overcoat that might have been even older than its wearer reached almost to the ground and the fingers that could only just be seen peeping through the sleeves were covered in grey woollen mittens. One hand clung on to a little leather suitcase, with the initials E.R. in black looking so worn that it might have belonged to his grandfather.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">One would have had to bend down or be very short to see the old man's face - a face that was dominated by a nose that would have flattered Cyrano de Berg-erac. He shuffled forward slowly until it was his turn to climb into a taxi. The operation was a slow one, and the driver was already drumming his fingers against the wheel when his passenger told him in guttural tones that he wanted to be taken to the bankers, Simon et Cie. The driver moved off without asking for further directions. Swiss taxi-drivers know the way to the banks in the same way as London cabbies can always find a theatre and New York's yellow cabs a westside bar.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I have come to see -&quot; he began in stilted German, but the doorman only pointed to the girl behind the reception desk. He shuffled over to her and then repeated, &quot;I have come to see Herr Daiimier. My name is Emmanuel Rosenbaum.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Herr Daumier is in conference at the moment,&quot; said the girl, &quot;but I will find out if there is another partner available to see you.&quot; After a phone conversation in German she said, &quot;Can you take the lift to the third floor?&quot; Mr Rosenbaum nodded with obvious signs of reluctance, but did as he was bid. When he stepped out of the lift, only just before the door closed on him, another young woman was standing there ready to greet him. She asked him if he would be kind enough to wait in what he would have described as a cloakroom with two chairs. Some time passed before anyone came to see him, and the old man was unable to hide his surprise at the age of the boy who eventually appeared.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; came back the reply, and the old man handed over his passport and a receipt that had been folded and unfolded so many times it was now almost in pieces.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The young man studied both documents carefully. He recognised the Israeli passport immediately. Everything seemed to be in order. The bank's receipt, too, although issued in the year of his birth, appeared authentic.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Shortly after the young man had left, the woman returned and invited Mr Rosenbaum to move to another room. This time it was larger and comfortably furnished. Within minutes the junior partner returned with another man, whom he introduced as Herr Daumier.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I don't think we have ever met, Herr Rosenbaum,&quot; said the chairman courteously. &quot;You must have dealt with my father.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, no,&quot; said Mr Rosenbaum. &quot;I dealt with your grandfather, Helmut.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I saw your father only on the one occasion, and was sad to learn of his premature death,&quot; added Rosenbaum. &quot;He was always so considerate. You do not wear a rose in your lapel as he did.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I apologise,&quot; said Daumier, visibly embarrassed. &quot;It will take me only a few minutes to bring your box up, if you will be kind enough to wait.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mr Rosenbaum's eyes blinked as if he were too tired even to nod his agreement. The two men left him alone. They returned a few minutes later with a flat box about two feet square and placed it on the table in the centre of the room. Herr Daumier unlocked the top lock while the other partner acted as a witness. He then handed over a key to Rosenbaum saying, &quot;We will now leave you, sir. Just press the button underneath the table when you wish us to return.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Rosenbaum, and waited for the door to close behind them. He turned the key in the lock and pushed up the lid. Inside the box was a package in the shape of a picture, about eighteen by twelve inches, covered in muslin and tied securely. Rosenbaum placed the package carefully in his old suitcase. He then shut the box and locked it. He pressed the button under the table and within seconds Herr Daumier and the junior partner returned.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I do hope everything was as you left it, Herr Rosenbaum,&quot; said the chairman, &quot;it has been some considerable time.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, thank you.&quot; This time the old gentleman did manage a nod.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;May I mention a matter of no great consequence?&quot; asked Herr Daumier.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Pray do so,&quot; said the old man.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, I have no need for it any longer.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's just that there was a small charge outstanding. But in the circumstances we are happy to waive it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You are most kind.&quot; Herr Daumier bowed and the junior partner accompanied their client to the front door, helped him into a taxi and instructed the driver to take Mr Rosenbaum to Zurich airport.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">At the airport, the old man took his time reaching the check-in desk, because he appeared to be frightened of the escalator, and with the suitcase now quite heavy the flight of steps was difficult to negotiate.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">At the desk he produced his ticket for the girl to check and was pleased to find that the passenger lounge was almost empty. He shuffled over towards the corner and collapsed on to a comfortable sofa. He checked to be sure he was out of sight of the other passengers in the lounge.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He flicked back the little knobs on the old suitcase and the springs rose reluctantly. He pushed up the lid, pulled out the parcel and held it to his chest. His fingers wrestled with the knots for some time before they became loose. He then removed the muslin to check his prize. Mr Rosenbaum stared down at the masterpiece. 'The Cornfields' by Van Gogh - which he had no way of knowing had been missing from the Vienna National Gallery since 1938.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Emmanuel Rosenbaum swore, which was out of character. He packed the picture safely up and returned it to his case. He then shuffled over to the girl at the Swissair sales desk and asked her to book him on the first available flight to Geneva. With luck he could still reach Roget et Cie before they closed.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's not as bad as a work out with the sergeant major at ten,&quot; groaned Adam. &quot;And by ten past I shall be flat on my back regretting I ever left Geneva.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That will teach you to knock him out,&quot; said Heidi. &quot;So perhaps we ought to stay put after all,&quot; she added, taking him by the arm.

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good thing I remembered this,&quot; he said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not so much a raincoat, more a tent,&quot; said Heidi.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's my old army trenchcoat,&quot; he assured her, opening it up again. &quot;It can hold maps, compasses, even an overnight kit.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Adam, we're just going to be strolling around Geneva in the middle of summer, not lost in the Black Forest in the middle of winter.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He laughed. &quot;I'll remember your sarcasm whenever it pours.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The airport bus that travelled to and from the city took only twenty minutes to reach the centre of Geneva.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The short journey took them through the outskirts of the city until they reached the magnificent still lake nestled in the hills. The bus continued alongside the lake until it came to a halt opposite the massive single-spouting fountain that shot over four hundred feet into the air.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm beginning to feel like a day tripper,&quot; said Heidi, as they stepped out of the bus, pleased to find the light rain had stopped.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Both of them were immediately struck by how clean the city was as they walked along the wide litter-free pavement that ran alongside the lake. On the other side of the road neat hotels, shops and banks seemed in equal preponderance.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;First we must find out where our bank is so that we can have lunch nearby before going to pick up the booty.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How does a military man go about such a demanding exercise?&quot; asked Heidi.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Simple. We drop in at the first bank we see and ask them to direct us to Roget et Cie.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Worse,&quot; said Heidi. &quot;But you personify every German's image of the perfect English gentleman.&quot; Adam turned, touched her hair gently and leaning down, kissed her on the lips.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Heidi was suddenly conscious of the stares from passing strangers. &quot;I don't think the Swiss approve of that sort of thing in public,&quot; she said. &quot;In fact, I'm told some of them don't approve of it in private.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Shall I go and kiss that old prune over there who is still glaring at us?&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Don't do that, Adam, you might turn into a frbg. No, let's put your plan of campaign into action,&quot; she said, pointing to the Banque Populaire on the far side of the avenue.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When they had crossed the road Heidi enquired of the doorman the way to Roget et Cie. They followed his directions, once again admiring the great single-spouted fountain as they continued on towards the centre of the city.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Roget et Cie was not that easy to pinpoint, and they walked past it twice before Heidi spotted the discreet sign chiselled in stone by the side of a high wrought-iron and plate-glass door.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Looks impressive,&quot; said Adam, &quot;even when it's closed for lunch.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What were you expecting - a small branch in the country? I know you English don't like to admit it but this is the centre of the banking world.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Let's find that restaurant before our entente cordiale breaks down,&quot; said Adam. They retraced their steps towards the fountain and, as the sun was trying to find gaps between the clouds, they chose a pavement</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">cafe overlooking the lake. Both selected a cheese salad and shared a half bottle of white wine. Adam was enjoying Heidi's company so much that he began to tell her stories of his army days. She had to stop him and point out that it was nearly two. He reluctantly called for the bill. &quot;The time has now come to discover if the Tsar's icon really exists,&quot; he said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When they had returned to the entrance of the bank Adam pushed open the heavy door, took a step inside and stared around the gloomy hall.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Over there,&quot; said Heidi, pointing to a woman who was seated behind a desk.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good morning. My name is Adam Scott. I have come to collect something that has been left to me in a will.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The woman smiled. &quot;Have you made an appointment with anyone in particular?&quot; she asked, with only the slightest trace of accent.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No,&quot; said Adam. &quot;I didn't realise that I had to.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm sure it will be all right,&quot; said the lady. She picked up a phone, dialled a single number and held a short conversation in French. Replacing the phone she asked them both to go to the fourth floor.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As Adam walked out of the lift, he was surprised to be met by someone of his own age.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good afternoon, my name is Pierre Neffe and I am a partner of the bank,&quot; said the young man in perfect English.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I did warn you that I would be redundant,&quot; whispered Heidi.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Don't speak too soon,&quot; replied Adam. &quot;We haven't even begun to explain our problem yet.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">M. Neffe led them to a small, exquisitely furnished room.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I could settle down here,&quot; said Adam, taking off his coat, &quot;without any trouble.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We do like to make our customers feel at home,&quot; said M. Neffe condescendingly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You obviously haven't seen my home,&quot; said Adam. M. Neffe did not laugh.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How can I help you?&quot; was all the young partner offered by way of reply.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My father,&quot; began Adam, &quot;died last month and left me in his will a receipt for something I think you have had in your safe-keeping since 1938. It was a gift given to him by one of your customers.&quot; Adam hesitated. &quot;A Mr Emmanuel Rosenbaum.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Do you have any documentation relating to this gift?&quot; enquired M. Neffe.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said Adam, digging into the map pocket of his trenchcoat. He passed over the Roget et Gie receipt to the young banker. M. Neffe studied it and nodded. &quot;May I be permitted to see your passport, Mr Scott?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Adam, delving back into his trenchcoat and passing it to M. Neffe.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;If you will excuse me for one moment.&quot; M. Neffe rose, and left them on their own.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What do you imagine they are up to now?&quot; said Heidi.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Checking first if they still have the icon, and second if my receipt is authentic. 1938 was rather a long time ago.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As the minutes ticked by, Adam started to feel disappointed, then depressed, and finally began to believe it was all going to turn out to be a complete waste of time.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You could always take one of the pictures off the wall and put it in your trenchcoat,&quot; teased Heidi. &quot;I'm</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">sure it would fetch a good price in London. Perhaps even more than your beloved icon.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Too late,&quot; said Adam as M. Neffe reappeared with another banker whom he introduced as M. Roget.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good morning,&quot; said M. Roget. &quot;I am sorry that my father is not here to meet you, Mr Scott, but he has been held up in Chicago on business.&quot; He shook hands with both Adam and Heidi. &quot;We have on file a letter from Mr Rosenbaum giving clear instructions to the bank that the box is not to be opened by any other than&quot; - he looked at the piece of paper he had brought with him - &quot;Colonel Gerald Scott, DSO, QBE, MC.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My father,&quot; said Adam. &quot;But as I explained to M. Neffe, he died last month and left me the gift in his will.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I would be happy to accept what you say,&quot; said M. Roget, &quot;if I might be allowed sight of a copy of the death certificate and of the will itself.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam smiled at his own foresight and once more searched in his trenchcoat before removing a large brown envelope with the words 'Holbrooke, Holbrooke and Gascoigne' printed in heavy black letters across the top. He took out copies of his father's death certificate, the will and a letter marked 'To Whom It May Concern' and passed them to M. Roget, who read all three documents slowly, then handed them to his senior partner, who after he had read them whispered in his chairman's ear.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Would you object to us phoning Mr Holbrooke in your presence?&quot; asked M. Roget.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No,&quot; said Adam simply. &quot;But I must warn you that he is rather curmudgeonly.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Curmudgeonly?&quot; said the banker. &quot;A word I am not familiar with, but I think I can sense its meaning.&quot; He turned and spoke to M. Neffe, who swiftly left the</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">room, only to return a minute later with a copy of the English Law Society Register, 1966.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam was impressed by the bank's thoroughness as M. Roget checked that the number and address on the letterhead corresponded with the number and address in the Year Book. &quot;I don't think it will be necessary to call Mr Holbrooke,&quot; said M. Roget,. &quot;but we have encountered one small problem, Mr Scott.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And what is that?&quot; asked Adam, nervously.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Mr Rosenbaum's position is somewhat overdrawn, and the bank's rule is that an account must be cleared before any box can be opened.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam's pulse raced as he assumed that he hadn't brought enough money to cover this eventuality.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The account is only 120 francs in debit,&quot; continued M. Roget, &quot;which is the charge for housing the box over the past two years since Mr Rosenbaum's deposit ran out.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam breathed a sigh of relief. He took out his wallet and signed a traveller's cheque and handed it over.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And finally,&quot; said M. Roget, &quot;we will need you to sign a form of indemnity for the bank.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">M. Roget passed over a long form containing clause after clause in tightly printed French at which Adam only glanced before passing it over to Heidi. She studied each clause carefully. M. Roget used the time to explain to Adam that it was a standard disclaimer clearing the bank of any liability concerning what might be in the box and Adam's legal claim to it.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Heidi looked up and nodded her agreement.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam signed on the dotted line with a flourish.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Excellent,&quot; said the banker. &quot;All we have to do now is go and retrieve your box.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">158</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;I </I>suppose it could be empty,&quot; said Adam once the two of them were left alone again.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And it could be jam-packed with gold doubloons, you old pessimist,&quot; said Heidi.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When both men returned a few minutes later, M. Neffe was carrying a flat metal box about twelve by nine inches, and some three inches deep.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam was disappointed by its modest size, but didn't show his feelings. M. Roget proceeded to undo the top lock with the bank's key and then handed Adam a small faded envelope with signatures scrawled across the waxed seal. &quot;Whatever is in the box belongs to you, Mr Scott. When you have finished, perhaps you would be kind enough to let us know. Until then we shall remain outside in the corridor.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Both men left the room.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Come on,&quot; said Heidi, &quot;I can't wait.&quot; Adam opened the envelope and a key fell out. He fumbled with the lock which clicked and then he pushed up the lid. Inside the box was a small flat package wrapped in muslin and tied tightly with string. The knots took some undoing and then finally an impatient Adam tore off the string before slowly removing the muslin. They both stared at the masterpiece in disbelief.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The simple beauty of the golds, reds and blues left them both speechless. Neither of them had expected the icon to be so breathtaking. St George towering over the dragon, a massive sword in hand on the point of plunging it into the heart of the beast. The fire that belched from the dragon's jaw was a deep red and made a startling contrast to the gold cloak that seemed to envelop the saint.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's magnificent,&quot; said Heidi, eventually finding her voice.</FONT><BR>
</P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam continued to hold the tiny painting in his hand.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Say something,&quot; said Heidi.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I wish my father had seen it, perhaps it would have changed his whole life.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Don't forget he wanted it to change yours,&quot; said Heidi.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam finally turned the icon over and found on the back a small silver crown inlaid in the wood. He stared at it, trying to recall what Mr Sedgwick of Sotheby's had said that proved.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I wish my father had opened the letter,&quot; said Adam, turning the icon back over and once again admiring St George's triumph. &quot;Because it was his by right.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Heidi checked there was nothing else left inside the box. She then flicked down the lid and Adam locked it again with his key. He tucked the muslin round the masterpiece, tied it up firmly and slipped the little painting into the map pocket of his trenchcoat.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Heidi smiled. &quot;I knew you'd be able to prove that you needed that coat even if it didn't rain.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam walked over to the door and opened it. The two bankers immediately returned.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I hope you found what you had been promised,&quot; said M. Roget.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, indeed,&quot; said Adam. &quot;But I shall have no further need of the box,&quot; he added, returning the key.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I also hope that you will enjoy a pleasant stay in our city,&quot; said M. NefFe as the lift took its leisurely pace down.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It will have to be very quick,&quot; said Adam. &quot;We have to be back at the airport in just over an hour.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The lift stopped at the ground floor and M. NefFe accompanied Adam and Heidi across the hall. The door was held open for them but they both stood aside to allow an old man to shuffle past. Although most people would have stared at his nose Adam was more struck by his penetrating eyes.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When the old man eventually reached the woman at the reception desk, he announced, &quot;I have come to see Monsieur Roget.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm afraid he's in Chicago at the moment, sir, but I'll see if his son is available. What name shall I tell him?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Emmanuel Rosenbaum.&quot; The woman picked up the phone and held another conversation in French. When she had replaced it she asked, &quot;Would you go to the fourth floor, Mr Rosenbaum?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Once again he had to take the fearsome lift, and once again he only just got out before its great teeth sprang back on him. Another middle-aged woman accompanied him to the waiting room. He politely declined her offer of coffee, thumping his heart with his right hand.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Monsieur Roget will be with you shortly,&quot; she reassured the old gentleman.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">I have left in your safe-keeping a small icon of St George and the Dragon in my box 718. I am transferring the ownership of that painting to a British army officer, Colonel Gerald Scott, DSO, OBE, MC. If Colonel Scott should come to claim the icon at any time please ensure that he receives my key without delay.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">My thanks to you for your help in this matter, and I am only sorry we have never met in person.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Yours sincerely, Emmanuel Rosenbaum</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And you say that Colonel Scott came to collect the contents of the box earlier today?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, no, Monsieur Rosenbaum. The colonel died quite recently and left the contents of the box to his son, Adam Scott. Monsieur NefFe and I checked all the documents including the death certificate and the will, and we were left in no doubt that they were both authentic and that everything was in order. He was also in possession of your receipt.&quot; The young banker hesitated. &quot;I do hope we did the right thing, Monsieur Rosenbaum?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You certainly did,&quot; said the old man. &quot;I came only to check that my wishes had been carried out.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">M. Roget smiled in relief. &quot;I feel I ought also to mention that your account had run into a small deficit.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How much do I owe you?&quot; asked the old man, fumbling in his breast pocket.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nothing,&quot; said M. Roget. &quot;Nothing at all. Monsieur Scott dealt with it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I am in debt to Mr Scott. Are you able to tell me the amount?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;One hundred and twenty francs,&quot; said M. Roget.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then I must repay the sum immediately,&quot; said the old man. &quot;Do you by any chance have an address at which I can contact him?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, I'm sorry I am unable to help you there,&quot; said M. Roget. &quot;I have no idea where he is staying in Geneva.&quot; A hand touched M. Roget's elbow, and M. NefFe bent down and whispered in his ear.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It appears,&quot; said M. Roget, &quot;that Mr Scott was planning to return to England shortly because he had to check in at Geneva airport by five.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then have a good flight, sir,&quot; said the man, handing over their boarding passes. Adam and Heidi started walking towards the escalator that would take them to the departure lounge.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I have seven hundred and seventy Swiss francs left,&quot; said Adam, thumbing through some notes, &quot;and while we're here I must get my mother a box of decent liqueur chocolates. When I was a boy I used to give her a minute box every Christmas. I swore when I grew up if I ever got to Switzerland I would find her the finest box available.&quot; Heidi pointed to a counter that displayed row upon row of ornate boxes. Adam walked over and selected a large, gold-wrapped box of Lindt chocolates which the girl behind the counter gift-wrapped and placed in a carrier bag.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">They returned downstairs and walked over to the man who had handed them their boarding passes. &quot;I think you put a call out for me,&quot; said Adam. &quot;My name is Scott.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said the man. &quot;There's an urgent message for you,&quot; he said, reading from a pad in front of him. &quot;Please call Monsieur Roget at Roget et Cie on Geneva 271279.&quot; He ripped off the piece of paper and handed it over. &quot;The phones are over there in the far corner behind the KLM desk, and you'll need twenty centimes.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Adam, studying the message, but it gave no clue as to why M. Roget should need to speak to him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I wonder what he can want,&quot; said Heidi. &quot;It's a bit late to ask for the icon back.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, there's only one way I'm going to find out,&quot; said Adam, passing over the bag to her. &quot;Hang on to that and I'll be back in a moment.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'll try and pick up my magazine at the same time, if I can find a newspaper shop on this floor,&quot; said Heidi as she gripped the brightly coloured bag which contained the chocolates.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'll find out if he's available, sir.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam swung round to see if Heidi had returned to the BEA counter, but as there was no sign of her he assumed she must still be looking for a newspaper. Then he noticed an old man shuffling across the hall. He could have sworn he had seen him somewhere before.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Mr Scott?&quot; Adam leaned back into the box.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, Monsieur Roget, I am returning your call.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Returning my call?&quot; said the banker, sounding puzzled. &quot;I don't understand.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;There was a message left at the BEA counter asking me to phone you. Urgent.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;There must be some mistake, I didn't leave any message. But now that you have rung, it might interest you to know that just as you were leaving Mr Emmanuel Rosenbaum paid us a visit.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Emmanuel Rosenbaum?&quot; said Adam, &quot;but I assumed he was ...&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Could you assist me, please, young lady?&quot; Heidi looked up at the old man who had addressed her in English, but with such a strong mid-European accent. She wondered why he had taken for granted that she spoke English but decided it must be the only language he felt confident conversing in.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not at all,&quot; said Heidi, taking the old man by the arm and guiding him back towards the door marked 'Taxi et Autobus'.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Are you sure it was Rosenbaum?&quot; said Adam anxiously.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm certain,&quot; replied the banker.</FONT><BR>

<P>

</P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh, yes. That was not the problem. His only concern was to return your 120 francs. I think he may try and get in touch with you.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you, Monsieur Roget,&quot; said Adam and replaced the receiver. He turned towards the BEA counter and was surprised to find that Heidi had not yet returned. His eyes began to search the ground floor for a paper shop as he feared she might well not have heard the departure announcement. Then he spotted her walking out through the double door, helping the old man he had noticed earlier.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam called out and quickened his pace. Something didn't feel quite right. When he reached the automatic door he had to check his stride to allow it to slide back. He could now see Heidi standing on the pavement in front of him, opening a taxi door for the old man.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Heidi,&quot; he shouted. The old gentleman suddenly turned and once again Adam found himself staring at the man he could have sworn he had seen at the bank. &quot;Mr Rosenbaum?&quot; he questioned. Then with a</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">movement of his arm that was so fast and powerful it took Adam by surprise, the old man threw Heidi into the back of the taxi, jumped in beside her, and pulling the taxi door closed, hollered at the top of his voice,</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;AUez vite&quot;</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">For a moment Adam was stunned but then he dashed to the side of the taxi and only just managed to touch the handle as it accelerated away from the kerb. The car's sudden momentum knocked Adam backwards on the pavement, but not before he saw the petrified look on Heidi's face. He stared at the number plate of the departing car: GE-7-1-2 - was all he could catch, but at least he recognised it was a blue Mercedes. Desperately he looked around for another taxi but the only one in sight was already being filled up with luggage.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A Volkswagen Beetle drew up on the far side of the concourse. A woman stepped out of the driver's seat and walked to the front to open the boot. A man joined her from the passenger's side and lifted out a suitcase, before she slammed the boot lid back into place.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">On the kerb, the two of them embraced. As they did so, Adam sprinted across the road and opening the passenger door of the Volkswagen, leapt inside and slid into the driver's seat. The key was still in the ignition. He turned it on, threw the car into gear, slammed his foot on the accelerator and shot backwards. The embracing couple stared at him in disbelief. Adam jerked the gear lever out of reverse into what he hoped was first. The engine turned over slowly, but just fast enough for him to escape the pursuing man. It must be third, he thought, and changed down as he began to follow the signs to the centre of Geneva.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">By the time he reached the first junction he had mastered the gears, but had to concentrate hard on</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">remaining on the right-hand side of the road. &quot;GE712 . . . GE712,&quot; he repeated to himself again and again, to be sure it was fixed in his memory. He checked the number plate and the passengers of every blue taxi he passed. After a dozen or so, he began to wonder if Heidi's taxi might have left the motorway for a minor road. He pressed the accelerator even harder- 90,100, 110, 120 kilometres an hour. He passed three more taxis but there was still no sign of Heidi.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Then he saw a Mercedes in the outside lane some considerable distance ahead of him, its lights full on and travelling well above the speed limit. He felt confident that the Volkswagen was powerful enough to catch the Mercedes, especially if it had a diesel engine. Metre by metre he began to narrow the gap as he tried to fathom out why the old man would want to kidnap Heidi in the first place. Could it be Rosenbaum? But he had wanted him to keep the icon, or so the banker had assured him. None of it made sense, and he drove on wondering if at any moment he was going to wake up.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When they reached the outskirts of the city Adam hadn't woken up as he followed carefully the taxi's chosen route. By the next intersection only three cars divided them. &quot;A red light, I need a red light,&quot; Adam shouted, but the first three traffic lights into the city remained stubbornly green. And when one finally turned red, a van suddenly pulled in front of him, lengthening the gap between them. Adam cursed as he leaped out of the car and started running towards the taxi, but the light changed back to green just before he could reach it and the Mercedes sped away. Adam sprinted back to the Volkswagen and only just managed to drive the car across the junction as the light turned red. His decision to get out of the car had</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">lost him several crucial seconds and when he looked anxiously ahead he could only just spot the taxi in the distance.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When they reached the Avenue de France, running parallel with the west side of the lake, both cars weaved in and out of the traffic, until the Mercedes suddenly turned left and climbed up a slight hill. Adam threw his steering wheel over to follow it, and for several yards careered up the wrong side of the road, narrowly missing a post van meandering down towards him. He watched carefully as the taxi turned left again, and in order to keep in contact he veered in front of a bus so sharply that it was forced to slam on its brakes. Several passengers, thrown from their seats, waved their fists at him as the bus's horn blared.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The taxi was now only a couple of hundred yards ahead. Once again Adam began to pick up some ground when suddenly it swerved into the kerbside and screeched to a halt. Nothing seemed to happen for the next few seconds as Adam weaved his way towards the stationary taxi, skidding to a halt directly behind the Mercedes. He then leaped out of the car and ran towards the parked vehicle. But, without warning, the old man jumped out of the taxi on the far side of the car and sprinted off up a side-street carrying with him Heidi's airport shopping bag and a small suitcase.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam pulled the back door open and stared at the beautiful girl who sat motionless. &quot;Are you all right, are you all right?&quot; he shouted, suddenly realising how much she meant to him. Heidi did not move a muscle and made no reply. Adam put his arms on her shoulders and looked into her eyes but they showed no response. He began to stroke her hair and then without warning her head fell limply on to his shoulder like a rag doll and a small trickle of blood started to run from</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">the corner of her mouth. Adam felt cold and sick and began to tremble uncontrollably. He looked up at the taxi-driver. His arms were loose by his side and his body slumped over the wheel. There was no sign of life in the middle-aged man.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He refused to accept that they were dead.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam kept holding on to Heidi as he stared beyond her: the old man had reached the top of the hill.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Why did he still think of him as an old man? He was obviously not old at all, but young and very fit. Suddenly Adam's fear turned to anger. He had a split second to make a decision. He let go of Heidi, jumped out of the car and started to sprint up the hill after her killer. Two or three onlookers had already gathered on the kerbside and were now staring at Adam and the two cars. He had to catch the man who was still running. Adam moved as fast as he could but the trenchcoat he was wearing slowed him down, and by the time he too had reached the top of the hill the killer was a clear hundred yards ahead of him, weaving his way through the main thoroughfare. Adam tried to lengthen his stride as he watched the man leap on to a passing tram, but he was too far behind to make any impression on him and could only watch the tram moving inexorably into the distance.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>

The back was no longer hunched, the figure no longer frail, and even at that distance, Adam could sense the triumph in the man's stance. Adam stood for several seconds in the middle of the road helplessly watching the tram as it disappeared out of sight.</FONT><BR>

None of it made sense. He would surely find it was all a mistake . . . Then he touched the side of his coat, touched the package that held the Tsar's icon. The killer hadn't gone to all that trouble for &pound;20,000 -murdering two innocent people who happened to have got in his way - why, why, <I>why, </I>was the icon that important? What had the Sotheby's expert said? &quot;A Russian gentleman had enquired after the piece.&quot; Adam's mind began to whirl. If it was Emmanuel Rosenbaum and that was what he had killed for, all he had ended up with was a large box of Swiss liqueur chocolates.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When Adam heard the whistle behind him he felt relieved that help was at hand but as he turned he saw two officers with guns out of their holsters pointing towards him. He instinctively turned his jog into a run, and looking over his shoulder he saw that several police were now giving chase. He lengthened his stride again and, despite the trenchcoat, doubted if there were a member of the Swiss force who could hope to keep up the pace he set for more than a quarter of a mile. He turned into the first alley he came to and speeded up. It was narrow - not wide enough for even two bicycles to pass. Once he was beyond the alley he selected a one-way street. It was crammed with cars, and he was able swiftly and safely to move in and out of the slow-moving oncoming traffic.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">In a matter of minutes he had lost the pursuing police, but he still ran on, continually switching direction until he felt he had covered at least two miles. He finally turned into a quiet street and halfway down</FONT><BR>

It didn't look much more than a guest house, and certainly wouldn't have qualified under the description of an hotel. He stopped in the shadows and waited, taking in great gulps of air. After about three minutes his breathing was back to normal and he marched straight into the hotel.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He stood naked, staring at the image of Emmanuel Rosenbaum in the hotel mirror. He didn't like what he saw. First he removed the teeth, then began to click his own up and down: he had been warned that the gums would ache for days. Then painstakingly he shed each layer of his bulbous nose, admiring the skill and artistry that had gone into creating such a monstrosity. It will be too conspicuous, he had told them. They will remember nothing else, had come back the experts' reply.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When the last layer had been removed, the aristocratic one that took its place looked ridiculous in the centre of such a face. Next he began on the lined forehead that even moved when he frowned. As the lines disappeared, so the years receded. Next the flaccid red cheeks, and finally, the two chins. The Swiss bankers would have been amazed at how easily the sharp rubbing of a pumice stone removed the indelible number on the inside of his arm. Once more he studied himself in the mirror. The hair, short and greying, would take nature longer. When they had cut his hair and smeared that thick, mud-like concoction all over his scalp he realised how an Irishman must feel to be tarred and feathered. Moments later he stood under a</FONT><BR>

Black treacly water started to run down his face and body before finally disappearing down the plug hole. It took half a bottle of shampoo before his hair had returned to its normal colour, but he realised that it would take considerably longer before he stopped looking like a staff sergeant in the United States Marines.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">In a corner of the room lay the long baggy coat, the shiny shapeless suit, the black tie, the off-white shirt, woollen mittens and the Israeli passport. Hours of preparation discarded in a matter of minutes. He longed to burn them all, but instead left them in a heap. He returned to the main room and stretched himself out on the bed like a yawning cat. His back still ached from all the bending and crouching. He stood up, then touched his toes and threw his arms high above his head fifty times. He rested for one minute before completing fifty press-ups.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He returned to the bathroom and had a second shower - cold. He was beginning to feel like a human being again. He then changed into a freshly ironed cream silk shirt and a new double-breasted suit.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Before making one phone call to London and two more to Moscow he ordered dinner in his room so that no one would see him - he had no desire to explain how the man who checked in was thirty years younger than the man eating alone in his room. Like a hungry animal he tore at the steak and gulped the wine.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He stared at the colourful carrier bag but felt no desire to finish off the meal with one of Scott's liqueur chocolates. Once again he felt anger at the thought of the Englishman getting the better of him.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">At a little after eleven he switched on the late-night news. They had no photograph of the suspect, only one of that stupid taxi-driver who had driven so slowly it had cost the fool his life, and the pretty German girl who had tried to fight back. It had been pathetic, one firm clean strike and her neck was broken. The television announcer said the police were searching for an unnamed Englishman. Romanov smiled at the thought of police searching for Scott while he was eating steak in a luxury hotel. Although the Swiss police had no photograph of the murderer, Romanov didn't need one. It was a face he would never forget. In any case, his contact in England had already told him a lot more about Captain Scott in one phone call than the Swiss police could hope to discover for another week.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When Romanov was told the details of Scott's military career and decorations for bravery he considered it would be a pleasure to kill such a man.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Lying motionless on a mean little bed, Adam tried to make sense of all the pieces that made up a black jigsaw. If Goering had left the icon to his father, and his alias had been Emmanuel Rosenbaum, then a real-life Emmanuel Rosenbaum didn't exist. But he <I>did </I>exist: he had even killed twice in his attempt to get his hands on the Tsar's icon. Adam leaned over, switched on the bedside light, then pulled the small package out of the pocket of his trenchcoat. He unwrapped it carefully before holding the icon under the light. St George stared back at him — no longer looking</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">By midnight Adam had decided what had to be done, but he didn't stir from that tiny room until a few minutes after three. He lifted himself quietly off the bed, opened the door, checked the corridor, and then locked the door noiselessly behind him before creeping down the stairs. When he reached the bottom step he waited and listened. The night porter had nodded off in front of a television that now let out a dim, monotonous hum. A silver dot remained in the centre of the screen. Adam took nearly two minutes to reach the front door, stepping on a noisy floorboard just once: but the porter's snores had been enough to cover that. Once outside, Adam checked up and down the street but there was no sign of any movement. He didn't want to go far, so he stayed in the shadows by the side of the road, moving at a pace unfamiliar to him. When he reached the corner he saw what he was searching for and it was still about a hundred yards away.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">There was still no one to be seen, so he quickly made his way to the phone box. He pressed a twenty centime coin into the box and waited. A voice said, <I>&quot;Est-ce-que jepeux vous aider?&quot; </I>Adam uttered only one word, &quot;International.&quot; A moment later another voice asked the same question.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I want to make a reverse charge call to London,&quot; said Adam firmly. He had no desire to repeat himself.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes,&quot; said the voice. &quot;And what is your name?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;George Cromer,&quot; replied Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And the number you are speaking from?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">he felt the police could well be listening in on all calls to England that night. He then told the girl the number in London he required.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Can you wait for a moment, please?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Adam as his eyes checked up and down the street once again, still looking for any unfamiliar movement. Only the occasional early morning car sped by. He remained absolutely motionless in the corner of the box.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He could hear the connection being put through. &quot;Please wake up,&quot; his lips mouthed. At last the ringing stopped and Adam recognised the familiar voice which answered.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Who is this?&quot; Lawrence asked, sounding irritated but perfectly awake.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Will you accept a reverse charge call from a Mr George Cromer in Geneva?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;George Cromer, Lord Cromer, the Governor of the Bank of Eng-? Yes, I will,&quot; he said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's me, Lawrence,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank God. Where are you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm still in Geneva but I'm not sure you're going to believe what I'm about to tell you. While we were waiting to board our plane home a man pulled Heidi into a taxi and later murdered her before I could catch up with them. And the trouble is that the Swiss police think I'm the killer.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Now just relax, Adam. I know that much. It's been on the evening news and the police have already been around to interview me. It seems Heidi's brother identified you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What do you mean <I>identified </I>me? I didn't do it. You know I couldn't do it. It was a man called Rosenbaum, not me, Lawrence.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam tried to sound calm. &quot;Heidi and I came to Geneva this morning to pick up a gift from a Swiss bank that Pa had left me in his will. It turned out to be a painting. Then when we returned to the airport, this Rosenbaum grabbed Heidi thinking she had got the painting which didn't make any sense because the damned icon's only worth &pound;20,000.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Icon?&quot; said Lawrence.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, an icon of St George and the Dragon,&quot; said Adam. &quot;That's not important. What's important is that ...&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Now listen and listen carefully,&quot; interrupted Lawrence, &quot;because I'm not going to repeat myself. Keep out of sight until the morning and then give yourself up at our Consulate. Just see you get there in one piece and I'll make sure that the Consul will be expecting you. Don't arrive until eleven because London is an hour behind Geneva and I'll need every minute to arrange matters and see that the consul staff is properly organised.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam found himself smiling for the first time in twelve hours.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Did the killer get what he was after?&quot; Lawrence asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, he didn't get the icon,&quot; said Adam, &quot;he only got my mother's chocolates . . .&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank God for that and keep out of sight of the Swiss police because they are convinced it was you who killed Heidi.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But. . .&quot; began Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No explanations. Just be at the Consulate at eleven. Now you'd better get off the line,&quot; said Lawrence. &quot;Eleven, and don't be late.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">he thought: the Lawrence of old who didn't need to ask any questions because he already knew the answers. Christ, what had he got himself involved in? Adam checked the street once again. Still no one in sight. He quickly stole the two hundred yards back to the hotel. The front door remained unlocked, the porter asleep, the television screen still faintly humming, the silver dot in place. Adam was back on his bed by five minutes past four. He didn't sleep. Rosenbaum, Heidi, the taxi driver, the Russian gentleman at Sotheby's. So many pieces of a jigsaw, none of them fitting into place.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">But the one thing that worried him most was the conversation with Lawrence - the Lawrence of old?</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The two policemen arrived at the Hotel Monarque at twenty past seven that Thursday morning. They were tired, discontented and hungry. Since midnight they had visited forty-three hotels on the west side of the city, on each occasion with no success. They had checked over a thousand registration cards and woken seven innocent Englishmen who had not come anywhere near fitting the description of Adam Scott.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">At eight they would be off duty and could go home to their wives and breakfasts; but they still had three more hotels to check before then. When the landlady saw them coming into the hall she waddled as quickly as possible from the inner office towards them. She loathed the police and was willing to believe anyone who told her that the Swiss pigs were even worse than the Germans. Twice in the last year she had been fined and once even threatened with jail over her failure to register every guest. If they caught her once more she knew they would take her licence away and with it her living. Her slow mind tried to recall who had booked in the previous evening. Eight people had registered</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">but only two had paid cash - the Englishman who hardly opened his mouth, Mr Pemberton was the name he had filled in on the missing card, and Maurice who always turned up with a different girl whenever he was in Geneva. She had destroyed both their cards and pocketed the money. Maurice and the girl had left by seven and she had already made up their bed, but the Englishman was still asleep in his room.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We need to check your registration cards for last night, madame.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Certainly, monsieur,&quot; she replied with a warm smile, and gathered together the six remaining cards: two Frenchmen, one Italian, two nationals from Zurich and one from Basle.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Did an Englishman stay here last night?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No,&quot; said the landlady firmly. &quot;I haven't had an Englishman,&quot; she added helpfully, &quot;for at least a month. Would you like to see the cards for last week?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, that won't be necessary,&quot; said the policeman. The landlady grunted with satisfaction. &quot;But we will still need to check your unoccupied rooms. I see from the certificate that there are twelve guest bedrooms in the hotel,&quot; the policeman continued. &quot;So there must be six that should be empty.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;There's no one in them,&quot; said the landlady. &quot;I've already checked them once this morning.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We still need to see for ourselves,&quot; the other officer insisted.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you, madame,&quot; said the first policeman as he stepped back into the corridor. &quot;We are sorry to have troubled you,&quot; he added. He put a tick on his list next to the Hotel Monarque.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As the two policemen made their way downstairs the landlady walked into room number twelve, mystified. The bed was undisturbed, as if it had not been slept in, and there was no sign of anyone having spent the night there. She called on her tired memory. She hadn't drunk that much the previous night - she touched the fifty francs in her pocket as if to prove the point. &quot;I wonder where he is,&quot; she muttered.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">For the past hour Adam had been crouching behind a derelict coach in a railway goods yard less than half a mile from the hotel. He had a clear view for a hundred yards in every direction. He had watched the early morning commuters flooding in on every train. By twenty past eight Adam judged they were at their peak. He checked that the icon was in place and left his hideout to join the flood as they headed to work. He stopped at the kiosk to purchase a newspaper. The only English paper on sale at that time in the morning was the <I>Herald-Tribune: </I>the London papers didn't arrive until the first plane could land, but Adam had seen the <I>Herald-Tribune </I>come in on the train from Paris. He made two other purchases at the station kiosk before rejoining the scurrying crowds: a city map of Geneva and a large bar of Nestle's chocolate.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">the map confirmed that he could already see the building he had marked out as his next place of sanctuary. He steered a route towards it that allowed him to stay in contact with the largest number of people. When he arrived in the square he continued under the shop awnings round the longest route, clinging to the wall, always avoiding the open spaces. It took a considerable time but his judgment was perfect. He reached the front door as hundreds of worshippers were leaving from the early morning Communion service.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Once inside, he felt safe. Notre Dame was the main Catholic Church in the city and Adam found his bearings in a matter of moments. He made his way slowly down the side aisle towards the Lady Chapel, dropped some coins in one of the collection boxes, lit a candle and placed it in a vacant holder below a statue of the Virgin Mother. He then fell on his knees, but his eyes never closed. A lapsed Catholic, he found he no longer believed in God - except when he was ill, frightened or in an aeroplane. After about twenty minutes, had passed Adam was distressed to see that there was now only a handful of people left in the cathedral. Some old ladies dressed in black filled a front pew, moving their rosary beads methodically and chanting, <I>&quot;Ave Maria, gratia plena, Domine teum, Benedicta </I>...&quot; A few tourists were craning their necks to admire the fine roof, their eyes only looking upwards.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam rose slowly, his eyes darting from side to side. He stretched his legs and walked over to a confessional box partly hidden behind a pillar. A small sign on the wooden support showed that the box was not in use. Adam slipped in, sat down and pulled the curtain closed.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">First he took out the <I>Herald-Tribune </I>from his trench-coat pocket, and then the bar of chocolate. He tore the silver paper from the chocolate and began to munch greedily. Next he searched for the story. Only one or two items of English news were on the front page, as most of the articles were devoted to what was happening in America. &quot;The pound still too high at $2.80?&quot; one headline suggested. Adam's eyes passed over the smaller headlines until he saw the paragraph he was looking for. It was in the bottom left-hand corner: &quot;Englishman sought after German girl and Swiss taxi-driver murdered.&quot; Adam read the story, and only began to tremble when he discovered they knew his name:</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Captain Adam Scott, who recently resigned his commission from the Royal Wessex Regiment, is wanted . . . please turn to page fifteen.&quot; Adam began to turn the large pages.

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good, my son, and what form has this sin taken?&quot; asked the priest in accented but clear English.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam thought quickly, I must give him no clue as to who I am. He looked out through the gap in the curtain and was alarmed to see two policemen questioning another priest by the west door. He drew the curtains tight and turned to the only accent he could ever imitate with any conviction.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam folded up his paper, pushed it in the trench-coat and bolted from the little box and took a seat on the end of a pew. He lowered his head and began to whisper the Lord's Prayer as he opened the map of Geneva and began to study the road plan. He had located the British Consulate on the far side of a large garden square by the time he reached 'Deliver us from evil.' He estimated that it was just over a mile away from the cathedral, but seven streets and a bridge had to be negotiated before he would be safe. He returned to the Lady Chapel and his knees. Adam checked his watch. It was too early to leave St Peter's so he remained head in hands for another thirty minutes, going over the route again and again. He watched a party of tourists as they were conducted through the cathedral. His eyes never left them as they began to move nearer and nearer to the great door at the west end of the aisle. He needed to time it to perfection.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Suddenly Adam rose and walked quickly down the side aisle reaching the porch only a yard behind the party of tourists. They shielded him out on to the square. Adam ducked under a shop awning at the side of the road, then walked round three sides of the square to avoid the one policeman on duty by the north corner. He crossed the first road as the light turned red and</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">headed up a one-way street. He kept on the inside of the pavement, knowing he had to turn left at the end of the road. Two uniformed policemen came round the corner and walked straight towards him. He jumped into the first shop without looking and turned his back on the pavement.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Bonjour, monsieur,&quot; </I>said a young lady to Adam. <I>&quot;Vous desirez quelque chose?&quot; </I>Adam looked around him. Lissome mannequins in knickers and bras with suspenders and long black nylon stockings stood all around him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm looking for a present for my wife.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The girl smiled. &quot;Perhaps a slip?&quot; she suggested.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Adam, &quot;definitely a slip. Do you have one in burgundy?&quot; he asked, as he half turned to watch the policemen stroll past.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, I think so, but I'll have to check in the stockroom.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam had reached the next street corner long before she had returned with 'just the thing'.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He managed the next few minutes walk without incident and with only two hundred yards to go could already feel his heart thumping as if it was trying to escape from his body. On the final corner there was only one policeman in sight, and he seemed intent on directing traffic. Adam kept his back to the officer as he could now see the garden square that had only shown up on the map as a tiny green blob. On the far side of the road he spotted a Union Jack hanging above a blue door.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Never run the last few yards, especially when it's open ground, his sergeant had told him many times when on patrol in the Malayan jungle.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">aimlessly up the road but Adam suspected that was only because there were several consulates standing adjacent to one another. He watched the officer carefully. It took the man two minutes to reach the end before he turned and continued his leisurely walk back. Adam ducked behind a tree in the corner of the little park and selected another tree on the far side of the road only yards from the Consulate front door that would shield him from the oncoming policeman. He estimated that by walking at a speed that wouldn't attract attention he could cover the last thirty yards in under ten seconds. He waited for the policeman to reach his farthest point.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He checked the Consulate door again, relieved to see a girl go in and a man carrying a briefcase come out on to the street. There seemed to be no guard in sight as the door remained half open. He looked up at the bay window on the first floor. He could see two men staring out at the park as if waiting expectantly for someone to arrive. Lawrence had succeeded. In moments he would be safe. Adam pulled up the collar of his trenchcoat and set off as the cathedral clock behind him struck eleven. The policeman was now a few paces from reaching his farthest point but still walking in the opposite direction. Adam crossed the road at a measured stride. When he reached the centre of the row he had to stop suddenly to let a car pass by. The policeman turned to start his journey back.</FONT><BR>

<P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Leaving Number 10 behind him, Sir Morris marched quickly into the Foreign Office courtyard and within moments was stepping out of the lift on the seventh floor. When he walked into his office, Tessa, his secretary, was laying out some papers for him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I want a D4 assembled immediately,&quot; he said to the woman who had served him so loyally for fourteen years. &quot;And ask Commander Busch to join the team.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Tessa raised her eyebrows but Sir Morris ignored her silent comment as he knew he couldn't hope to get to the bottom of this one without the co-operation of the Americans.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As Romanov moved towards him, Adam took a pace backwards from the tramlines to allow the tramcar to pass between them. When the tram had passed Adam was no longer to be seen. Romanov snarled at such an amateur trick, sprinted the twenty yards necessary to catch up with the tram and to the astonishment of the passengers, leapt on. He began checking over the faces row by row.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam waited for the tramcar to travel another twenty yards before he emerged from behind a tree on the far side of the road. He felt confident he could reach the safety of the Consulate door long before Heidi's killer could hope to return. He checked the other side of the road and swore under his breath. The policeman patrolling was now only a few paces from the Consulate and heading relentlessly towards it. Adam looked back at the tram which had just been passed by another heading towards him. To his dismay, he saw his adversary leap from one platform to the other with the agility of a top-class gymnast. With the policeman now only yards from the Consulate door Adam was left with no choice but to retreat and sprint back up the one-way street. After fifty yards he glanced over his shoulder. The man he knew only as Rosen-baum couldn't have looked less like a helpless old man as he started running towards him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam jumped between the cars and buses and dodged around the milling pedestrians as he tried to lengthen the fifty yards' distance between them. At the first crossroad he saw a plump lady coming out of a phone box a few yards away. He changed direction quickly and leapt into the empty box, crouching into the far corner. The door slowly squelched shut. Rosen-baum came hurtling round the corner and was twenty yards past the box before he realised that Adam had</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">shot back out and down the road in the opposite direction. Adam knew he had at least five seconds before Rosenbaum could hope to see which direction he had chosen. One and two and three and four and five, he counted as he ran along the road. He then checked right, before mounting three steps and pushing through some swing doors. He found himself in front of a small counter, behind which sat a young woman holding a small wad of tickets.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Deux francs, monsieur,&quot; </I>said the girl. Adam looked at the little box, quickly took out two francs and made his way down the long dark passage and through another set of swing doors. He stood at the back waiting for his eyes to become accustomed to the dark. It was the first performance of the day and the cinema was nearly empty. Adam chose a seat on the end of a row that was an equal distance from both exits.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He stared at the screen, thankful that the movie had just begun, because he needed some time to formulate a plan. Whenever the screen was bright enough he checked the little red road on the map, and then using the top of his thumb as a one-inch ruler, he was able to estimate that the nearest border into France was only eight miles away at Ferney-Voltaire. From there he could travel to Paris via Dijon and be back home almost as quickly as it would take him to sit through <I>Exodus </I>a second time. Having decided on his route, the next problem for Adam was how to travel. He dismissed all forms of public transport and settled on hiring a car. He remained in his seat during the interval to double-check the routes. The moment Paul Newman reappeared on the screen, he folded up the map and left the cinema by the exit which had been least used during the past four hours.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When Sir Morris entered the room for the meeting of the 'Northern Department', he found the rest of the D4 were already assembled, and familiarising themselves with the files that had been presented to them only an hour before.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He glanced round the table at the specially selected D4, all hand-picked men but only one of them did he consider his equal. And it wasn't the old war-horse Alec Snell who had served at the Foreign Office longer than any of them and was touching his moustache nervously as he waited for Sir Morris to take his seat. Next to him sat Brian Matthews, known in the Department as the 'well-balanced man': a grammar school boy with a double first and a chip on both shoulders. Opposite him was Commander Ralph Busch, the CIA representative with a short fuse, who after five years attached to the Embassy in Grosvenor Square considered himself more British than the British, and even imitated the Foreign Office style of dress to prove it. At the far end of the table, Sir Morris's second in command, who some said was a little too young, although everyone except Tessa had forgotten that Sir Morris had held his job at the same age.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The four members of the committee stopped talking once Sir Morris had settled in his seat at the head of the table.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; he began - the only lady present being Tessa, whose existence he rarely acknowledged - &quot;the Prime Minister has given this D4 his full blessing. And he requires detailed reports to be sent to him every twelve hours, wherever he is, and at any time of the night or day if there should be any unexpected development. So, as you can see, there is no time to waste. This particular D4 has co-opted as part of its team a liaison officer from the CIA, Commander Ralph</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The man seated on Sir Morris's right bowed slightly. At five feet nine inches, with broad, muscular shoulders and a neat black beard, he looked every inch the sailor whom Player's cigarettes were always trying to please. Indeed, a sailor wouldn't have been a bad guess because Busch had been a commander in PT boats during the Second World War.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;From the latest reports I have received,&quot; Sir Morris continued, opening the file in front of him, &quot;it appears that Scott never reached the Consulate this morning, despite our request for the police to have no more than a token force on duty within two hundred yards of the park.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Since our sketchy information yesterday, BEA have confirmed,&quot; said Sir Morris consulting a note in front of him, &quot;that Scott received a call from Roget et Cie while he was at the airport. After considerable pressure from our Ambassador and Interpol we have learned from Mr Roget that the purpose of Scott's visit to the bank was to pick up an unknown bequest from a Mr Emmanuel Rosenbaum. Further cheeking shows that a Mr Rosenbaum arrived in Zurich yesterday morning and travelled on to Geneva in the afternoon. He left his hotel first thing this morning and has subsequently vanished from the face of the earth. None of this would be of any great significance if Mr Rosenbaum had not boarded the aeroplane to Zurich from -&quot; Sir Morris couldn't resist a short dramatic pause &quot;- Moscow. I think it is not unreasonable therefore to assume that Mr Rosenbaum, whoever he is, works directly or indirectly for the KGB.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The KGB, as we know to our cost, is well serviced in Geneva, by a large number of East Europeans working under the guise of the United Nations for ILO and WHO, all with the necessary diplomatic status they need to carry out undercover work. What still remains a mystery to me is why Mr Rosenbaum should be willing to kill two innocent people for a relatively obscure icon. That brings my report up to date. But perhaps you have come up with something new,&quot; said Sir Morris turning to his Number Two.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Lawrence Pemberton looked up from his end of the table. &quot;Since our meeting this morning, Sir Morris,&quot; he began, &quot;I have spoken to Scott's sister, his mother and a firm of solicitors in Appleshaw who administered his father's will. It transpires that Scott was left with nothing of any real importance in the will apart from an envelope which his mother says contained a letter from Reichsmarshal Hermann Goering.&quot; There was an immediate buzz around the table until Sir Morris tapped his knuckle on the desk.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Do we have any idea of the contents of Goering's letter?&quot; asked Sir Morris.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The whole letter, no, sir. But one of our examination entrants, a Mr Nicholas Wainwright, was asked by Scott to translate what we now believe was a paragraph from the letter because later Wainwright asked the examination board if it was part of his test.&quot; Lawrence extracted a piece of paper from the file in front of him and read out the paragraph:</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's all?&quot; said Sir Morris.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm afraid so,&quot; said Lawrence, &quot;although I believe it confirms what Scott told me last night was his reason for travelling to Geneva. There is no doubt in my mind that the package he went to pick up contained the icon of St George and the Dragon left to his father by Goering.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;St George and the Dragon,&quot; said Matthews interrupting, &quot;but that's the icon that half of the KGB have been searching for during the past two weeks and my Department has been trying to find out why.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And what have you come up with?&quot; asked Sir Morris.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Very little,&quot; admitted Matthews. &quot;But we began to assume that it must be a decoy because the Tsar's icon of St George and the Dragon hangs in the Winter Palace at Leningrad and has done so for three hundred years.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Anything else?&quot; asked Sir Morris.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Only that the section leader in search of the icon is Alex Romanov,&quot; said Matthews.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Snell gave out a low whistle. &quot;Well, at least we know we're dealing with the First Division,&quot; he said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">There was a long silence before Sir Morris offered, &quot;One thing is clear. We have to get to Scott first and must assume that it's Romanov we're up against. So what are we doing about it?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;As much as we can get away with,&quot; said Lawrence. &quot;Along with the Americans we have seventeen men operatives in Geneva, all of them trying to find Scott.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Lawrence chipped back in. &quot;And it's been almost impossible to convince them that Scott is not in any way responsible for the two murders. So we may have to get him out without relying on their co-operation.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But what do you imagine would be the outcome if Romanov or this Rosenbaum, who must also be part of the KGB, manages to get to Scott before we do?&quot; asked Matthews.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A civilian up against one of the Russians' most ruthless agents. That's all we need,&quot; said Commander Busch.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Lawrence inclined his head towards the American. &quot;I've known Adam for most of my life. The irony of his particular predicament is that it was I who, without his knowledge, recommended that he should be interviewed for a place in the Northern Department. It was my intention that he should join us as soon as he had completed his course as a trainee. If Romanov or any of his cohorts come face to face with Scott they'd better remember that he was awarded a Military Gross when faced with a thousand Chinese.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But if it turned out to be Romanov,&quot; asked Snell, &quot;would Scott be able to kill him?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I would have said no before Rosenbaum murdered his girlfriend,&quot; said Lawrence.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I wouldn't be confident of his chances even then,&quot; said Busch.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Neither would I,&quot; added Matthews.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We are as mystified as you,&quot; said the American. &quot;All we can add to your current information, is that two weeks ago the Russians deposited gold bullion in New York to the value of over seven hundred million dollars without any explanation. We are, of course, not certain at the moment there is any connection.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Seven hundred million dollars?&quot; said Sir Morris. &quot;You could buy half the countries in the United Nations for that.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Lawrence undid a folder with a red band around it, the words 'Immediate Action' printed across the top in black.

With the Russians and the Swiss roaming the city like knights of the round table in search of the Holy Grail, I can only believe that someone will come across Scott fairly soon. One of our biggest problems, as I explained, is that the Swiss are unwilling to co-operate. As far as they are concerned, Scott is a common criminal on the run and should they get to him first they have made it clear they will not allow him diplomatic immunity.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We, as well as the Swiss police, and undoubtedly the Russians,&quot; continued Lawrence, &quot;have started checking out all the obvious places: hotels, guest houses, restaurants, airports, car hire companies, even lavatories, and we remain in constant touch with every one of our agents on the ground. So if Scott suddenly appears out of nowhere we should be able to go to his aid at a moment's notice.&quot; Lawrence looked up to observe that one of the team was taking down all the details. &quot;Added to that, the Post Office are intercepting every call made to Barclays DCO from Geneva. If Scott does try to get in contact with me again at the bank or at my flat it will be put through to this office automatically,&quot; he said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Is he aware that you work for the Service?&quot; asked Snell, putting a hand through his dark hair.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No. He, like my dear mother, still thinks I'm a bank official in the International Department of Barclays DCO. But it won't be long before he works out that that's only a front. Unlike my mother, he doesn't always believe everything I tell him and after our conversation last night he is bound to have become suspicious.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Do we have anything else to go on?&quot; Sir Morris asked, looking up at Lawrence.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No one will be going out to dinner tonight,&quot; said Sir Morris.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The cinema door opened on to the busy pavement and Adam slipped into the main stream of commuters who were now returning home for dinner. As he kept walking he made certain of as little head movement as possible but his eyes never stayed still, checking everything within 180 degrees. After he had covered three blocks, he spotted a red Avis sign swinging in the afternoon breeze on the far side of the road. He safely reconnoitred the crowded crossing, but once his foot touched the far pavement he froze on the spot. Just ahead of him in the fast, jostling crowd stood a man in a raincoat. He was continually looking around, while making no attempt to walk in either direction. Was he one of Rosenbaum's men, the police, or even British? There was no way of telling whose side he was on. Adam's eyes didn't leave the man as he took out an intercom and, putting it to his mouth, whispered into it. &quot;Nothing to report, sir. Still no sign of our man, and I haven't seen any of the KGB either.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam, unable to hear the words, switched into a side road and almost knocked over a boy selling papers. <I>'Le soldat anglais toujours a Geneve' </I>the headline blared.

He started to move away as a large, empty touring coach drew up and parked in front of the block. Smart blue lettering along the side of the coach proclaimed 'The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra'. Adam watched as some musicians walked out of the front door and climbed on to the coach carrying their instrument cases of assorted lengths and widths. One was even lugging a large kettle drum which he deposited in the boot of the coach. As the musicians continued to stream out of the hotel Adam decided he wouldn't get a better opportunity. When the next group came through the double doors he walked quickly forward and stepped into the middle of them before anyone could have spotted him. He then continued on past them through the open hotel door. The first thing he spotted in the crowded lobby was a double bass leaning against the wall. He glanced at the label around the neck of the unwieldy case. 'Robin Beresford.'</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam walked over to the counter and gestured to the clerk. &quot;I need my room key quickly - I've left my bow upstairs and now I'm holding everyone up.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, sir. What room number?&quot; asked the clerk.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I think it's 312, or was that yesterday?&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Beresford - Robin Beresford.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Adam. As he left the counter, he turned to check that the receptionist was already dealing with another customer. He walked smartly over to the lift which was disgorging still more musicians. Once it had emptied he stepped in, pressed the button for the sixth floor, and waited. He felt</FONT><BR>

When the doors opened again he was relieved to find there was no one standing in the corridor. He made his way quickly along the passage to room 612.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As he turned the key and opened the door he said firmly in as good a French accent as he could manage, &quot;Room service&quot;, but as no one responded, he stepped in and locked the door behind him. An unopened suitcase had been left in one corner. Adam checked the label. Obviously Mr Beresford hadn't even had time to unpack. Adam checked the room, but there was no other sign of the hotel guest apart from a piece of paper on the side table. It was a typed itinerary:</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">'European Tour: Geneva, Frankfurt, Berlin, Amsterdam, London.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam looked at his watch: by the time Robin Beresford had completed the 'Unfinished Symphony' he would be over the border; but he still felt safe to remain in Room 612 until it was dark.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He picked up the phone by the bed and dialled room service. &quot;Beresford, 612,&quot; he announced, and ordered himself some dinner before going into the bathroom. On the side of the basin was propped a little plastic bag with the words 'Compliments of the Management' printed across it. Inside Adam found soap, a tiny toothbrush, toothpaste and a plastic razor.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He handed Adam a slip of paper. He signed it 'Robin Beresford' and added a fifteen per cent tip.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said the waiter and left. As soon as the door closed behind him Adam's eyes settled on the feast of onion soup, rump steak with green beans and potatoes, and finally a raspberry sorbet. A bottle of house wine had been uncorked and needed only to be poured. He suddenly didn't feel that hungry.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He still couldn't accept what he had gone through. If only he hadn't pressed Heidi into joining him on this unnecessary journey. A week before she hadn't even known him and now he was responsible for her death. He would have to explain to her parents what had happened to their only daughter. But before Adam could face them he still had to come up with some explanation for the things he hadn't yet begun to understand. Not least the unimportant icon. Unimportant?</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">After he had half finished the meal he wheeled the trolley out into the cprridor and placed the 'Do not disturb' sign on the door. Once back in the bedroom he stared out of the window over the city. The sun looked as if it had another hour allocated for Geneva. Adam lay down on thetoed and began to consider what had happened in the last twenty-four hours of his life.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Antarctic is in possession of an icon of St George and the Dragon. But we know from our files of that period that that particular icon was destroyed when the Grand Duke of Hesse's plane crashed over Belgium in 1937.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But Stalin confirmed at Yalta that the icon and its contents had been destroyed in the plane crash. He agreed to make no protest while he was not in possession of the original document. After all, that was the reason Roosevelt appeared to be gaining so little at the time while Stalin was getting so much in return. Can't you remember the fuss Churchill made?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I certainly can because he had worked out that it wasn't Britain who was going to benefit from such a decision.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But if the Russians have now discovered the existence of the original icon?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You are suggesting they might also get their hands on the original document?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Precisely. So you must be sure to get to Antarctic before the Russians do, or for that matter, the Foreign Office.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But I'm part of the Foreign Office team.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam woke with a start. Looking down at him was a girl who held a double bass firmly by the neck with one hand and a bow in the other. She was nearly six foot and certainly weighed considerably more than Adam. She had long, gleaming red hair that was in such contrast to the rest of her that it was as if the Maker had started at the top and quickly lost interest.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Who are you?&quot; asked Adam, startled.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm not Goldilocks, that's for sure,&quot; parried the girl. &quot;More to the point, who are you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam hesitated. &quot;If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I can't imagine why not,&quot; she said. &quot;You don't look like Prince Charles or Elvis Presley to me, so go on, try me.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm Adam Scott.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Am I meant to swoon and run to your side, or scream and run away?&quot; she enquired.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam suddenly realised that the girl couldn't have watched television or read a paper for at least two days. He switched tactics. &quot;I thought my friend Robin Beresford was meant to be booked into this room,&quot; he said confidently.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And so did I until I saw you on my bed.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You're Robin Beresford?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's not my fault my father wanted a boy,&quot; she said. &quot;And you still haven't explained what you're doing on my bed.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Is there any hope of you listening to me for five minutes without continually interrupting?&quot; asked Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, but don't bother with any more fairy stories,&quot; said Robin. &quot;My father was a born liar, and by the time I was twelve I could see through him like a pane of glass.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I should have a seat if I were you,&quot; said Adam. &quot;This may take longer than the average double bass accompaniment.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov stood in the Ambassador's office and rested his fingers on the table. &quot;I blame myself,&quot; he said very quietly, &quot;even more than I blame any of you. I underestimated the Englishman. He's good, and if any of you are hoping to kill him before I get to him you'll have to be <I>very </I>good.&quot; No one assembled in the Ambassador's office that night was disposed to disagree with the Comrade Major. Romanov paused to study the group of men who had been flown in from several Eastern satellites at short notice. All with long records of service to the State but only one of them, Valchek, was known to Romanov personally and he worked too closely with Zaborski to be trusted. Romanov had already faced the fact that only a few of them were acquainted with Geneva. He could only pray that the British and Americans were suffering from the same problem'.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">His eyes swept around the room. The Swiss police had the best chance of finding Scott and they weren't being at all helpful, he thought ruefully.

Satisfied, he continued, &quot;We will therefore maintain a tight surveillance over Geneva in case Scott is still holed up somewhere in the city. My own guess is that, like all amateurs, he is, and will wait until it's dark, perhaps even first light, before he makes a run for the nearest border. The French border will be his most obvious choice. Despite going to war against the Germans twice in the past fifty years, the English have never bothered to master the German language, although a few of them can manage to speak passable French. So he's more likely to feel safe in that country. It also offers him the opportunity to cross only one border before reaching the coast.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;If he's stupid enough to try and leave by plane he will find we have the airports covered; if by train, we have the stations manned. But my guess is still that he will try to escape by motor vehicle.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I shall therefore take five men to the French border with me while Major Valchek will take another five to Basle to cover the German crossing point. The rest of you will remain on surveillance in Geneva. Those of you who have just arrived will relieve those agents who are in the field already. And don't expect Scott to be roaming around looking like a tourist on holiday. Study your picture of the Englishman carefully and even be prepared for him to try and get away with some amateur disguise.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam jumped off the bed and pulled out the package containing the Tsar's icon from the map pocket of his trenchcoat. Robin put her double bass up against the wall and leaving the bow propped against it, lowered herself into the only chair in the room.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam handed the icon over to her. For some time, she stared at the face of St George without making any comment. &quot;It's magnificent,&quot; she said at last. &quot;And I can understand anyone wanting to possess it. But no painting could be worth the tragedy and trouble you've had to go through.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I agree it's inexplicable,&quot; said Adam. &quot;But Rosen-baum or whatever his real name is has been willing to kill twice to get his hands on the piece, and he's already convinced me that as long as I am in possession of the icon then I'll be the next in line.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That proves it was once owned by a Tsar, according to the man from Sotheby's. And greatly enhances its value, he assured me.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Still couldn't be worth killing for,&quot; said Robin. She handed the icon back to Adam. &quot;So what other secret is St George keeping to himself?&quot;</FONT><BR>

I felt sure that between Rosenbaum and his men and the Swiss police they would have had all the airports and stations fully covered.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No doubt Rosenbaum will have also thought that much out as well, if he's half as good as you claim,&quot; said Robin. &quot;So we'd better try and get in touch with your friend Lawrence and see if he's come up with any bright ideas.&quot; She pushed herself up out of the chair and walked across to the phone.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You don't have to get yourself involved,&quot; said Adam hesitantly.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I am involved,&quot; said Robin. &quot;And I can tell you it's far more exciting than Schubert's Unfinished. Once I've got your friend on the line I'll pass him over to you and then no one will realise who's phoning.&quot; Adam told her the number of the flat and she asked the girl on the switchboard to connect her.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam checked his watch: eleven forty. Surely Lawrence would be home by now? The phone didn't complete its first two rings before Robin heard a man's voice on the line. She immediately handed the receiver over.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Hello, who is that?&quot; asked the voice. Adam was reminded how strange he always found it that Lawrence never announced his name.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Lawrence, it's me.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where are you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm still in Geneva.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My clients were waiting for you at eleven o'clock this morning.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So was Rosenbaum.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Who is Rosenbaum?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A six-foot, fair-haired, blue-eyed monster, who seems determined to kill me.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Lawrence did not speak for some time. &quot;And are you still in possession of our patron saint?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, I am,&quot; said Adam. &quot;But what can be so important about ...&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Put the phone down and ring me back again in three minutes.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The line went dead. Adam couldn't fathom the sudden change in his old friend's manner. What had he missed during those months he had lodged with him? He tried to recall details that he had previously considered unimportant and that Lawrence had so skilfully disguised.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Is everything all right?&quot; asked Robin, breaking into his thoughts. _</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I think so,&quot; said Adam, a little mystified. &quot;He wants me to ring back in three minutes. Will that be all right with you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;This tour's already lost eight thousand pounds of the taxpayers' money, so what difference can a few international calls make?&quot; she said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Three minutes later, Robin picked up the receiver and repeated the number. In one ring Lawrence was back on the line.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Only answer my questions,&quot; said Lawrence.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, I will not answer your questions,&quot; said Adam, becoming increasingly annoyed with Lawrence's manner. &quot;I want one or two of my own answered before you get anything more out of me. Do I make myself clear?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes,&quot; said a more gentle sounding Lawrence.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Who is Rosenbaum?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Lawrence didn't immediately reply.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You'll get nothing further from me until you start telling the truth,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;From your description I have every reason to believe Rosenbaum is a Russian agent whose real name is Alex Romanov.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A Russian agent? But why should a Russian agent want to get his hands on my icon?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I don't know,&quot; said Lawrence. &quot;We were rather hoping you might be able to tell us.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Who's we?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Another long silence.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Who's we?&quot; repeated Adam. &quot;You can't really expect me to go on believing you work for Barclays DCO.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I work at the Foreign Office,&quot; said Lawrence.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;In what capacity?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I am not at liberty ...&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Stop being so pompous, Lawrence. In what capacity?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm the Number Two in a small section that deals in . . .&quot; Lawrence hesitated.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Espionage I think is the current jargon we laymen are using,&quot; said Adam, &quot;and if you want my icon that badly you had better get me out of this mess alive because Romanov is willing to kill for it as I am sure you are aware.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where are you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The Richemond Hotel.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;In a public phone box?&quot; asked Lawrence, sounding incredulous.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, in a private room.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But not registered in your name?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, in the name of a friend. A girlfriend.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Is she with you now?&quot; asked Lawrence.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Damn,&quot; said Lawrence. &quot;Right. Don't leave that room until seven a.m., then phone on this number again. That will give me enough time to get everything in place.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Is that the best you can do?&quot; said Adam, but the phone had already gone dead. &quot;It looks as if I'm stuck with you for the night,&quot; he told Robin as he replaced the phone.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;On the contrary, it is I who am stuck with you,&quot; said Robin, and disappeared into the bathroom. Adam paced around the room several times before he tested the sofa. Either he had to rest his head on a cushion, balanced on the thin wooden arm, or he had to let his legs dangle over the far end. By the time Robin had come back out clad in a pair of sky-blue pyjamas he had selected the floor as his resting place.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not much of a chair, is it?&quot; said Robin. &quot;But then British Intelligence didn't warn me to book a double room.&quot; She climbed into the bed and turned out the light. &quot;Very comfortable,&quot; were the last words she uttered.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam lay down flat on the bedroom floor, using the cushion from the chair as a pillow and a hotel dressing gown as a blanket. He slept intermittently, his mind switching between why the icon could be that important, how Lawrence knew so much about it, and, most immediate, how the hell were they going to get him out of the hotel alive?</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov waited patiently for the phone to be picked up.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes,&quot; said a voice that he recognised immediately.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where is he?&quot; were the only words Romanov uttered. Four words were all he received from Mentor in reply before the phone went dead.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam woke with a start an hour before he was due to phone Lawrence back. For nearly forty minutes he lay on the floor with only Robin's steady breathing to remind him he was not alone. Suddenly he became aware of a strange sound coming from the corridor outside - two or three steps, a pause, then whoosh, two or three steps, a pause, another whoosh. Adam raised himself up silently from the floor and crept to the door. The rhythm of Robin's breathing never faltered. Whoosh: it now sounded closer. He picked up a heavy wooden coathanger from the table by the door. He gripped it firmly in his right hand, raised it above his head and waited. Whoosh - and a newspaper shot under the door and the steps moved on. He didn't have to bend down to see that it was his photograph that</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam took the paper into the bathroom, closed the door silently, switched on the light and read the lead article. It was yesterday's story with guarded comments from his old commanding officer and embarrassed silence from his mother. He felt helpless.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He crept up to Robin hoping she wouldn't wake. He stood over her but she didn't stir. He silently picked up the phone and dragged it to the bathroom. He could only just manage to close the door behind him. He dialled the operator and repeated the number.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When the ringing stopped, he immediately said, &quot;Is that you, Lawrence?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes,&quot; came back the reply.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Things have become much worse now. I'm still-holed up in the hotel but my picture is on the front page of every paper.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I know,&quot; said Lawrence. &quot;We tried to prevent it, but yet again the Swiss wouldn't co-operate.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then I may as well give myself up to the Swiss,&quot; said Adam. &quot;Damn it all, I am innocent.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, Adam, in Switzerland you're guilty until proven innocent and you must have worked out by now that you're involved in something far more important than a double murder.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What could be more important than a double murder when the rest of the world thinks you're the murderer?&quot; asked Adam angrily.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I can understand exactly how you feel, but your only chance now is to carry out my instructions to the letter and treat with suspicion every other person with whom you come in contact.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm listening,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Just remember everything I say because I am only going to tell you once. The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra are staying in the same hotel as you. They are going on to Frankfurt at ten o'clock this morning. Leave your room at five to ten, join the orchestra in the lobby and then make your way to the front door where you'll find their coach parked. We will have a car waiting for you on the far side of the road. The car is a black Mercedes and you will see a man in grey chauffeur's uniform holding the door open for you. We have already arranged that no other car will be able to park on that side of the road between nine thirty and ten thirty, so you can't mistake it. Just get into the back and wait. There will be another man in the back with you and you will then be driven to the safety of our Consulate. Do you need me to repeat any of that?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No,&quot; said Adam, &quot;but...&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good luck,&quot; said Lawrence, and the phone went dead.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">By seven-thirty he had showered, while Robin remained unrepentant in a deep sleep. Adam envied her; only a twig had to break outside and he was wide awake. Two years of living in the Malayan jungle, never knowing when the Chinese would strike, never being able to sleep for more than two or three hours at a time if one wanted to stay alive, still kept its hold on him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Robin did not stir for another thirty minutes, during which time Adam sat on the sofa and went over Lawrence's plan in his mind. At ten to eight she finally woke, even then taking several minutes before she was fully conscious. Robin blinked at Adam and a large grin appeared on her face.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So you didn't murder me while I slept,&quot; she said.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;When your father is an habitual drunk and comes home at all hours of the night, you learn to sleep through anything,&quot; she explained, placing both feet firmly on the carpet. &quot;Aren't you meant to have phoned London by now?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I already have.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And what is the master plan to be?&quot; she asked, rubbing her eyes on her way to the bathroom.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I will be leaving with you,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Most of my one-night stands don't bother to stay that long,&quot; she remarked as she closed the bathroom door behind her. He tried to read the paper while the bath was filling up.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Does that mean we're sharing a room in Frankfurt as well?&quot; she asked a few minutes later when the bathroom door reopened, as if the conversation had never been interrupted.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, as soon as we're clear of the hotel I leave you at the coach and make my own way to a car on the far side of the road.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That sounds more like the men in my life,&quot; she said. &quot;But at least we can have a farewell breakfast,&quot; she added, picking up the phone. &quot;I'm nuts about kippers. How about you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam didn't answer. He had begun looking at his watch every few moments. The waiter arrived with breakfast about fifteen minutes later: Adam waited in the bathroom. When he reappeared he showed no interest in the food, so Robin ate four kippers and most of the toast. Nine o'clock passed; a porter took away the breakfast trolley and Robin began to pack. The phone rang and Adam jumped nervously as Robin picked it up.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, Stephen,&quot; she said. &quot;No, I won't need any help with my luggage. Not this time.&quot; She put the phone down. &quot;We depart for Frankfurt at ten.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I know,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We ought to make Lawrence the orchestra manager. He seems to know everything even before it's been decided.&quot; Adam had been thinking the same thing. &quot;Well, at least I've found someone to help with my luggage for a change,&quot; added Robin.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'll carry the double bass for you if you like,&quot; offered Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'd like to see you try,&quot; said Robin. Adam walked over to the large instrument that was propped up in its case against the wall. He tried the double bass from all angles but couldn't manage to do better than hold it off the floor for a few moments. Robin joined him and with one flick she had the stem on her shoulder and the instrument balanced perfectly. She walked up and down the bedroom demonstrating her prowess.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's a matter of skill, my puny friend,&quot; she said. &quot;And to think I believed all those stories last night about your outrunning half the Swiss police force to spend a night with me.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam tried to laugh. He picked up his trenchcoat, checking the icon was zipped up. But he couldn't stop himself shaking from a combination of fear and anticipation.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Robin looked at him. &quot;Don't worry,&quot; she said gently. &quot;It will all be over in a few minutes' time.&quot; Then she saw the paper on the floor. &quot;I should sue them if I were you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why?&quot; asked Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You're a lot better looking than that.&quot; Adam smiled and walked across, and just managed to get his arms round her to give her a hug.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You're sounding more like one of my lovers all the time,&quot; said Robin, mournfully.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam picked up her suitcase while Robin jerked up the stem of the double bass onto her shoulder. She opened the door and checked the corridor: two of her colleagues from the RPO were waiting by the lift, otherwise there was nobody else in sight. Robin and Adam joined the two musicians and after &quot;Good mornings&quot; no one spoke until the lift doors slid open. Once the doors were closed Robin's colleagues couldn't resist taking a closer look at Adam. At first Adam was anxious they had recognised him from the newspaper. Then he realised that it was who Robin had spent the night with that fascinated them. Robin gave him a lewd wink, as if she fully intended to live off this one for a long time. For his part Adam ducked behind the double bass and remained in the corner breathing deeply in and out as the lift trundled down towards the ground floor. The doors sprang open and Robin waited for her two colleagues to leave before she shielded Adam as best she could all the way across the foyer. His eyes were now fixed on the front door. He could see the bus taking up most of the road and several members of the orchestra were already clambering on. One more minute and he should be safely away. He watched as the drums were packed carefully in the large boot.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh, God, I forgot,&quot; said Robin. &quot;I'm meant to put this in the boot at the back of the bus.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Do it later,&quot; said Adam sharply. &quot;Just keep going until you reach the coach door.&quot; Then'he saw the car on the far side of the road. He felt light with relief, almost dizzy. The car door was being held open for</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">him. Another man was seated in the back just as Lawrence had promised. Ten o'clock struck somewhere in the distance. The man dressed in chauffeur's uniform, hat pulled down over his forehead, stood by the open door. He turned towards the hotel in anticipation. Adam stared towards him as the man's eyes scanned the hotel entrance. The uniform wasn't a good fit.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Into the bus,&quot; hissed Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;With this thing? They'll kill me,&quot; said Robin.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;If you don't, he'll kill me.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Robin obeyed, despite the adverse comments as she lumbered down the aisle with her double bass screening Adam from the gaze of anyone on the far side of the road. He wanted to be sick.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam slumped into a seat next to Robin with the double bass between them.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Which one?&quot; she whispered.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;In the chauffeur's uniform.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Robin glanced out of the window. &quot;He may be evil, but he's damned good looking,&quot; she said, inconsequentially.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam looked disbelieving. Robin smiled apologetically.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Everybody's in,&quot; called a man from the front of the bus, &quot;and I've double-checked and we seem to have one extra.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Oh, my God, thought Adam, he's going to throw me off the bus.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My brother,&quot; shouted Robin from the back. &quot;He's only travelling with us for part of the journey.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh, that's okay then,&quot; said the manager. &quot;Well, let's be on our way.&quot; He turned to the driver.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I didn't realise you had a brother,&quot; said the manager, who was suddenly standing beside them. The coach moved slowly out of the square.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Neither did I until this morning,&quot; mumbled Robin, still looking out of the window. She turned and faced her boss. &quot;Yes, I forgot to mention to you that he might be in Switzerland at the same time as the orchestra. I do hope it's not going to cause a problem.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not at all,&quot; said the manager.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Adam, this is Stephen Grieg who, as you will already have gathered, is the orchestra's manager.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Are you a musician as well?&quot; asked Stephen as he shook Adam's hand.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, I can truthfully say that I have never been able to master any instrument,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He's tone deaf,&quot; butted in Robin. &quot;Takes after my father. He's in tyres, actually,&quot; she continued, enjoying herself.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh, really. Which company are you with?&quot; enquired Stephen.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm with Pirelli,&quot; said Adam, mentioning the first tyre company that came into his head.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Pirelli, the company that produces those fabulous calendars?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What's so special about their calendars?&quot; asked Robin innocently. &quot;If you want one I'm sure Adam can get you one.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh, that would be great,&quot; said Stephen. &quot;I hope it won't put you to too much trouble.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No trouble at all,&quot; said Robin, leaning over Adam conspiratorially. &quot;Actually, to let you in on a little family secret there is a rumour at HQ that Adam will</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How impressive,&quot; said the manager, taking a closer look at the orchestra's latest recruit.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where shall I send the calendar?&quot; bleated out Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh, direct to the RPO. No need to tell you the address, is there?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;In a brown envelope, no doubt,&quot; said Robin. &quot;And don't worry about the year. It's not the dates that he gets worked up about.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What time are we expecting to reach Frankfurt, Stephen?&quot; shouted a voice from the front. &quot;Must leave you now,&quot; said the manager. &quot;Thanks for the promise of a calendar. Robin's right, of course - any year will do.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Who taught you to spin a yarn like that?&quot; asked Adam, as soon as he was out of earshot.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My father,&quot; said Robin. &quot;You should have heard him at his best. In a class of his own. The problem was my mother still believed every word.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He would have been proud of you today.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Now we've found out what you do for a living,&quot; said Robin, &quot;may we learn what's next on the agenda for the youngest director of Pirelli?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam smiled. &quot;I've started trying to reason like Rosenbaum, and I think he'll stay in Geneva for at least an hour, two at the most, so with luck I'll get a fifty-mile start on him.&quot; He unfolded the map across the two seats.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">His finger ran along the road the bus was travelling on, and it was Robin who spoke first.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That means you could make Zurich airport before he has any chance of catching up with you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Adam, &quot;but that would be too much</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">of a risk. Whoever Rosenbaum is,&quot; he went on, abiding by Lawrence's request to be cautious by not letting Robin into his secret, &quot;we now know for certain that he has a professional organisation behind him so I must expect the airports to be the first place he will have covered. And don't forget the Swiss police are still on the lookout for me as well.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So why don't you come on to Frankfurt with us?&quot; asked Robin. &quot;I can't believe you'll have any trouble from Stephen.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I've thought about that already but discounted it also as too great a risk,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Because, when Rosenbaum has had time to think about it,&quot; said Adam, &quot;the one thing he'll remember is this bus. Once he's found out the direction we're heading in he's sure to come after us.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Robin's eyes returned to the map. &quot;So you'll need to decide where and when to get off.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Exactly,&quot; whispered Adam. &quot;I can risk sixty to seventy miles, but not a lot further.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Robin's finger ran along the little road. &quot;About here,&quot; she said, her finger stopping on a little town called Solothurn.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Looks about the right distance.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But once you're off the bus what will you do for transport?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I've little choice but to walk or thumb lifts - unless I pinch another car.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;With your luck, Rosenbaum will be the one person who stops to pick you up.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, I've thought about that as well,&quot; said Adam. &quot;I would have to find a long stretch of road where I can see without being seen for about one hundred</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They taught you a trick or two in the army, didn't they?&quot; said Robin. &quot;But how do you intend to cross the frontier with your passport?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's one of the many problems I haven't yet come up with a solution for.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;If you decide to stay with us,&quot; said Robin, &quot;it wouldn't be a problem.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why?&quot; asked Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Because whenever we cross a border they only count the number of people on the bus and the number of passports, and as long as they tally the customs officials don't bother to check everyone individually. After all, why should they? The RPO is not exactly an unknown quantity. All I would have to do is add your passport to the bundle and mention it to the manager.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's a clever idea but it's not on. If Rosenbaum caught up with me while I'm still on this bus then I would be left with no escape route.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Robin was silent for a moment. &quot;Once you're on your own will you contact Lawrence again?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes. I've got to let him know what happened this morning, because whoever he's dealing with must have a direct line to Rosenbaum.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Could it be Lawrence himself?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Never,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Your loyalty is touching,&quot; said Robin, turning to look at him, &quot;but what you actually mean is you don't want to believe it could be Lawrence.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What are you getting at?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Like my mother didn't want to believe that my father was a liar and a drunk. So she turned a blind eye to his little foibles. You know even when he dropped</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam thought about his relationship with Lawrence and wondered if you could know someone for twenty years and really not know them at all.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Just be wary how much you let him know,&quot; advised Robin.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">They sat in silence as Adam checked the map and went over all the different possible routes he could take once he had left the bus. He decided to aim for the German border and take the long route back to England, from Hamburg or Bremerhaven, rather than the shorter, more obvious route via Calais or Ostend.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Got it,&quot; said Robin suddenly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Got what?&quot; said Adam, looking up from the map.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How we solve your passport problem,&quot; she murmured.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam glanced at her hopefully. &quot;If you let me have your passport,&quot; she explained, &quot;I'll substitute it for the member of the orchestra who most resembles you. No one will notice anything strange at our end until we're back home in Britain on Sunday night.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not a bad idea, if there is anyone who remotely resembles me.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We'll have to see what we can do,&quot; said Robin. She sat bolt upright, her eyes moving slowly from person to person. By the time she had scanned all those in the bus from front to back, a small smile appeared on her face. &quot;There are two of our lot who bear a passable resemblance to you. One is about five years older and the other is four inches shorter, but you go on working out the safest way of escape while I carry out some research. Let me have your passport,&quot; she said. Adam handed it over and then watched Robin walk up to the front and sit next to the manager. He</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I need to check something in my passport,&quot; Robin broke in. &quot;Sorry to bother you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No bother. You'll find them all under my seat in a plastic bag,&quot; he said, and continued his conversation with the driver.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Robin bent down and started to shuffle through the passports as if searching for her own. She picked out the two she had considered as possible substitutes and compared the photographs. The shorter man's photo looked nothing like Adam. The older man's was at least five years out of date but could have passed for Adam as long as the officials didn't study the date of birth too carefully. She bundled up the passports, placing Adam's in the middle. She then put them back in the plastic bag and returned the bag under the manager's seat.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Robin made her way back to her seat. &quot;Take a look at yourself,&quot; she said, slipping the passport over to Adam. He studied the photo.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Other than the moustache, not a bad likeness, and it's certainly my best chance in the circumstances. But what will happen when you return to London and they find out my passport has been substituted?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You'll be back in England long before us,&quot; said Robin. &quot;So put this one in an envelope with the calendar and send it direct to the RPO in Wigmore Street, Wl, and I'll see that they return yours.&quot; Adam vowed to himself that if he ever got back to London, he would become a life subscriber to the Friends of the Royal Philharmonic.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That seems to have solved one of your problems.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;For the moment at least,&quot; said Adam. &quot;I only wish I could take you with me for the rest of the trip.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Robin smiled. &quot;Frankfurt, Berlin, Amsterdam-just in case you get bored. I wouldn't mind meeting up with Rosenbaum. But this time face to face.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He might just have met his match,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Can I have a last look at the icon?&quot; Robin asked, ignoring the comment.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam bent down to retrieve his trenchcoat and slipped the painting out of his map pocket, careful to shield it from anyone else's view. Robin stared into the eyes of St George before she spoke again. &quot;When I lay awake last night waiting for you to ravish me, I passed the time trying to fathom out what secret the icon held.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I thought you were asleep,&quot; said Adam smiling. &quot;When all along we were both doing the same thing. Anyway, did you come up with any worthwhile conclusions?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;First, I decided your taste was for male double bass players,&quot; said Robin, &quot;or how else could you have resisted me?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But what about St George and the Dragon?&quot; asked Adam, grinning.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;To begin with I wondered if the little pieces of mosaic made up a code. But the picture is so magnificently executed that the code would have to have been worked out afterwards. And that didn't seem credible.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good thinking, Batman.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, you're Batman. So I wondered if there was another painting underneath. I remembered from my schooldays that Rembrandt and Constable often painted on the top of their paintings, either because they didn't care for their original effort or because, in the case of Rembrandt, he couldn't afford another canvas.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;If that were the answer only an expert could have</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">carried out the task of removing every piece of paint.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Agreed,&quot; said Robin. &quot;So I dismissed that as well. My third idea was that the crown on the back&quot; - she turned the icon over and stared at the little piece of silver embedded in the wood - &quot;indicates as your expert suggested that this is the original by Rublev and not a copy as you have been led to believe.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I had already considered that,&quot; said Adam, &quot;during my sleepless night and although it would place a far higher value on the work, it is still not enough to explain why Rosenbaum would kill indiscriminately for it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Perhaps someone else needs St George every bit as much as Rosenbaum does,&quot; said Robin.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But who and why?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Because it's not the icon they're after, but something else. Something hidden in or behind the paint-ing.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That was the first thing I checked,&quot; said Adam smugly. &quot;And I'm convinced that it's a solid piece of wood.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I don't agree with you,&quot; said Robin as she began tapping the wood all over like a doctor examining someone's chest. &quot;I've worked with instruments all my life, watched them being made, played with them, even slept with them, and this icon is not solid right through, though God knows how I can prove it. If something is hidden inside it was never intended to be discovered by laymen like ourselves.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Quite an imaginative little thing, aren't you?&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Comes naturally,&quot; she said as she handed the icon back to Adam. &quot;Do let me know if you ever discover what is inside,&quot; she added.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Goodbye, baby brother,&quot; said Robin. &quot;Give my love to mother if you see her before I do.&quot; She smiled and waved at him as the door swung closed and the coach returned to the highway to continue its journey on to Frankfurt.</FONT><BR>

The 'President' was all they had said and he had wondered if he should believe it. Certainly they had got him out of bed in the middle of the night and escorted him silently to the Pentagon. They wanted Brunweld's expert opinion, they had assured him. Could it be possible? After Cuba and Dallas he'd begun to believe anything was possible.</FONT><BR>

Ah, yes — in all sorts of trouble.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Once Romanov was back in the Consulate Valchek handed him a large envelope which he was informed had just arrived in the diplomatic pouch from Moscow.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov read over the decoded telex a second time, still unable to fathom its possible significance.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Information has come to light concerning the late Colonel Gerald Scott, DSO, QBE, MC, that may prove useful when you make contact with your quarry. Full documentation will be with you by morning, latest, Al.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov wondered what headquarters had discovered about Scott's father that could possibly prove of interest to him. It was still his avowed intention that the son would be despatched to join the father long before any further missive from Moscow had arrived.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov thought of his own father and the escape route he had made possible by leaving such a fortune, and how for the sake of advancement he had betrayed him to the State. Now, for the sake of further advancement he had to kill Scott and bring home the icon. If he failed . . . He dismissed both fathers.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Either he's very clever or he's living on an amateur's luck,&quot; Romanov said, moving into the small office that had been made available for his use. Valchek who followed him did not comment other than to ask what he should do next.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Tell me what you saw when we were at the hotel.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Valchek.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Don't ask questions,&quot; said Romanov, changing back into his own clothes, &quot;answer them. Tell me everything you remember seeing, from the moment we drew up outside the hotel.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, no, no. Be more specific. Don't just generalise. For instance, do you remember anything unusual taking place while we were waiting?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nothing in particular,&quot; said Valchek. &quot;People continually entering and leaving the hotel - but I'm sure Scott wasn't among them.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You are fortunate to be so certain. What happened next?&quot; asked Romanov.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What time was that?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It must have been about seven minutes past ten. I remember because I checked my watch when that coach left.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, the one that was being loaded up with musical instruments. It left about. . .&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Instruments, that's it,&quot; said Romanov. &quot;Now I remember what was worrying me. Cellos, violins, and a double bass that didn't go into the boot.&quot; Valchek looked puzzled but said nothing. &quot;Ring the hotel immediately and find out who was on that bus and where they are heading.&quot; Valchek scurried away.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov checked his watch: ten fifty-five. We are going to have to move, and move quickly. He pressed the intercom by the side of the phone. &quot;I want a fast car, and more important, a superb driver.&quot; Valchek returned as Romanov replaced the receiver. &quot;The bus was hired by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, who are on a European tour ...&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He strolled away from the village, having checked everything with a professional <SUP>c</SUP>oldier's eye. The main street was deserted but for a little boy who relentlessly kicked a plastic football into a gap in the hillside which he was using as a goal. The boy turned when he saw Adam and kicked the ball towards him. Adam kicked it back and the boy took it in his arms, a wide smile appearing on his face. The smile disappeared as he watched Adam continue quickly up the hill. There were only a few old houses on the main road. On one side was a dangerous ravine with tree-covered hills rising in the distance, while on the other side stretched green fields in which cows, bells round their necks, munched happily away. It made Adam feel hungry.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He went further up the road until he came to a sharp bend in the hill. Standing on the corner he could see down the hill for about half a mile without being seen. He tested the feasibility of his plan for several minutes and soon became expert at picking out British cars or cars with British number plates as far as two or three hundred yards away. It didn't take long to work out how few foreigners bought British.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">During the next twenty minutes he thumbed optimistically at seven cars with English number plates heading towards Lausanne, but they all ignored him. He had forgotten just how easy it had been for him when he was a cadet in uniform. In those days almost everyone would stop. He checked his watch: he could only risk it for a few more minutes. Three more cars refused to pull up and when a fourth slowed down it only sped away again as Adam ran towards it.</FONT><BR>

The moment they were on the highway, with full lights blazing and the driver's hand almost lodged on the horn, the speedometer rarely fell below 130 kilometres an hour. &quot;We must beat them to the border,&quot; he kept repeating as he thumped his fist on the leather dashboard. After they had covered one hundred kilometres in fifty-five minutes, the three men began watching ahead of them for the coach, but it was another thirty kilometres before Valchek was able to point ahead and shout, &quot;That must be them, about a kilometre up the hill.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Force them off the road,&quot; said Romanov, his eyes never leaving the bus. The Embassy driver swung out to overtake and once he was in front immediately cut across, forcing the coach driver to throw on his brakes and swerve into the side. Valchek waved dictatorially at the coach driver to slow down and the man stopped the vehicle just off the road on the edge of the mountain.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Don't either of you speak. Just leave everything to me,&quot; said Romanov, &quot;and remain near the driver in case there's trouble.&quot; Romanov jumped out of the car and ran towards the coach, his eyes already searching for anyone who might be attempting to leave it. He banged on the door impatiently until the driver pressed a knob and the big doors swung open. Romanov leapt on, with the other two following only paces behind. He took out his passport from an inside pocket, flashed it in the frightened driver's face and shouted, &quot;Who's in charge here?&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I am,&quot; piped up a voice from the back. Romanov marched down the bus and saw the double bass case and then everything fitted into place. It always worried him when something was out of context. Yes, that was what hadn't rung true. Why hadn't she put the double bass in the boot with all the other large instruments? He stared down at the heavy-framed woman who now sat behind the monstrous instrument.</FONT><BR>

When he reached the front he waved at Val-chek and the chauffeur, indicating that they should leave the coach. Reluctantly they obeyed him.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not clever, sir, I'm afraid,&quot; began Lawrence. &quot;Two of our most experienced agents were selected to pick up Scott at the Richmond Hotel as planned and then take him to the safety of the British Consulate.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We've also drawn a blank on that,&quot; said Lawrence.

But he wasn't on it when we were waiting for them at the border. The orchestra is due at their Frankfurt hotel in about one hour so we will be able to find out more then. The German police are being far more co-operative,&quot; Lawrence added.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So Scott could be anywhere by now?&quot; said Matthews. &quot;Do you think he's still in Switzerland, or managed to cross one of the borders?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Agreed,&quot; said Lawrence, &quot;and we have men stationed at the airport checking every flight out to the East.

His hands were cut and bleeding in several places, his trousers torn and smeared with clay and earth.

But Romanov would never forget the girl with the man's name.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Solothurn was about forty kilometres back in the direction they had already travelled, and the driver could have completed the journey in about twenty minutes had Romanov not insisted on slowing down as they passed every vehicle that travelled towards them. They checked the occupants of each vehicle on the other side of the road, just in case Scott had managed to thumb a lift. It was a necessary precaution in Romanov's judgment, but it meant a total time of thirty-one minutes before they arrived back in Solothurn. At least Romanov felt confident Scott wasn't heading for the German border - unless he had been very well disguised or travelled in the boot of a car.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As soon as they reached Solothurn Romanov instructed the driver to leave the car in the middle of the town while they split up to see if they could discover any clues as to the route Scott might have taken.

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Nein, nein&quot; </I>cried the little boy who followed after them. Romanov looked back to see the boy was standing on the spot where Adam had been thumbing lifts, pointing out over the ravine.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov quickly turned to the driver. &quot;Get the car, I need the glasses and the map.&quot; The driver ran back down the hill once again followed by the boy. A few minutes later the Mercedes drew up by Romanov's side. The driver jumped out and handed the glasses over to Romanov, while Valchek spread a map out on the car bonnet.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov focused the binoculars and began to sweep the hills in the distance. It was several minutes before the glasses stopped and settled upon a brown speck climbing up the farthest hill.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The rifle,&quot; were Romanov's only words.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">wooden skeleton stock and checked that it was loaded. He then raised it, moved it around until it felt comfortable nestled in his shoulder and swept the ground in front of him until he too focused on Scott. Romanov followed Adam's relentless stride with the binoculars. Valchek's arm moved with him, keeping the same pace. &quot;Kill him,&quot; said Romanov. Valchek was grateful for the clear windless day as he kept the rifle sight in the middle of the Englishman's back, waited for three more strides, then slowly squeezed the trigger. Adam had almost reached the top of the ridge when the bullet tore through him. He fell to the ground with a thud. Romanov smiled and lowered the glasses.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam knew exactly what had ripped through his shoulder and where the shot must have come from. He instinctively rolled over until he reached the nearest tree. And then the pain began. Although the bullet had lost a lot of its power at such a distance, it still stung like an adder's bite, and blood was already beginning to seep through his trenchcoat from the torn muscle. He turned his head and gazed back behind him. He could see no one but he knew Romanov must be standing there waiting to take a second shot.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Turning with difficulty, he looked back up towards the edge of the hill. Only thirty yards to the safety of the ridge, but he would have to run over the top, remaining exposed for several vital seconds. Even if he made it Romanov would still be able to reach him by car within thirty minutes.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Nevertheless, that was his one chance. Slowly, very slowly, he crawled inch by inch up the ridge, thankful for the tree that he could still use as protection. One arm followed one leg, like a beached crab. Once he had covered ten yards he knew the angle would be against him and Romanov would have a flat, slow-</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">You can't hold a rifle up on your shoulder for ever, Adam thought. He counted to two hundred slowly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I suspect he's going to make a run for it,&quot; Romanov told Valchek as he raised the glasses, &quot;which will give you about three seconds. I'll shout the moment he moves.&quot; Romanov kept the glasses trained on the tree. Suddenly Adam jumped up and sprinted as though it were the last twenty metres of an Olympic final. Romanov shouted &quot;Now&quot; and Valchek pulled the rifle up into his shoulder, focused on the moving man and squeezed the trigger as Adam threw himself over the ridge. The second bullet whistled by the side of Adam's head.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov cursed, as he stared through the binoculars, knowing that Valchek had missed. He turned to the open map. The others joined him around the car as he began to consider the alternatives. &quot;He should reach that road in about ten minutes,&quot; he said, putting his finger in the middle of a small red line that ran between Neuchatel and the French border. &quot;Unless the first bullet hit him, in which case it could take him longer. So how long will it take you to get to that border?&quot; Romanov asked the driver.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The chauffeur studied the map. &quot;About twenty-five, at most thirty minutes, Comrade Major,&quot; came back the reply.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov turned and looked back towards the hills. &quot;Thirty minutes, Scott, that's how long you've got to live.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When the car sped away, the little boy ran home as fast as he could. He quickly told his mother everything he had seen. She smiled understandingly. Only children always had such vivid imaginations.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When Adam looked up, he was relieved to see the road was only about a mile away. He jogged towards it at a steady pace, but found that the running caused him even more discomfort. He was anxious to stop and check the wound but waited till he reached the road. The bullet had torn through the outer flesh of his shoulder muscle leaving him in considerable pain. An inch lower and he would have been unable to move. He was relieved to see that the blood had only made a small stain on his trenchcoat. He folded a handkerchief in four and placed it between his shirt and the wound. He knew he daren't risk a hospital. As long as he could get to a pharmacy by nightfall, he felt he could take care of the problem himself.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam checked the map. He was now only a few kilometres from the French border, and decided, because of the wound, to cross into France as quickly as possible rather than keep to his original plan of going up through Basle and on to Bremerhaven.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Desperately he began to thumb at any car that passed, no longer bothering with the nationality of the number plates. He felt he was safe for about twenty minutes but after that he would have to disappear back into the hills. Unfortunately there were far fewer cars driving towards the French border than there had been on the Basle road, and they all ignored his plea. He feared that the time was fast approaching for him to return to the hills when a yellow Citroen drew into the side of the road a few yards ahead of him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">By the time Adam had reached the car the woman in the passenger seat had already wound down the window.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where - are - you - going?&quot; asked Adam, pronouncing each word slowly and carefully.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The driver leant across, took a lengthy look at Adam and said in a broad Yorkshire accent, &quot;We're on our way to Dijon. Any use to you, lad?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, please,&quot; said Adam, relieved that his scruffy appearance had not put them off.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then jump in the back with my daughter.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam obeyed. The Citroen moved off, as Adam checked out of the back window; he was relieved to see an empty road stretching out behind him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Jim Hardcastle's the name,&quot; said the man, as he moved the car into third gear. Jim appeared to have a large, warm smile perpetually imprinted on his chubby red face. His dark ginger hair went straight back and was plastered down with Brylcreem. He wore a Harris tweed jacket and an open-necked shirt that revealed a little red triangle of hair. It looked to Adam as if he had given up attempts to do anything about his waistline. &quot;And this is the wife, Betty,&quot; he said, gesturing with his elbow towards the woman in the front seat. She turned towards Adam, revealing the same ruddy cheeks and warm smile. Her hair was dyed blonde but the roots remained an obstinate black. &quot;And sitting next to you is our Linda,&quot; Jim Hardcastle added, almost as an afterthought. &quot;Just left school and going to work for the local council, aren't you, Linda?&quot; Linda nodded sulkily. Adam stared at the young girl whose first experiment with make-up hadn't worked that well. The dark over-lined eye shadow and the pink lipstick did not help what Adam considered was an attractive girl probably in her late teens. &quot;And what's your name, lad?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Dudley Hulme,&quot; said Adam, recalling the name on his new passport. &quot;And are you on holiday?&quot; he asked, trying to keep his mind off the throbbing shoulder.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Mixing business with pleasure,&quot; said Jim. &quot;But this part of the trip is rather special for Betty and myself. We flew to Genoa on Saturday and hired the car to tour Italy, First we travelled up through the Simplon Pass. It's a bit breathtaking after our home town of Hull.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam would have asked for details, but Jim didn't reckon on any interruptions. &quot;I'm in mustard, you see. Export director for Colman's, and we're on our way to the annual conference of the IMF. You may have heard of us.&quot; Adam nodded knowingly. &quot;International Mustard Federation,&quot; Jim added. Adam wanted to laugh, but because of the pain in his shoulder, managed to keep a straight face.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;This year they've elected me President of the IMF, the high point of my career in mustard, you might say. And, if I may be so bold as to suggest, an honour for Colman's as well, the finest mustard in the world,&quot; he added, as if he said it at least a hundred times a day. &quot;As President I have to preside over the conference meetings and chair the annual dinner. Tonight I shall be making a speech of welcome to delegates from all over the world.&quot;.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How fascinating,&quot; winced Adam, as the car went over a pothole.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It certainly is,&quot; said Jim. &quot;People have no idea how many makes of mustards there are.&quot; He paused for a second and then said, &quot;One hundred and forty-three. There's no doubt the Frogs make one or two good attempts and even the Krauts don't do too badly, but there's still nothing to beat Colman's. British is best after all, I always say. Probably the same in your line of country,&quot; said Jim. &quot;By the way, what is your line of country?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm in the army,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Can I speak to you in confidence?&quot; asked Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Mum's the word,&quot; said Jim. &quot;We Hardcastles know how to keep our traps shut.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">In the case of Jim's wife and daughter, Adam had no proof to the contrary.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm a captain in the Royal Wessex, at present on a NATO exercise,&quot; began Adam. &quot;I was dumped off the coast at Brindisi in Italy last Sunday with a false passport and ten English pounds. I have to be back in barracks at Aldershot by midnight Saturday.&quot; When he saw the look of approbation appear on Jim's face, he felt even Robin would have been proud of him. Mrs Hardcastle turned around to take a more careful look at him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I knew you were an officer the moment you opened your mouth,&quot; said Jim. &quot;You couldn't have fooled me. I was a sergeant in the Royal Army Service Corps in the last war myself. Doesn't sound much, but I did my bit for the old country.&quot; The acronym for the Corps -'Rob All Serving Comrades' - flashed through Adam's mind. &quot;Have you seen any action yourself, Dudley?&quot; Jim was asking.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A little in Malaya,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I missed that one,&quot; said Jim. &quot;After the big one was over, I went back into mustard. So where's the problem in getting you back to England?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;There are about eight of us trying to reach Alder-shot, and a thousand Americans trying to stop us.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The Swiss,&quot; said Jim. &quot;They're even worse than the Americans. They don't even join in a war - happy to fleece both sides at the same time. They won't pick you up, lad, believe me. I'll see to that.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;If you can get me across the border, Mr Hardcastle, I'm confident I will be able to make it all the way back to Aldershot.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;About twenty, Comrade Major,&quot; said the driver.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then we should still make the French border?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Perhaps it might be safer to stop and fill up,&quot; suggested the driver.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;There is no time for safety,&quot; said Romanov. &quot;Go faster.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, Comrade Major,&quot; said the driver, who decided it was not the occasion to point out they would run out of petrol even more quickly if he was made to push the car to its limits.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why didn't you fill the tank up this morning, you fool?&quot; said Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I thought I was only taking the Consul to lunch at the town hall today, and I had intended to fill the tank up during my lunch hour.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Just pray for your sake that we reach the border,&quot; said Romanov. &quot;Faster.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">minutes later a smile grew on his face as they passed the five-kilometre sign, and then suddenly the engine spluttered as it tried helplessly to continue turning over at the speed the pressed-down accelerator was demanding. The indicator on the speedometer started to drop steadily as the engine continued to chug. The driver turned off the ignition and threw the gear lever into neutral. The sheer momentum of the heavy Mercedes took them another kilometre before the car slowed to a complete stop.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov did not even look at the driver as he jumped out of the car and began running the last three kilometres towards the border.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I've come up with an idea,&quot; said Jim, as they passed a signpost warning drivers that the border was only two kilometres away.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What's that, sir?&quot; asked Adam, who could now feel his shoulder beating like a steady tune hammered out by a child on a tin drum.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;When it comes to the time for us to present our passports, you put your arm round Linda and start cuddling her. Leave the rest to me.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mrs Hardcastle turned round and gave Adam a much closer look as Linda went scarlet. Adam looked across at the mini-skirted pink-lipped Linda and felt embarrassed by the predicament her father had placed his daughter in. &quot;Don't argue with me, Dudley,&quot; continued Jim confidently. &quot;I promise you what I have in mind will work.&quot; Adam made no comment and neither did Linda. When they reached the Swiss border a few moments later, Adam could see that there were two checkpoints about one hundred yards apart. Drivers were avoiding one line of traffic in which a row was going on between a customs official and an irate lorry</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Why did you choose this line? Adam wanted to ask.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I chose this line,&quot; continued Jim, &quot;because by the time it comes for our passports to be inspected I reckon the customs officer will be only too happy to allow us through without much fuss.&quot; As if in reaction to his logic, a long queue started to form behind Jim, but still the argument raged in front of them. Adam remained alert, continually looking out of the back window, waiting for the moment when Romanov would appear. When he turned back, he was relieved to find that the lorry in front of them was being told to pull over into the side and wait.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Jim drove quickly up to the customs post. &quot;Get necking, you two,&quot; he said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Up until that point Adam had kept his hands hidden in his trenchcoat pocket because they were so scratched and bruised. But he obeyed Jim and took Linda in his arms and kissed her perfunctorily, one eye still open watching for Romanov. To his surprise she parted his lips and began exploring inside his mouth with her tongue. Adam thought about protesting but realised there was no way he could make it sound gallant or credible.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The wife, the daughter and the future son-in-law,&quot; said Jim, handing over the four passports.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The customs man started to check.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What was all the trouble about, officer?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nothing for you to worry about,&quot; said the official, flicking through the passports. &quot;I hope it hasn't inconvenienced you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, no,&quot; said Jim. &quot;They didn't even notice,&quot; he said, pointing over his shoulder and laughing.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sharp as mustard Jim, that's what they call me back in Hull.&quot; He looked over his shoulder towards ,Adam. &quot;You can stop that now, Dudley, thank you.&quot; Adam felt Linda release him with some reluctance.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">She glanced at him shyly, then turned towards her father. &quot;But we still have to go over the French border, don't we?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We have already been alerted to look out for him and I can assure you he hasn't been through this post,&quot; said the senior customs officer. &quot;Otherwise one of my men would have spotted him. But if you want to double-check, be my guest.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov went quickly from officer to officer showing them the blown-up photograph of Adam, but none of them could recall anyone resembling him. Valchek joined him a few minutes later and confirmed that Scott was not in any of the cars still waiting to be allowed over the border and that the Mercedes was being pushed into the border garage.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Is it back to the hills, Comrade Major?&quot; asked Valchek.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not yet. I want to be absolutely certain he hasn't managed to cross the border.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The senior official emerged from his post in the centre of the road. &quot;Any luck?&quot; he asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No,&quot; said Romanov glumly. &quot;You seem to be right.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I thought as much. If any of my men had let the Englishman through they would have been looking for a new job by now.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov nodded in acknowledgment. &quot;Could I have missed any of your staff?&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Doubt it - unless there's a couple of them taking a break. If so you'll find them in the bar about a hundred metres up towards the French border point.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Four customs officers and a French waitress were the only people to be found in the bar. Two of the officers were playing pool while the other two sat at a corner table, drinking coffee. Romanov took the photo out once more and showed it to the two men at the pool table. They both shook their heads in an uninterested fashion and returned to potting the multi-coloured balls.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The two Russians made their way to the bar. Val-chek passed Romanov a cup of coffee and a sandwich, which he took over to the table where the other two border guards sat. One of them was telling his colleague the trouble he had had with a French lorry driver who was trying to smuggle Swiss watches over the border. Romanov pushed the photograph of Scott across the table.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Have you seen this man today?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Neither showed any sign of recognition and the younger one quickly returned to his story. Romanov sipped his coffee, and began to consider whether he should make a run for Basle or call for reinforcements to sweep the hills. Then he noticed that the young man's eyes kept returning to the photo. He asked once again if he had seen Scott.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, no,&quot; said the young officer, a little too quickly. In Moscow Romanov would have had a 'yes' out of him within minutes, but he would have to follow a more gentle approach here.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How long ago?&quot; Romanov asked quietly.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked the policeman.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How long ago?&quot; repeated Romanov in a firmer voice.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It wasn't him,&quot; said the officer, sweat now appearing on his forehead.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;If it wasn't him, how long ago wasn't it him?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The officer hesitated. &quot;Twenty minutes, maybe thirty.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What make of vehicle?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The young officer hesitated. &quot;A Citroen, I think. &quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Colour?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yellow.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Other passengers?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Three. Looked like a family. Mother, father, daughter. He was in the back with the daughter. The father said they were engaged.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov had no more questions.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Jim Hardcastle managed to keep a one-sided conversation going for over an hour.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Naturally,&quot; he said, &quot;the IMF holds its annual conference in a different city every year. Last year it was in Denver in Colorado, and next year it'll be at Perth in Australia, so I manage to get around a bit. But as the export man you have to get used to a lot of travel.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm sure you do,&quot; said Adam, trying to concentrate on his benefactor's words while his shoulder throbbed on.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm only President for a year, of course,&quot; continued Jim. &quot;But I have plans to ensure that my fellow delegates won't forget 1966 in a hurry.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm sure they won't,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I shall point out to them that Colman's has had another record year on the export side.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How impressive.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, but I must admit that most of our profits are left on the side of the plate,&quot; he said, laughing.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">260</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam laughed as well but sensed that Mrs Hard-castle and Linda might have heard the line before.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I've been thinking, Dudley, and I'm sure the wife would agree with me, that it would be most acceptable to us if you felt able to join the presidential table for dinner tonight — as my guest, of course.&quot; Mrs Hardcastle nodded, as did Linda with enthusiasm.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I can think of nothing that would give me greater pleasure,&quot; said Adam. &quot;But I fear my commanding officer might not be quite as delighted to hear I had stopped on the way back to England to take in a party. I do hope you'll understand.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;If he is anything like my old CO I certainly do,&quot; said Jim. &quot;Still, if you should ever be Hull way, look us up.&quot; He took a card out of his top pocket and passed it over his shoulder.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam studied the embossed letters and wondered what 'MIFT stood for. He didn't ask.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where in Dijon would you like to be dropped off?&quot; asked Jim as he drove into the outskirts of the town.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Anywhere near the centre that's convenient for you,&quot; replied Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Just holler when it suits you then,&quot; said Jim. &quot;Of course, I always maintain that a meal without mustard . . .&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Can you drop me on the next corner?&quot; said Adam suddenly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh,&quot; said Jim, sad to be losing such a good listener. And he reluctantly drew the car up alongside the kerb.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam kissed Linda on the cheek before getting out of the back. He then shook hands with Mr and Mrs Hardcastle.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nice to have made your acquaintance,&quot; said Jim. &quot;If you change your mind you'll find us at the hotel ... Is that blood on your shoulder, lad?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Just a graze from a fall - nothing to worry about. Wouldn't want the Americans to think they'd got the better of me.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, no, of course not,&quot; said Jim. &quot;Well, good luck.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As the car moved off Adam stood on the pavement watching them disappear. He smiled and tried to wave, then turning, he walked quickly down a side street looking for a shopping precinct. Within moments he was in the centre of town, relieved to find that all the shops were still open. He began to search up and down the street for a green cross above a door. Adam hadto walk only fifty yards before he spotted one. He entered the shop tentatively and checked the shelves.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A tall man with short fair hair, wearing a long leather coat, stood in the corner with his back to the entrance. Adam froze. Then the man turned round, frowning at the packet of tablets he wanted to purchase, while at the same time rubbing his thick Gallic moustache.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam walked up to the counter.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Do you speak English, by any chance?&quot; he asked the dispenser, trying to sound confident.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Passable, I hope,&quot; came back the reply.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I need some iodine, cotton wool, a bandage and heavy Elastoplast. I fell and bruised my shoulder on a rock,&quot; Adam explained.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The dispenser quickly put the order together without showing much interest.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;This is what you require but you will find that the trade names are different,&quot; explained the dispenser. &quot;That will be twenty-three francs,&quot; he added.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Will Swiss do?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Certainly.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Is there a hotel anywhere nearby?&quot; asked Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Around the next corner, on the other side of the square.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">262</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam thanked him, handed over the Swiss notes, and then left the pharmacy in search of the hotel. The Hotel Frantel was, as promised, only a short distance away. He walked across the square and up the steps into the hotel to find several people were waiting at reception to be booked in. Adam swung his trenchcoat over his' blood-stained shoulder and walked past them as he checked the signs on the wall. He then strode across the entrance hall as though he were a guest of several days' standing. He followed the sign he had been looking for which took him down a flight of stairs, to come head on with three further signs. The first had the silhouette of a man on the door, the second a woman, the third a wheelchair.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He opened the third tentatively and was surprised to find behind it nothing more than a sizeable square room with a high-seated lavatory against the wall. Adam locked himself in and let his trenchcoat fall to the ground.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He rested for a few minutes before slowly stripping to the waist. He then ran a basinful of warm water.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam was thankful for the endless first-aid seminars every officer had to go through, never believing they would serve any purpose. Twenty minutes later the pain had subsided and he even felt comfortable.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He picked up his coat with his right hand and tried to throw it back over his shoulder. The very movement caused the icon to fall out of the map pocket and onto the tiled floor. As it hit the ground, the sound made Adam fear that it might have broken in half. He stared down anxiously and then fell to his knees.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The icon had split open like a book.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">263</FONT><BR>
</P>
 <P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="5"><B>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</B></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When Adam returned to the Hotel Frantel an hour later few guests would have recognised the man who had crept in earlier that afternoon.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He wore a new shirt, trousers, tie and a double-breasted blazer that wouldn't be fashionable in Britain for at least another year. Even the raincoat had been ditched because the icon fitted snugly into the blazer pocket. He considered the shop had probably given him a poor exchange rate for his traveller's cheques but that was not what had been occupying his mind for the past hour.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He booked himself into a single room in the name of Dudley Hulme and a few minutes later took the lift to the third floor.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Lawrence picked the phone up even before Adam heard the second ring.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's me,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where are you?&quot; were Lawrence's first words.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'll ask the questions,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I can understand how you feel,&quot; said Lawrence, &quot;but . . .&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No buts. You must be aware by now that someone on your so-called team has a direct line to the Russians because it was Romanov and his friends who were</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">waiting for me outside the hotel in Geneva, not your lot.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We realise that now,&quot; said Lawrence.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We?&quot; said Adam. &quot;Who are we? Because I'm finding it rather hard to work out who's on my side.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You don't believe that ...&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;When you get your girlfriend murdered, chased across Europe by professional killers, shot at and . . .&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Shot at?&quot; said Lawrence.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, your friend Romanov took a shot at me today, hit me in the shoulder. Next time we meet I intend it to be the other way round and it won't be the shoulder.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;There won't be a next time,&quot; said Lawrence, &quot;because we'll get you out safely if you'll only let me know where you are.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The memory of Robin's words, &quot;Just be wary of how much you let him know,&quot; stopped Adam from telling Lawrence his exact location.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Adam, for God's sake, you're on your own; if you don't trust me who can you trust? I admit it looks as if we let you down. But it won't happen again.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">There was another long silence before Adam said, &quot;I'm in Dijon.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why Dijon?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Because the only person who would give me a lift was going to a mustard conference in Dijon.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Lawrence couldn't stop himself smiling. &quot;Give me your number and I'll phone you back within the hour.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No,&quot; said Adam, &quot;I'll phone <I>you </I>back in one hour.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Adam, you've got to show some trust in me.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not now that I know what it is you're all after, I can't afford to trust anybody.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam replaced the phone and stared down at the icon which lay open on the bed. It wasn't the signature</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">of Stoeckle or Seward that worried him. It was the date -June 20, 1966 - that read like a death warrant.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Goodnight, sir,&quot; said the doorkeeper as the senior civil servant left Century House that evening. &quot;Another late night for you,&quot; he added sympathetically. He acknowledged the doorman by raising his rolled umbrella a few inches. It <I>had </I>been another late night, but at least they had caught up with Scott again. He was beginning to develop quite a respect for the man. But how they failed to pick him up in Geneva still required a fuller explanation than the one Lawrence Pemberton had supplied the D4 with that afternoon.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He set off at a brisk pace towards the Old Kent Road, conspicuous in his black coat and pin-striped trousers. He tapped his umbrella nervously before hailing a passing taxi.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Dillon's bookshop, Malet Street,&quot; he told the driver, before getting in the back. Already seven thirty, but he still wouldn't be too late and a few minutes either way wasn't going to make that much difference. Pemberton had agreed to remain at his desk until all the loose ends were tied up and he was sure that nothing could go wrong this time. He allowed himself a wry smile as he thought how they had all accepted his plan. It had the double advantage of ensuring enough time for them to get their best men into position, while keeping Scott well out of sight in a deserted hideaway. He hoped that this was the last time they would expect him to come up with an original proposal.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Eight shillings, guv'nor,&quot; said the taxi-driver, as he drew up outside Dillon's. He handed over the money and added a sixpenny tip. He stood staring at the window of the university bookshop, watching the reflection of the taxi as it moved off. The moment the taxi</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">had turned the corner into Gower Street he began walking away. In moments he had reached a side road into which he turned. Ridgmount Gardens was one of those streets which even London cabbies had to think about for a few moments. He had walked only a matter of yards before he disappeared down some stone steps to a basement flat. He inserted a Yale key in the front door lock, turned it quickly, stepped inside and closed the door behind him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">During the next twenty minutes he made two telephone calls - one international, one local - and then had a bath. He emerged back on Ridgmount Gardens less than an hour later dressed in a casual brown suit, pink floral open shirt and brown brogue shoes. The parting in his hair had changed sides. He returned to Dillon's on foot and hailed another taxi.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The British Museum,&quot; he instructed the driver, as he stepped into the back. He checked his watch: nearly ten past eight. Scott would be fully briefed by now, he thought, although his associates would be already on the way back to Dijon, as his plan had allowed for a two-hour delay.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The taxi drew up outside the British Museum. He paid and walked up the twelve steps in front of the museum, admiring the Byzantine architecture as he regularly did each week, before walking back down again to hail another taxi.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Middlesex Hospital, please,&quot; was all he said. The taxi executed a U-turn and headed west.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Poor bastard. If Scott hadn't opened that envelope in the first place the icon would have ended up with its rightful owner.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Shall I drive up to the entrance?&quot; asked the cabbie.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, please.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A moment later he strolled into the hospital, checked</FONT><BR>

From the Middlesex Hospital it always took him about three minutes at a steady pace to reach Charlotte Street, where he stopped outside a house and pressed a buzzer attached to a little intercom.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Are you a member?&quot; enquired a voice suspiciously.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">On the hour Adam phoned and listened carefully to all Lawrence had to say.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'll take one more risk,&quot; said Adam, &quot;but if Romanov turns up this time I'll hand over the icon to him personally and with it a piece of property so valuable that no amount of money the Americans could offer would be sufficient to purchase it back.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When Adam put the phone down Lawrence and Sir Morris played the conversation back over again and again.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I think <I>property's </I>the key word,&quot; said Sir Morris.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Agreed,&quot; said Lawrence, &quot;but what piece of property could be that valuable to both the Russians and the Americans?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Sir Morris began slowly rotating the globe that stood by the side of his desk.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What does that buzz mean?&quot; asked Romanov. &quot;We are not running out of petrol again, are we?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, sir,&quot; said the chauffeur. &quot;It's the new calling device now fixed to all ambassadorial cars. It means they expect me to check in.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Turn round and go back to that petrol station we passed a couple of miles ago,&quot; Romanov said quietly.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">horizon. The sun was going down quickly and he feared it would be dark within the hour. They had travelled about ninety kilometres beyond Dijon and neither he nor Valchek had even seen a yellow Citroen going either way.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Fill up again while I phone Geneva,&quot; Romanov said the moment he saw the petrol station. He ran to the phone box while Valchek still kept a watchful eye on the passing traffic.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I am answering your signal,&quot; said Romanov when he was put through to the euphemistically titled Second Secretary.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We've had another call from Mentor,&quot; said the Second Secretary. &quot;How far are you from Dijon?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The member stumbled about the dimly lit room until he came across an unoccupied table wedged up against a pillar in one corner. He sat down on a little leather stool by its side. He swivelled around nervously, as he always did when waiting for someone to bring him his usual malt whisky on the rocks. When the drink was placed on the table in front of him he sipped at it, in between trying to discover if there were any new faces spread around the dark room. Not an easy task, as he refused to put on his glasses. His eyes eventually became accustomed to the dim light thrown out by the long red fluorescent bulb that stretched above the bar. All he could make out were the same old faces staring at him hopefully; but he wanted something new.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The proprietor, noticing that a regular customer had remained on his own, came out and sat opposite him on the other little stool. The member never could get himself to look the man in the eyes.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I've got someone who's very keen to meet you,&quot; whispered the proprietor.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Which one?&quot; he asked, looking up once more to check the faces at the bar.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Leaning on the juke box in the corner. The tall, slim one. And he's young,&quot; added the proprietor. He looked towards the blaring machine. A pleasing new face smiled at him. He smiled nervously back.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Was I right?&quot; asked the proprietor.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Is he safe?&quot; was all he asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No trouble with this one. Upper-class lad, right out of a top-drawer public school. Just wants to earn a bit of pocket money on the side.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Fine.&quot; The member took a sip of whisky.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The proprietor walked over to the juke box. The member watched him talking to the young man. The boy downed his drink, hesitated for a moment, then strolled across the crowded floor to take the empty stool.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My name is Piers,&quot; the young man said.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Mine's Jeremy,&quot; the member said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A gentle name,&quot; said Piers. &quot;I've always liked the name Jeremy.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Would you care for a drink?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A dry Martini, please,&quot; said Piers.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The member ordered a dry Martini and another malt whisky. The waiter hurried away. &quot;I haven't seen you here before.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, it's only my second time,&quot; said Piers. &quot;I used to work in Soho, but it's got to be so rough lately, you_ never know who you might end up with.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The drinks arrived and the member took a quick gulp.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Would you like to dance?&quot; asked Piers.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's an emergency,&quot; the voice said. &quot;Is the tape on?&quot; &quot;I'm listening.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Antarctic is in Dijon and he's discovered what's in the icon.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And did he give them any clue?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, all he told Pemberton was that he was in possession of a piece of property so valuable that no amount of money we could offer would be sufficient to purchase it back.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Indeed,&quot; said the voice.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The British think the important word is property,&quot; said the caller.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They're wrong,&quot; said the voice on the other end of the line. &quot;It's purchase.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How can you be so sure?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Because the Russian Ambassador in Washington has requested a meeting with the Secretary of State on June 20 and he's bringing with him a bullion order to the value of 712 million dollars in gold.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So where does that leave us?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;On our way to Dijon so that we can be sure to lay our hands on that icon before the British or the Russians. The Russians obviously feel confident that it will soon be in their possession, so my bet is that they must already be on the way.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But I've already agreed to go along with the British plan.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Try not to forget which side you're on, Commander.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, sir. But what are we going to do about Antarctic if we get our hands on the icon?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's only the icon we're after. Once that's in our possession, Antarctic is expendable.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam checked his watch: a few minutes after seven.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">It was time for him to leave because he had decided not to carry out Lawrence's instructions to the letter.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>He </I>intended to be waiting for <I>them, </I>and not as Lawrence had planned. He locked the bedroom door and returned to reception where he paid for the use of the room and the telephone calls he had made.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you,&quot; he said to the receptionist, and turned to leave.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Dudley.&quot; Adam fro/e on the spot.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Dudley,&quot; the voice boomed again. &quot;I almost didn't recognise you. Did you change your mind?&quot; A hand thumped him on the shoulder — at least it wasn't the left shoulder, he thought - as he stared down at Jim Hardcastle.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No,&quot; said Adam, wishing he possessed the guile of Robin's father. &quot;I think I was spotted in town so I had to get a change of clothes and keep out of sight for a few hours.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then why don't you come to the mustard dinner?&quot; said Jim. &quot;No one will see you there.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Wish I were able to,&quot; said Adam, &quot;but I can't afford to lose any more time.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Anything I can do to help?&quot; said Jim conspira-torially.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, I've got to get to ... I have a rendezvous just outside the town in less than an hour.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Wish I could take you there myself,&quot; said Jim. &quot;Do anything to help an old soldier, but I'm a bit stuck tonight - of all nights.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Don't give it a second thought, Jim, I'll be all right.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I could always take him, Dad,&quot; said Linda, who had slipped up by her father's side and was listening intently.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">They both turned towards Linda who was wearing a tight-fitting black crepe dress that started as low and ended as high as it dared while her freshly washed hair</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You've only just got your licence, lass. Don't be daft.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You always treat me like a child when there's something worthwhile to do,&quot; came back her immediate response.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Jim hesitated. &quot;How far is this rendezvous?&quot; he asked apprehensively.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;About five, maybe six miles,&quot; said Adam, &quot;but I'll be fine. I can get a taxi easily.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The lass is right,&quot; said Jim, and taking his car keys out of his pocket, he turned to her and added, &quot;but if you ever let on to your mother I'll kill you.&quot; Jim took Adam by the hand and shook it furiously.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But I'll be just fine . . .&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I won't hear of it, lad. Never forget, that in the end we're both on the same side, and good luck.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; said Adam reluctantly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Jim beamed. &quot;You'd better be getting along, lass, before your mother shows up.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Linda happily took Adam by the hand and led him away to the car park.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Which direction?&quot; she asked, once they were seated in the car.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The Auxerre road,&quot; said Adam, looking down at the piece of paper on which he had written the directions Lawrence had read over the phone to him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Linda set off at a slow pace, seeming at first to be unsure of the car, but once they had reached the outskirts of the town Adam suggested that she might go a little faster.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm very nervous,&quot; she said, as she put her hand on Adam's knee.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, I can tell you are,&quot; said Adam, crossing his</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">legs quickly. &quot;Don't miss the turning,&quot; he added when he noticed a signpost pointing to the left.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Linda swung down off the main road on to a country lane while Adam kept his eyes peeled for the building Lawrence had described. It was another two miles before it came into sight.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Draw into the side,&quot; said Adam, &quot;and turn the lights off.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;At last,&quot; said Linda, sounding more hopeful, as she brought the car to a halt.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you very much,&quot; said Adam, as he touched the door handle.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Is that all I get for risking life and limb?&quot; asked Linda.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I wouldn't want you to be late for the dinner.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That dinner will be about as exciting as a dance at the Barnsley Young Conservatives.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But your mother will be worried about you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Dudley, you're so up-tight.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I wouldn't be in normal circumstances but if you stay much longer your life could be in danger,&quot; Adam said quietly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Linda turned ashen. &quot;You're not joking, are you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I wish I was,&quot; said Adam. &quot;Now, when I get out of this car you must turn round and go back to the hotel and never mention this conversation to anyone, especially your mother.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I will,&quot; Linda said, souncung nervous for the first time.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You're a fantastic girl,&quot; said Adam, and took her in his arms and gave her the longest, warmest kiss she had ever experienced. Adam then got out of the car and watched her do a five-point turn before she headed off back in the direction of Dijon.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He checked his watch: an hour and a half still to go</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">275</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">before they were due, and by then it would be pitch dark. He jogged over to the airfield and studied the burnt-out buildings that ran alongside the road. It was exactly as Lawrence had described it. It was like a ghost town and Adam was confident that no one else could be there yet as they still wouldn't have had enough time to carry out Lawrence's plan.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Looking across the runway, Adam spotted the ideal place to hide while he waited to see which of the two plans he had prepared would prove necessary.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Flight Lieutenant Alan Banks was thankful that the moon shone so brightly that night. He had landed the little Beaver full of combat men in far worse conditions when a runway had been lit up like the Blackpool seafront.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Banks circled the perimeter of the airfield once and studied the two runways carefully. The airport had been out of action for such a long time that none of the aircraft manuals included a detailed ground plan.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The flight lieutenant was breaking every rule in the book, including piloting an unmarked aircraft informing the French that they would be landing in Paris; not easy to explain overshooting an airport by over a hundred miles.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I can make a landing on the north-south runway more easily,&quot; Banks said, turning to the SAS captain, who sat crouched in the back with his five men. &quot;How near to that hangar do you want me to go?&quot; he said, pointing out of the window.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Stay well clear, at least a couple of hundred yards,&quot; came back the reply. &quot;We still don't know what to expect.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The six SAS men continued to stare cautiously out of the side windows. They had been briefed to pick up</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">276</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">a lone Englishman called Scott who would be waiting for them, and then get out fast. It sounded easy enough but it couldn't be that easy otherwise they wouldn't have been called in.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The pilot swung the Beaver round to the south and put the nose down. He smiled when he spotted the burnt-out Spitfire that had been left derelict on the corner of the runway. Just like the ones his father used to fly during the Second World War. But this one had obviously never made it home. He descended confidently and as the little plane touched down it bounced along not because the pilot lacked experience but because the surface of the runway was so badly pitted.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Flight Lieutenant Banks brought the plane to a halt about two hundred yards from the hangar and swung the fuselage round a full circle ready for that quick getaway the captain seemed so keen to execute. He pressed the button that cut the propellers' engines and turned the lights out. The whirring slowed to an eerie whisper. They were forty-three minutes early.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam watched the new arrivals suspiciously from the cockpit of the Spitfire some four hundred yards away. He wasn't going to make a run for it across that open ground while the moon shone so brightly. His eyes never left the little unmarked plane as he waited for some clue as to who the occupants might be. He estimated it would be another fifteen minutes before the moon would be shielded by clouds. A few minutes more passed before Adam watched six men drop out of the blind side of the aircraft and lie flat on the tarmac on their stomachs. They were correctly dressed in SAS battle kit but Adam remained unconvinced while he still recalled Romanov's chauffeur's uniform. The six soldiers made no attempt to move. Neither did</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">277</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam as he was still uncertain which side they were on.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">All six men on the ground hated the moon and even more the open space. The captain checked his watch: thirty-six minutes to go. He raised his hand and they began to crawl towards the hangar where Pemberton had said Scott would be waiting, a journey which took them nearly twenty minutes, and with each movement they made they became more confident that Pember-ton's warning of an enemy waiting for them was unjustified.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">At last a mass of clouds reached the moon and a shadow was thrown across the whole airfield. The SAS captain quickly checked his watch. Five minutes to go before the rendezvous was due. He was the first to reach the door of the hangar and he pushed it open with the palm of his hand. He wriggled in through the gap. The bullet hit him in the forehead even before he had found time to raise his gun.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Move, laddies,&quot; shouted the second in command, and the other four were up in a flash, firing in an arc in front of them and running for the protection of the building.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As soon as Adam heard the Scottish brogue, he jumped out of the cockpit and sprinted across the tarmac towards the little plane whose propellers were already beginning to turn. He jumped on the wing and climbed in by the side of the surprised pilot.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm Adam Scott, the man you've come to pick up,&quot; he shouted.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm Flight Lieutenant Alan Banks, old chap,&quot; said the pilot, thrusting out his hand. Only a British officer could shake hands in such a situation, thought Adam, relieved if still terrified.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">They both turned and watched the battle.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We ought to get going,&quot; said the pilot. &quot;My orders are to see you are brought back to England in one piece.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not before we are certain none of your men can make it back to the plane.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sorry, mate. My instructions are to get you out. Their orders are to take care of themselves.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Let's at least give them another minute,&quot; Adam said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">They waited until the propellers were rotating at full speed. Suddenly the firing stopped and Adam could hear his heart thumping in his body.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We ought to get moving,&quot; said the pilot.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I know,&quot; replied Adam, &quot;but keep your eyes skinned. There's something I still need to know.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Years of night marches made it possible for Adam to see him long before the pilot.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Get going,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What?&quot; said the pilot.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Get going.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The pilot moved the joystick forward and the plane started moving slowly down the crumbling runway.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Suddenly a dark figure was running towards them firing long bursts straight at them. The pilot looked back to see a tall man whose fair hair shone in the moonlight.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Faster, man, faster,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The throttle's full out,&quot; said the pilot, as the firing began again, but this time the bullets were ripping into the fuselage. A third burst came but by then the plane was going faster than the man and Adam let out a scream of delight when it left the ground.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He looked back to see that Romanov had turned around and was now firing at someone who was not wearing an SAS uniform.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>Jeffrey Arcfar</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They couldn't hope to hit us now unless they've got a bazooka,&quot; said Flight Lieutenant Banks.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well done, well done,&quot; said Adam turning back to the pilot.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And to think my wife had wanted me to go to the cinema tonight,&quot; said the pilot laughing.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And what were you hoping to see?&quot; asked Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;My Fair Lady.&quot;</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Isn't it time for us to be going home?&quot; asked Piers, removing his hand from the member's leg.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good idea,&quot; he said. &quot;Just let me settle the bill.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And I'll pick up my coat and scarf,&quot; said Piers. &quot;Join you upstairs in a few moments?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Fine,&quot; he said. Catching the eye of the proprietor the member scribbled his signature in the air. When the 'account' appeared - a bare figure written out on a slip of paper without explanation - it was, as always, extortionate. As always, the member paid without comment. He thanked the proprietor as he left and walked up the dusty, creaky stairs to find his companion already waiting for him on the pavement. He hailed a taxi and while Piers climbed in the back he directed the cabbie to Dillon's bookshop.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not in the cab,&quot; he said, as his new friend's hand began to creep up his leg.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I can't wait,&quot; said Piers. &quot;It's way past my bedtime.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Way past my bedtime,&quot; his companion, repeated involuntarily, and checked his watch. The die must have been cast. They would have moved in by now: surely they had caught Scott this time and, more important, the . . . ?</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Four bob,&quot; said the cabbie, flicking back the glass.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He handed over five shillings and didn't wait for any change.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Just around the corner,&quot; he said, guiding Piers past the bookshop and into the little side street. They crept down the stone steps and Piers waited as he unlocked the door, switched on the lights, and led the young man in.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh, very cosy,&quot; said Piers. &quot;Very cosy indeed.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Flight Lieutenant Alan Banks stared out of his tiny window as the plane climbed steadily.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where to now?&quot; said Adam, relief flooding through his body.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I had hoped England but I'm afraid the answer is as far as I can manage.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What do you mean?&quot; said Adam anxiously.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Look at the fuel gauge,&quot; said Alan Banks, putting his forefinger on a little white indicator that was pointing halfway between a quarter full and empty. &quot;We had enough to get us back to Northolt in Middlesex until those bullets ripped into my fuel tank.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I am going to have to put her down in a field. I can't risk going on as there are no other airports anywhere nearby. Just be thankful it's a clear moonlit night.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Without warning the plane began to descend sharply. &quot;I shall try for that field over there,&quot; said the flight lieutenant, sounding remarkably blase as he pointed to a large expanse of land to the west of the aircraft. &quot;Hold on tight,&quot; he said as the plane spiralled inevitably down. The large expanse of land suddenly</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam found himself gripping the side of his seat and gritting his teeth.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Relax,&quot; said the pilot. &quot;These Beavers have landed on far worse places than this,&quot; he went on, as the wheels touched the brown earth. &quot;Damn mud. I hadn't anticipated that,&quot; he cursed as the wheels lost their grip in the soft earth and the plane suddenly nosedived forward. A few seconds passed before Adam realised he was still alive but upside down swinging from his seat belt.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What do I do next?&quot; he asked the pilot but there was no reply.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam tried to get his bearings and began to rock his body backwards and forwards until he could touch the side of the plane with one hand while gripping the joystick with his feet. Once he was able to grab the side of the fuselage he undid the belt and collapsed onto the roof of the plane.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He picked himself up, relieved to find nothing was broken. He quickly looked around but there was still no sign of the pilot. Adam clambered out of the plane, glad to feel the safety of the ground. He scrambled around for a considerable time before he found Alan Banks some thirty yards in front of the aircraft motionless on his back.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Are you all right?&quot; asked the pilot before Adam could ask the same question.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm fine, but how about you, Alan?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm OK. I must have been thrown clear of the aircraft. Just sorry about the landing, old chap, have to admit it wasn't up to scratch. We must try it again some time.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Can you walk?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, I think so,&quot; said Alan, gingerly lifting himself up. &quot;Damn,&quot; he said, &quot;it's only my ankle but it's sure going to slow me down. You'd better get going without me. That bunch back there with the arsenal can only be about thirty minutes behind us.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But what will you do?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My father landed in one of these bloody fields during the Second World War and still managed to get himself back to England without being caught by the Germans. I owe you a great debt of gratitude, Adam, because if I can get back I'll be able to shut him up once and for all. Which lot are chasing us this time, by the way?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The Russians,&quot; said Adam who was beginning to wonder if perhaps there was a second enemy.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The Russians - couldn't be better. Anything less and Dad wouldn't have accepted it as a fair comparison.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam smiled as he thought of his own father and how much he would have liked Alan Banks. He touched the icon instinctively and was relieved to find it was still in place. The pilot's words had only made him more determined to get back to England.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Which way?&quot; asked Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The pilot looked up at the Great Bear. &quot;I'll head east, seems appropriate, so you'd better go west, old fellow. Nice to have made your acquaintance,&quot; and with that he limped off.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm not sure how much longer I can last, Comrade Major.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I believe you, Comrade, but at least let me die a peaceful death on the side of the road, rather than endure the agony of this car.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov glanced across at his colleague who had been shot in the abdomen. Valchek's hands were covered in blood, and his shirt and trousers were already drenched as he tried helplessly to hold himself in. He continued to clutch on to his stomach like a child who is about to be sick. The driver had also been shot, but in the back while attempting to run away. If he hadn't died instantly, Romanov would have put the next bullet into the coward himself. But Valchek was a different matter. No one could have questioned his courage. He had first taken on the British flat on their stomachs and then the Americans charging in like the seventh cavalry. Romanov had Mentor to thank for ensuring that they had been there first. But he must now quickly warn him that someone else was also briefing the Americans. Romanov, however, felt some satisfaction in having tricked the Americans into turning their fire on the British while he and Valchek waited to pick off the survivors. The last survivor was an American who fired at Valchek continually as they were making their getaway.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov reckoned he had a clear hour before the French, British and Americans would be explaining away several bodies on a disused airfield. Romanov's thoughts returned to Valchek when he heard his comrade groan.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Let's turn off into this forest,&quot; he begged. &quot;I cannot hope to last much longer now.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Hold on, Comrade, hold on,&quot; repeated Romanov.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;To hell with the Motherland,&quot; said Valchek. &quot;Just let me die in peace.&quot; Romanov looked across again and realised that he could be stuck with a dead body within a few minutes. Despite Valchek's efforts the blood was now seeping on to the floor like a tap that wouldn't stop dripping.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov noticed a gap in the trees ahead of him. He switched his lights on to full beam and swung off the road on to a dirt track and drove as far as he could until the thicket became too dense. He switched off the headlights and ran round the car to open the door.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Valchek could only manage two or three steps before he slumped to the ground, still holding on to his intestines. Romanov bent down and helped him ease himself up against the trunk of a large tree.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Leave me to die, Comrade Major. Do not waste any more of your time on me.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov frowned.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How do you wish to die, Comrade?&quot; he asked. &quot;Slowly and in agony, or quickly and peacefully?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Leave me, Comrade. Let me die slowly, but you should go while you still have Scott in your sights.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But if the Americans were to find you, they might force you to talk.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You know better than that, Comrade.&quot; Romanov accepted the rebuke, then rose and after a moment's thought, ran back to the car.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Valchek began to pray that once the bastard had left someone might find him. He'd never wanted this assignment in the first place, but Zaborski needed two extra eyes on Romanov and Zaborski was not a man to cross. Valchek wouldn't talk, but he still wanted to live.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The bullet from the 9mm Makarov went straight through the back of Valchek's temple and blew away one side of his head. Valchek slumped to the ground and for several seconds his body trembled and spasmed, subsiding into twitches as he emptied his bowels and bladder on to the brown earth.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov stood over him until he was certain he was dead. Valchek would probably not have talked, but this was not a time for taking unnecessary risks.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When he woke the next morning he felt the same familiar guilt. Once again he swore it would be the last time. It was never as good as he had anticipated, and the regret always lingered on for several hours.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The expense of keeping up an extra flat, the taxi fares and the club bills nearly made it prohibitive. But he always returned, like a salmon to its breeding ground. &quot;A queer fish,&quot; he murmured out loud, and then groaned at his own pun.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Piers began to wake, and for the next twenty minutes he made his companion forget those regrets. After a moment of lying in exhausted silence the older man slipped out of bed, took ten pounds out of his wallet and left it on the dresser before going to run himself a bath. He anticipated that by the time he returned the boy and the money would have gone.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He soaked himself in the bath wondering about Scott. He knevy he should feel guilty about his death. A death that, like so many others before him, had been caused by his picking up a young Pole who he had thought was safe. It was now so many years ago that he couldn't even remember his name.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam lay flat on his stomach in the bottom of the empty barge. His head propped on one side, he remained alert to the slightest unfamiliar sound.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The bargee stood behind the wheel counting the three hundred Swiss francs for a second time. It was more than he could normally hope to earn in a month. A woman standing on tiptoes was eyeing the notes happily over his shoulder.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The barge progressed at a stately pace down the canal and Adam could no longer see the crashed plane.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Suddenly, far off in the distance, he heard distinctly the report of what sounded like a gunshot. Even as he listened the woman turned and scuttled down the hatch like a frightened rat. The barge ploughed its course on slowly through the night while Adam listened anxiously for any other unnatural noises, but all he could hear was the gentle splash of the water against the barge's hull. The clouds had moved on and full moon once again lit up the bank on both sides of the river. It became abundantly clear to Adam as he watched the towpath that they were not moving very fast. He could have run quicker. But even if it had cost him the remainder of his money, he was grateful to be escaping. He lowered himself again and curled up in</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Although everything appeared absolutely serene, he still remained alert. The river was far wider now than when he had first leapt on the barge.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The bargee's eyes never left him for long. He stood gripping the wheel, his oil-covered face not much cleaner than the old dungarees he wore - which looked as if they were never taken off. Occasionally he took a hand from the wheel, but only to remove the smokeless pipe from his mouth, cough, spit and put it back again.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The man smiled, took both hands off the wheel and placed them by the side of his head to indicate that Adam should sleep. But Adam shook his head. He checked his watch. Midnight had passed and he wanted to be off the barge and away long before first light.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He stood up, stretched, and wobbled a little. His shoulder, although healing slowly, still ached relentlessly. He walked up the centre of the barge and took his place next to the wheel.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;La Seine?&quot; he asked, pointing at the water.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The bargee shook his head, no. &quot;Canal de Bour-gogne,&quot; he grunted.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam then pointed in the direction they were moving. <I>&quot;Quelle'mUe?&quot;</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The bargee removed his pipe. <I>&quot;Ville? Ce n'estpas une ville, c'est Sombernon&quot; </I>he said, and put the stem back between his teeth.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You know Scott better than any of us,&quot; said Sir Morris, &quot;and you still have no feel as to where he might be now, or what he might do next, do you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, sir,&quot; admitted Lawrence. &quot;The only thing we know for certain is that he has an appointment for a medical on Monday afternoon, but somehow I don't think he'll make it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Sir Morris ignored the comment. &quot;But someone was able to get to Scott, even though we didn't call D4,&quot; he continued. &quot;That icon must hold a secret that we haven't begun to appreciate.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And if Scott is still alive,&quot; said Lawrence, &quot;nothing is going to convince him now that we're not to blame.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And if we're not, who is?&quot; asked Sir Morris. &quot;Because someone was so desperate to discover our next move that they must have taken one hell of a risk during the last twenty-four hours. Unless, of course, it was you,&quot; said Sir Morris. The Permanent Secretary rose from his desk and turned around to look out of his window on to Horse Guards Parade.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Even if it was me,&quot; said Lawrence, his eyes resting on a picture of the young Queen which stood on the corner of his master's desk, &quot;it doesn't explain how the Americans got there as well.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh, that's simple,&quot; said Sir Morris. &quot;Busch has been briefing them direct. I never doubted he would from the moment he joined us. What I hadn't anticipated was how far the Americans would go without keeping us informed.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So it was you who told Busch,&quot; said Lawrence.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No,&quot; said Sir Morris. &quot;You don't end up sitting behind this desk risking your own skin. I told the Prime</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Minister, and politicians can always be relied on to pass on your information if they consider it will score them a point. To be fair, I knew the Prime Minister would tell the President. Otherwise I wouldn't have told him in the first place. More important: do you think Scott can still be alive?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; said Lawrence. &quot;I have every reason to believe that the man who ran across the tarmac to our waiting plane was Scott. The French police, who incidentally have been far more co-operative than the Swiss, have informed us that our plane crashed in a field twelve miles north of Dijon but neither Scott nor the pilot were to be found at the scene of the crash.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And if the French reports on what took place at the airport are accurate,&quot; said Sir Morris, &quot;Romanov escaped and they must have had a couple of hours' start on us.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Possibly,&quot; said Lawrence.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And do you think it equally possible,&quot; asked Sir Morris, &quot;that they have caught up with Scott and are now in possession of the icon?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, sir, I fear that is quite possible,&quot; Lawrence said. &quot;But I can't pretend it's conclusive. However, the BBC monitoring service at Caversham Park picked up extra signals traffic to all Soviet embassies during the night.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That could mean anything,&quot; said Sir Morris, removing his spectacles.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I agree, sir. But NATO reports that Russian strategic forces have been placed at a state of readiness and several Soviet Ambassadors across Europe have requested formal audiences with their Foreign Secretaries, ours included.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That <I>is </I>more worrying,&quot; said Sir Morris. &quot;They don't do that unless they are hoping for our support.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Agreed, sir. But most revealing of all is that the Active Measures section of the KGB, First Chief Directorate, has booked pages of advertising space in newspapers right across Europe and, I suspect, America.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Next you'll be telling me they hired J. Walter Thompson to write the copy,&quot; growled Sir Morris.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They won't need them,&quot; said Lawrence. &quot;I suspect it's a story that will make every front page.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">If it hadn't been for the ceaseless throbbing in his shoulder, Adam might not have woken so quickly. The barge had suddenly swung at 90&deg; and started heading east when Adam woke up with a start. He looked at the bargee and indicated that as the river was far wider now could he ease them nearer to the bank so he could jump off. The old man shrugged his shoulders pretending not to understand as the barge drifted aimlessly on.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam looked over the side and despite the lateness of the hour could see the bed of the river quite clearly. He tossed a stone over the side and watched it drop quickly to the bottom. It looked almost as if he could reach down and touch it. He looked up helplessly at the bargee who continued to stare over his head into the distance.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Damn,&quot; said Adam, and taking the icon out of his blazer pocket held it high above his head. He stood on the edge of the barge feeling like a football manager asking the referee for permission to substitute a player. Permission was granted and Adam leaped into the water. His feet hit the canal bed with a thud and knocked the breath out of his body despite the fact that the water only came up to his waist.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">to the nearest bank and clambered up on to the tow-path, turning slowly round as he tried to get some feel for direction. He was soon able to distinguish the Plough again and plot a course due west. After an hour of soggy jogging he began to make out a light in the distance which he estimated to be under a mile away. His legs were soaking and cold as he started to squelch his way across a field towards the first rays of the morning sun.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Whenever he came to a hedge or gate he climbed over or under like a Roman centurion determined to hold a straight line with his final destination. He could now see the outline of a house, which as he got nearer he realised was no more than a large cottage. He remembered the expression 'peasant farmer' from his school geography lessons. A little cobbled path led up to a half-open wooden door that looked as if it didn't need a lock. Adam tapped gently on the knocker and stood directly below the light above the doorway so that whoever answered would see him immediately.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The door was pulled back by a woman of perhaps thirty, who wore a plain black dress and a spotless white apron. Her rosy cheeks and ample waist confirmed her husband's profession.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When she saw Adam standing under the light she couldn't mask her surprise — she had been expecting the postman, but he didn't often appear in a neat navy blue blazer and soaking grey trousers.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam smiled. <I>&quot;Anglais&quot; </I>he told her, and added, &quot;I fell in the canal.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The lady burst out laughing and beckoned Adam into her kitchen. He walked in to find a man evidently dressed for milking. The farmer looked up and when he saw Adam he joined in the laughter - a warm, friendly laugh more with Adam than against him.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam turned towards the farmer for guidance but his host only nodded his agreement and added with a mime of pulling down his own trousers.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam removed his shoes and socks but the farmer's wife went on pointing until he took off his trousers, and she didn't budge before he had finally removed his shirt and underclothes and wrapped the towel around his waist. She stared at the large bandage on his shoulder but then quickly picked up everything except his blazer and took them over to the sink while he stood by the fire and dried himself.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam hitched up the towel around his waist, as the farmer beckoned him to join him at the table, pouring a large glass of milk for his guest and another for himself. Adam sat down next to the farmer, hanging his fashionable new blazer over the back of the chair near the fire. A delicious aroma arose from the pan where the farmer's wife was frying a thick slice of bacon which she had cut from the joint hanging in the smoky recess of the chimney.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The farmer raised his glass of milk high in the air.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Winston Churchill,&quot; he toasted. Adam took a long gulp from his own glass and then raised it dramatically.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Charles de Gaulle,&quot; he said, and finished off the warm milk as if it had been his first pint at the local pub.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Merci, merci,&quot; </I>Adam repeated, as she cut him a thick oval slice from the huge loaf in front of am.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam began to devour the freshly cooked food which was the first meal he'd managed since the dinner he'd ordered at Robin's expense.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Without warning the farmer suddenly rose from his place and thrust out his hand. Adam also got up and shook it gratefully, only to be reminded how sore his shoulder still was.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Je dois travailler a la laiterie,&quot; </I>he explained.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam nodded, and remained standing as his host left the room, but the farmer waved him down with a further, <I>&quot;Mangez.&quot;</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When Adam had finished the last scrap of food - he did everything except lick the plate — he took it over to the farmer's wife who was busy removing a pot from the stove in order to pour him a large, steaming cup of hot coffee. He sat back down and began to sip at it.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam tapped the jacket pocket almost automatically to make sure the icon was still safely in place. He pulled it out and studied St George and the Dragon. He turned it over, hesitated and then pressed the silver crown hard. The icon split in half like a book revealing two tiny hinges on the inside.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He glanced up at the farmer's wife, who was now wringing out his socks. Adam noticed his pants had already joined the trousers on the rack above the fire. She removed an ironing board from a little alcove by the side of the stove and began to set it up, showing no interest in Adam's discovery.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Once again he stared down at the inside of the open icon which was now laid flat on the table in front of him. The true irony was that the woman pressing his</FONT><BR>

The complete surface of the inside of the icon was covered by a parchment which was glued to the wood and fell only a centimetre short of the four edges. Adam swivelled it round so that he could study it more clearly. The scrawled signatures in black ink at the bottom and the seals gave it the look of a legal document. On each reading he learned something new. Adam had been surprised originally to discover it was written in French until he came to the date on the bottom -June 20, 1867 - and then he remembered from his military history lectures at Sandhurst that long after Napoleonic times most international agreements remained conducted in French. Adam began to reread the script again slowly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">His French was not good enough to translate more than a few odd words from the finely handwritten scroll. Under <I>Etas Unis </I>William Seward's bold hand was scrawled across a crest of a two-headed eagle. Next to it was the signature of Edward de Stoeckle below a crown that mirrored the silver ornament embedded in the back of the icon. Adam double-checked. It had to be some form of agreement executed between the Russians and the Americans in 1867.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He then searched for other words that would help to explain the significance of the document. On one line he identified: <I>'Sept millions deux cent mille dollars d'or (7.2 million)' </I>and on another <I>'Sept cent douze millions huit cent mille dollars d'or (712.8 million) le 20juin 1966.</I></FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">His eyes came to a halt on the one word that would remain the same in both languages.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The one word he had not told Lawrence.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam wondered how the icon had ever fallen into the hands of Goering in the first place. He must have bequeathed it to his father unknowingly — for had he realised the true importance of what was hidden inside it, he would surely have been able to bargain for his own freedom with either side.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Voila, voila,&quot; </I>said the farmer's wife, waving her hands as she placed warm socks, pants and trousers in front of Adam. How long had he spent engrossed in his fateful discovery? She looked down at the upside down parchment and smiled. Adam quickly snapped the icon closed and then studied the masterpiece carefully. So skilfully had the wood been cut that he could no longer see the join. He thought of the words of the letter left to him in his father's will: &quot;But if you open it only to discover its purpose is to involve you in some dishonourable enterprise, be rid of it without a second thought.&quot; He did not need to give a second thought to how his father would have reacted in the same circumstances. The farmer's wife was now standing hands on hips, staring at him with a puzzled look.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where do we stand on this legally, Dean?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We don't, Mr President. Abraham Brunweld, the leading authority on documents of this period, confirms that the terms of the ninety-nine year lease are binding on both sides. The lease was signed on behalf of Russia by Edward de Stoeckle and for the US by the then Secretary of State, William Seward.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Can this agreement still be valid today?&quot; asked the President, turning to his chief legal officer, Nicholas Katzenbach.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It certainly can, sir,&quot; said the Attorney General. &quot;But only if they can produce their original. If they do, the UN and the international court at The Hague would have no choice but to support the Russian claim. Otherwise no international agreement signed</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I understand how you feel, Mr President,&quot; said the Attorney General, &quot;but it remains my responsibility to make you aware of the legal position.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;God dammit, is there a precedent for this kind of stupidity by a Head of State?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The British,&quot; chipped in Dean Rusk, &quot;will be facing a similar problem with the Chinese in 1999 over the New Territories of Hong Kong. They have already accepted the reality of the situation and indeed have made it clear to the Chinese Government that they are willing to come to an agreement with them.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's just one example,&quot; said the President, &quot;and we all know about the British and their 'fair play' diplomacy.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Also, in 1898,&quot; continued Rusk, &quot;the Russians obtained a ninety-nine-year lease on Port Arthur in Northern China. The port was vital to them because, unlike Vladivostok, it is ice-free all year round.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I had no idea the Russians <I>had </I>a port in China.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They don't any longer, Mr President. They returned it to Mao in 1955, as an act of goodwill between fellow Communists.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You can be damn sure,the Russians won't return this piece of land to <I>us </I>as an act of goodwill,&quot; said the President. &quot;Am I left with any alternative?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Short of military action to prevent the Soviets claiming what they will rightfully see as theirs, no sir,&quot; replied the Secretary of State.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So one Johnson buys the land from the Russians in 1867 and another has to sell it back in 1966. Why</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">did Seward and the President ever agree to such a damn cockamaney idea in the first place?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;At the time,&quot; said the Attorney General, removing his spectacles, &quot;the purchase price of the land in question was seven point two million dollars and inflation was then virtually unheard of. Andrew Johnson could never have imagined the Russians wanting to purchase it back at ninety-nine times its original value, or in real terms, seven hundred and twelve point eight million dollars in gold bullion. In reality, years of inflation have made the asking price cheap. And the Russians have already lodged the full amount in a New York bank to prove it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So we can't even hope that they won't stump up in time,&quot; said the President.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It would seem not, sir.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But why did Tsar Alexander want to lease the damn land in the first place? That's what beats me.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He was having trouble with some of his senior ministers at the time over the selling off of land belonging to Russia in Eastern Asia. The Tsar thought this transaction would be more palatable to his inner circle if he presented it as nothing more than a long lease, with a buy-back clause, rather than an outright sale.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why didn't Congress object?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;After Congress ratified the main treaty, the amendment was not strictly subject to approval by the House, because no further expenditure by the United States government was involved,&quot; Rusk explained. &quot;Ironically, Seward was proud of the fact he had demanded such a high premium in the repayment clause. At the time he had every reason to believe it would be impossible to repay.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Neither adviser felt able to contradict their elected leader.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So what are the British doing about all this?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Playing it close to the chest, as usual, Mr President. It's an English national who is thought to be in possession of the treaty at the moment and they still seem quietly confident that they will get their hands on him and the icon before the Russians, so they may yet turn out to be our saviours.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nice to have the British coming to <I>our </I>rescue for a change,&quot; said the President. &quot;But have we meanwhile been sitting on our asses while they try to solve our problems for us?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, sir. The CIA have been on it for over a month.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then it's only surprising that the Russians haven't got their hands on the icon already.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Nobody laughed.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So what am I expected to do next? Sit and wait for the Soviets to move 712 million dollars of gold from their New York bank to the US Treasury before midnight on Monday?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They must also deliver their original copy of the agreement to me at the same time,&quot; said Rusk. &quot;And they have only sixty hours left to do that.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;For over fifty years, we've believed the Russians' copy was destroyed at the time of the Revolution. As the years passed it became clear that the Soviets accepted this as a <I>fait accompli </I>with the final acknowledgment of this fact coming from Stalin at Yalta.

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When the cottage door closed behind Adam, all he could make out was the outskirts of a small town. While it was still so early he felt safe to jog towards the <I>'centre ville\ </I>but as soon as the early-morning workers began to appear on the streets, he slowed to a walk. Adam opted not to go straight into the centre of the town but to look for somewhere to hide while he considered his next move. He came to a halt outside a multi-storey car park and decided he was unlikely to find a better place to formulate a plan.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam walked through an exit door at ground level and came to a lift that indicated that the car park was on four floors. He ran down the steps to the lowest level, tentatively pulled back the door to the basement, and found it was badly lit and almost empty. Adam had chosen the basement as he assumed that it would be the last floor to fill up with customers. He walked around the perimeter of the floor and studied the layout. Two cars were parked in the far corner, and a thick layer of dust suggested that they had been there for some time. He crouched down behind one of them and found that he was safely out of sight to all but the most inquisitive.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">car on that floor and leave the keys in the ignition. He checked the doors of the two cars already parked but both were securely locked. He settled back to work out a more serious plan of how he could reach the coast by nightfall.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He was deep in thought when he heard a scraping noise that made him jump. He peered round the gloomy basement, and out of the darkness a man appeared pulling behind him a plastic dustbin half full of rubbish. Adam could barely see the old man dressed in a dirty brown coat that stretched nearly to the ground and left little doubt about the height of the previous employee. He wasn't sure what he would do if the man continued to walk towards him. But as he came nearer Adam could see that he was stooped and old; the stub of a cigarette protruded frt&gt;m his lips. The cleaner stopped in front of him, spotted a cigarette packet, picked it up and checked to be sure it was empty before dropping it in the dustbin. After that, a sweet paper, a Pepsi-Cola can and an old copy of <I>Le Figaro </I>all found their way into the dustbin. His eyes searched slowly round the room for more rubbish, but still he didn't notice Adam tucked away behind the farthest car. Satisfied that his task was completed, he dragged the dustbin across the floor and pushed it outside the door. Adam began to relax again but after about two minutes, the old man returned, walked over to a wall and pulled open a door that Adam hadn't previously noticed. He took off the long brown coat and replaced it with a grey one that didn't look in a much better state but at least it made a more convincing fit. He then disappeared through the exit. Moments later Adam heard a door close with a bang.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam waited for some time before he stood up and stretched. He crept around the edge of the wall until he reached the little door. He pulled it open quietly and removed the long brown coat from its nail, then headed back to his place in the corner. He ducked down as the first of the morning cars arrived. The driver swung into the far corner in such a fluent circle that Adam felt sure it must have been a daily routine. A short dapper man with a pencil moustache, dressed in a smart pin-stripe suit, jumped out of the car carrying a briefcase. Once he had locked the car door he proceeded with fast mincing strides towards the exit. Adam waited until the heavy door swung back into place before he stood up and tried on the brown coat over his blazer. It was tight on the shoulders and a little short in the arm, but at least it made him look as if he might have worked there.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">For the next hour he watched the cars as they continued to arrive at irregular intervals. Tiresomely, all the owners carefully locked their doors and checked them before disappearing through the exit with their keys.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When he heard ten o'clock strike in the distance Adam decided that there was nothing to be gained by hanging around any longer. He had crept out from behind the car that was shielding him and began to make his way across the floor towards the exit when a Rover with English registration plates swung round the corner and nearly blinded him. He jumped to one side to let the car pass but it screeched to a halt beside him and the driver wound down his window.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;One hour at most,&quot; said the man as he reached the door. Adam waited by the car for a few minutes but the man did not come back. He opened the passenger door and dropped the food bag on the front seat. He then walked round to the other side and climbed in the driver's seat, switched on the ignition and checked the fuel gauge: a little over half full. He revved the engine and drove the car up the ramp until he reached the first floor, where he came to a halt unable to escape. He needed a two-franc piece to make the arm swing up and let him out. The lady in the car behind him reluctantly changed his ten-franc note once she realised there was no other way of getting out.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam drove quickly out on to the road looking for the sign Toutes Directions'. Once he had found one, it was only minutes before he was clear of the town and travelling up the N6 to Paris.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam estimated that he had two hours at best. By then the police would surely have been informed of the theft of the car. He felt confident he had enough petrol to reach Paris; but he certainly couldn't hope to make Calais.</FONT><BR>

He opened the bag the farmer's wife had given him and took out an apple and a piece of cheese. His mind began to drift to Heidi, as it had so often in the past two days.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">If only he had never opened the letter.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Another hour passed before he spotted him limping up a hill only a few hundred yards from the main road. A broad smile came over Romanov's face when he realised he could get to Scott long before he could hope to reach the road. When Romanov was within a few yards of him the flight lieutenant turned round and smiled at the stranger.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When Romanov left Banks thirty minutes later hidden behind a tree with a broken neck he reluctantly admitted that the young pilot officer had been as brave as Valchek - but he couldn't waste any more time trying to discover in which direction Scott was heading.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov headed west.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The moment Adam heard the siren he came out of his reverie. He checked the little clock on the dashboard. He had only been driving for about an hour and a half. Could the French police be that efficient? The police car was now approaching him fast on his left but Adam maintained the same speed — except for his heartbeat, which climbed well above the approved limit - until the police car shot past him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As the kilometres sped by, he began to wonder if it might be wiser to turn off on to a quieter road, but decided, on balance, to risk pushing on to Paris as quickly as possible.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He remained alert for further sirens as he continued to follow the signs to Paris. When he finally reached the outskirts of the city, he proceeded to the Boulevard de 1'Hopital and even felt relaxed enough to bite into another apple. In normal circumstances he would have appreciated the magnificent architecture along the banks of the Seine, but today his eyes kept returning to the rear view mirror.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam decided he would abandon the vehicle in a large public car park: with any luck it could be days before anyone came across it.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He turned down the Rue de Rivoli and took in at once the long colourful banners looming up in front of him. He could hardly have picked a better place, as he felt sure it would be packed with foreign cars.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam backed the Rover in the farthest corner of the square. He then wolfed down the last piece of cheese, and locked the car. He started walking towards the exit, but had only gone a few yards when he realised that the strolling holidaymakers were amused by his ill-fitting brown jacket which he had completely forgotten. He decided to turn back and throw the coat in the boot. He quickly took it off and folded it in a small square.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He was only a few yards away from the car when he saw the young policeman. He was checking the Rover's number plate and repeating the letters and numbers into an intercom. Adam inched slowly back, never taking his eyes from the officer. He only needed to manage another six or seven paces before he would be lost in the throng of the crowd.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Five, four, three, two, he backed, as the man continued speaking into the intercom. Just one more pace . . . <I>&quot;Alors!&quot; </I>hollered the lady on whose foot Adam stepped.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm so sorry,&quot; said Adam, instinctively in his native</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam dropped the brown coat and swung round quickly, nearly knocking the stooping lady over before sprinting off towards the exit. The car park was full of tourists who had come to enjoy the pleasures of the Louvre, and Adam found it hard to pick up any real speed through the dense crowd. By the time he reached the entrance to die car park he could hear the policeman's whistle a few paces behind him. He ran across the Rue de Rivoli, through an archway and into a large square.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">By then another policeman was coming from his right, leaving him with no choice but to run up the steps in front of him. When he reached the top he turned to see at least three other policemen in close pursuit. He threw himself through the swing door and past a group ofjapanese tourists who were surrounding the Rodin statue that stood in the hallway. He charged on past a startled ticket collector, and on up the long marble staircase. <I>&quot;Monsieur, monsieur, votre billet?&quot; </I>he heard shouted in his wake.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">At the top of the staircase he turned right and ran through <I>The Special '66' Centuries Exhibition, </I>Modern -Pollock, Bacon, Hockney-into the Impressionist room - Monet, Manet, Courbet - desperately looking for any way out. On into Eighteenth Century - Fragon-ard, Goya, Watteau - but still no sign of an exit. Through the great arch into Seventeenth Century -Murillo, Van Dyck, Poussin - as people stopped looking at the pictures and turned their attention to what was causing such a commotion. Adam ran on into Sixteenth Century - Raphael, Caravaggio, Michelangelo - suddenly aware that there were only two centuries of paintings to go.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Right or left? He chose right, and entered a huge square room. There were three exits. He slowed momentarily to decide which would be his best bet when he became aware that the room was full of Russian icons. He came to a halt at an empty display case. <I>'Nous regrettons que ce tableau soit soumis a la restauration.'</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The first policeman had already entered the large room and was only a few paces behind as Adam dashed on towards the farthest exit. There were now only two exits left open for him from which to choose. He swung right, only to see another policeman bearing straight down on him. Left: two more. Ahead, yet another.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam came to a halt in the middle of the Icon Room at the Louvre, his hands raised above his head. He was surrounded by policemen, their guns drawn.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Sir Morris picked up the phone on his desk.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;An urgent call from Paris, sir,&quot; said his secretary.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you, Tessa.&quot; He listened carefully as his brain quickly translated the exciting news.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Merci, merci,&quot; </I>said Sir Morris to his opposite number at the French Foreign Ministry. &quot;We will be back in touch with you as soon as we have made all the necessary arrangements to collect him. But for now, please don't let him out of your sight.&quot; Sir Morris listened for a few moments before he said: &quot;And if he has any possessions on him, please keep them guarded under lock and key. Thank you once again.&quot; His secretary took down every word of the conversation in shorthand - as she had done for the past seventeen years.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Once the police had snapped the handcuffs on Adam and marched him off to a waiting car, he was surprised how relaxed, almost friendly, they became. He was yanked into the back of the car by the policeman to whom he was attached. He noticed that there was a police car in front of him and yet another behind. Two motorcycle outriders led the little motorcade away. Adam felt more like visiting royalty than a criminal</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When Adam arrived at the Surete on the He de la Cite, he was immediately ordered to empty all his pockets. One wristwatch, one apple, forty pounds in traveller's cheques, eight francs, and one British passport in the name of Dudley Hulme. The station inspector asked him politely to strip to his vest and pants. It was the second time that day. Once Adam had done so, the inspector carefully checked every pocket of the blazer, even the lining. His expression left Adam in no doubt he hadn't found what he was looking for.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Do you have anything else in your possession?&quot; the officer asked in slow, precise English.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Damn silly question, thought Adam. You can see for yourself. &quot;No,&quot; was all he replied. The inspector checked the blazer once again but came across nothing new. &quot;You must be dressed,&quot; he said abruptly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam put back on his shirt, jacket and trousers but the inspector kept his tie and shoelaces.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;All your things will be returned to you when you leave,&quot; the inspector explained. Adam nodded as he slipped on his shoes, which flapped uncomfortably when he walked. He was then accompanied to a small cell on the same floor, locked in and left alone. He looked around the sparsely furnished room. A small wooden table was placed in its centre, with two wooden chairs on either side. His eyes checked over a single bed in the corner which had on it an ancient horse-hair mattress. He could not have described the room properly as a cell because there were no bars, even across the one small window. He took off his jacket, hung it</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">over the chair and lay down on the bed. At least it was an improvement over anything he had slept on for the past two nights, he reflected. Could it have only been two nights since he had slept on the floor of Robin's hotel room in Geneva?</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As the minutes ticked by, he made only one decision. That when the inspector returned, he would demand to see a lawyer. &quot;What the hell's the French for lawyer?&quot; he asked out loud.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When an officer eventually appeared, in what Adam estimated must have been about half an hour, he was carrying a tray laden with hot soup, a roll, and what looked to Adam like a steak with all the trimmings and a plastic cup filled to the brim with red wine. He wondered if they had got the wrong man, or if this was simply his last meal before the guillotine. He followed the officer to the door,</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I demand to speak to a lawyer,&quot; he said emphatically, but the policeman only shrugged.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>Je ne comprendspas I'anglais,&quot; </I>he said, and slammed the door behind him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam settled down to eat the meal that had been set before him, thankful that the French assumed good food should be served whatever the circumstances.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Sir Morris told them his news an hour later and then studied each of them round the table carefully. He would never have called the D4 if he hadn't felt sure that Adam was at last secure. Matthews continued to show no emotion. Busch was unusually silent while Snell looked almost relaxed for a change. Lawrence was the only one who seemed genuinely pleased.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Colonel Pollard,&quot; said Sir Morris, &quot;who has been sent over in the Ambassador's car and will bring Scott back to be debriefed at our Embassy in Faubourg St Honore. Surete rang a few moments ago to confirm that Colonel Pollard had arrived.&quot; Sir Morris turned towards his Number Two. &quot;You will fly over to Paris tonight and conduct the debriefing yourself.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said Lawrence, looking up at his boss, a smile appearing on his face.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Sir Morris nodded. A cool lot, he considered, as he stared round that table, but the next half hour would surely find out which one of them it was who served two masters.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good. I don't think I shall need any of you again today,&quot; said Sir Morris as he rose from his chair.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Mentor smiled as Sir Morris left the room; his task had already been completed. So simple when you can read upside-down shorthand.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A black Jaguar bearing CD plates had arrived at police headquarters a few minutes earlier than expected. The traffic had not been as heavy as the colonel had anticipated. The inspector was standing on the steps as Pollard jumped out of the car. The policeman looked at the flapping Union Jack on the bonnet and considered the whole exercise was becoming rather melodramatic.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Pollard, a short, thickset man, dressed in a dark suit, regimental tie and carrying a rolled umbrella, looked like so many of those Englishmen who refuse to acknowledge that they could possibly be abroad.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The inspector took Pollard directly through to the little room where Adam had been incarcerated.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Pollard's the name, Colonel Pollard. British Military Attache stationed here in Paris. Sorry you've been put through this ordeal, old fellow, but a lot of paperwork had to be completed to get you out. Bloody red tape.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I understand,&quot; said Adam, jumping off the bed and shaking the colonel by the hand. &quot;I was in the army myself.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I know. Royal Wessex, wasn't it?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam nodded, feeling a little more confident.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Still, the problem's been sorted out now,&quot; continued the colonel. &quot;The French police have been most co-operative and have agreed to let you accompany me to our Embassy.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam looked at the colonel's tie. &quot;Duke of York's?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What? Certainly not,&quot; said Pollard, his hand fingering his shirt front. &quot;Green Jackets.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; said Adam, pleased to have his mistake picked up.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Now I think we ought to be cutting along, old fellow, I know you'll be relieved to hear that they won't be laying any charges.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The colonel didn't know just how relieved Adam did feel.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The inspector led them both back out into the hall where Adam had only to identify and sign for his personal belongings. He put them all in his pocket, except for the watch, which he slipped over his wrist, and his shoelaces, which he quickly inserted and tied. He wasn't surprised they didn't return Dudley Hulme's passport.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Don't let's hang around too long, old fellow,&quot; said the colonel, beginning to sound a little anxious.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I won't be a moment,&quot; said Adam. &quot;I'm just as keen to get out of this place as you are.&quot; He checked his laces before following Colonel Pollard and the inspector out to the waiting Jaguar. He noticed for the first time that the colonel had a slight limp. A chauffeur held the door open for him; Adam laughed.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Something funny, old fellow?&quot; asked the colonel.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No. It's just that the last chauffeur who offered to do that for me didn't look quite as friendly.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam climbed into the back of the Jaguar and the colonel slipped in beside him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Back to the Embassy,&quot; said Pollard, and the car moved off briskly.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When Adam awoke he was naked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He looked around the sparse room but this time, unlike the French jail, he was unable to see what was behind him: his arms, legs and body were bound tightly by a nylon cord to a chair that had been placed in the middle of the room, and which made him all but immobile.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When he looked up from the chair all he could see was Colonel Pollard standing over him. The moment the colonel was satisfied that Adam had regained consciousness he quickly left the room.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam turned his head to see all his clothes laid out neatly on a bed at the far side of the cell. He tried to manoeuvre the chair, but he could barely manage to make it wobble from side to side, and after several minutes had advanced only a few inches towards the door. He switched his energies to trying to loosen the cords around his wrists, rubbing them up and down against the wood of the slats, but his arms were bound so tightly that ne could only manage the slightest friction.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">After struggling ineffectively for several minutes he was interrupted by the sound of the door swinging open. Adam looked up as Romanov strode through.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He decided he was no less terrifying at close quarters. He was followed by another man whom Adam didn't recognise. The second man was clutching what looked like a cigar box as he took his place somewhere behind Adam. Pollard followed him, carrying a large plastic sheet.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov looked at Adam's naked body and smiled; enjoying his humiliation he came to a halt directly in front of the chair.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My name is Alexander Petrovich Romanov,&quot; he announced with only a slight accent.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Or Emmanuel Rosenbaum,&quot; said Adam, staring at his adversary closely.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I am only sorry that we are unable to shake hands,&quot; he added, as he began circling the chair. &quot;But I felt in the circumstances certain precautions were necessary. First I should like to congratulate you on having eluded me for so long, but as you will now realise my source in London can place a call every bit as quickly as yours.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Your source?&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Don't be na'ive, Captain. You must be painfully aware by now that you're in no position to be asking questions, only answering them.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam fixed his gaze on a brick in the wall in front of him, making no attempt to follow Romanov's circumnavigations.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Pollard,&quot; said Romanov sharply, &quot;put Captain Scott back in the centre of the room. He seems to have managed to move at least a foot in his getaway attempt.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Pollard did as he was bid, first spreading the plastic sheet on the floor, then manoeuvring Adam till the chair was on the centre of the sheet.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Romanov. &quot;I think you have</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">already met our Colonel Pollard,&quot; he continued. &quot;That's not his real name, of course, and indeed he's not a real colonel either, but that's what he always wanted to be in life, so when the opportunity arose, we happily obliged.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;In fact the good colonel did serve in the British Army, but I fear he entered the service of King and country as a private soldier and eighteen years later left, still as a private soldier. And despite an injury to his leg - unfortunately not received from any known enemy of the Crown — he was unable to claim a disability pension. Which left him fairly destitute. But, as I explained, he always wanted to be a colonel,&quot; continued Romanov. &quot;It was a good attempt of yours - The Duke of York's?' - but as the colonel had genuinely served with the Green Jackets it was the one tie he felt safe wearing.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam's eyes remained fixed on the wall. &quot;Now I confess, our mistake over the Union Jack was lax but as it is impossible to fly the Russian flag upside down without everyone noticing, it was perhaps understandable. Although, in truth, Pollard should have spotted it immediately, we must be thankful that you did not until the car doors were safely locked.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov stopped his endless circling and stared down at the nude body.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Now I think the time has come for you to be introduced to our Dr Stavinsky who has so been looking forward to making your acquaintance because he hasn't had a lot of work to do lately and he fears he might be becoming a little rusty.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov took a pace backward allowing Stavinsky to come and take his place immediately in front of Adam. The cigar box was still tucked under his arm. Adam stared at the diminutive figure who seemed to</FONT><BR>

Stavinsky must have been no taller than five feet and wore an open-necked grey shirt and a badly creased grey suit that made him resemble a junior clerk in a not very successful solicitor's office. A one-day bristle covered his face, leaving the impression that he hadn't expected to be working that day. His thin lips suddenly parted in a grin as if he had come to some conclusion.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Captain Scott,&quot; began Stavinsky. &quot;Although you are an unexpected guest of the Embassy you are most welcome. You could of course make our association very short by simply letting me have one piece of information. In truth&quot; - he let out a small sigh - &quot;I only require to know the whereabouts of the Tsar's icon.&quot; He paused. &quot;Although I have a feeling it's not going to be that easy. Am I correct?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam didn't reply.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It doesn't come as a great surprise. I warned Comrade Romanov that after his laudatory description of you a simple series of questions and answers would be unlikely to suffice. However, I must follow the normal procedure in such circumstances. As you will find, the Russians go by the book every bit a*s much as the British. Now you may have wondered,&quot; added Stavinsky as if it were an afterthought, &quot;why a man who never smokes should be seen carrying a Cuban cigar box.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Stavinsky waited for Adam's reply but none was forthcoming.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Ah, no attempt at conversation. I see you have been through such an experience before. Well, then I must continue talking to myself for the moment. When I was a student at the University of Moscow my subject was chemistry, but I specialised in one particular aspect of the science.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What few people in the West realise is that we Russians were the first to pioneer, at university level, a Department of Scientific Interrogation with a full professorial chair and several research assistants. They are still without one at either Oxford or Cambridge I am told. But then the West continues to preserve a quixotic view of the value of life and the right of the individual. Now, as you can imagine, only certain members of the university were aware of the existence of such a department, let alone able to enrol as a student - especially as it was not on the curriculum. But as I had already been a member of the Perviyotdel it was common sense that I should add the craft of torture to my trade. Now I am basically a simple man,&quot; continued Stavinsky, &quot;who had previously shown little interest in research but once I had been introduced to the 'cigar box' I became, overnight, an enthralled and retentive pupil. I could not wait to be let loose to experiment.&quot; He paused to see what effect he was having on Scott, and was disappointed to be met by the same impassive stare.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Torture, of course, is an old and honourable profession,&quot; continued Stavinsky. &quot;The Chinese have been at it for nearly three thousand years as I think you have already experienced, Captain Scott, and even you British have come a long way since the rack. But that particular instrument has proved to be rather cumbersome for carrying around in a modern world. With this in mind, my tutor at Moscow, Professor Metz, has developed something small and simple that even a man of average intelligence can master after a few lessons.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam tried to remain relaxed and calm.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Still no response, Captain Scott, but as I explained I am in no hurry. Especially, as I suspect in your case, the whole operation may take a little longer than usual, which I confess will only add to my enjoyment. And although we are not yet in possession of the Tsar's icon I <I>am </I>at least in control of the one person who knows where it is.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam still made no comment.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not only ill-mannered,&quot; remarked Stavinsky, &quot;but also stupid. Because in a very short time you will be desperate for any liquid we might be kind enough to allow you. But, to be fair, you had no way of knowing that.&quot;</FONT><BR>

Fourth, two syringes, fifth, a tube of collodion glue and finally, a phial, of which more later.

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Doesn't look a lot, I confess,&quot; said Stavinsky. &quot;But with a little imagination I'm sure you will be able to work out its potential. Now. In order that Comrade Romanov and the colonel can enjoy the spectacle I am about to offer it is necessary to add a few details about the nervous system itself. I do hope you are following my every word, Captain Scott, because it is the victim's knowledge which allows him to appreciate the true genius of what is about to follow.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">It didn't please Adam that Stavinsky spoke English so well. He could still vividly remember how the Chinese had told Adam what they were going to do to him in a language that he couldn't understand. With them, he had found it easier to allow his mind to drift during their diatribe but he still ended up in a fridge for four hours.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Now to the practical,&quot; continued the grey figure. &quot;By sending a small electrical impulse to the end of the synapse, it is possible to pass on a large electric message to thousands of other nerves within a fraction of a second. This causes a nasty sensation not unlike touching a live wire when the electrical power has been left on in one's home, more commonly known as an electric shock. Not deadly, but distinctly unpleasant. In the Moscow school this is known as Stage One and there is no necessity for you to experience this if you are now willing to tell me where I can find the Tsar's icon.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Like you,&quot; continued Romanov, &quot;I only have this one on loan - but you tell me where the original is and I will release you and exchange the copy for the original.

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then the time has obviously come to let you into some information you will be more interested in,&quot; Romanov said, extracting a single sheet of paper from an envelope he removed from his inside pocket. Adam was genuinely puzzled, quite unable to think what it could be. Romanov opened it slowly and held it up so that Adam could only see the back.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;This single sheet of paper reveals a sentence carried out in Moscow in 1946 by Judge I. T. Nikitchenko -the death sentence,&quot; continued Romanov, &quot;pronounced on a certain Major Vladimir Kosky, the Russian guard in charge of the Soviet watch the night Reichsmarshal Hermann Goering died.&quot; He turned the paper round so Adam could see it. &quot;As you can see, Major Kosky was found guilty of collaboration with the enemy for financial gain. It was proved he was directly responsible for smuggling cyanide into the Reichsmarshal's cell on the night he died.&quot; Adam's eyes widened. &quot;Ah, I see I have dealt the ace of spades,&quot; said Romanov. &quot;Now I think you will finally tell me where the icon actually is because you have an expression in England, if I recall correctly: fair exchange is no robbery. Your icon for my icon, plus the legal judgment that will finally vindicate your father's honour.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Metz was never really satisfied with Stage Two because he found the recovery time even for an extremely brave and fit man like yourself could sometimes hold him up for hours, even days. So during his final years at the university he devoted his time to finding how he could possibly speed the whole process up. As for all geniuses the final solution was staggering in its simplicity. All he had to produce was a chemical formula that when injected into the nervous system caused an immediate recovery — a rapid analgesic. It took him twelve years and several deaths before he came up with the final solution,&quot; said Stavinsky, removing another phial from the cigar box and plunging the needle of a second syringe into the seal on the top of the phial,</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;This,&quot; Stavinsky said, holding up the little phial in triumph, &quot;when injected into your blood stream, will aid recovery so quickly that you may even wonder if you ever went through any pain in the first place. For this piece of genius Metz should have been awarded the Nobel Prize, but it was not something we felt he could share with the rest of the scientific world. But because of him I can repeat the process you have just experienced again and again, never permitting you to die. You see, I can keep this generator pumping up and down every thirty minutes for the next week if that is your desire,&quot; said Stavinsky, as he stared down at Adam's white, disbelieving face flecked with yellow specks of his vomit.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Stavinsky stood in front of Adam and half filled the syringe! Adam felt intensely cold, yet the shock of his torture had caused him to sweat profusely. &quot;Sit still, Captain Scott, I have no desire to do you any perma-</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He could not believe how quickly he felt himself recovering. Within minutes he no longer felt sick or disorientated. The sensation in his arms and legs returned to normal while the wish never to experience Stage Two again became acute.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Brilliant man, Professor Metz, on that I'm sure we can both agree,&quot; said Stavinsky, &quot;and if he were still alive I feel certain he would have written a paper on your case.&quot; Slowly and carefully Stavinsky began to smear more lumps of jelly on Adam's chest. When he was satisfied with his handiwork he once again attached the electrodes to the jelly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Coriolanus, Timon of Athens, Pericles.&quot; </I>Stavinsky thrust his palm down and Adam hoped that he would die. He found a new level to scream at, as his body shook and shook. Seconds later he felt ice cold and, shivering uncontrollably, he started to retch.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Stavinsky was quickly by his side to release him. Adam fell to the ground and coughed up what was left in his body. When he was only spitting, Pollard placed him back in the chair.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You must understand I can't let you die, Captain. Now where is the icon?&quot; Stavinsky shouted.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">In the Louvre, Adam wanted to scream, but his words barely came out as a whisper, the inside of his mouth feeling like sandpaper. Stavinsky proceeded to fill the second syringe again and injected Adam with the fluid. Once again it was only moments before the agony subsided and he felt completely recovered.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;The Tempest. </I>Aahhhh,&quot; he screamed and immediately fainted. The next thing Adam remembered was the cold water being poured over him by the colonel before he began to retch again. Once tied back in the chair Stavinsky thrust the syringe into him once more, but Adam couldn't believe he would ever recover again. He must surely die, because he wanted to die. He felt the syringe jab into his flesh again.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov stepped forward and looking straight at Adam, said, &quot;I feel Dr Stavinsky and I have earned a little supper. We did consider inviting you but felt your stomach wouldn't be up to it, but when we return fully refreshed Dr Stavinsky will repeat the entire exercise again and again until you let me know where you have hidden the icon.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov and Stavinsky left as Colonel Pollard came back in. Romanov and the colonel exchanged a few sentences which Adam could not make out. Then Romanov left the room, closing the door quietly behind him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Pollard came over to Adam and offered him the water bottle. Adam gulped it down and was genuinely surprised how quickly he was recovering. Yet although his senses were returning to normal Adam still doubted he could survive one more time.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm going to throw up again,&quot; said Adam and suddenly thrust his head forward. Pollard quickly undid the knots and watched Adam slump to his hands and knees. He threw up some spit and rested before the colonel helped him gently back into the chair. As he sat down Adam gripped both sides of the chair legs firmly, then with all the strength he could muster jack-knifed forward, swung the chair over his head, and brought it crashing down on top of the unsuspecting</FONT><BR>

Pollard collapsed in a heap, unconscious, on the floor in front of Adam and never heard him utter the words, <I>&quot;Henry VIII </I>and <I>Two Noble Kinsmen - </I>I'll bet that's one you've never heard of, Colonel. Mind you, to be fair, not everyone thinks Shakespeare wrote it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam remained on his knees over the colonel's body, wondering what his next move should be. He was grateful that the soundproofed room was now working in his favour. He waited for a few more seconds as he tried to measure what was left of his strength. He picked up the water bottle that had been knocked over and drained it of its last drops. He then crawled across to the bed and pulled on his pants and socks, shoes, and his not so white shirt, followed by his trousers. He was about to put on the blazer, but found the lining had been ripped to shreds. He changed his mind and stumbled like an old man back towards the colonel, removed his Harris tweed coat and slipped it on. It was large round the shoulders but short at the hips.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam made his way to the door, feeling almost exhilarated. He turned the handle and pulled. The door came open an inch - nothing happened - two inches - still nothing. He stared through the crack but all he could see was a dark corridor. As he pulled the door wide open the hinges sounded to Adam like racing tyres screeching. Once he was certain that no one was going to return, he ventured into the corridor.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Standing against the wall he stared up and down the thin windowless passage, waiting for his eyes to adjust to the dark. He could make out a light shining through a pebbled pane in a door at the far end of the corridor, and began to take short steps towards it. He continued on, as if he were a blind man, creeping slowly forward until he saw another beam of light coming from under a door to his right about ten yards</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">away from the one he needed to reach. He edged cautiously on and was only a pace away from the first door when it opened abruptly and out stepped a small man in a white tunic and blue kitchen overalls. Adam froze against the wall as the kitchen hand removed a packet of cigarettes and a box of matches from his pocket and headed away in the opposite direction. When the man reached the glazed door he opened it and walked out. Adam watched the silhouette outlined against the pebbled wii dow, a match being struck, a cigarette being lit, the first puff of smoke; he even heard a sigh.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam crept past what he now assumed was a kitchen and on towards the outer door. He turned the knob slowly, waiting for the silhouette to move. The outer door also possessed hinges which no one had bothered to oil for months. The smoker turned round and smiled as Adam's left hand landed firmly in his stomach. As the smoker bent over, Adam's right fist came up to the man's chin with all the force he could muster. The smoker sank in a heap on the ground, and Adam stood over him thankful that he didn't move.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He dragged the limp body across the grass, dumped it behind a bush and remained kneeling by it while he tried to work out his bearings. Adam could just make out a high wall ahead of him with a gravelled courtyard in front of it. Thfe wall threw out a long shadow from the moon across the tiny stones. About twenty yards . . . Summoning up every ounce of energy, he ran to the wall and then clung to it like a limpet, remaining motionless in its shadow. Slowly and silently he moved round the wall, yard by yard, until he reached the front of what he now felt sure was the Russian Embassy. The great green wooden gates at the front entrance were open, and every few seconds limousines swept past</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">him. Adam looked back up towards the front door of the Embassy and at the top of the steps he saw a massive man, medals stretching across his formal dress jacket, shaking hands with each of his departing guests. Adam assumed he was the Ambassador.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">One or two of the guests were leaving by foot. There were two armed gendarmes on the gate who stood rigidly to attention and saluted as each car or guest passed by.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam waited until a vast BMW, the West German flag fluttering on its bonnet, slowed as it passed through the gates. Using the car to shield him, Adam walked out into the centre of the drive, then, following closely behind, walked straight between the guards towards the road.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Bonsoir,&quot; </I>he said lightly to the guards as the car moved forward: he was only a yard from the road. &quot;Walk,&quot; he told himself, &quot;don't run. Walk, walk until you are out of their sight.&quot; They saluted deferentially. &quot;Don't look back.&quot; Another car followed him out, but he kept his eyes firmly to the front.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Tu cherches une femme?&quot; </I>a voice repeated from the shadows of a recessed doorway. Adam had ended up in a badly lit one-way street. Several men of indeterminate age seemed to be walking aimlessly up and down the kerbside. He eyed them with suspicion as he moved on through the darkness.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Wha —?&quot; said Adam, stepping sharply into the road, his senses heightened by the unexpected sound.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;From Britain, eh? Do you search for a girl?&quot; The voice held an unmistakable French accent.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You speak English,&quot; said Adam, still unable to see the woman clearly,</FONT><BR>
</P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You have to know a lot of languages in my profession, <I>cheri, </I>or you'd starve.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam tried to think coherently. &quot;How much for the night?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Eh bien, </I>but it's not yet midnight,&quot; said the girl. &quot;So I would have to charge two hundred francs.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Although he had no money Adam hoped the girl might at least lead him to safety.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Two hundred is fine.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;D'accord,&quot; </I>said the girl, at last stepping out of the shadows. Adam was surprised by how attractive she turned out to be. &quot;Take my arm and if you pass a gendarme say only, <I>'Mafemme'.&quot;</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam stumbled forward.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Ah, I think you drink too much, <I>cheri. </I>Never mind, you can lean on me, yes.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, I'm just tired,&quot; said Adam, trying hard to keep up with her pace.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You have been to party at Embassy, <I>n'est-cepas?&quot;</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam was startled.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Don't be surprised, <I>cheri. I </I>find most of my regulars from the Embassies. They can't risk to be involved in casual affairs, <I>tu comprends?&quot;</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I believe you,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My apartment is just round the corner,&quot; she assured him. Adam was confident he could get that far but he took a deep breath when they arrived at a block of flats and first saw the steps. He just managed to reach the front door.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I live on the top of the house, <I>cheri. </I>Very nice view,&quot; she said matter-of-factly, &quot;but I'm afraid - how you say - no lift.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam said nothing, but leaned against the outside wall, breathing deeply.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I don't see you getting it up tonight, <I>chert,&quot; </I>she said, opening her front door and turning on the light. &quot;Still, it's your party.&quot; She strode in, turning on other lights as she went.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam staggered across the floor towards the only chair in sight and collapsed into it. The girl had by this time disappeared into another room and he had to make a supreme effort not to fall asleep before she returned.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As she stood in the light of the doorway Adam was able to see her properly for the first time. Her blonde hair was short and curly and she wore a red blouse and a knee-length skin-tight black skirt. A wide white plastic belt emphasised her small waist. She wore black mesh stockings and what he could see of her legs would have normally aroused him had he been in any other condition.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">She walked over to Adam with a slight swing of the hips, and knelt down in front of him. Her eyes were a surprisingly luminous green.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Would you please give me the two hundred now?&quot; she asked, without harshness. She ran her hand along his thigh.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I don't have any money,&quot; said Adam quite simply.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What?&quot; she said, sounding angry for the first time. Placing her hand in his inside pocket she removed a wallet and asked, &quot;Then what's this? I don't play the games,&quot; handing the thick wallet over to Adam. He opened the flap to find it was jammed full of French francs and a few English notes. Adam concluded that the colonel was obviously paid in cash for his services.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam extracted two one-hundred francs and dutifully handed them over.</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's better,&quot; she said, and disappeared into the other room.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam checked quickly through the wallet to discover a driving licence and a couple of credit cards in the colonel's real name of Albert Tomkins. He quickly looked around: a double bed that was wedged up against the far wall took up most of the floor space. Apart from the chair he was settled in, the only other pieces of furniture were a dressing table and a tiny stool with a red velvet cushion on it. A stained 1 lue carpet covered most of the wooden floor.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">To his left was a small fireplace with logs stacked neatly in one corner. All Adam wished to do was fall asleep but with what strength was left in his body, he pushed himself up, wobbled over to the fireplace and hid the wallet between the logs. He lurched back towards the chair and fell into it as the door reopened.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Again the girl stood in the light of the doorway but this time she wore only a pink negligee, which even in his present state Adam could see right through whenever she made the slightest movement. She walked slowly across the room and once more knelt down beside him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How you like it, <I>man cher? </I>Straight or the French way?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I need to rest,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;For two hundred francs you sleep in any 'otel,&quot; she said in disbelief.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I only want to be allowed to rest a few minutes,&quot; he assured her.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;L'Anglais,&quot; </I>she said, and began to try to lift Adam out of the chair and towards the bed. He stumbled and fell, landing half on and half off the corner of the mattress. She undressed him as deftly as any nurse could have done before lifting his legs up on to the</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">bed. Adam made no effort to help or hinder her. She hesitated for a moment when she saw the shoulder wound, bewildered as to what kind of accident could have caused such a gash. She rolled him over to the far side and pulled back the top sheet and blanket. Then she walked round to the other side of the bed and rolled him back again. Finally she pushed him flat on his back and covered him with the sheet and blankets.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I could still give you French if you like,&quot; she said. But Adam was already asleep.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When Adam eventually awoke the sun was already shining through the small window of the bedroom. He blinked as he took in his surroundings and tried to recall what had happened the night before. Then it all came back to him and suddenly he felt sick again at the memory. He sat on the edge of the bed but the moment he tried to stand he felt giddy and weak, and fell back down. At least he had escaped. He looked around the room but the girl was nowhere to be seen or heard. Then he remembered the wallet.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He sat bolt upright, gathering himself for a few moments before standing up again and trying to walk. Although he was still unsteady it was better than he had expected. It's only the recovery that counts, not the speed, he thought ^ironically. When he reached the fireplace he fell on his knees and searched among the logs, but the colonel's wallet was no longer there. As quickly as he could he went to the jacket hanging over the back of the chair. He checked in the inside pocket: a pen, a half-toothless comb, a passport, a driving licence, some other papers, but no wallet. He searched the outside pockets: a bunch of keys, a penknife, a few assorted coins, English and French, but that was all that was left. With a string of oaths he collapsed on to</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The front door of the flat swung open and the girl sauntered in carrying a shopping basket. She was dressed in a pretty floral skirt and white blouse that would have been suitable for any churchgoer on a Sunday morning. The basket was crammed with food.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&quot;Woken up, 'ave we, <I>cheri? Est-ce-que tu prends le petit dejeuner?&quot;</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam looked a little taken aback.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">She returned his stare. &quot;Even working girls need their breakfast, <I>n'est-cepas? </I>Sometimes is the only meal I manage all day.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where's my wallet?&quot; asked Adam coldly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;On the table,&quot; said the girl, pointing.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam glanced across the room, to see that she had left the wallet in the most obvious place.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It not necessary of you to 'ide it,&quot; she reprimanded him. &quot;Because I'm a whore don't think I'm a thief.&quot; With this she strode off into the kitchen, leaving the door open.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam suddenly knew how big Tom Thumb felt.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Coffee and croissants?&quot; she shouted.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Fantastic,&quot; said Adam. He paused. &quot;I'm sorry. I was stupid.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not to think about it,&quot; she said, &quot;fa <I>n'est </I>ran.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I still don't know your name,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My working name is Brigitte, but as you 'ave not use my services last night or this morning you can call me by my real name —Jeanne.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The door in the corner, but don't take too long, unless you like croissants cold.&quot; Adam made his way to the bathroom and found Jeanne had provided for everything a man might need: a razor, shaving cream,</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">After a warm bath and a shave - delights Adam had nearly forgotten — he felt almost back to normal again, if still somewhat fragile. He tucked a pink towel around his waist before joining Jeanne in the kitchen. The table was already laid and she was removing a warm croissant from the oven.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good body,&quot; she said, turning round and scrutinising him carefully. &quot;Much better than I usually 'ave.&quot; She put the plate down in front of him.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I am 'appy you notice,&quot; said Jeanne. &quot;I was beginning to think about you.&quot; Adam spread the roll liberally with jam and didn't speak again for several seconds.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;When 'ave you last eat?&quot; asked Jeanne as he devoured the final scrap left on the plate.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yesterday lunch. But I emptied my stomach in between.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sick, eh? You mustn't drink so much.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I think 'drained' might be a better word. Tell me, Jeanne,&quot; said Adam, looking up at her, &quot;are you still available for work?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">She checked her watch. &quot;One of my regulars is at two this afternoon, and I must be back on the streets by five. So it would 'ave to be this morning,&quot; she said matter-of-factly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, no, that's not what I meant,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You could quickly give a girl, how do you say in England? - a complex,&quot; said Jeanne. &quot;You not one of those weird ones, are you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, nothing like that,&quot; said Adam, laughing. &quot;But I would be willing to pay you another two hundred francs for your services.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What do you think he meant by that?&quot; asked Snell.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Geneva would be my guess,&quot; said Lawrence.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why Geneva?&quot; said Matthews.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm not certain,&quot; said Lawrence, &quot;but he said it had something to do with the German girl, or the bank, but I can't be sure which.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">No one spoke for some time.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Did you trace the call?&quot; asked Busch.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Only the area,&quot; said Lawrence, &quot;Neuchatel on the German-Swiss border.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good. Then we're in business again,&quot; said Sir Morris. &quot;Have you informed Interpol?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes sir, and I've personally briefed the German, French and Swiss police,&quot; added Lawrence, which was the only true word he had spoken since the meeting had begun.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No one is going to give me a second look, even if I were to empty the till in front of them,&quot; he told her.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That is the idea, <I>n'est-cepas?&quot; </I>Jeanne said, grinning.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Now, are you sure you know exactly what you have to do?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I know well.&quot; Jeanne checked herself once more in the long mirror. &quot;We 'ave rehearse like military exercise four times already.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good,&quot; said Adam. &quot;You sound as if you're ready to face the enemy. So let's begin with what in the army they call 'advance to contact'.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Jeanne took out a plastic bag from a drawer in the kitchen. The single word 'Celine' was printed across it. She handed it over to Adam. He folded the bag in four, and stuffed it into his jacket pocket before walking into the corridor. She then locked the flat door behind them, and they walked down the stairs together and out on to the pavement.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam hailed a taxi and Jeanne told the driver &quot;Tuileries gardens&quot;. Once they had arrived, Adam paid the fare and joined Jeanne on the pavement.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Bonne chance,&quot; </I>said Adam as he remained on the corner, allowing Jeanne to walk twenty yards ahead of him. Although he still felt unsteady he was able to keep up at her pace. The sun beat down on his face as he watched her walk in and out of the ornate flower beds. Her pink leather skirt and tight white sweater made almost every man she passed turn and take a second look. Some even stopped in their tracks and continued watching until she was out of sight.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The comments she could hear and Adam, twenty yards behind, couldn't, ranged from <I>&quot;Je payerais n'importe quoi,&quot; </I>which she reluctantly had to pass up, to just plain <I>&quot;Putain&quot;, </I>which Adam had told her to ignore. Her part had to be acted out, and for two</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">hundred francs she would just have to suffer the odd insult.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Jeanne reached the far side of the gardens and did not look back: she had been instructed not to turn around in any circumstances. Keep going forwards, Adam had told her. He was still twenty yards behind her when she reached the Quai des Tuileries. She waited for the lights to turn green before she crossed the wide road, keeping in the centre of a throng of people.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">At the end of the quai she turned sharp right, and for the first time could see the Louvre straight in front of her. She had been too embarrassed to admit to him that she had never been inside the building before.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Jeanne climbed the steps to the entrance hall. By the time she had reached the swing doors, Adam was approaching the bottom step. She continued on up the marble staircase with Adam still following discreetly behind.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When Jeanne reached the top of the stairs she passed the statue of the Winged Victory of Samothrace. She proceeded into the first of the large crowded rooms and began counting to herself, noting as she passed through each gallery that there was at least one attendant on duty in each, usually standing around aimlessly near one of the exits. A group of schoolchildren were studying 'The Last Supper' by Giovanni but Jeanne ignored the masterpiece and marched straight on. After passing six attendants she arrived in the room Adam had described to her so vividly. She strode purposefully into the centre and paused for a few seconds. Some of the men began to lose interest in the paintings. Satisfied by the impact she was making, she flounced over to the guard, who straightened up his jacket and smiled at her.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Dans quelle direction se trouve la peinture du seizieme siecle?&quot; </I>Jeanne asked innocently. The guard turned to point in the direction of the relevant room. The moment he turned back, Jeanne slapped him hard across the face and shouted at him at the top of her voice: <I>&quot;Quelle horreur! Pour qui est-ce que vous me punex.?&quot;<SUP>1</SUP></I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Only one person in the Icon Room didn't stop to stare at the spectacle. <I>&quot;Je vais parler a la Direction&quot; </I>she screamed, and flounced off towards the main exit. The entire charade was over in less than thirty seconds. The bemused guard remained transfixed, staring after his assailant in bewilderment.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Jeanne continued on through three centuries more quickly than H. G. Wells. She took a left turn into the sixteenth-century room as instructed and then another left brought her back into the long corridor. A few moments later, she joined Adam at the top of the marble staircase leading down to the front entrance.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As they walked back down the steps together, Adam handed her the Celine bag and was about to set off again, when two attendants waiting on the bottom step threw out their arms indicating they should halt.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Do you wish a run for it?&quot; she whispered.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Certainly not,&quot; said Adam very firmly. &quot;Just don't say anything.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Madame, excusez-moi, maisje doisfouiller votre sac.&quot;</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Allez-y pour tout ce que vousy trouvez!&quot; </I>said Jeanne.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Certainly you can search her bag,&quot; said Adam, returning to her side before Jeanne could say anything more. &quot;It's an icon, quite a good one, I think. I purchased it in a shop near the Champs-Elysees only this morning.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Vous me permettez, monsieur?&quot; </I>the senior attendant asked suspiciously.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why not?&quot; said Adam. He removed the Tsar's icon</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">from the bag and handed it over to the attendant, who seemed surprised by the way things were turning out. Two more attendants rushed over and stood on each side of Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The senior attendant asked in broken English if Adam would mind if one of the gallery's experts were to look at the painting.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Only too delighted,&quot; said Adam. &quot;It would be fascinating to have a second opinion.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The senior attendant was beginning to look unsure of himself. <I>&quot;Je dots vous demander de me suivre&quot; </I>he suggested in a tone that was suddenly less hostile. He ushered them quickly through to a little room at the side of the gallery. The attendant put the Tsar's icon in the middle of a table that dominated the room. Adam sat down and Jeanne, still bemused, took the seat beside him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'll only be a moment, sir.&quot; The senior attendant almost ran out while the two other attendants remained stationed near the door. Adam still did not attempt to speak to Jeanne although he could see that she was becoming more and more apprehensive. He shot her a little smile as they sat waiting.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When the door eventually opened, an elderly man with a scholarly face preceded the senior attendant.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Bonjour, monsieur,&quot; </I>the man began, looking at Adam, the first man who did not show an overt interest in Jeanne. &quot;I understand that you are English,&quot; and without giving either of them more than a glance, he picked up the icon.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He studied the painting carefully for some time before he spoke. Adam felt just a moment's apprehension. &quot;Most interesting. Yes, yes.&quot; One of the attendants put a hand on his truncheon.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Interesting,&quot; he repeated. &quot;I would be so bold as</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">to suggest,&quot; he hesitated, &quot;late nineteenth century, eighteen seventy, possibly eighty. Fascinating. Not that we have ever had anything quite like it at the Louvre,&quot; he added. &quot;You do realise it's an inferior copy,&quot; he said as he handed the icon back to Adam. &quot;The original Tsar's icon of St George and the Dragon hangs in the Winter Palace in Leningrad. I've seen it, you know,&quot; he added, sounding rather pleased with himself.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You certainly have,&quot; said Adam under his breath as he placed the icon back in its plastic bag. The old man bowed low to Jeanne and said as he shuffled away, &quot;Funnily enough, someone else was making enquiries about the Tsar's icon only a few weeks ago.&quot; Adam was the only person who didn't seem surprised.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I was only -&quot; began the senior attendant.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Doing your duty,&quot; completed Adam. &quot;A natural precaution, if I may say so,&quot; he added a little pompously. &quot;I can only admire the way you carried out the entire exercise.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Jeanne stared at them both, quite unable to comprehend what was happening.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You are kind, <I>monsieur,&quot; </I>said the attendant, sounding relieved. &quot;Hope you come again,&quot; he added, smiling at Jeanne.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The attendant accompanied the two of them to the entrance of the Louvre, and when they pushed through the door he stood smartly to attention and saluted.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam and Jeanne walked down the steps and into the Paris sun.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Well, now can I know what that's all about?&quot; asked Jeanne.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>

</P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;True,&quot; agreed Adam. &quot;But I had left it in their safe-keeping overnight. And without your bravura performance it might have taken considerably longer to convince the authorities that it belonged to me in the first place.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam realised from the look on her face that Jeanne had no idea what he was talking about.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You know, that my first time in the Louvre?&quot; said Jeanne linking her arm in Adam's.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You're priceless,&quot; said Adam, laughing.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That I'm not,&quot; she said, turning to face him. &quot;Two hundred francs was our bargain even if it belongs to you or not.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Correct,&quot; said Adam, taking out the colonel's wallet and extracting two hundred francs, to which he added another hundred. &quot;A well-earned bonus,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">She pocketed the money gratefully. &quot;I think I'll take an evening off,&quot; she said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam held her in his arms and kissed her on both cheeks as if she was a French general.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">She kissed him on the lips and smiled. &quot;When you next in Paris, <I>chert, </I>look me up. I owe you one - on the house.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How can you be so sure?&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You told me that Pemberton said he would never phone back if you let him down again. Not only did he phone back but he peppered you with facts. Which way did he say he was going?&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I would like to rent a car which I will be dropping off at the coast. I haven't decided which port yet,&quot; he told the girl behind the counter.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Bien sur, monsieur,&quot; </I>said the girl. &quot;Would you be kind enough to fill in the form, and we will also need your driving licence.&quot; Adam removed all the papers from his inside pocket and passed over the colonel's driving licence. He filled in the forms slowly, copying the signature off the back of the colonel's Playboy Club card. He handed over the full amount required in cash hoping it would speed up the transaction.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The girl picked up the cash and counted the notes carefully before checking the back of the licence against the signature on the form. Adam was relieved that she hadn't spotted the disparity in the dates of birth. He replaced all Albert Tomkins's documents and the wallet in his inside jacket pocket, as the girl turned round and removed an ignition key from a hook on a board behind her.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's a red Citroen, parked on the first floor,&quot; she told him. &quot;The registration number is stamped on the key ring.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam thanked her and walked quickly up to the first floor where he handed the key over to an attendant, who drove the car out of its parking space for him.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev entered the room, hardly allowing the other four members of the inner quorum of the Defence Council enough time to stand. Their faces were grim, resolute, no different from their public image - unlike Western politicians.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The General Secretary took his place at the head of the table and nodded to his colleagues to sit.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The last time the inner quorum of the Defence Council had been summoned to a meeting at an hour's notice had been at the request of Khrushchev, who was hoping to enlist support for his Cuban adventure. Brezhnev would never forget the moment when his predecessor had uncontrollably burst into tears because they forced him to order the Soviet ships to return home. From that moment, Brezhnev knew it could only be a matter of time before he would succeed Khrushchev as the leader of the Communist world. On this occasion he had no intention of bursting into tears.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He raised his eyes and stared up at the massive oil painting of Lenin reviewing an early military parade in Red Square: a picture no one other than members of the Politburo had seen since it disappeared from the Tretyakov in 1950.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">If only Lenin had realised the icon was a fake in the first place, Brezhnev reflected . . . Yet, despite the traditional Russian pastime of blaming the dead for everything that goes wrong, he knew that Vladimir Ilyich Lenin was beyond criticism. He would have to find a living scapegoat.</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Zaborski fingered a file in front of him although he knew the contents almost off by heart. &quot;The plan to locate the Tsar's icon was carried out in an exemplary fashion,&quot; he began. &quot;When the Englishman, Adam Scott, was caught and later . . . questioned&quot; - they all accepted the euphemism — &quot;by Comrade Dr Stavinsky in the privacy of our Embassy in Paris, the Englishman gave no clue as to where we would find the icon.

If it had proved possible to retrieve our icon it would also have been possible to site those very missiles along a border less than a thousand eight hundred kilometres from Seattle — two thousand kilometres from Chicago. Not only could we have made the Americans' early warning system redundant, we could have greatly improved our ability to detect any enemy missiles while they were still thousands of kilometres from our nearest border.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The General Secretary paused to see if the Chairman of the KGB had any further explanation to offer but Zaborski kept his eyes fixed on the table in front of him. When Brezhnev began again it was almost in a whisper:</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And for such a prize we would not have had to sacrifice one life, one rocket, one tank or even one bullet - because all this was ours by right. But if we fail to locate the Tsar's icon in the next thirty-six hours we will never be given such a chance again. We will have lost our one opportunity to remove a star from the American flag.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Foreign Secretary Gromyko waited until he was certain Brezhnev had completed his statement before he enquired:</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;If I may ask, Comrade Chairman, why was Major Romanov allowed to continue being involved in such a sensitive operation after it was suspected he had killed&quot; - with this he glanced down at the papers in front of him - &quot;Researcher Petrova?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">There was a timid knock on the door. All the faces round the table showed surprise. The Minister of Defence had given specific orders that no one was to interrupt them.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Come,&quot; shouted Brezhnev.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The great door inched open and a secretary appeared in the gap; the thin piece of paper in his hand shook, betraying his nervousness. The Minister of Defence waved him in as Brezhnev had no intention of turning around to see who it was. The secretary walked quickly towards them. As soon as he had deposited the telex on the table he turned, and almost ran from the room.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brezhnev slowly unfolded his tortoise-shell glasses before picking up the missive. Once he had read through the cable, he looked up at the expectant faces in front of him. &quot;It seems an Englishman left an icon in the Louvre and picked it back up this morning.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The blood quickly drained from Zaborski's face.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The four ministers round the table all began talking together, until Brezhnev raised the vast palm of his right hand. There was immediate silence. &quot;I intend to continue my plans on the assumption that it will still be us who get to the Englishman first.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Brezhnev turned towards hi&pound; Foreign Minister. &quot;Alert all our Western Ambassadors to be prepared to brief the Foreign Ministers of the country in which they reside on the full implications of honouring the amendment to the treaty.

The General Secretary finally turned to the Chairman of the KGB. &quot;Do we still have advertising space booked in every major newspaper in the West?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, Comrade General Secretary,&quot; replied Zabor-ski. &quot;But I cannot be certain they will be willing to print the statement as you have prepared it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then pay every one of them in advance,&quot; said Brezhnev. &quot;Few Western editors will withdraw a full page advertisement when they already have the money in the bank.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam wound down the car window and immediately the warm summer air flooded in. He had decided to avoid the main road to Calais in favour of the Nl to Boulogne. He still considered it possible that Romanov would have men watching at every port on the Channel coast although he doubted if Lawrence or the Americans were aware he had escaped.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Once he had cleared the outskirts of the French capital, he was confident that he could average seventy kilometres an hour the rest of the way. But what he hadn't anticipated was running into a hundred or more cyclists, daubed in their various stripes of reds, greens, blues, blacks and golds, bobbing along ahead of him. As he drifted past them Adam was able accurately to check that they were averaging 40 miles an hour.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Having followed the build-up for the forthcoming World Cup in Britain, he was also able to make out the national colours of France, Germany, Italy and even Portugal. He honked his horn loudly as he passed a group of four men quite near the front, clad in red, white and blue T-shirts with the British team van driving just ahead of them. A few moments later he had overtaken the leaders, and was able to put the car back into fourth gear.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He switched on the car radio and fiddled around for some time before he tuned in to the Home Service of the BBC. He settled back to listen to the news in English for the first time in days. The usual reports of long strikes, high inflation, and of England's chances when the second Test Match at Lord's resumed after the rest day almost made him feel he was already back home, and then he nearly swerved off the road and into a tree.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The news reader reported matter-of-factly that a young RAF pilot had been found dead in a field off the Auxerre/Dijon road after his plane had crashed in mysterious circumstances. No more details were available at the present time. Adam cursed and slammed his fist on the steering wheel at the thought of Alan Banks becoming another victim of Romanov. He tapped the icon and cursed again.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It was foolish of you to contact me, young man,&quot; said the old banker. &quot;You're not exactly a hero of the Soviet Union at the present time.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov slammed the phone down. In Moscow, the old Russian banker wound the tape back.

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm just outside Paris on my way back home,&quot; Adam said. &quot;Are you sticking to the schedule you outlined on the bus?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sure am. Why, are you still desperate to spend the night with me?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sure am,&quot; said Adam, mimicking her. &quot;But when do you get back home?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The orchestra is taking the ferry from Dunkerque at six thirty tonight. Can you join us?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No,&quot; said Adam. &quot;I have to &quot;eturn by another route. But, Robin, when I reach London can you put me up for the night?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Sounds like an offer I can't refuse,&quot; she said, and then repeated her address to be sure he had time to write it down. &quot;When shall I expect you?&quot; she asked.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam jumped back in the car and drove on until he reached the outskirts of Beauvais, where he decided to stop at a wayside <I>routier </I>for a quick lunch.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">According to the timetable he had picked up from the Hertz counter, the ferry he wanted to catch was due to leave Boulogne at three o'clock, so he felt confident he would still make it with about an hour to spare.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He sat hidden in an alcove by the window enjoying what might have been described in any English pub as a ploughman's lunch. With each mouthful he became aware that the French ploughmen demanded far higher standards of their innkeepers than any English farmworker was happy to settle for.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As he waited for his coffee he took out Albert Tomkins's papers from his inside pocket and began to scrutinise them carefully. He was interested to discover exactly how many weeks he had been claiming unemployment benefit.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Through the window of the inn he watched the first of the cyclists as they pedalled by. The athletes' muscles strained in their determination to remain among the leading group. As they shot through Beauvais, Adam was amused by the fact that they were all breaking the speed limit. The sight of the competitors reminded him that he was expected to attend the final part of his medical for the Foreign Office tomorrow afternoon.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Does Mentor think I'm that naive?&quot; said Romanov to his Parisian colleague. &quot;We already know from our agent in Amsterdam that he's now on his way towards the French coast.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then why should Mentor want to send you in the opposite direction?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Because it must be him who's been briefing the Americans,&quot; said Romanov coldly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov turned to the colonel who was standing by his side. &quot;We know it can't be Dunkerque, so how many other possibilities are we left with?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Cherbourg, Le Havre, Dieppe, Boulogne, or Calais,&quot; replied the colonel, looking down at the map laid out on the table in front of him. &quot;My bet would be Calais,&quot; he added.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; said Romanov, &quot;Captain Scott is not quite <I>that </I>simple. And as the motorway takes you direct to Calais, the captain will expect us to have that part of his route well covered. I think our friend will try Boulogne or Dieppe first.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He checked the timetable the Second Secretary had supplied him with. &quot;The first boat he could hope to catch leaves Boulogne for Dover at three, and then there's one from Dieppe to Newhaven at five.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov also checked Calais and Le Havre. &quot;Good. Calais left at twelve this morning, and as he phoned the girl after twelve he had no hope of catching that one. And Le Havre doesn't leave until seven fifteen tonight, and he won't risk leaving it that late. Assuming we can beat him to the coast, Colonel, I think Captain Scott is once again within our grasp.&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Once Adam had left the <I>relais routier </I>it was only minutes before he began to catch up with the straggling cyclists as they pedalled on towards Abbeville. His thoughts reverted to Romanov. Adam suspected that his agents would have the airports, stations, autoroute and ports well covered. But even the KGB could not be in fifty places at once.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam took the Boulogne route out of Abbeville but had to remain in the centre of the road to avoid the bobbing cyclists. He even had to slam his brakes on once when an Italian and a British rider collided in front of him. The two men, both travelling at some speed, were thrown unceremoniously to the ground. The British rider remained ominously still on the side of the road.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam felt guilty about not stopping to help his fellow countryman but feared that any hold-up might prevent him catching his boat. He spotted the British team van ahead of him and speeded up until he was alongside. Adam waved at the driver to pull over.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The man behind the steering wheel looked surprised but stopped and wound down the window. Adam pulled up in front of him, leaped out of his car and ran to the van.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;One of your chaps has had an accident about a mile back,&quot; shouted Adam, pointing towards Paris.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thanks, mate,&quot; said the driver who turned round and sped quickly back down the road.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam continued to drive on at a sedate speed until he had passed all the leaders. Then, once again, he put the car into top gear. A signpost informed him that it was now only thirty-two kilometres to Boulogne: he would still make the three o'clock sailing comfortably.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He began to imagine what it might be like if he could survive beyond Monday. Would his life ever be routine again? Jogs in the park, Foreign Office interviews, workouts with the sergeant major and even the acknowledgment of the part he had played in delivering the icon into safe hands. The problem was that he hadn't yet decided who had safe hands.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A helicopter looking like a squat green bullfrog swept over him; now that would be the ideal way to get back to England, Adam considered. With help like that he could even make it to Harley Street in time for his medical for the Foreign Office.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He watched as the helicopter turned and swung back towards him. He assumed that there must be a military airport somewhere nearby, but couldn't remember one from his days in the army. A few moments later he heard the whirl of the blades as the helicopter flew across his path at a considerably lower level. Adam gripped the wheel of the car until his knuckles went white as an impossible thought crossed his mind. As he did so the helicopter swung back again, and this time flew straight towards him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam wound the window up and crouching over the top of the steering wheel, stared into the sky. He could see the silhouetted outline of three figures sitting in the helicopter cockpit. He banged his fist on the steering wheel in anger as he realised how easy it must have been for them to trace a car signed for in the one name they would immediately recognise. He could sense Romanov's smile of triumph as the chopper hovered above him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam saw a signpost looming up ahead of him and swung off the main road towards a village called Fleureville. He pushed the speedometer well over ninety causing the little car to skid along country lanes.</FONT><BR>
</P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The helicopter likewise swung to the right, and dog-like followed his path.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam took a hard left and onlyjust avoided colliding with a tractor coming out of a newly ploughed field. He took the next right and headed back towards the Boulogne road, desperately trying to think what he could do next. Every time he looked up the helicopter was there above him: he felt like a puppet dancing on the end of Romanov's string.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A road sign depicting a low tunnel ahead flashed past them and Adam dismissed the melodramatic idea of trying to make them crash; he didn't need reminding that it was he who was proving to be the novice.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When he first saw the tunnel he estimated it to be sixty or seventy yards in length. Although it was quite wide, a double-decker bus could not have entered it without the upstairs passengers ending up walking on the bridge.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">For a brief moment Adam actually felt safe. He slammed on the little Citroen's brakes and skidded to a halt about thirty yards from the end of the tunnel. The car ended up almost scraping the side of the wall. He switched on his side lights and they flashed brightly in the darkness. For several seconds he watched as approaching cars slowed down before safely overtaking him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">At last he jumped out of the car and ran to the end of the tunnel where he pinned himself against the wall. The helicopter had travelled on some way, but was already turning back, and heading straight towards the tunnel. Adam watched it fly over his head, and moments later heard it turn again. As he waited, two hitch-hikers passed by on the other side, chatting away to themselves, oblivious to Adam's predicament.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He looked across desperately at the two young men</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">376</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">and shouted, &quot;Were you hoping to thumb a lift?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes,&quot; they called back in unison. Adam staggered across the road to join them.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Adam heard one of them ask but he could hardly make out which one as his eyes had not yet become accustomed to the darkness.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, I'm not,&quot; Adam explained simply. &quot;I drank too much wine at lunch and because of a cycle race the road is just crawling with police. I'm sure to be picked up if I go much further. Can either of you drive?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I only have my Canadian licence,&quot; said the taller of the two youths. &quot;And in any case we are heading for Paris and your car is facing the opposite direction.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's a Hertz Rent-a-Car,&quot; Adam explained. &quot;I picked it up on the Rue St Ferdinand this morning, and I have to return it by seven tonight. I don't think I can make it in my present state.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The two young men looked at him apprehensively. &quot;I will give you both one hundred francs if you will return it safely for me. You see I can't afford to lose my licence, I'm a commercial traveller,&quot; Adam explained. Neither of them spoke. &quot;My papers are all in order, I can assure you.&quot; Adam handed them over to the taller man who crossed back over the road and used the car lights to study Albert Tomkins's licence and insurance before carying on a conversation with his friend.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam could hear the helicopter blades whirling above the tunnel entrance.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We don't need the hundred francs,&quot; the taller one said eventually. &quot;But we will need a note from you explaining why we are returning the car to Hertz in Paris on your behalf.&quot; Adam pulled out the colonel's</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Do you want to come back to Paris with us?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam hesitated fractionally. Couldn't they hear the noise too? &quot;No. I have to get to Boulogne.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We could drive you to Boulogne and still have enough time to take the car to Paris.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, no. That's very considerate. I can take care of myself as long as I feel confident that the car will be delivered back as soon as possible.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The taller one shrugged while his companion opened a rear door and threw their rucksacks on the back seat. Adam remained in the tunnel while they started up the engine. He could hear the purr of the helicopter blades change cadence: it had to be descending to land in a nearby field.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Go, go, for God's sake go, he wanted to shout as the car shot forward towards Boulogne. He watched them travel down the road for about a hundred yards before turning in at a farm entrance, reversing, and heading back towards the tunnel. They tooted as they passed him in the dark, disappearing in the direction of Paris. Adam sank down on to his knees with relief and was about to pick himself up and start walking towards Boulogne when he saw two figures silhouetted at the far entrance of the tunnel. Against the clear blue sky he could make out the outline of two tall, thin men. They stood peering into the tunnel. Adam didn't move a muscle, praying they hadn't spotted him.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">And then suddenly one of them started walking towards him, while the other remained motionless. Adam knew he could not hope to escape again. He knelt there cursing his own stupidity. In seconds they would be able to see him clearly.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Don't let's waste any more valuable time, Marvin, we already know that the limey bastard's heading back to Paris.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I just thought perhaps . . .&quot; began the one called Marvin in a Southern drawl.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Leave the thinking to me. Now let's get back to the chopper before we lose him.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When Marvin was only twenty yards away from Adam he suddenly stopped, turned around and began running back.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam remained rooted to the spot for several minutes. A cold, clammy sweat had enveloped his body the moment he realised his latest pursuer was not Romanov. If one of them hadn't referred to him as a 'limey bastard', Adam would have happily given himself up. Suddenly he had become painfully aware of the diflerence between fact and fiction: he had been left with no friends.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam did not move again until he heard the helicopter rise above him. Peering out, he could see outlined against the arc of the tunnel the Americans heading back in the direction of Paris.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He staggered outside and put a hand across his eyes. The sunlight seemed much fiercer than a few minutes before. What next? He had less than an hour to catch the boat but no longer had any transport. He wasn't sure whether to thumb lifts, search for a bus stop, or simply get as far away from the main road as possible. His eyes were continually looking up into the sky. How long before they reached the car, and realised it was not him inside?</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Cyclists began to pass him again as he jogged slowly towards Boulogne. He kept on moving, and even found enough strength to cheer the British competitors as they pedalled by. The British team van followed close</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">behind and Adam gave it the thumbs-up sign. To his surprise the van came to a halt in front of him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The driver wound down the window. &quot;Weren't you the fellow who stopped me back in Abbeville?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's right,&quot; said Adam. &quot;Has your man recovered?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, he's resting in the back - pulled ligament. What happened to your car?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Broke down about a mile back,&quot; said Adam, shrugging philosophically.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Bad luck. Can I give you a lift?&quot; the man asked. &quot;We're only going as far as Boulogne on this stage, but jump in if it will help.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Adam, with the relief of a bearded beatnik who has found the one person willing to stop to pick him up. The driver leaned across and pushed open the door for him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Before climbing in, Adam shielded his eyes and once more looked up into the sky. The helicopter was nowhere to be seen - although he knew it couldn't be long before it returned. They would quickly work out that there was only one place where the switch could possibly have been made.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My name's Bob,&quot; said the track-suited driver, thrusting out his free hand. &quot;I'm the British team manager.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Mine's Adam.&quot; He shook the other's hand warmly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where are you heading?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Boulogne,&quot; said Adam, &quot;and with luck I could still make my crossing by three.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We should be there about two thirty,&quot; said Bob. &quot;We have to be: the afternoon stage starts at three.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Will your man be able to ride?&quot; asked Adam, pointing over his shoulder.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, he won't be competing in this race again,&quot; said</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">the team manager. &quot;He's pulled a ligament in the back of his leg, and they always take a couple of weeks to heal properly. I shall have to leave him in Boulogne and complete the last leg myself. You don't ride by any chance, do you?&quot; Bob asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No,&quot; said Adam. &quot;Run a little, but haven't done a lot on wheels since my sister crashed the family tricycle.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We're still in with a chance for the bronze,&quot; Bob said, as they overtook the British riders once more.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam gave them the thumbs-up sign and then looked over his shoulder through the back window. He was thankful to see that there was still no sign of the helicopter as they drove into the outskirts of Boulogne. Bob took him all the way up to the dockside. &quot;Hope you get that bronze medal,&quot; said Adam as he jumped out of the van. &quot;And thanks again. Good luck with the next stage.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam checked his watch: twenty minutes before the boat was due to sail. He wondered if it was too much time. He walked over to the booking office and waited in a short line before buying a passenger ticket. He kept looking round to check if anyone was watching him, but no one seemed to be showing the slightest interest. Once he had purchased his ticket he headed towards the ship and had just begun to start whistling a tuneless version of 'Yesterday' when a black speck appeared in the distance. There was no mistaking it -the sound was enough.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam looked up at the gangway which led to the deck of the ship now only yards away from him, and then back to the speck as it grew larger and larger in the sky. He checked his watch: the ship was due to leave in twelve minutes - still time enough for his pursuers to land the helicopter and get on board. If he</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">climbed on and the Americans followed, they were bound to discover him. But if the Americans got on and he stayed off that would still give him enough time to reach Dieppe before the next sailing . . .</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam jogged quickly back towards the large crowd that was hanging about waiting for the start of the next stage of the road race. As he did so the helicopter swept overhead and started hovering, like a kestrel that is looking for a mouse.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I thought you said you were desperate to be on that ship.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam swung round, his fist clenched, only to face the British team manager now dressed in riding gear.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Changed my mind,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Wouldn't care to drive the van for us on the next stage?&quot; said Bob hopefully.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where does the next stage go?&quot; Adam asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Dunkerque,&quot; said the team manager.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam tried to remember what time Robin had said her boat left from Dunkerque.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Six minutes,&quot; </I>a voice said over the loudspeaker.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Okay,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good,&quot; said the team manager. &quot;Then follow me.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam ran behind the team manager as he headed towards the van.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Quatre minutes/' </I>Adam heard clearly as Bob unlocked the van and handed him the keys. He stared towards the ship. The two Americans were emerging from the ticket office.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Deux minutes.&quot;</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam jumped up into the driver's seat, looked over towards the boat and watched Marvin and his colleague stride up the gangplank.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>&quot;Une minute.&quot;</I></FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good luck,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Bob, and ran to the starting line to join his team mates who were anxiously holding his bike.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>&quot;Trente secondes.&quot;</I></FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;On your marks, set...&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The ship's fog horn belched out a droning note and the two Americans started their journey to Dover. A second later, the gun went off as Adam put the van into second gear and headed towards Dunkerque.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam sat in the little dockside cafe waiting for the coach to appear. The team van had been left at the checkpoint and he was now ready to board the ship but he still needed to be sure Robin was on it. The coach trundled in with only ten minutes to spare and Adam greeted her as she stepped off.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Just couldn't keep away from me, could you?&quot; said Robin.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam burst out laughing and threw his arms almost round her.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's good to see you,&quot; he said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I thought you were going back to England by some mysterious route, you know, spy rocket or something even more exotic.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I wanted to,&quot; said Adam, &quot;but the Americans were sitting at the controls just as I decided to climb aboard.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The Americans?&quot; she said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'll explain everything once we're on board,&quot; said Adam. Neither of them noticed the young agent who had trailed Robin from Berlin. He sat in a phone booth on the far side of the dock and dialled an overseas number.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I wouldn't have believed a word of it a week ago,&quot; she said, &quot;but for two things.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Namely?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;First, a senior official of the Foreign Office returned Dudley Hulme's passport to him in Amsterdam. Which reminds me to give you yours back.&quot; She rummaged around in her bag for a few moments before taking out a dark blue passport and handing it to him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And what's the second thing?&quot; said Adam, taking the passport gratefully.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I had the doubtful pleasure of coming face to face with Comrade Romanov, and I have no desire to do so again.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I intend to meet him again,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why?&quot; asked Robin.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Because I'm going to kill him.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov and Pollard arrived in Dover a few minutes before the ferry was due to dock. They waited expectantly. Romanov stationed himself so that he could look through the customs hall window and watch the ferry as it sailed into Dover harbour. He had found the perfect spot behind a coffee-vending machine from which he could observe everyone who entered or left the customs hall, while at the same time remaining hidden from view.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Just in case he should act out of character for a change,&quot; said Romanov, &quot;and fails to go in a straight line, you will cover the car exit and report back to me if you notice anything unusual.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The colonel left Romanov secreted behind the coffee machine while he selected a place for himself on the dockside where he could watch the cars as they entered the customs area some fifty yards from the exit gate. If Scott did leave the ferry in a car Pollard would easily</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">have enough time to run back and warn Romanov before Scott could hope to clear customs and reach the main gate. At least this would be the one place Scott couldn't risk hiding in the trunk. Both men waited.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The captain switched on his ship-to-shore radio to channel nine and spoke clearly into the small microphone. &quot;This is the MV <I>Chantilly </I>calling the Dover Harbour Master. Are you receiving me?&quot; He waited for a moment, flicked up the switch in front of him and then heard: &quot;Harbour Master to MV <I>Chantilly. </I>Receiving you loud and clear, over.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;This is the captain speaking. We have an emergency. A male passenger has fallen out of a lifeboat on to the deck and contracted multiple injuries to his arms and legs.&quot; Adam groaned as the captain continued. &quot;I shall need an ambulance to be standing by at the quayside to take him to the nearest hospital once we have docked. Over.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Message received and understood, Captain. An ambulance will be waiting for you when the ship docks. Over and out.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Everything will be all right, my dear,&quot; said Robin in a gentle voice that Adam had not heard before. &quot;As soon as we arrive, they are going to see you are taken straight to a hospital.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I must get back to the bridge,&quot; said the captain gruffly. &quot;I shall instruct two stewards to bring a stretcher down for your brother.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you, Captain,&quot; said Robin. &quot;You have been most helpful.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It's quite all right, miss. You did say your brother?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, Captain,&quot; said Robin.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I've tried,&quot; said Robin, sighing. &quot;You couldn't believe how many times I've tried, Captain, but I'm afraid he takes after my father.&quot; Adam held on to his leg and groaned again.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Um,&quot; said the captain, looking down at the gash across Adam's shoulder. &quot;Let's hope it turns out not to be serious. Good luck,&quot; he added.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you again, Captain,&quot; said Robin as she watched the cabin door close behind them.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So far, so good,&quot; said Robin. &quot;Now let's hope the second part of the plan works. By the way, your breath smells foul.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What do you expect after making me swirl whisky round in my mouth for twenty minutes and then forcing me to spit it out all over my own clothes?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam was lifted carefully on to the stretcher, then carried out on to the deck by two stewards. They waited at the head of the gangplank and placed Adam gently on the deck while a customs officer, accompanied by an immigration officer, ran up to join them. Robin handed over his passport. The immigration officer flicked through the pages and checked the photograph.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Quite a good likeness for a change,&quot; said Robin, &quot;but I'm afraid they may have to include this under 'unusual scars' in the next edition.&quot; She threw back the blanket dramatically and revealed the deep gash on Adam's shoulder. Adam looked suitably crestfallen.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Is he bringing anything in with him that needs to be declared?&quot; asked the customs official. Adam couldn't stop himself from touching the icon.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Right. Thank you, miss. Better see he gets off to the hospital then,&quot; said the officer, suddenly aware that a restless mob of people were waiting at the top of the gangplank to disembark.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The two stewards carried Adam down the gangplank. An attendant was on hand to check his wound. Adam waved gamely at Robin as they placed him in the ambulance.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov spotted her as she came through customs. &quot;Now I know exactly how Captain Scott hopes to get off the ship, and we will be waiting for him when he least expects it. Go and hire a car to take us to London,&quot; he barked at the colonel.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The ambulance shot out through the customs gates with its lights full on and bells ringing. By the time they had arrived at The Royal Victoria Hospital the attendant had watched his patient's remarkable recovery en route with disbelief. He was beginning to feel that the captain might have exaggerated the scale of the emergency.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov stood by the gate and smiled as he watched the coach carrying the musicians emerge from the deep black hole of the ship and take its turn in the queue for customs.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As Romanov's eyes ranged up and down the coach he quickly picked out Robin Beresford. Just as he had anticipated, the double bass was propped up by her side,' making it impossible to see who was seated next to her.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You won't pull that one on me a second time,&quot; Romanov muttered, just as the colonel appeared by his side, red in the face.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where's the car?&quot; the Russian demanded, not taking his eye from the coach.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I've booked one provisionally,&quot; said the colonel, &quot;but they'll need your international licence. I forgot Scott has got mine, along with all my other papers.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You stay put,&quot; said Romanov, &quot;and make sure Scott doesn't try to get off that coach.&quot; Romanov ran to the Avis desk at the same time as Adam was being wheeled into a little cubicle to be examined by the duty registrar.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The young doctor leant over his patient for several minutes. He had never seen a wound quite like it before. He examined him carefully, before making any comment. &quot;Nasty lacerations,&quot; he said finally, cleaning Adam's shoulder wound. &quot;Can you circle your arm?&quot; Adam turned the arm in a full circle and straightened it again. &quot;Good. No break, at least.&quot; He continued to clean the wound.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm going to put some iodine on the open cut and it may sting a little,&quot; said the doctor. He cleaned up both elbows before placing a plaster on them.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That didn't happen today, did it?&quot; he asked, staring at Adam's half-healed shoulder.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No,&quot; said Adam, without offering any explanations.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You have been in the wars lately. I'm going to give you an anti-tetanus injection.&quot; Adam turned white. &quot;Funny how many grown men don't care for the sight of a needle,&quot; said the doctor. Adam groaned.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Now that wasn't so bad, was it?&quot; he coaxed as he placed a large bandage over the top of the shoulder. &quot;Do you have someone to collect you?&quot; the doctor asked finally.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, thank you,&quot; said Adam. &quot;My wife is waiting for me.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov sat in the driver's seat and watched the coach clear customs. He followed it out of the main gate and on to the A2 in the direction of London.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Are we going to intercept them on the way?&quot; asked Pollard nervously.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not this time,&quot; said Romanov without explanation. He never once allowed the coach out of his sight all the way into the capital.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam walked out of the hospital and checked to see that no one was following him. The only people in sight were a man in a blue duffle coat walking in the opposite direction, and a nurse scurrying past him, looking anxiously at her watch. Satisfied, he took a taxi to Dover Priory station and purchased a single ticket to London.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;When's the next train?&quot; he asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Should be in any moment,&quot; said the ticket collector, .checking his watch. &quot;The ship docked about forty minutes ago, but it always takes a bit of time to unload all the passengers.&quot; Adam walked on to the platform, keeping a wary eye out for anyone acting suspiciously. He didn't notice the dark-haired man in a blue duffle coat leaning against the shutters of the W. H. Smith's stall reading the <I>Evening Standard.</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam's thoughts returned to Robin getting safely home. The London train drew in, packed with passengers who had been on the boat. Adam moved out of the shadows and jumped on, selecting a carriage full of teddy-boys who were apparently returning from a day at the seaside. He thought it would be unlikely anyone else would wish to join them. He. took the only</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">By the time the train had pulled into Canterbury no one had entered the carriage other than the ticket collector, who discreetly ignored the fact that one of the youths only presented him with a platform ticket for his inspection. Adam felt strangely safe in the corner of that particular compartment even when he noticed a dark-haired man in a blue duffle coat pass by the compartment door and look in carefully.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam was jolted out of his thoughts by a noisy claim made by one of the gang who during the journey had given every appearance of being its leader.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;There's a foul smell in this compartment,&quot; he declared, sniffing loudly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I agree, Terry,&quot; said his mate who was sitting next to Adam and also began imitating the sniff. &quot;And I think it's quite close to me.&quot; Adam glanced towards the young man whose black leather jacket was covered in small shiny studs. The words 'Heil Hitler' were printed right across his back. He got up and pulled open the window. &quot;Perhaps some fresh air will help,&quot; he said as he sat back down. In moments all four of them were sniffing. &quot;Sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff, I think the smell's getting worse,&quot; their leader concluded.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It must be me,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The sniffing stopped and the youths stared towards the corner in disbelief - momentarily silenced by Adam's offensive.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I didn't have time to take a shower after my judo lesson,&quot; Adam added before any of them had found time to recover their speech.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Any good at judo, are you?&quot; asked the one sitting next to him.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">                     </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Passable,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What belt are you?&quot; demanded Terry belligerently. &quot;Go on, tell me, a black belt, I knew it,&quot; he added, sniggering.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I haven't been a black belt for nearly eight years,&quot; said Adam casually, &quot;but I've been recently awarded my second Dan.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A look of apprehension came over three of the four faces.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I was thinkin' about taking up judo myself,&quot; continued the leader, straightening his arm. &quot;How long does it take to get any good at it?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I've been working at it three hours a day for nearly twelve years and I'm still not up to Olympic standard,&quot; replied Adam as he watched the dark-haired man in the duffle coat pass by the compartment again. This time he stared directly at Adam before quickly moving on.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Of course,&quot; continued Adam, &quot;the only quality you really need if you are thinking of taking up judo seriously is nerve, and no one can teach you that. You've either got it or you haven't.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I've got nerve,&quot; said Terry belligerently. &quot;I'm not frightened of nothin'. Or nobody,&quot; he added, staring straight at Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good,&quot; said Adam. &quot;Because you may be given the chance to prove your claim before this journey is over.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What're you getting at?&quot; said the 'Heil Hitler'-clad youth. &quot;You trying to pick a fight or somethin'?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No,&quot; said Adam calmly. &quot;It's just that at this moment I'm being followed by a private detective who is hoping to catch me spending the night with his client's wife.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And are you?&quot; asked the leader.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam nodded conspiratorially.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nice bit of skirt when you've got it in the hay?&quot; Terry asked, leering.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not bad,&quot; said Adam, &quot;not bad at all.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Then just point out this detective git and we'll sew him up for the night,&quot; said the leader, thrusting his left hand on his right bicep while pulling up h<SUP>;</SUP>s clenched fist with gusto.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That might turn out to be overkill,&quot; said Adam. &quot;But if you could delay him for a little when I get off at Waterloo East, that should at least give me enough time to warn the lady.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Say no more, squire,&quot; said the leader. &quot;Your friend the Peeping Tom will be delivered to Charing Cross all trussed up like a British Rail parcel.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The other three youths burst out laughing and Adam was beginning to realise that it had taken Romanov only one week to turn him into a storyteller almost in the class of Robin's late father.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">' &quot;That's him,&quot; whispered Adam as the duffle-coated man passed by a third time. They all looked out into the corridor but only saw his retreating back.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The train is due to arrive at Waterloo East in eleven minutes' time,&quot; said Adam, checking his watch. &quot;So what I suggest we do is ... if you still think you're up to it, that is.&quot; All four of his new-found team leaned forward in eager anticipation.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A few minutes later Adam slipped out of the compartment, leaving the door wide open. He started to walk slowly in the direction opposite to that in which the man in the blue duffle coat had last been seen going. When Adam reached the end of the carriage,</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">he turned to find the man was now following quickly behind. As he passed the open compartment the man smiled and raised a hand to attract Adam's attention but two leather-clad arms shot out and the man disappeared inside the compartment with a muffled cry. The door was slammed and the blinds pulled quickly down. The train drew slowly into Waterloo East station.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Robin remained tense as the bus drew into Wigmore Street and came to a halt outside the RPO headquarters. A dark green Ford had been following them for at least thirty miles, and once she had become aware of it she had not dared to move from her seat.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As she dragged her double bass off the bus she looked back to see that the Ford had stopped about fifty yards down the road and turned off its headlights. Romanov was standing on the pavement looking like a caged animal that wanted to spring. Another man that Robin did not recognise remained seated behind the wheel. Adam had warned her not to turn around at any time but to walk straight into the RPO headquarters without stopping. Even so, she couldn't resist looking Romanov in the eye and shaking her head. Romanov continued to stare impassively ahead of him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When the last musician had left the bus Romanov and 'the Colonel' searched up and down the inside of the vehicle and then finally the trunk, despite noisy protests from the driver. Robin eyed them nervously from an upstairs window, as the two of them jumped back into the green Ford and drove off. She continued watching the car until the back lights had faded away in the darkness.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">395</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The colonel swung out of Wigmore Street towards Baker Street, bringing the car to a halt opposite Baker Street station. Romanov jumped out, walked into a vacant telephone booth and started thumbing through the A-D directory. Only one Robin Beresford was listed and it was the same address as the young agent had read over to him. He dialled the number and after ten unanswered rings smiled at the realisation that she lived alone. He was not surprised.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What now?&quot; asked the colonel, once Romanov was back at the car.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where's Argyle Crescent, NWS?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Must be out towards Hampstead,&quot; said the colonel. &quot;But I'll first check in the London A to Z roadmap. What's the plan?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Rather than waiting for Miss Beresford to come out we will be waiting for her to come in,&quot; said Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Robin slipped out of the back of the RPO headquarters about thirty minutes later. She zig-zagged around Portman Square then walked as quickly as she knew how up to the corner. She kept telling herself that Romanov was not coming back, but she found it impossible to stop herself from shaking all the same. She hailed a taxi and was relieved to see one draw up to her side almost immediately. She checked the driver and the back seat, as Adam had advised her, then climbed in.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov arrived at Robin's front door a few moments after she had hailed the taxi. The name holder on the side wall indicated that Miss Beresford resided on the fourth floor.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The door itself would have proved no problem to any self-respecting petty thief in Moscow and</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov had secured entry within moments. The colonel quickly joined him before they proceeded silently up the dark staircase to the fourth floor.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov slipped the Yale lock faster than Robin could have opened it with her own key. Once inside he quickly checked the layout of the room and assured himself no one else was in the flat.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The colonel stood around fidgeting. &quot;Settle down, Colonel. I don't expect the lady will keep us waiting too long.&quot; The colonel laughed nervously.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The taxi drew up outside the house that Robin pointed to. She then jumped out and tipped the cabbie extra because the bewitching hour had long passed and at last she felt safe. It seemed ages since she had been home. All she was looking forward to now was a hot bath and a good night's sleep.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam stepped off the train at Waterloo East a little after midnight and was pleased to find the underground was still running. He had avoided going on to Charing Cross, as he couldn't be sure which side would have a reception committee waiting for him. He produced a season ticket for the West Indian on the ticket barrier and waited around on the underground platform for some time before the train eventually drew in.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">There were several stations between Waterloo and his destination, and even at this time of night there seemed to be a prolonged stop at every one. Several late-night revellers got in at the Embankment, more still at Leicester Square. Adam waited nervously at each station, now aware that he must have caught the last train. He only hoped Robin had carried out his instructions faithfully. He looked around the carriage he was sitting in. It was full of night people, waiters,</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">397</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">nurses, party returners, drunks — even a traffic warden. The train eventually pulled into his station, at twelve forty.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The ticket collector was able to give him the directions he needed. It was a relief to reach his final destination so quickly because there was no one else around to ask the way at that time of night. He moved slowly towards number twenty-three. There were no lights on in the house. He opened the swinging gate and walked straight up the path, removed the bunch of keys from his pocket, putting the Chubb one in the lock. Adam pushed open the door cautiously and then closed it noiselessly behind him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A little after twelve ten the last train from Dover pulled into Charing Cross station. As Adam was nowhere to be seen, Lawrence instructed his driver to take him back to Cheyne Walk. He couldn't understand why the agent whom he had hand-picked hadn't reported in. When Lawrence arrived back at the flat he put the key in his lock, hoping to find Adam was already waiting for him.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He pushed open the swinging gate and made his way slowly up the path in the pitch darkness. Once he reached the corner of the house he searched for the third stone on the left. When he located the correct stone where he always left his spare key, he pulled it up with his fingers and felt around in the dirt. To his relief the key was still in place. Like a burglar he pushed it into the lock quietly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He crept into the hall and closed the door behind him, switched on the light and began to climb the stairs. Once he had reached the landing he switched off the hall light, turned the knob of his bedroom door and pushed.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As he stepped in an arm circled his throat like a whiplash and he was thrown to the ground with tremendous force. He felt a knee pressed hard against his spine and his arm was jerked up behind his back into a half nelson. He lay on the floor, flat on his face, hardly able to move or even breathe. The light switch flashed on and the first thing Adam saw was the colonel.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Don't kill me, Captain Scott sir, don't kill me,&quot; he implored.</FONT><BR>
</P>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I have no intention of doing so, Mr Tomkins,&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">said Adam calmly. &quot;But first, where is your esteemed employer at this moment?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam kept his knee firmly in the middle of the colonel's back and pressed his arm a few inches higher before the colonel bleated out, &quot;He went back to the Embassy once he realised the girl wasn't going to return to the flat.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Just as I planned,&quot; said Adam, but he didn't lessen the pressure on the colonel's arm as he described in vivid detail everything that would now be expected of him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The colonel's face showed disbelief. &quot;But that will be impossible,&quot; he said. &quot;I mean, he's bound to noti - Ahhh.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The colonel felt his arm forced higher up his back. &quot;You could carry out the whole exercise in less than ten minutes and he need never be any the wiser,&quot; said Adam. &quot;However, I feel that it's only fair that you should be rewarded for your effort.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; said the fawning colonel.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;If you succeed in delivering the one item I require and carry out my instructions to the letter you will be given in exchange your passport, driving licence, papers, wallet and a guarantee of no prosecution for your past treachery. But if, on the other hand, you fail to turn up by nine thirty tomorrow morning with the object of my desire,&quot; said Adam, &quot;all those documents will be placed thirty minutes later on the desk of a Mr Lawrence Pemberton of the FO, along with my report on your other sources of income which you have failed to declare on your tax return.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You wouldn't do that to me, would you, Captain Scott?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Scott, sir, if you carried out such a threat,&quot; moaned the colonel.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I have already considered that,&quot; said Adam, &quot;and I have come to two conclusions.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And what are they, Captain Scott?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Spies,&quot; continued Adam, not loosening his grip, &quot;at the present time seem to be getting anything from eighteen to forty-two years at Her Majesty's pleasure, so you might, with good behaviour, be out before the turn of the century, just in time to collect your telegram from the Queen.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The colonel looked visibly impressed. &quot;And the other conclusion?&quot; he blurted out.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh, simply that you could inform Romanov of my nocturnal visit and he in return would arrange for you to spend the rest of your days in a very small dacha in a suitably undesirable suburb of Moscow. Because, you see, my dear Tomkins, you are a very small spy. I personally am not sure when left with such an alternative which I would view with more horror.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'll get it for you, Captain Scott, you can rely on me.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm sure I can, Tomkins. Because if you were to let Romanov into our little secret, you would be arrested within minutes. So at best, you could try to escape on the Aeroflot plane to Moscow. And I've checked, there isn't one until the early evening.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'll bring it to you by nine thirty on the dot, sir. You can be sure of that. But for God's sake have yours ready to exchange.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I will,&quot; said Adam, &quot;as well as all your documents, Tomkins.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The keys,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But you've already got my keys, Captain Scott, sir.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The car keys, you fool.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But it's a hire car, sir,&quot; said the colonel.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And I'm about to hire it,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But how will I get myself back to London in time, sir?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I have no idea, but you still have the rest of the night to come up with something. You could even walk it by then. The keys,&quot; Adam repeated, jerking the colonel's arm to shoulder-blade level.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;In my left hand pocket,&quot; said the colonel, almost an octave higher.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam put his hand into the colonel's new jacket and pulled out the car keys.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He opened the front door, shoved the colonel on to the path, and then escorted him to the pavement.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You will go and stand on the far side of the road,&quot; said Adam, &quot;and you will not return to the house until I have reached the end of the road. Do I make myself clear, Tomkins?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Abundantly clear, Captain Scott, sir.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good,&quot; said Adam releasing him for the first time, &quot;and just one more thing, Tomkins. In case you think of double-crossing me, I have already instructed the Foreign Office to place Romanov under surveillance and put two extra lookouts near the Soviet Embassy with instructions to report the moment anyone suspicious turns up or leaves before nine tomorrow morning.&quot; Adam hoped he sounded convincing.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thought of everything, haven't you, sir?&quot; said the colonel mournfully.</FONT><BR>

He wound the window down. &quot;See you at nine thirty tomorrow morning. Prompt,&quot; he added, as he put the Ford into first gear.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not at all, my dear Bischoff,&quot; said Poskonov. &quot;After all these years the honour is entirely mine. And kind of you to be so understanding about opening the bank on a Sunday. But now to business. Did you manage to get Romanov to sign the release form?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said Bischoff, matter-of-factly. &quot;He did it without even reading the standard clauses, let alone the extra three you asked us to put in.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So his inheritance automatically returns to the Russian state?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That is so, Mr Poskonov, and we in return . . .&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;... will represent us in all the currency exchange transactions we carry out in the West.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Herr Bischoff. &quot;And we shall be delighted to assist you in your slightest requirement, but what happens when Romanov returns to the bank and demands to know what has become of his inheritance?&quot; asked the chairman of the bank anxiously.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He will not return,&quot; the Russian banker said emphatically. &quot;You can have my word on it. Now, I would like to see what is in those boxes.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; said Herr Bischoff. &quot;Will you please accompany me?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The two banking chairmen took the private lift to the basement and Herr Bischoff accompanied his guest to the underground vault.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I will unlock the five boxes now in your name with the bank's key but only you can open them with your key.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Poskonov, and left Herr Bischoff to open the five locks and return to the entrance of the vault.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Do take as long as you like,&quot; said Herr Bischoff, &quot;but at six o'clock the great door is automatically locked until nine o'clock tomorrow morning, and nothing less than a nuclear weapon would prise it open. At five forty-five, an alarm goes off to warn you that you only have fifteen minutes left.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Excellent,&quot; said the man who through his entire banking career had never been given a fifteen-minute warning of anything.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Herr Bischoff handed Comrade Poskonov the envelope with Romanov's key inside it.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As soon as the massive steel door had been swung closed behind him the Russian checked the clock on the wall. They had left him with over two hours to sort out what could be transported to Brazil and what would have to be left behind. A state pension and the Order of Lenin (second class) hadn't seemed much of an alternative to Poskonov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He turned the key and opened the first of the small boxes and found the deeds to lands the State had owned for decades. He growled. The second box contained the</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">shares of companies once brilliantly successful, now shells in every sense of the word. And to Poskonov's disappointment the third of the small boxes only held a will proving everything belonged to Romanov's father and his immediate heirs. Had he waited all these years to discover the stories the old man had told him of gold, jewels and pearls were nothing but a fantasy? Or had Romanov already removed them?</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Poskonov opened the first of the large boxes and stared down at the twelve little compartments. He removed the lid of the first one tentatively, and when he saw the array of gems and stones that shone in front of him his legs felt weak. He put both hands into the box and let the gems slip through his fingers like a child playing with pebbles on a beach.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The second box produced pearls and the third gold coins and medallions that could make even an old man's eyes sparkle. He hadn't realised how long it had taken him to go through the remaining boxes but when the alarm went off he was five thousand miles away already enjoying his new-found wealth. He glanced at the clock. He had easily enough time to get everything back into the compartments and then he would return the following day and remove once and for all what he had earned from fifty years of serving the State.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When the last lid had been placed back on he checked the clock on the wall: six minutes to six. Just enough time to glance in the other box and see if he could expect the same again.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He turned the key and licked his lips in anticipation as he pulled the large box out. Just a quick look, he promised himself, as he lifted the lid. When he saw the decaying body with its grey skin and eyes hanging in their sockets he reeled backwards from the sight and, falling to the floor, clutched his heart.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Both bodies were discovered at nine the next morning-</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The phone rang and Adam grabbed at it before the shrill tone could deafen him a second time.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Your alarm call, sir,&quot; said a girl's voice gently. &quot;It's eight o'clock.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you,&quot; Adam replied and replaced the receiver. The call had proved unnecessary because he had been sitting up in bed considering the implications of his plan for nearly an hour. Adam had finally worked out exactly how he was going to finish Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He jumped out of bed, threw back the curtains and stared down at the Soviet Embassy. He wondered how long the Russian had been awake.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He returned to the side of the bed and picked up the phone to dial the number Robin had given him. The phone rang several times before it was answered by an elderly voice saying, &quot;Mrs Beresford.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good morning, Mrs Beresford. My name is Adam Scott, I'm a friend of Robin's. I was just phoning to check that she reached home safely last night.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Oh, yes, thank you,&quot; said Robin's mother. &quot;It was a pleasant surprise to see her before the weekend. She usually spends the night in the flat when she gets back that late. I'm afraid she's still asleep. Would you like me to wake her?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, no, don't disturb her,&quot; said Adam. &quot;I only rang to fix up a lunch date. Can you tell her I'll call back later?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I certainly will,&quot; she replied. &quot;Thank you for phoning, Mr Scott.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam replaced the receiver and smiled. Each piece of the jigsaw was fitting neatly into place but without the colonel's help he still lacked the vital corner-piece.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam began to put everything Tomkins needed, including his passport, personal papers and wallet into a large envelope. He removed the icon from his jacket pocket, turned it over and carefully examined the little silver crest of the Tsar. He then flicked open the colonel's penknife and began the slow and delicate task of removing the crown.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Thirty minutes later, Adam was in the lift on the way to the hotel basement. When he stepped out, he walked across to the space where he had parked the green Cortina earlier that morning. He unlocked the door and threw the colonel's old jacket on to the seat, then locked the car, checking all the doors before taking the lift back up to the ground floor.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The manager of the men's shop in the arcade had just flicked over the 'closed' sign and Adam took his time selecting a white shirt, grey flannels and a blue blazer, trying them on in their little changing room.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">At nine twenty-three he settled his bill with the Royal Garden Hotel and asked the doorman to bring the green Ford up from the parking lot. He waited by the hotel entrance.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">As the minutes passed, he began to fear that the colonel wouldn't turn up. If he failed to, Adam knew that the next call would have to be to Lawrence and not Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">His reverie was disturbed by a honk on a car horn; the colonel's rented car had been left by the entrance.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Your car is waiting on the ramp,&quot; said the doorman, as he returned the keys to Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Adam and handed over the last of the colonel's pound notes. He dropped the wallet into the large envelope, which he sealed, before checking his watch again.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He stood waiting anxiously for another two minutes</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">before he spotted the colonel puffing up the slope leading to the hotel entrance.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He was clinging on to a small carrier bag.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I've done it, Captain Scott, sir, I've done it,&quot; said the colonel, before he had reached Adam's side. &quot;But I must return immediately or he's bound to notice it's gone.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He passed the carrier bag quickly to Adam who opened the top and stared down at the object inside.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You're a man of your word,&quot; said Adam, &quot;and as promised you'll find everything you need in there.&quot; He passed over his own package along with the car keys without speaking. He pointed to the hire car.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The colonel ran to it, jumped in and drove quickly down the ramp of the Royal Garden Hotel before turning left into Kensington Palace Gardens.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam checked his watch: nine thirty-five.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Could you call me a taxi?&quot; he asked the doorman.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The driver pulled the window down and gave Adam an enquiring look.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Chesham Place, SW1. A carpenter's shop.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam spent twenty minutes looking around the shop while the craftsman carried out his unusual request. Adam studied the result with satisfaction, paid him two half-crowns and then walked back on to King's Road, to hail another taxi.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Where to, guv'nor?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;The Tower of London.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Everyone was in their place for the D4 meeting at nine thirty and Busch had gone on the attack even before Lawrence had had the chance to sit down.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How in hell did you manage to lose him this time?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I must take the blame myself,&quot; said Lawrence. &quot;We had every port from Newhaven to Harwich covered, but the moment my man saw Romanov and his henchman leave the quayside at Dover and chase off down the motorway after the coach he assumed he must have seen Scott. I had already instructed the senior immigration officer at the port,&quot; he continued, &quot;to allow Scott to disembark without a fuss. It had been my intention to take over once he passed through customs. There seemed no reason to change that plan while we had Romanov under close surveillance. Scott then proceeded to fool both Romanov and our man at Dover.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But we were given a second chance when Scott got on the train,&quot; persisted Busch. Lawrence stared at the American, waiting to see if he would admit that his two CIA agents had also lost Scott at Dover.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My man was on the train,&quot; said Lawrence emphatically, &quot;but had only the one opportunity to make contact with Scott while he was on his own, and at just that moment he was grabbed and badly beaten up by a bunch of drunken louts - teenagers, apparently -who were on their way back from a day trip to the seaside.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Perhaps we're recruiting our agents from the wrong class of person,&quot; said Matthews, staring down at his briefing papers.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Lawrence made no attempt to reply.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;So, as far as we can tell, Scott, the Tsar's icon and Romanov are still holed up somewhere in London?&quot; said Snell.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It looks that way,&quot; admitted Lawrence.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Perhaps all is not lost then,&quot; suggested Snell. &quot;Scott may still try and get in touch with you again.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I think not,&quot; said Lawrence quietly.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How can you be so sure?&quot; asked Busch. &quot;Because Scott knows that one of us in this room is a traitor and he thinks it's me.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good morning. Soviet Embassy.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;My name is Adam Scott and I need to get in contact with a Major Romanov.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good morning, Mr Scott. We do not have a Major Romanov working at the Embassy,&quot; came back the polite reply.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'm sure you don't.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;But if you would like to leave your number, I will make further enquiries.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'll wait. Wouldn't surprise me if you find him very quickly once he knows who it is calling.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">There was a long silence at the other end, and Adam only hoped the shilling he had pressed into the call box would prove to be enough. At last there was a click, and then Adam heard a voice.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Who is this?&quot; said the voice, unable to mask its incredulity.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You know very well who it is,&quot; said Adam curtly. &quot;I want to make a deal.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A deal?&quot; Romanov repeated, his voice changing from one of disbelief to surprise.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'll swap you my icon - which as you so vividly pointed out is worthless to me - in exchange for your copy, which is not. But I also require the papers that prove my father's innocence.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How do I know you're not setting me up?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You don't,&quot; said Adam. &quot;But you're the one with nothing to lose.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The pips began to sound across the line.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Tell me your number,&quot; said Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;738-9121,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I'll phone you back,&quot; said Romanov as the line went dead.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How quickly can we find out where 738-9121 is located?&quot; Romanov asked the local KGB operative who sat opposite him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;About ten minutes,&quot; the aide replied. &quot;But it could be a trap.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;True, but with nineteen hours to go before the icon has to be in America I don't have a lot of choice.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov turned back to the KGB agent. &quot;What's the traffic like in London on a Friday morning?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;One of the busiest times in the week. Why do you ask?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Because I'll need a motorbike and a superb driver,&quot; was all Romanov said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam could do nothing about the middle-aged lady who was now occupying his phone booth. He had nervously walked out to check the bridge when she slipped in. She must have been puzzled as to why the young man didn't use the empty box that stood next to it.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He checked his watch anxiously: ten forty-five. He knew he couldn't risk waiting a minute after eleven but was confident that Romanov would have traced where he'd made the call from long before then.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The talkative woman was another twelve minutes before she eventually put the phone down. When she stepped out of the box she gave Adam a warm smile.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Three more minutes and he would have to phone Lawrence and abort his original plan. He began to watch the Beefeaters as they patrolled under Traitors' Gate. Traitors' Gate - how appropriate, Adam thought. He had chosen the spot because he could see clearly up and down the path leading to the drawbridge</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">and felt he could not be taken by surprise. And in desperation there was always the moat that surrounded them on all sides.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">For the first time in his life, Adam discovered exactly how long five minutes could be. When the phone rang, it sounded like an alarm bell. He picked it up nervously, his eyes never leaving the main road.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Scott?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I can now see you clearly as I am less than one minute away. I will be standing at the end of Tower Bridge until the end of that minute. Be sure you're there with the icon. If you're not, I shall burn the papers that prove your father's innocence in front of you.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The phone went dead.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam was delighted that another piece of the jigsaw had fallen into place. He stepped out of the phone booth and checked up and down the road. A BMW motorcycle swerved to a halt at the end of the bridge. A rider dressed in a leather jacket sat astride the bike but only seemed interested in watching the flow of traffic as it passed by the Tower. It was the man seated behind him who stared directly at Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam began to walk slowly towards the end of the bridge. He put a hand in his pocket to be sure the icon was still in its place.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He was about thirty yards from the end of the bridge when the second figure got off the bike and started walking towards him. When their eyes met, Romanov stopped in his tracks and held up a small, square frame. Adam did not respond in kind, but simply tapped the side of his pocket and continued walking. Both men advanced towards each other like knights of old until they were only a few paces apart. Almost</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">simultaneously they stopped and faced one another.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Let me see it,&quot; said Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam paused, then slowly removed the icon from his pocket and held it to his chest for his adversary to see St George stared at him.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Turn it over,&quot; said Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam obeyed, and the Russian could not hide his delight when he saw the little silver crown of the Tsar embedded in the back.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Now you,&quot; said Adam. Romanov held his icon away from his body, as if brandishing a sword. The masterpiece shone in the summer sun.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And the documents,&quot; said Adam, forcing himself to speak calmly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The Russian pulled out a package from within his jacket and slowly unfolded them. Adam stared at the official court verdict for a second time.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Go to the wall,&quot; said Adam, pointing with his left hand to the side of the bridge, &quot;and leave the icon and the documents on it.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">It was Romanov who now obeyed as Adam proceeded to the wall on the other side of the bridge and placed his icon in the middle of it.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Cross slowly,&quot; called Adam. The two men moved sideways back across the bridge, never getting closer than a couple of yards from each other until they had come to a halt at each other's icon. The moment the painting was within his reach, Romanov grabbed it, ran and jumped on to the motorcycle without looking back. Within seconds the BMW had disappeared into the dense traffic.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam did not move. Although it had only been out of his sight for just over an hour, he was relieved to have the original back. Adam checked the papers that would establish his father's innocence and placed them</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A little girl was staring up at him.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Will you and your friend be performing again this morning?&quot;</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">When the BMW motorcycle drew up outside the Soviet Embassy in Kensington Palace Gardens, Romanov leapt off and ran up the steps and straight into the Ambassador's office without knocking. The Ambassador didn't need to ask if he had been successful.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It worked out just as I planned. He was taken completely by surprise,&quot; said Romanov, as he handed the icon over to the Ambassador.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The Ambassador turned the painting over and saw the little silver crown of the Tsar. Any doubts that he might have had were also dispelled;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I have orders to send the icon to Washington in the diplomatic pouch immediately. There is no time to be lost.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I wish I could deliver it in person,&quot; said Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Be satisfied, Comrade Major, that you have carried out your part of the operation in an exemplary fashion.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The Ambassador pressed a button on the side of his desk. Two men appeared immediately. One held open the diplomatic pouch while the other stood motionless by his side. The Ambassador handed over the icon and watched it being placed into the pouch. The two couriers looked as if they would have had no trouble in carrying out the Ambassador's desk as well, thought Romanov.</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;There is a plane standing by at Heathrow to take</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">you both direct to Washington,&quot; said the Ambassador. &quot;All the necessary documentation for customs Staa already been dealt with. You should touch down at National airport around five o'clock Washington time, easily giving our comrades in America enough time to fulfil their part of the contract.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The two men nodded, sealed the diplomatic pouch in the Ambassador's presence and left. Romanov walked over to the window and watched the official car drive the two men out into Kensington High Street and off in the direction of Heathrow.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Vodka, Comrade Major?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thank you,&quot; Romanov replied, not moving from the window until the car was out of sight.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The Ambassador went over to a side cabinet and took out two glasses and a bottle from the fridge before pouring Romanov a large vodka.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It would not be exaggerating to say that you have played your part in establishing the Soviet Union as the most powerful nation on earth,&quot; he said as he handed over the drink. &quot;Let us therefore drink to the repatriation of the people of Aleuts as full citizens of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How is that possible?&quot; asked Romanov.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I think the time has come to let you know,&quot; said the Ambassador, &quot;the significance of your achievement.&quot; He then went on to tell Romanov of the briefing he had received from Moscow that morning.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov was thankful he had never known how much was at stake.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I have made an appointment to see the Foreign Secretary at three o'clock this afternoon in order to brief him. We can be sure the British will only be interested in fair play,&quot; the Ambassador continued. &quot;I am told he is not at all pleased as he had hoped to be</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov laughed. &quot;To Aleuts,&quot; he said, raising his glass. &quot;But what is happening in Washington at this moment?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Our Ambassador has already requested a meeting with the American Secretary of State to be scheduled for eight this evening. He is also setting up a press conference at the Embassy to follow that meeting. It may amuse you to know that President Johnson had to cancel his visit to Texas this weekend and has requested that the networks should allow him to address 'his fellow Americans' at peak time on Monday as a matter of national importance.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And we achieved it with only hours to spare,&quot; said Romanov, pouring himself another vodka.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Touch and go, as the English would say. Let us also be thankful for the time difference between here and the United States because without that we would never have been able to beat the deadline.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov shuddered at the thought of how close it had been and downed his second vodka in one gulp.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You must join me for lunch, Comrade. Although your orders are to return to Moscow immediately my secretary assures me that the first plane leaving Heathrow for Moscow does not depart until eight this evening. I envy you the reception you will receive when you arrive back in the Kremlin tomorrow.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I still need the &pound;1000 for . . .&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Ah, yes,&quot; said the Ambassador, &quot;I have it ready for you.&quot; He unlocked the little drawer of his desk and passed over a slim wad of notes in a small cellophane wrapper.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov slipped the tiny packet in his pocket and joined the Ambassador for lunch.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Busch barged into Lawrence's office.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Romanov's got the icon,&quot; he shouted.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Lawrence's jaw dropped. A look of desperation appeared on his face. &quot;How can you be so sure?&quot; he demanded.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I've just had a message from Washington. The Russians have requested an official meeting with the Secretary of State to be arranged for eight this evening.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I don't believe it,&quot; said Lawrence.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I do,&quot; said Busch. &quot;We've always known that God-damned friend of yours, like his father, was a lousy traitor. There's no other explanation.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He could be dead,&quot; said Lawrence quietly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I hope he is, for his sake,&quot; said Busch.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The phone on Lawrence's desk rang. He grabbed it as if it were a lifeline. &quot;A Dr John Vance wants a word with you, sir,&quot; said his secretary. &quot;He said you had asked him to call.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Vance? Vance? Lawrence recalled the name but couldn't quite place it. &quot;Put him on,&quot; he said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good morning, Mr Pemberton,&quot; said a voice.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Good morning, Dr Vance. What can I do for you?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;You asked me to call you after I had examined Scott.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Scott?&quot; repeated Lawrence, not believing what he was hearing.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes, Adam Scott. Surely you remember? You wanted him to complete a medical for your department.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Lawrence was speechless.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I've given him a clean bill of health,&quot; continued</FONT><BR>

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">the doctor. &quot;Some cuts and a nasty bruise, but nothing that won't heal in a few days.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Cuts and bruises?&quot; said Lawrence.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;That's what I said, old chap. But don't worry about Scott. He's fit enough to start work whenever you want him. That's if you still want him.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;If I still want him,&quot; repeated Lawrence. &quot;Mr Scott isn't there with you at this moment, by any chance?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No,&quot; said Vance. &quot;Left my surgery about ten minutes ago.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He didn't happen to tell you where he was going?&quot; asked Lawrence.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, he wasn't specific. Just said something about having to see a friend off at the airport.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Once the coffee had been cleared away, Romanov checked his watch. He had left easily enough time to keep the appointment and still catch his plane. He thanked the Ambassador for all his help, left him, ran down the Embassy steps and climbed into the back of the anonymous black car.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The driver moved off without speaking as he had already been briefed as to where the major wanted to go-</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Neither of them spoke on the short journey, and when the driver drew into Charlotte Street he parked the car in a lay-by. Romanov stepped out, walked quickly across the road to the door he was looking for and pressed the buzzer.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Are you a member?&quot; said a voice through the intercom.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Romanov, who heard a metallic click as he pushed the door open and walked down the dark staircase. Once he had entered the club it took a few seconds for his eyes to become accustomed to the light.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">418</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3"><I>A Matter of Honour</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">But then he spotted Mentor seated on his own at a little table near a pillar in the far corner of the room.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov nodded and the man got up and walked across the dance floor and straight past him. Romanov followed as the member entered the only lavatory. Once inside, Romanov checked that they were alone. Satisfied, he led them both into a little cubicle and slipped the lock to engaged. Romanov removed the thousand pounds from his pocket and handed it over to the man who sat down on the lavatory seat. Mentor greedily ripped open the packet, leaned forward and began to count. He never even saw Romanov straighten his fingers; and when the hand came down with a crushing blow on the back of Mentor's neck he slumped forward and fell to the ground in a heap.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov yanked him up; it took several seconds to gather the ten-pound notes that had fallen to the floor. Once he had all hundred, he stuffed them into the member's pocket. Romanov then undid the member's fly buttons one by one and pulled down his trousers until they fell around his ankles. He lifted the lid and placed the man on the lavatory seat. The final touch was to pull his legs as wide open as the fallen trousers would allow, the feet splayed apart. Romanov then slipped under the large gap at the bottom of the door leaving the cubicle locked from the inside. He quickly checked his handiwork. All that could be seen from the outside was the splayed legs and fallen trousers.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Sixty seconds later, Romanov was back in the car on his way to Heathrow.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam arrived at Heathrow two hours before the Aeroflot flight was due to depart. He stationed himself with a perfect view of the forty-yard stretch Romanov</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">would have to walk to board the Russian aircraft. He felt confident he would never reach the Aeroflot steps.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov checked in at the BEA desk a little after six. He couldn't resist taking the BEA flight rather than Aeroflot even though he knew Zaborski would frown at such arrogance; he doubted if anyone would comment on this of all days.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Once he had been given his boarding card, he took the escalator to the executive lounge and sat around waiting to be called. It was always the same - the moment any operation had been completed, all he wanted to do was get home. He left his seat to pour himself some coffee and, passing a table in the centre of the room, caught the headline on the London <I>Evening Standard. </I>Exclusive. 'Johnson Texas Weekend Cancelled - Mystery.' Romanov grabbed the paper from the table and read the first paragraph but it contained no information he couldn't have already told them. None of the speculation in the paragraphs that followed even began to get near the truth.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov couldn't wait to see the front page of <I>Pravda </I>the next day in which he knew the true story would be emblazoned. By Western standards it would be an exclusive.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;BEA announce the departure of their flight 117 to Moscow. Would all first class passengers now board through gate No. 23.&quot; Romanov left the lounge and walked the half mile long corridor to the plane. Romanov strolled across the tarmac to the waiting plane a few minutes after six fifty. The plane carrying the icon would be touching down in Washington in about two hours. Romanov would arrive back in Moscow well in time to see Dynamo play Spartak at the Lenin Stadium on Tuesday. He wondered if they</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">would announce his arrival to the crowd over the loudspeakers as they always did when a member of the Politburo attended a match. Romanov walked up the steps and on board, stepping over the feet of the passenger placed next to him, thankful that he had been given the window seat.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Would you care for a drink before take-off?&quot; the stewardess asked.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Just a black coffee for me,&quot; said his neighbour. Romanov nodded his agreement.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The stewardess arrived back a few minutes later with the two coffees and helped the man next to Romanov pull out his table from the armrest. Romanov flicked his over as the stewardess passed him his coffee.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He took a sip but it was too hot so he placed it on the table in front of him. He watched his neighbour take out a packet of saccharines from his pocket and flick two pellets into the steaming coffee.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Why did he bother, thought Romanov. Life was too short.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Romanov stared out of the window and watched the Aeroflot plane start to taxi out on to the runway. He smiled at the thought of how much more comfortable his own flight would be. He tried his coffee a second time: just as he liked it. He took a long gulp and began to feel a little drowsy which he didn't find that strange as he had hardly slept for the last week.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He leaned back in his seat and closed his eyes. He would now take every honour the State could offer him. With Valchek conveniently out of the way, he could even position himself to take over from Zaborski. If that failed, his grandfather had left him another alternative.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">He was leaving London with only one regret: he had failed to kill Scott* But then he suspected that the</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><I>Jeffrey Archer</I></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Americans would take care of that. For the first time in a week he didn't have to stop himself falling asleep . . .</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">A few moments later the passenger seated next to Romanov picked up the Russian's coffee cup and put it next to his own. He then flicked Romanov's table back into the armrest and placed a woollen blanket over Romanov's legs. He quickly slipped the BEA eye shades over the Russian's head, covering his open eyes. He looked up to find that the stewardess was standing by his side.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Can I help?&quot; she asked, smiling.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, thank you. All he said was that he did not want to be disturbed during the flight as he has had a very hard week.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Of course, sir,&quot; said the stewardess. &quot;We'll be taking off in a few minutes,&quot; she added, and picked up the two coffee cups and whisked them away.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">The man tapped his fingers impatiently on the little table. At last the chief steward appeared at his side.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;There's been an urgent call from your office, sir. You're to return to Whitehall immediately.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I had been half expecting it,&quot; he admitted.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam stared up at the Russian plane as it climbed steeply and swung in a semi-circle towards the East. He couldn't understand why Romanov hadn't boarded it. Surely he wouldn't have taken the BEA flight. Adam slipped back into the shadows the moment he saw him. He stared in disbelief. Lawrence was striding back across the tarmac, a smile of satisfaction on his face.</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;We now move on to Lot no. 32,&quot; said the auctioneer, looking down from the raised platform at the front of the crowded room. &quot;An icon of St George and the Dragon,&quot; he declared as an attendant placed a little painting on the easel next to him. The auctioneer stared down at the faces of experts, amateurs and curious onlookers. &quot;What am I bid for this magnificent example of Russian art?&quot; he asked, expectantly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Robin gripped Adam's hand. &quot;I haven't felt this nervous since I came face to face with Romanov.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Don't remind me,&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It is, of course, not the original that hangs in the Winter Palace,&quot; continued the auctioneer, &quot;but it is nevertheless a fine copy, probably executed by a court painter circa 1914,&quot; he added, giving the little painting an approving smile. &quot;Do I have an opening bid? Shall I say eight thousand?&quot; The next few seconds seemed interminable to Robin and Adam. &quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; said the auctioneer, eventually looking towards an anonymous sign that had been given somewhere at the front of the room.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Neither Adam nor Robin were able to make out</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">where the bid had come from. They had spent the last hour seated at the back of the room watching the previous items coming under the hammer and had rarely been able to work out whose hands they had ended up in.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How much did the expert say it might go for?&quot; Robin asked again.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Anywhere between ten and twenty thousand,&quot; Adam reminded her.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Nine thousand,&quot; said the auctioneer, his eyes moving to a bid that appeared to come from the right-hand side of the room.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;I still think it's amazing,&quot; said Robin, &quot;that the Russians ever agreed to the exchange in the first place.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Why?&quot; asked Adam. &quot;Once the Americans had extracted the treaty, there was no harm in allowing the Russians to have their original back in exchange for the copy which rightly belonged to me. As an example of diplomatic ingenuity it was Lawrence at his most brilliant.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Ten thousand from the front of the room. Thank you, sir,&quot; said the auctioneer.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;What are you going to do with all that money?&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;All I can tell you is that one of Lawrence's old team was 'retired early',&quot; said Adam.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Was that also true of Romanov?&quot; asked Robin, still desperately trying to discover all that had taken place since they had last met.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Thirteen thousand,&quot; said the auctioneer, his eyes returning to the lady on the centre aisle.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;After all he can't have survived for long once they discovered you had done a switch on Tower Bridge that gave the Russians back the copy while Romanov ended up presenting you with the original,&quot; said Robin.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;He's never been heard of since,&quot; admitted Adam innocently.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;And all our information leads us to believe that his boss Zaborski is soon to be replaced by someone called Yuri Andropov.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Fourteen thousand,&quot; said the auctioneer, his eye settling on the gentleman at the front once again.</FONT><BR>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Once they had been authenticated by the Russians,&quot; Adam said, &quot;Lawrence paid an official visit to the Colonel of the Regiment and furnished him with the conclusive evidence.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Any reaction?&quot; probed Robin.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;They're going to hold a memorial service in Pa's memory and have commissioned some fellow called Ward to paint his portrait for the regimental mess. Mother has been invited to unveil it in the presence of all those officers who served with my father.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Fourteen thousand for the first time then,&quot; said the auctioneer raising the little gavel a few inches in the air.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;She must have been over the moon,&quot; said Robin.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Burst into tears,&quot; said Adam. &quot;All she could say was 'I wish Pa could have lived to see it.' Ironic, really. If only he had opened that letter.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Fourteen thousand for the second time,&quot; said the auctioneer, the gavel now hovering.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;How do you fancy a celebration lunch at the Ritz?&quot; said Adam, delighted with how well the sale was turning out.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No thank you,&quot; said Robin.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam looked across at his companion in surprise.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;It won't be much fun if every time I ask you a question I only get the official Foreign Office briefing.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam looked sheepish. &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; he said.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;No, that wasn't fair,&quot; said Robin. &quot;Now you're on the inside it can't be easy, so I suppose I will have to go to my grave wondering what treaty was inside that icon.&quot;</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam looked away from the girl who had saved his life.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Or perhaps I'll find out the truth in 1996 when the cabinet papers are released.&quot;</FONT><BR>

</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;Not a bad price,&quot; said Adam, smiling.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;A bargain in my opinion,&quot; replied Robin quietly.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">Adam turned to her, a quizzical look on his face.</FONT><BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">&quot;After all,&quot; she said in a whisper, &quot;imagine what the forty-ninth state would have fetched if it had come up for auction.&quot;</FONT><BR>
