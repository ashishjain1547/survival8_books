T* (toward my writing is best expressed by a statement of Victor Hugo: "If a writer) Tj
T* (wrote merely for his time, I would have to break my pen and throw it away.") Tj
T* T* (Certain writers, of whom I am one, do not live, think or write on the range of) Tj

T* (in a month or a year. That most of them do, today, that they are written and) Tj

T* (Fountainhead was being rejected by twelve publishers, some of whom declared that) Tj
T* (it was "too intellectual,") Tj
T* T* ("too controversial" and would not sell because no audience existed for it--that) Tj
T* (was the difficult part of its history; difficult for me to bear. I mention it) Tj
T* (here for the sake of any other writer of my kind who might have to face the same) Tj
T* (battle--as a reminder of the fact that it can be done.) Tj
T* T* (It would be impossible for me to discuss The Fountainhead or any part of its) Tj
T* (history without mentioning the man who made it possible for me to write it: my) Tj
T* (husband, Frank O'Connor.) Tj
T* T* (In a play I wrote in my early thirties, Ideal, the heroine, a screen star,) Tj
T* (speaks for me when she says: "I want to see, real, living, and in the hours of) Tj
T* (my own days, that glory I create as an illusion. I want it real. I want to know) Tj
T* (that there is someone, somewhere, who wants it, too. Or else what is the use of) Tj
T* (seeing it, and working, and burning oneself for an impossible vision? A spirit,) Tj
T* (too, needs fuel. It can run dry.") Tj
T* T* (Frank was the fuel. He gave me, in the hours of my own days, the reality of that) Tj
T* (sense of life, which created The Fountainhead--and he helped me to maintain it) Tj
T* (over a long span of years when there was nothing around us but a gray desert of) Tj
T* (people and events that evoked nothing but contempt and revulsion. The essence of) Tj
T* (the bond between us is the fact that neither of us has ever wanted or been) Tj
T* (tempted to settle for anything less than the world presented in The) Tj
T* (Fountainhead. We never will.) Tj
T* T* (If there is in me any touch of the Naturalistic writer who records "real-life") Tj
T* (dialogue for use in a novel, it has been exercised only in regard to Frank. For) Tj
T* (instance, one of the most effective lines in The Fountainhead comes at the end) Tj
T* (of Part II, when, in reply to Toohey's question: "Why don't you tell me what you) Tj
T* (think of me?" Roark answers: "But I don't think of you." That line was Frank's) Tj
T* (answer to a different type of person, in a somewhat similar context. "You're) Tj
T* (casting pearls without getting even a pork chop in return," was said by Frank to) Tj
T* (me, in regard to my professional position. I gave that line to Dominique at) Tj
T* (Roark's trial.) Tj
T* T* (I did not feel discouragement very often, and when I did, it did not last longer) Tj
T* (than overnight. But there was one evening, during the writing of The) Tj
T* (Fountainhead, when I felt so profound an indignation at the state of "things as) Tj
T* (they are" that it seemed as if I would never regain the energy to move one step) Tj
T* (farther toward "things as they ought to be." Frank talked to me for hours, that) Tj
T* (night. He convinced me of why one cannot give up the world to those one) Tj
T* (despises. By the time he finished, my discouragement was gone; it never came) Tj
T* (back in so intense a form.) Tj
T* T* (I had been opposed to the practice of dedicating books; I had held that a book) Tj
T* (is addressed to any reader who proves worthy of it. But, that night, I told) Tj
T* (Frank that I would dedicate The Fountainhead to him because he had saved it. And) Tj
T* (one of my happiest moments, about two years later, was given to me by the look) Tj
T* (on his face when he came home, one day, and saw the page-proofs of the book,) Tj
T* (headed by the page that stated in cold, clear, objective print: To Frank) Tj
T* (O'Connor.) Tj
T* T* (I have been asked whether I have changed in these past twenty-five years. No, I) Tj
T* (am the same--only more so. Have my ideas changed? No, my fundamental) Tj
T* (convictions, my view of life and of man, have never changed, from as far back as) Tj
T* (I can remember, but my knowledge of their applications has grown, in scope and) Tj
T* (in precision. What is my present evaluation of The Fountainhead? I am as proud) Tj

T* (of it as I was on the day when I finished writing it.) Tj
T* T* (Was The Fountainhead written for the purpose of presenting my philosophy? Here,) Tj
T* (I shall quote from The Goal of My Writing, an address I gave at Lewis and Clark) Tj
T* (College, on October 1, 1963: "This is the motive and purpose of my writing; the) Tj
T* (projection of an ideal man. The portrayal of a moral ideal, as my ultimate) Tj
T* (literary goal, as an end in itself--to which any didactic, intellectual or) Tj
T* (philosophical values contained in a novel are only the means.) Tj
T* T* ("Let me stress this: my purpose is not the philosophical enlightenment of my) Tj
T* (readers...My purpose, first cause and prime mover is the portrayal of Howard) Tj
T* (Roark [or the heroes of Atlas Shrugged} as an end in himself...) Tj
T* T* ("I write--and read--for the sake of the story...My basic test for any story is:) Tj
T* ('Would I want to meet these characters and observe these events in real life? Is) Tj
T* (this story an experience worth living through for its own sake? Is the pleasure) Tj
T* (of contemplating these characters an end in itself?'...) Tj
T* T* ("Since my purpose is the presentation of an ideal man, I had to define and) Tj
T* (present the conditions which make him possible and which his existence requires.) Tj
T* (Since man's character is the product of his premises, I had to define and) Tj
T* (present the kinds of premises and values that create the character of an ideal) Tj
T* (man and motivate his actions; which means that I had to define and present a) Tj
T* (rational code of ethics. Since man acts among and deals with other men, I had to) Tj
T* (present the kind of social system that makes it possible for ideal men to exist) Tj
T* (and to function--a free, productive, rational system which demands and rewards) Tj
T* (the best in every man, and which is, obviously, laissez-faire capitalism.) Tj
T* T* ("But neither politics nor ethics nor philosophy is an end in itself, neither in) Tj
T* (life nor in literature. Only Man is an end in himself.") Tj
T* T* (Are there any substantial changes I would want to make in The Fountainhead?) Tj
T* (No--and, therefore, I have left its text untouched. I want it to stand as it was) Tj
T* (written. But there is one minor error and one possibly misleading sentence which) Tj
T* (I should like to clarify, so I shall mention them here.) Tj
T* T* (The error is semantic: the use of the word "egotist" in Roark's courtroom) Tj
T* (speech, while actually the word should have been "egoist." The error was caused) Tj
T* (by my reliance on a dictionary which gave such misleading definitions of these) Tj
T* (two words that "egotist" seemed closer to the meaning I intended \(Webster's) Tj
T* (Daily Use Dictionary, 1933\). \(Modern philosophers, however, are guiltier than) Tj
T* (lexicographers in regard to these two terms.\)) Tj
T* T* (The possibly misleading sentence is in Roark's speech: "From this simplest) Tj
T* (necessity to the highest religious abstraction, from the wheel to the) Tj
T* (skyscraper, everything we are and everything we have comes from a single) Tj
T* (attribute of man--the function of his reasoning mind.") Tj
T* T* (This could be misinterpreted to mean an endorsement of religion or religious) Tj
T* (ideas. I remember hesitating over that sentence, when I wrote it, and deciding) Tj
T* (that Roark's and my atheism, as well as the overall spirit of the book, were so) Tj
T* (clearly established that no one would misunderstand it, particularly since I) Tj
T* (said that religious abstractions are the product of man's mind, not of) Tj
T* (supernatural revelation.) Tj
T* T* (But an issue of this sort should not be left to implications. What I was) Tj
T* (referring to was not religion as such, but a special category of abstractions,) Tj
T* (the most exalted one, which, for centuries, had been the near-monopoly of) Tj
T* (religion: ethics--not the particular content of religious ethics, but the) Tj

T* (emotional connotations of height, uplift, nobility, reverence, grandeur, which) Tj
T* (pertain to the realm of man's values, but which religion has arrogated to) Tj
T* (itself.) Tj
T* T* (The same meaning and considerations were intended and are applicable to another) Tj
T* (passage of the book, a brief dialogue between Roark and Hopton Stoddard, which) Tj
T* (may be misunderstood if taken out of context:) Tj
T* T* ("'You're a profoundly religious man, Mr. Roark--in your own way. I can see that) Tj
T* (in your buildings.') Tj
T* T* ("'That's true,' said Roark.") Tj
T* T* (In the context of that scene, however, the meaning is clear: it is Roark's) Tj
T* (profound dedication to values, to the highest and best, to the ideal, that) Tj
T* (Stoddard is referring to \(see his explanation of the nature of the proposed) Tj
T* (temple\). The erection of the Stoddard Temple and the subsequent trial state the) Tj
T* (issue explicitly.) Tj
T* T* (This leads me to a wider issue which is involved in every line of The) Tj
T* (Fountainhead and which has to be understood if one wants to understand the) Tj
T* (causes of its lasting appeal.) Tj
T* T* (Religion's monopoly in the field of ethics has made it extremely difficult to) Tj
T* (communicate the emotional meaning and connotations of a rational view of life.) Tj
T* (Just as religion has preempted the field of ethics, turning morality against) Tj
T* (man, so it has usurped the highest moral concepts of our language, placing them) Tj
T* (outside this earth and beyond man's reach. "Exaltation" is usually taken to mean) Tj
T* (an emotional state evoked by contemplating the supernatural. "Worship" means the) Tj
T* (emotional experience of loyalty and dedication to something higher than man.) Tj
T* ("Reverence" means the emotion of a sacred respect, to be experienced on one's) Tj
T* (knees. "Sacred" means superior to and not-to-be-touched-by any concerns of man) Tj
T* (or of this earth. Etc.) Tj
T* T* (But such concepts do name actual emotions, even though no supernatural dimension) Tj
T* (exists; and these emotions are experienced as uplifting or ennobling, without) Tj
T* (the self-abasement required by religious definitions. What, then, is their) Tj
T* (source or referent in reality? It is the entire emotional realm of man's) Tj
T* (dedication to a moral ideal. Yet apart from the man-degrading aspects introduced) Tj
T* (by religion, that emotional realm is left unidentified, without concepts, words) Tj
T* (or recognition.) Tj
T* T* (It is this highest level of man's emotions that has to be redeemed from the murk) Tj
T* (of mysticism and redirected at its proper object: man.) Tj
T* T* (It is in this sense, with this meaning and intention, that I would identify the) Tj
T* (sense of life dramatized in The Fountainhead as man-worship.) Tj
T* T* (It is an emotion that a few--a very few--men experience consistently; some men) Tj
T* (experience it in rare, single sparks that flash and die without consequences;) Tj
T* (some do not know what I am talking about; some do and spend their lives as) Tj
T* (frantically virulent spark-extinguishers.) Tj
T* T* (Do not confuse "man-worship" with the many attempts, not to emancipate morality) Tj
T* (from religion and bring it into the realm of reason, but to substitute a secular) Tj
T* (meaning for the worst, the most profoundly irrational elements of religion. For) Tj

T* (substitute "society" for God as the beneficiary of man's self-immolation. There) Tj
T* (are the various schools of modern philosophy which, rejecting the law of) Tj
T* (identity, proclaim that reality is an indeterminate flux ruled by miracles and) Tj
T* (shaped by whims--not God's whims, but man's or "society's." These neo-mystics) Tj
T* (are not man-worshipers; they are merely the secularizers of as profound a hatred) Tj

T* T* (A cruder variant of the same hatred is represented by those concrete-bound,) Tj
T* ("statistical" mentalities who--unable to grasp the meaning of man's) Tj

T* (encountered any specimens of humanity who deserved it.) Tj
T* T* (The man-worshipers, in my sense of the term, are those who see man's highest) Tj
T* (potential and strive to actualize it. The man-haters are those who regard man as) Tj

T* (The majority of mankind spend their lives and psychological energy in the) Tj

T* (of the quotation which had stood at the head of my manuscript, but which I) Tj
T* (removed from the final, published book. With this opportunity to explain it, I) Tj
T* (am glad to bring it back.) Tj
T* T* (I removed it, because of my profound disagreement with the philosophy of its) Tj
T* (author, Friedrich Nietzsche. Philosophically, Nietzsche is a mystic and an) Tj
T* (irrationalist. His metaphysics consists of a somewhat "Byronic" and mystically) Tj
T* ("malevolent" universe; his epistemology subordinates reason to "will," or) Tj
T* (feeling or instinct or blood or innate virtues of character. But, as a poet, he) Tj
T* (projects at times \(not consistently\) a magnificent feeling for man's greatness,) Tj
T* (expressed in emotional, not intellectual terms.) Tj
T* T* (This is especially true of the quotation I had chosen. I could not endorse its) Tj
T* (literal meaning: it proclaims an indefensible tenet--psychological determinism.) Tj
T* (But if one takes it as a poetic projection of an emotional experience \(and if,) Tj
T* (intellectually, one substitutes the concept of an acquired "basic premise" for) Tj
T* (the concept of an innate "fundamental certainty"\), then that quotation) Tj
T* (communicates the inner state of an exalted self-esteem--and sums up the) Tj

T* T* (--AYN RAND March 10, 1943) Tj
T* T* T* T* (Part One: PETER KEATING) Tj
T* T* T* T* (1.) Tj
T* T* (HOWARD ROARK laughed.) Tj
T* T* (He stood naked at the edge of a cliff. The lake lay far below him. A frozen) Tj
T* (explosion of granite burst in flight to the sky over motionless water. The water) Tj
T* (seemed immovable, the stone--flowing. The stone had the stillness of one brief) Tj
T* (moment in battle when thrust meets thrust and the currents are held in a pause) Tj
T* (more dynamic than motion. The stone glowed, wet with sunrays.) Tj
T* T* (The lake below was only a thin steel ring that cut the rocks in half. The rocks) Tj
T* (went on into the depth, unchanged. They began and ended in the sky. So that the) Tj
T* (world seemed suspended in space, an island floating on nothing, anchored to the) Tj
T* (feet of the man on the cliff.) Tj
T* T* (His body leaned back against the sky. It was a body of long straight lines and) Tj
T* (angles, each curve broken into planes. He stood, rigid, his hands hanging at his) Tj
T* (sides, palms out. He felt his shoulder blades drawn tight together, the curve of) Tj
T* (his neck, and the weight of the blood in his hands. He felt the wind behind him,) Tj
T* (in the hollow of his spine. The wind waved his hair against the sky. His hair) Tj
T* (was neither blond nor red, but the exact color of ripe orange rind.) Tj
T* T* (He laughed at the thing which had happened to him that morning and at the things) Tj
T* (which now lay ahead.) Tj
T* T* (He knew that the days ahead would be difficult. There were questions to be faced) Tj
T* (and a plan of action to be prepared. He knew that he should think about it. He) Tj
T* (knew also that he would not think, because everything was clear to him already,) Tj
T* (because the plan had been set long ago, and because he wanted to laugh.) Tj
T* T* (He tried to consider it. But he forgot. He was looking at the granite.) Tj
T* T* (He did not laugh as his eyes stopped in awareness of the earth around him. His) Tj
T* (face was like a law of nature--a thing one could     not question, alter or) Tj
T* (implore. It had high cheekbones over gaunt, hollow cheeks; gray eyes, cold and) Tj
T* (steady; a contemptuous mouth, shut tight, the mouth of an executioner or a) Tj
T* (saint.) Tj
T* T* (He looked at the granite. To be cut, he thought, and made into walls. He looked) Tj
T* (at a tree. To be split and made into rafters. He looked at a streak of rust on) Tj
T* (the stone and thought of iron ore under the ground. To be melted and to emerge) Tj
T* (as girders against the sky.) Tj
T* T* (These rocks, he thought, are here for me; waiting for the drill, the dynamite) Tj
T* (and my voice; waiting to be split, ripped, pounded, reborn; waiting for the) Tj
T* (shape my hands will give them.) Tj
T* T* (Then he shook his head, because he remembered that morning and that there were) Tj

T* (many things to be done. He stepped to the edge, raised his arms, and dived down) Tj
T* (into the sky below.) Tj
T* T* (He cut straight across the lake to the shore ahead. He reached the rocks where) Tj
T* (he had left his clothes. He looked regretfully about him. For three years, ever) Tj
T* (since he had lived in Stanton, he had come here for his only relaxation, to) Tj
T* (swim, to rest, to think, to be alone and alive, whenever he could find one hour) Tj
T* (to spare, which had not been often. In his new freedom the first thing he had) Tj
T* (wanted to do was to come here, because he knew that he was coming for the last) Tj
T* (time. That morning he had been expelled from the Architectural School of the) Tj
T* (Stanton Institute of Technology. He pulled his clothes on: old denim trousers,) Tj
T* (sandals, a shirt with short sleeves and most of its buttons missing. He swung) Tj
T* (down a narrow trail among the boulders, to a path running through a green slope,) Tj
T* (to the road below.) Tj
T* T* (He walked swiftly, with a loose, lazy expertness of motion. He walked down the) Tj
T* (long road, in the sun. Far ahead Stanton lay sprawled on the coast of) Tj
T* (Massachusetts, a little town as a setting for the gem of its existence--the) Tj
T* (great institute rising on a hill beyond.) Tj
T* T* (The township of Stanton began with a dump. A gray mound of refuse rose in the) Tj
T* (grass. It smoked faintly. Tin cans glittered in the sun. The road led past the) Tj
T* (first houses to a church. The church was a Gothic monument of shingles painted) Tj
T* (pigeon blue. It had stout wooden buttresses supporting nothing. It had) Tj
T* (stained-glass windows with heavy traceries of imitation stone. It opened the way) Tj
T* (into long streets edged by tight, exhibitionist lawns. Behind the lawns stood) Tj
T* (wooden piles tortured out of all shape: twisted into gables, turrets, dormers;) Tj
T* (bulging with porches; crushed under huge, sloping roofs. White curtains floated) Tj
T* (at the windows. A garbage can stood at a side door, flowing over. An old) Tj
T* (Pekinese sat upon a cushion on a door step, its mouth drooling. A line of) Tj
T* (diapers fluttered in the wind between the columns of a porch.) Tj
T* T* (People turned to look at Howard Roark as he passed. Some remained staring after) Tj
T* (him with sudden resentment. They could give no reason for it: it was an instinct) Tj
T* (his presence awakened in most people. Howard Roark saw no one. For him, the) Tj
T* (streets were empty. He could have walked there naked without concern. He crossed) Tj
T* (the heart of Stanton, a broad green edged by shop windows. The windows displayed) Tj
T* (new placards announcing:) Tj
T* T* (WELCOME TO THE CLASS OF  '22!  GOOD LUCK,  CLASS OF  '22!  The Class of '22 of) Tj
T* (the Stanton Institute of Technology was holding its commencement exercises that) Tj
T* (afternoon.) Tj
T* T* (Roark swung into a side street, where at the end of a long row, on a knoll over) Tj
T* (a green ravine, stood the house of Mrs. Keating. He had boarded at that house) Tj
T* (for three years.) Tj
T* T* (Mrs. Keating was out on the porch. She was feeding a couple of canaries in a) Tj
T* (cage suspended over the railing. Her pudgy little hand stopped in mid-air when) Tj
T* (she saw him. She watched him with curiosity. She tried to pull her mouth into a) Tj
T* (proper expression of sympathy; she succeeded only in betraying that the process) Tj
T* (was an effort.) Tj
T* T* (He was crossing the porch without noticing her. She stopped him.) Tj
T* T* ("Mr. Roark!") Tj
T* T* ("Yes?") Tj

T* ("Mr. Roark, I'm so sorry about--" she hesitated demurely, "--about what happened) Tj
T* (this morning.") Tj
T* T* ("What?" he asked.) Tj
T* T* ("Your being expelled from the Institute. I can't tell you how sorry I am. I only) Tj
T* (want you to know that I feel for you.") Tj
T* T* (He stood looking at her. She knew that he did not see her. No, she thought, it) Tj
T* (was not that exactly. He always looked straight at people and his damnable eyes) Tj
T* (never missed a thing, it was only that he made people feel as if they did not) Tj
T* (exist. He just stood looking. He would not answer.) Tj
T* T* ("But what I say," she continued, "is that if one suffers in this world, it's on) Tj
T* (account of error. Of course, you'll have to give up the architect profession) Tj
T* (now, won't you? But then a young man can always earn a decent living clerking or) Tj
T* (selling or something.") Tj
T* T* (He turned to go.) Tj
T* T* ("Oh, Mr. Roark!" she called.) Tj
T* T* ("Yes?") Tj
T* T* ("The Dean phoned for you while you were out.") Tj
T* T* (For once, she expected some emotion from him; and an emotion would be the) Tj
T* (equivalent of seeing him broken. She did not know what it was about him that had) Tj
T* (always made her want to see him broken.) Tj
T* T* ("Yes?" he asked.) Tj
T* T* ("The Dean," she repeated uncertainly, trying to recapture her effect. "The Dean) Tj
T* (himself through his secretary.") Tj
T* T* ("Well?") Tj
T* T* ("She said to tell you that the Dean wanted to see you immediately the moment you) Tj
T* (got back.") Tj
T* T* ("Thank you.") Tj
T* T* ("What do you suppose he can want now?") Tj
T* T* ("I don't know.") Tj
T* T* (He had said: "I don't know." She had heard distinctly: "I don't give a damn.") Tj
T* (She stared at him incredulously.) Tj
T* T* ("By the way," she said, "Petey is graduating today." She said it without) Tj
T* (apparent relevance.) Tj
T* T* ("Today? Oh, yes.") Tj
T* T* ("It's a great day for me. When I think of how I skimped and slaved to put my boy) Tj
T* (through school. Not that I'm complaining. I'm not one to complain. Petey's a) Tj
T* (brilliant boy.") Tj

T* (starched folds of her cotton dress that it seemed to squeeze the fat out to her) Tj
T* (wrists and ankles.) Tj
T* T* ("But of course," she went on rapidly, with the eagerness of her favorite) Tj
T* (subject, "I'm not one to boast. Some mothers are lucky and others just aren't.) Tj
T* (We're all in our rightful place. You just watch Petey from now on. I'm not one) Tj

T* T* ("But what am I doing, gabbing with you like that!" she said brightly. "You've) Tj
T* (got to hurry and change and run along. The Dean's waiting for you.") Tj
T* T* (She stood looking after him through the screen door, watching his gaunt figure) Tj
T* (move across the rigid neatness of her parlor. He always made her uncomfortable) Tj
T* (in the house, with a vague feeling of apprehension, as if she were waiting to) Tj
T* (see him swing out suddenly and smash her coffee tables, her Chinese vases, her) Tj
T* (framed photographs. He had never shown any inclination to do so. She kept) Tj
T* (expecting it, without knowing why.) Tj
T* T* (Roark went up the stairs to his room. It was a large, bare room, made luminous) Tj
T* (by the clean glow of whitewash. Mrs. Keating had never had the feeling that) Tj
T* (Roark really lived there. He had not added a single object to the bare) Tj
T* (necessities of furniture which she had provided; no pictures, no pennants, no) Tj
T* (cheering human touch. He had brought nothing to the room but his clothes and his) Tj
T* (drawings; there were few clothes and too many drawings; they were stacked high) Tj
T* (in one comer; sometimes she thought that the drawings lived there, not the man.) Tj
T* T* (Roark walked now to these drawings; they were the first things to be packed. He) Tj
T* (lifted one of them, then the next, then another. He stood looking at the broad) Tj
T* (sheets.) Tj
T* T* (They were sketches of buildings such as had never stood on the face of the) Tj
T* (earth. They were as the first houses built by the first man born, who had never) Tj
T* (heard of others building before him. There was nothing to be said of them,) Tj
T* (except that each structure was inevitably what it had to be. It was not as if) Tj
T* (the draftsman had sat over them, pondering laboriously, piecing together doors,) Tj
T* (windows and columns, as his whim dictated and as the books prescribed. It was as) Tj
T* (if the buildings had sprung from the earth and from some living force, complete,) Tj
T* (unalterably right. The hand that had made the sharp pencil lines still had much) Tj
T* (to learn. But not a line seemed superfluous, not a needed plane was missing. The) Tj
T* (structures were austere and simple, until one looked at them and realized what) Tj
T* (work, what complexity of method, what tension of thought had achieved the) Tj
T* (simplicity. No laws had dictated a single detail. The buildings were not) Tj
T* (Classical, they were not Gothic, they were not Renaissance. They were only) Tj
T* (Howard Roark.) Tj
T* T* (He stopped, looking at a sketch. It was one that had never satisfied him. He had) Tj
T* (designed it as an exercise he had given himself, apart from his schoolwork; he) Tj
T* (did that often when he found some particular site and stopped before it to think) Tj
T* (of what building it should bear. He had spent nights staring at this sketch,) Tj
T* (wondering what he had missed. Glancing at it now, unprepared, he saw the mistake) Tj
T* (he had made.) Tj
T* T* (He flung the sketch down on the table, he bent over it, he slashed lines) Tj
T* (straight through his neat drawing. He stopped once in a while and stood looking) Tj
T* (at it, his fingertips pressed to the paper; as if his hands held the building.) Tj

T* T* (An hour later he heard a knock at his door.) Tj
T* T* ("Come in!" he snapped, without stopping.) Tj
T* T* ("Mr. Roark!" gasped Mrs. Keating, staring at him from the threshold. "What on) Tj
T* (earth are you doing?") Tj
T* T* (He turned and looked at her, trying to remember who she was.) Tj
T* T* ("How about the Dean?" she moaned. "The Dean that's waiting for you?") Tj
T* T* ("Oh," said Roark. "Oh, yes. I forgot.") Tj
T* T* ("You...forgot?") Tj
T* T* ("Yes." There was a note of wonder in his voice, astonished by her astonishment.) Tj
T* T* ("Well, all I can say," she choked, "is that it serves you right! It just serves) Tj
T* (you right. And with the commencement beginning at four-thirty, how do you expect) Tj
T* (him to have time to see you?") Tj
T* T* ("I'll go at once, Mrs. Keating.") Tj
T* T* (It was not her curiosity alone that prompted her to action; it was a secret fear) Tj
T* (that the sentence of the Board might be revoked. He went to the bathroom at the) Tj
T* (end of the hall; she watched him washing his hands, throwing his loose, straight) Tj
T* (hair back into a semblance of order. He came out again, he was on his way to the) Tj
T* (stairs before she realized that he was leaving.) Tj
T* T* ("Mr. Roark!" she gasped, pointing at his clothes. "You're not going like this?") Tj
T* T* ("Why not?") Tj
T* T* ("But it's your Dean!") Tj
T* T* ("Not any more, Mrs. Keating.") Tj
T* T* (She thought, aghast, that he said it as if he were actually happy.) Tj
T* T* (The Stanton Institute of Technology stood on a hill, its crenelated walls raised) Tj
T* (as a crown over the city stretched below. It looked like a medieval fortress,) Tj
T* (with a Gothic cathedral grafted to its belly. The fortress was eminently suited) Tj
T* (to its purpose, with stout, brick walls, a few slits wide enough for sentries,) Tj
T* (ramparts behind which defending archers could hide, and corner turrets from) Tj
T* (which boiling oil could be poured upon the attacker--should such an emergency) Tj
T* (arise in an institute of learning. The cathedral rose over it in lace splendor,) Tj
T* (a fragile defense against two great enemies: light and air.) Tj
T* T* (The Dean's office looked like a chapel, a pool of dreamy twilight fed by one) Tj
T* (tall window of stained glass. The twilight flowed in through the garments of) Tj
T* (stiff saints, their arms contorted at the elbows. A red spot of light and a) Tj
T* (purple one rested respectively upon two genuine gargoyles squatting at the) Tj
T* (corners of a fireplace that had never been used. A green spot stood in the) Tj
T* (center of a picture of the Parthenon, suspended over the fireplace.) Tj

T* T* ("Ah, yes, Roark," he smiled. "Do sit down, please.") Tj
T* T* (Roark sat down. The Dean entwined his fingers on his stomach and waited for the) Tj
T* (plea he expected. No plea came. The Dean cleared his throat.) Tj
T* T* ("It will be unnecessary for me to express my regret at the unfortunate event of) Tj
T* (this morning," he began, "since I take it for granted that you have always known) Tj
T* (my sincere interest in your welfare.") Tj
T* T* ("Quite unnecessary," said Roark.) Tj
T* T* (The Dean looked at him dubiously, but continued:) Tj
T* T* ("Needless to say, I did not vote against you. I abstained entirely. But you may) Tj
T* (be glad to know that you had quite a determined little group of defenders at the) Tj
T* (meeting. Small, but determined. Your professor of structural engineering acted) Tj
T* (quite the crusader on your behalf. So did your professor of mathematics.) Tj
T* (Unfortunately, those who felt it their duty to vote for your expulsion quite) Tj
T* (outnumbered the others. Professor Peterkin, your critic of design, made an issue) Tj
T* (of the matter. He went so far as to threaten us with his resignation unless you) Tj
T* (were expelled. You must realize that you have given Professor Peterkin great) Tj
T* (provocation.") Tj
T* T* ("I do," said Roark.) Tj
T* T* ("That, you see, was the trouble. I am speaking of your attitude towards the) Tj
T* (subject of architectural design. You have never given it the attention it) Tj
T* (deserves. And yet, you have been excellent in all the engineering sciences. Of) Tj
T* (course, no one denies the importance of structural engineering to a future) Tj
T* (architect, but why go to extremes? Why neglect what may be termed the artistic) Tj
T* (and inspirational side of your profession and concentrate on all those dry,) Tj
T* (technical, mathematical subjects? You intended to become an architect, not a) Tj
T* (civil engineer.") Tj
T* T* ("Isn't this superfluous?" Roark asked. "It's past. There's no point in) Tj
T* (discussing my choice of subjects now.") Tj
T* T* ("I am endeavoring to be helpful, Roark. You must be fair about this. You cannot) Tj
T* (say that you were not given many warnings before this happened.") Tj
T* T* ("I was.") Tj
T* T* (The Dean moved in his chair. Roark made him uncomfortable. Roark's eyes were) Tj

T* (looking at me, in fact it's quite correct, most properly attentive; only, it's) Tj
T* (as if I were not here.) Tj
T* T* ("Every problem you were given," the Dean went on, "every project you had to) Tj
T* (design--what did you do with it? Every one of them done in that--well, I cannot) Tj
T* (call it a style--in that incredible manner of yours. It is contrary to every) Tj
T* (principle we have tried to teach you, contrary to all established precedents and) Tj
T* (traditions of Art. You may think you are what is called a modernist, but it) Tj
T* (isn't even that. It is...it is sheer insanity, if you don't mind.") Tj

T* (earth are alike. No two buildings have the same purpose. The purpose, the site,) Tj
T* (the material determine the shape. Nothing can be reasonable or beautiful unless) Tj
T* (it's made by one central idea, and the idea sets every detail. A building is) Tj
T* (alive, like a man. Its integrity is to follow its own truth, its one single) Tj
T* (theme, and to serve its own single purpose. A man doesn't borrow pieces of his) Tj
T* (body. A building doesn't borrow hunks of its soul. Its maker gives it the soul) Tj

T* T* ("But all the proper forms of expression have been discovered long ago.") Tj
T* T* ("Expression--of what? The Parthenon did not serve the same purpose as its wooden) Tj
T* (ancestor. An airline terminal does not serve the same purpose as the Parthenon.) Tj
T* (Every form has its own meaning. Every man creates his meaning and form and goal.) Tj
T* (Why is it so important--what others have done? Why does it become sacred by the) Tj

T* (Peterkin to have erected, before he sacrificed his practice to the) Tj
T* (responsibilities of teaching. A great deal was said about Keating's final) Tj
T* (project--a Palace of Fine Arts. For the life of him, Keating could not remember) Tj
T* (at the moment what that project was.) Tj
T* T* (Through all this, his eyes held the vision of Guy Francon shaking his hand, and) Tj
T* (his ears held the sounds of Francon's mellow voice: "...as I have told you, it) Tj
T* (is still open, my boy. Of course, now that you have this scholarship...you will) Tj
T* (have to decide...a Beaux-Arts diploma is very important to a young man...but I) Tj
T* (should be delighted to have you in our office....") Tj
T* T* (The banquet of the Class of '22 was long and solemn. Keating listened to the) Tj
T* (speeches with interest; when he heard the endless sentences about "young men as) Tj
T* (the hope of American Architecture" and "the future opening its golden gates," he) Tj
T* (knew that he was the hope and his was the future, and it was pleasant to hear) Tj
T* (this confirmation from so many eminent lips. He looked at the gray-haired) Tj
T* (orators and thought of how much younger he would be when he reached their) Tj
T* (positions, theirs and beyond them.) Tj
T* T* (Then he thought suddenly of Howard Roark. He was surprised to find that the) Tj
T* (flash of that name in his memory gave him a sharp little twinge of pleasure,) Tj
T* (before he could know why. Then he remembered: Howard Roark had been expelled) Tj
T* (this morning. He reproached himself silently; he made a determined effort to) Tj
T* (feel sorry. But the secret glow came back, whenever he thought of that) Tj
T* (expulsion. The event proved conclusively that he had been a fool to imagine) Tj
T* (Roark a dangerous rival; at one time, he had worried about Roark more than about) Tj
T* (Shlinker, even though Roark was two years younger and one class below him. If he) Tj
T* (had ever entertained any doubts on their respective gifts, hadn't this day) Tj
T* (settled it all? And, he remembered, Roark had been very nice to him, helping him) Tj
T* (whenever he was stuck on a problem...not stuck, really, just did not have the) Tj
T* (time to think it out, a plan or something. Christ! how Roark could untangle a) Tj
T* (plan, like pulling a string and it was open...well, what if he could? What did) Tj
T* (it get him? He was done for now. And knowing this, Peter Keating experienced at) Tj
T* (last a satisfying pang of sympathy for Howard Roark.) Tj
T* T* (When Keating was called upon to speak, he rose confidently. He could not show) Tj
T* (that he was terrified. He had nothing to say about architecture. But he spoke,) Tj
T* (his head high, as an equal among equals, just subtly diffident, so that no great) Tj
T* (name present could take offense. He remembered saying: "Architecture is a great) Tj
T* (art...with our eyes to the future and the reverence of the past in our) Tj
T* (hearts...of all the crafts, the most important one sociologically...and, as the) Tj
T* (man who is an inspiration to us all has said today, the three eternal entities) Tj
T* (are: Truth, Love and Beauty....") Tj
T* T* (Then, in the corridors outside, in the noisy confusion of leave-taking, a boy) Tj
T* (had thrown an arm about Keating's shoulders and whispered: "Run on home and get) Tj

T* (coming, Pete. No fun without you. And, by the way, congratulations and all that) Tj
T* (sort of thing. No hard feelings. May the best man win." Keating had thrown his) Tj
T* (arm about Shlinker's shoulders; Keating's eyes had glowed with an insistent kind) Tj
T* (of warmth, as if Shlinker were his most precious friend; Keating's eyes glowed) Tj
T* (like that on everybody. He had said: "Thanks, Ted, old man. I really do feel) Tj
T* (awful about the A.G.A. medal--I think you were the one for it, but you never can) Tj
T* (tell what possesses those old fogies." And now Keating was on his way home) Tj
T* (through the soft darkness, wondering how to get away from his mother for the) Tj
T* (night.) Tj
T* T* (His mother, he thought, had done a great deal for him. As she pointed out) Tj
T* (frequently, she was a lady and had graduated from high school; yet she had) Tj
T* (worked hard, had taken boarders into their home, a concession unprecedented in) Tj
T* (her family.) Tj
T* T* (His father had owned a stationery store in Stanton. Changing times had ended the) Tj
T* (business and a hernia had ended Peter Keating, Sr., twelve years ago. Louisa) Tj
T* (Keating had been left with the home that stood at the end of a respectable) Tj
T* (street, an annuity from an insurance kept up accurately--she had seen to) Tj
T* (that--and her son. The annuity was a modest one, but with the help of the) Tj
T* (boarders and of a tenacious purpose Mrs. Keating had managed. In the summers her) Tj
T* (son helped, clerking in hotels or posing for hat advertisements. Her son, Mrs.) Tj
T* (Keating had decided, would assume his rightful place in the world, and she had) Tj
T* (clung to this as softly, as inexorably as a leech....It's funny, Keating) Tj
T* (remembered, at one time he had wanted to be an artist. It was his mother who had) Tj
T* (chosen a better field in which to exercise his talent for drawing.) Tj
T* ("Architecture," she had said, "is such a respectable profession. Besides, you) Tj
T* (meet the best people in it." She had pushed him into his career, he had never) Tj
T* (known when or how. It's funny, thought Keating, he had not remembered that) Tj
T* (youthful ambition of his for years. It's funny that it should hurt him now--to) Tj
T* (remember. Well, this was the night to remember it--and to forget it forever.) Tj
T* T* (Architects, he thought, always made brilliant careers. And once on top, did they) Tj
T* (ever fail? Suddenly, he recalled Henry Cameron; builder of skyscrapers twenty) Tj
T* (years ago; old drunkard with offices on some waterfront today. Keating shuddered) Tj
T* (and walked faster.) Tj
T* T* (He wondered, as he walked, whether people were looking at him. He watched the) Tj
T* (rectangles of lighted windows; when a curtain fluttered and a head leaned out,) Tj
T* (he tried to guess whether it had leaned to watch his passing; if it hadn't, some) Tj
T* (day it would; some day, they all would.) Tj
T* T* (Howard Roark was sitting on the porch steps when Keating approached the house.) Tj
T* (He was leaning back against the steps, propped up on his elbows, his long legs) Tj
T* (stretched out. A morning-glory climbed over the porch pillars, as a curtain) Tj
T* (between the house and the light of a lamppost on the corner.) Tj
T* T* (It was strange to see an electric globe in the air of a spring night. It made) Tj
T* (the street darker and softer; it hung alone, like a gap, and left nothing to be) Tj
T* (seen but a few branches heavy with leaves, standing still at the gap's edges.) Tj
T* (The small hint became immense, as if the darkness held nothing but a flood of) Tj
T* (leaves. The mechanical ball of glass made the leaves seem more living; it took) Tj
T* (away their color and gave the promise that in daylight they would be a brighter) Tj
T* (green than had ever existed; it took away one's sight and left a new sense) Tj
T* (instead, neither smell nor touch, yet both, a sense of spring and space.) Tj
T* T* (Keating stopped when he recognized the preposterous orange hair in the darkness) Tj
T* (of the porch. It was the one person whom he had wanted to see tonight. He was) Tj
T* (glad to find Roark alone, and a little afraid of it.) Tj

T* T* ("Oh...Oh, thanks...." Keating was surprised to find that he felt more pleasure) Tj
T* (than from any other compliment he had received today. He was timidly glad that) Tj

T* (sound.) Tj
T* T* (He knew, for the moment, that he felt affection for Roark; an affection that) Tj

T* T* ("You won't think," said Keating gently, in complete sincerity, "that it's awful) Tj
T* (of me to be asking about my business, when you've just been...?") Tj
T* T* ("I said forget about that. What is it?") Tj
T* T* ("You know," said Keating honestly and unexpectedly even to himself, "I've often) Tj

T* (hell...in architecture.) Tj

T* T* (PETER KEATING looked at the streets of New York. The people, he observed, were) Tj
T* (extremely well dressed.) Tj
T* T* (He had stopped for a moment before the building on Fifth Avenue, where the) Tj
T* (office of Francon & Heyer and his first day of work awaited him. He looked at) Tj
T* (the men who hurried past. Smart, he thought, smart as hell. He glanced) Tj
T* (regretfully at his own clothes. He had a great deal to learn in New York.) Tj
T* T* (When he could delay it no longer, he turned to the door. It was a miniature) Tj
T* (Doric portico, every inch of it scaled down to the exact proportions decreed by) Tj
T* (the artists who had worn flowing Grecian tunics; between the marble perfection) Tj
T* (of the columns a revolving door sparkled with nickel plate, reflecting the) Tj
T* (streaks of automobiles flying past. Keating walked through the revolving door,) Tj
T* (through the lustrous marble lobby, to an elevator of gilt and red lacquer that) Tj
T* (brought him, thirty floors later, to a mahogany door. He saw a slender brass) Tj
T* (plate with delicate letters:) Tj
T* T* (FRANCON & HEYER, ARCHITECTS.) Tj
T* T* (The reception room of the office of Francon & Heyer, Architects, looked like a) Tj
T* (cool, intimate ballroom in a Colonial mansion. The silver white walls were) Tj
T* (paneled with flat pilasters; the pilasters were fluted and curved into Ionic) Tj
T* (snails; they supported little pediments broken in the middle to make room for) Tj
T* (half a Grecian urn plastered against the wall. Etchings of Greek temples adorned) Tj
T* (the panels, too small to be distinguished, but presenting the unmistakable) Tj
T* (columns, pediments and crumbling stone.) Tj

T* (the moment he crossed the threshold. It carried him to the reception clerk who) Tj
T* (sat at a telephone switchboard behind the white balustrade of a Florentine) Tj
T* (balcony. It transferred him to the threshold of a huge drafting room. He saw) Tj
T* (long, flat tables, a forest of twisted rods descending from the ceiling to end) Tj
T* (in green-shaded lamps, enormous blueprint files, towers of yellow drawers,) Tj
T* (papers, tin boxes, sample bricks, pots of glue and calendars from construction) Tj
T* (companies, most of them bearing pictures of naked women. The chief draftsman) Tj
T* (snapped at Keating, without quite seeing him. He was bored and crackling with) Tj
T* (purpose simultaneously. He jerked his thumb in the direction of a locker room,) Tj
T* (thrust his chin out toward the door of a locker, and stood, rocking from heels) Tj
T* (to toes, while Keating pulled a pearl-gray smock over his stiff, uncertain body.) Tj
T* (Francon had insisted on that smock. The conveyor belt stopped at a table in a) Tj
T* (corner of the drafting room, where Keating found himself with a set of plans to) Tj
T* (expand, the scaggy back of the chief draftsman retreating from him in the) Tj
T* (unmistakable manner of having forgotten his existence.) Tj
T* T* (Keating bent over his task at once, his eyes fixed, his throat rigid. He saw) Tj
T* (nothing but the pearly shimmer of the paper before him. The steady lines he drew) Tj
T* (surprised him, for he felt certain that his hand was jerking an inch back and) Tj
T* (forth across the sheet. He followed the lines, not knowing where they led or) Tj
T* (why. He knew only that the plan was someone's tremendous achievement which he) Tj
T* (could neither question nor equal. He wondered why he had ever thought of himself) Tj
T* (as a potential architect.) Tj
T* T* (Much later, he noticed the wrinkles of a gray smock sticking to a pair of) Tj
T* (shoulder blades over the next table. He glanced about him, cautiously at first,) Tj
T* (then with curiosity, then with pleasure, then with contempt. When he reached) Tj
T* (this last, Peter Keating became himself again and felt love for mankind. He) Tj
T* (noticed sallow cheeks, a funny nose, a wart on a receding chin, a stomach) Tj
T* (squashed against the edge of a table. He loved these sights. What these could) Tj
T* (do, he could do better. He smiled. Peter Keating needed his fellow men.) Tj
T* T* (When he glanced at his plans again, he noticed the flaws glaring at him from the) Tj
T* (masterpiece. It was the floor of a private residence, and he noted the twisted) Tj
T* (hallways that sliced great hunks of space for no apparent reason, the long,) Tj
T* (rectangular sausages of rooms doomed to darkness. Jesus, he thought, they'd have) Tj
T* (flunked me for this in the first term. After which, he proceeded with his work) Tj
T* (swiftly, easily, expertly--and happily.) Tj
T* T* (Before lunchtime. Keating had made friends in the room, not any definite) Tj
T* (friends, but a vague soil spread and ready from which friendship would spring.) Tj
T* (He had smiled at his neighbors and winked in understanding over nothing at all.) Tj
T* (He had used each trip to the water cooler to caress those he passed with the) Tj
T* (soft, cheering glow of his eyes, the brilliant eyes that seemed to pick each man) Tj
T* (in turn out of the room, out of the universe, as the most important specimen of) Tj
T* (humanity and as Keating's dearest friend. There goes--there seemed to be left in) Tj
T* (his wake--a smart boy and a hell of a good fellow.) Tj
T* T* (Keating noticed that a tall blond youth at the next table was doing the) Tj
T* (elevation of an office building. Keating leaned with chummy respect against the) Tj
T* (boy's shoulder and looked at the laurel garlands entwined about fluted columns) Tj
T* (three floors high.) Tj

T* ("Francon hell," said the boy placidly. "He hasn't designed a doghouse in eight) Tj
T* (years." He jerked his thumb over his shoulder, at a glass door behind them.) Tj
T* ("Him.") Tj
T* T* ("What?" asked Keating, turning.) Tj
T* T* ("Him," said the boy. "Stengel. He does all these things.") Tj
T* T* (Behind the glass door Keating saw a pair of bony shoulders above the edge of a) Tj
T* (desk, a small, triangular head bent intently, and two blank pools of light in) Tj
T* (the round frames of glasses.) Tj
T* T* (It was late in the afternoon when a presence seemed to have passed beyond the) Tj
T* (closed door, and Keating learned from the rustle of whispers around him that Guy) Tj
T* (Francon had arrived and had risen to his office on the floor above. Half an hour) Tj
T* (later the glass door opened and Stengel came out, a huge piece of cardboard) Tj
T* (dangling between his fingers.) Tj
T* T* ("Hey, you," he said, his glasses stopping on Keating's face. "You doing the) Tj
T* (plans for this?" He swung the cardboard forward. "Take this up to the boss for) Tj
T* (the okay. Try to listen to what he'll say and try to look intelligent. Neither) Tj
T* (of which matters anyway.") Tj
T* T* (He was short and his arms seemed to hang down to his ankles; arms swinging like) Tj

T* (darkening, for one-tenth of a second, gathered in a tight stare at the blank) Tj
T* (lenses. Then Keating smiled and said pleasantly:) Tj
T* T* ("Yes, sir.") Tj
T* T* (He carried the cardboard on the tips of his ten fingers, up the crimson-plushed) Tj
T* (stairway to Guy Francon's office. The cardboard displayed a water-color) Tj
T* (perspective of a gray granite mansion with three tiers of dormers, five) Tj
T* (balconies, four bays, twelve columns, one flagpole and two lions at the) Tj
T* (entrance. In the corner, neatly printed by hand, stood: "Residence of Mr. and) Tj
T* (Mrs. James S. Whattles. Francon & Heyer, Architects." Keating whistled softly:) Tj
T* (James S. Whattles was the multimillionaire manufacturer of shaving lotions.) Tj
T* T* (Guy Francon's office was polished. No, thought Keating, not polished, but) Tj
T* (shellacked; no, not shellacked, but liquid with mirrors melted and poured over) Tj
T* (every object. He saw splinters of his own reflection let loose like a swarm of) Tj
T* (butterflies, following him across the room, on the Chippendale cabinets, on the) Tj
T* (Jacobean chairs, on the Louis XV mantelpiece. He had time to note a genuine) Tj
T* (Roman statue in a corner, sepia photographs of the Parthenon, of Rheims) Tj
T* (Cathedral, of Versailles and of the Frink National Bank Building with the) Tj
T* (eternal torch.) Tj
T* T* (He saw his own legs approaching him in the side of the massive mahogany desk.) Tj
T* (Guy Francon sat behind the desk. Guy Francon's face was yellow and his cheeks) Tj
T* (sagged. He looked at Keating for an instant as if he had never seen him before,) Tj

T* (bit. But don't you worry. I'm sure you'll make good.") Tj
T* T* ("I'll do my best, sir.") Tj
T* T* ("Of course you will. What's this they sent me?" Francon extended his hand to the) Tj
T* (drawing, but his fingers came to rest limply on his forehead instead. "It's so) Tj
T* (annoying, this headache....No, no, nothing serious--" he smiled at Keating's) Tj

T* (designer in New York City, but he's just getting to be a bit too grand lately.) Tj

T* (fastidiously, in self-mockery. "A few words to say informally in a little) Tj
T* (after-dinner speech--you know, nothing blatant, no vulgar sales talk--only a few) Tj
T* (well-chosen thoughts on the responsibility of realtors to society, on the) Tj
T* (importance of selecting architects who are competent, respected and well) Tj
T* (established. You know, a few bright little slogans that will stick in the mind.") Tj
T* T* ("Yes, sir, like 'Choose the builder of your home as carefully as you choose the) Tj

T* T* ("Not bad. Not bad at all, Kittredge. Mind if I jot it down?") Tj
T* T* ("My name is Keating, sir," said Keating firmly. "You are very welcome to the) Tj

T* (smile. "Dear me, one meets so many people. How did you say it? Choose the) Tj
T* (builder...it was very well put.") Tj
T* T* (He made Keating repeat it and wrote it down on a pad, picking a pencil from an) Tj

T* (cardboard out at arm's length and looked at it. He closed his left eye, then his) Tj
T* (right eye, then moved the cardboard an inch farther. Keating expected wildly to) Tj
T* (see him turn the drawing upside down. But Francon just held it and Keating knew) Tj
T* (suddenly that he had long since stopped seeing it. Francon was studying it for) Tj

T* T* ("If I may make a suggestion, sir, it seems to me that the cartouches between the) Tj

T* T* ("That's it. I was just going to say it. An ornamented stringcourse....But...but) Tj
T* (look, it would mean diminishing the fenestration, wouldn't it?") Tj

T* (dignity of a building's facade.") Tj
T* T* ("That's right. Dignity. We must give our clients dignity above all. Yes,) Tj

T* T* ("I think," said Keating slowly, "it is more important to make changes you find) Tj

T* T* (Because Francon said nothing, but only looked straight at him, because Francon's) Tj

T* (two bright little points of contempt in the corners of Keating's mouth, like two) Tj
T* (musical notes of laughter visible the second before they were to be heard.) Tj
T* (Francon felt a great wave of comfort. The comfort came from the contempt. The) Tj

T* (someone tonight. He had no one. For the first time he wished his mother were in) Tj

T* T* (He had sent her a wire on the night of his graduation and forgotten her ever) Tj
T* (since. Now he wanted to see her; the desire was intense and immediate with the) Tj
T* (first sound of her name in his memory. He leaped into a bus for the long ride to) Tj
T* (Greenwich Village, climbed to the deserted top and, sitting alone on the front) Tj
T* (bench, cursed the traffic lights whenever they turned to red. It had always been) Tj
T* (like this where Catherine was concerned; and he wondered dimly what was the) Tj
T* (matter with him.) Tj
T* T* (He had met her a year ago in Boston, where she had lived with her widowed) Tj
T* (mother. He had found Catherine homely and dull, on that first meeting, with) Tj
T* (nothing to her credit but her lovely smile, not a sufficient reason ever to see) Tj
T* (her again. He had telephoned her the next evening. Of the countless girls he had) Tj
T* (known in his student years she was the only one with whom he had never) Tj
T* (progressed beyond a few kisses. He could have any girl he met and he knew it; he) Tj
T* (knew that he could have Catherine; he wanted her; she loved him and had admitted) Tj
T* (it simply, openly, without fear or shyness, asking nothing of him, expecting) Tj
T* (nothing; somehow, he had never taken advantage of it. He had felt proud of the) Tj
T* (girls whom he escorted in those days, the most beautiful girls, the most) Tj
T* (popular, the best dressed, and he had delighted in the envy of his schoolmates.) Tj
T* (He had been ashamed of Catherine's thoughtless sloppiness and of the fact that) Tj
T* (no other boy would look at her twice. But he had never been as happy as when he) Tj
T* (took her to fraternity dances. He had had many violent loves, when he swore he) Tj
T* (could not live without this girl or that; he forgot Catherine for weeks at a) Tj
T* (time and she never reminded him. He had always come back to her, suddenly,) Tj
T* (inexplicably, as he did tonight.) Tj
T* T* (Her mother, a gentle little schoolteacher, had died last winter. Catherine had) Tj

T* (Peter Keating heard of it somehow, as he always heard everything he wanted to) Tj

T* (them to Roark. "You need it, Howard. I know you need it. Don't start protesting) Tj
T* (now. You can pay me back any time." Roark looked at him, astonished, took the) Tj

T* (hell are you doing, wasting yourself on old Cameron? What do you want to live) Tj
T* (like this for? Chuck it, Howard, and come with us. All I have to do is say so.) Tj
T* (Francon'll be delighted. We'll start you at sixty a week." Roark took the money) Tj

T* (beyond its influence on this routine; that merely by living through their own) Tj
T* (obscure days his readers were representing and achieving all the highest) Tj

T* (first-hand observer. He did not plod laboriously through the centuries; he) Tj
T* (danced, said the critics, down the road of the ages, as a jester, a friend and a) Tj
T* (prophet.) Tj
T* T* (He said that architecture was truly the greatest of the arts, because it was) Tj

T* (The few whose names had lived were really impostors, expropriating the glory of) Tj
T* (the people as others expropriated its wealth. "When we gaze at the magnificence) Tj

T* (great building is not the private invention of some genius or other. It is) Tj
T* (merely a condensation of the spirit of a people.") Tj

T* (replaced the communal spirit of the Middle Ages, and that the selfishness of) Tj
T* (individual owners--who built for no purpose save to satisfy their own bad taste,) Tj
T* ("all claim to an individual taste is bad taste"--had ruined the planned effect) Tj
T* (of cities. He demonstrated that there was no such thing as free will, since) Tj
T* (men's creative impulses were determined, as all else, by the economic structure) Tj
T* (of the epoch in which they lived. He expressed admiration for all the great) Tj
T* (historical styles, but admonished against their wanton mixture. He dismissed) Tj
T* (modern architecture, stating that: "So far, it has represented nothing but the) Tj
T* (whim of isolated individuals, has borne no relation to any great, spontaneous) Tj

T* (come, where all men would be brothers and their buildings would become) Tj
T* (harmonious and all alike, in the great tradition of Greece, "the Mother of) Tj
T* (Democracy." When he wrote this, he managed to convey--with no tangible break in) Tj
T* (the detached calm of his style--that the words now seen in ordered print had) Tj
T* (been blurred in manuscript by a hand unsteady with emotion. He called upon) Tj
T* (architects to abandon their selfish quest for individual glory and dedicate) Tj

T* (wait.) Tj
T* T* ("Mr. Roark, are you ready with the steel cage for the Gothic lantern for the) Tj
T* (American Radio Corporation Building?") Tj
T* T* (He had no friends in the drafting room. He was there like a piece of furniture,) Tj
T* (as useful, as impersonal and as silent. Only the chief of the engineering) Tj
T* (department, to which Roark was assigned, had said to Keating after the first two) Tj
T* (weeks: "You've got more sense than I gave you credit for, Keating. Thanks.") Tj
T* T* ("For what?" asked Keating. "For nothing that was intentional, I'm sure," said) Tj
T* (the chief.) Tj
T* T* (Once in a while, Keating stopped by Roark's table to say softly: "Will you drop) Tj
T* (in at my office when you're through tonight, Howard? Nothing important.") Tj
T* T* (When Roark came, Keating began by saying: "Well, how do you like it here,) Tj
T* (Howard? If there's anything you want, just say so and I'll..." Roark interrupted) Tj
T* (to ask: "Where is it, this time?" Keating produced sketches from a drawer and) Tj
T* (said: "I know it's perfectly right, just as it is, but what do you think of it,) Tj
T* (generally speaking?" Roark looked at the sketches, and even though he wanted to) Tj
T* (throw them at Keating's face and resign, one thought stopped him: the thought) Tj
T* (that it was a building and that he had to save it, as others could not pass a) Tj
T* (drowning man without leaping in to the rescue.) Tj
T* T* (Then he worked for hours, sometimes all night, while Keating sat and watched. He) Tj
T* (forgot Keating's presence. He saw only a building and his chance to shape it. He) Tj
T* (knew that the shape would be changed, torn, distorted. Still, some order and) Tj
T* (reason would remain in its plan. It would be a better building than it would) Tj
T* (have been if he refused.) Tj
T* T* (Sometimes, looking at the sketch of a structure simpler, cleaner, more honest) Tj
T* (than the others, Roark would say: "That's not so bad, Peter. You're improving.") Tj
T* (And Keating would feel an odd little jolt inside, something quiet, private and) Tj
T* (precious, such as he never felt from the compliments of Guy Francon, of his) Tj
T* (clients, of all others. Then he would forget it and feel much more substantially) Tj
T* (pleased when a wealthy lady murmured over a teacup: "You're the coming architect) Tj
T* (of America, Mr. Keating," though she had never seen his buildings.) Tj
T* T* (He found compensations for his submission to Roark. He would enter the drafting) Tj
T* (room in the morning, throw a tracing boy's assignment down on Roark's table and) Tj
T* (say: "Howard, do this up for me, will you?--and make it fast." In the middle of) Tj
T* (the day, he would send a boy to Roark's table to say loudly: "Mr. Keating wishes) Tj
T* (to see you in his office at once." He would come out of the office and walk in) Tj
T* (Roark's direction and say to the room at large: "Where the hell are those) Tj
T* (Twelfth Street plumbing specifications? Oh, Howard, will you look through the) Tj
T* (files and dig them up for me?") Tj
T* T* (At first, he was afraid of Roark's reaction. When he saw no reaction, only a) Tj
T* (silent obedience, he could restrain himself no longer. He felt a sensual) Tj
T* (pleasure in giving orders to Roark; and he felt also a fury of resentment at) Tj
T* (Roark's passive compliance. He continued, knowing that he could continue only so) Tj
T* (long as Roark exhibited no anger, yet wishing desperately to break him down to) Tj
T* (an explosion. No explosion came.) Tj

T* (beams hanging over empty space, as easily as the best of them.) Tj
T* T* (It was a day in March, and the sky was a faint green with the first hint of) Tj

T* (painful progress.) Tj
T* T* (The man raised his head and turned to him abruptly. He had a big head and a face) Tj
T* (so ugly that it became fascinating; it was neither old nor flabby, but it was) Tj
T* (creased in deep gashes and the powerful jowls drooped like a bulldog's; the eyes) Tj

T* (muttered: "Where did you learn to handle it like that, Red?") Tj
T* T* (Roark's slow, amused smile acknowledged this concession of victory. "Oh, I've) Tj

T* T* ("And went to school besides?") Tj

T* (architecture was perishing from a lack of new blood and new thought, a lack of) Tj

T* (to search for promising beginners, to encourage them, develop them and give them) Tj

T* (tall, athletic and thirty-five, but his face combined a crisp air of) Tj
T* (sophisticated wisdom with the soft skin, the button nose, the small, puffed) Tj
T* (mouth of a college hero. His face was sun-scorched, his blond hair clipped) Tj
T* (short, in a military Prussian haircut. He was frankly masculine, frankly) Tj
T* (unconcerned about elegance and frankly conscious of the effect.) Tj
T* T* (He listened to Roark silently, and his eyes were like a stop watch registering) Tj
T* (each separate second consumed by each separate word of Roark's. He let the first) Tj

T* (known to him already.) Tj
T* T* (He held the drawings in his bronzed hands. Before he looked down at them, he) Tj
T* (said: "Ah, yes, so many young men come to me for advice, so many." He glanced at) Tj
T* (the first sketch, but raised his head before he had seen it. "Of course, it's) Tj
T* (the combination of the practical and the transcendental that is so hard for) Tj
T* (beginners to grasp." He slipped the sketch to the bottom of the pile.) Tj
T* ("Architecture is primarily a utilitarian conception, and the problem is to) Tj
T* (elevate the principle of pragmatism into the realm of esthetic abstraction. All) Tj
T* (else is nonsense." He glanced at two sketches and slipped them to the bottom. "I) Tj
T* (have no patience with visionaries who see a holy crusade in architecture for) Tj
T* (architecture's sake. The great dynamic principle is the common principle of the) Tj
T* (human equation." He glanced at a sketch and slipped it under. "The public taste) Tj
T* (and the public heart are the final criteria of the artist. The genius is the one) Tj
T* (who knows how to express the general. The exception is to tap the) Tj
T* (unexceptional." He) Tj
T* (weighed the pile of sketches in his hand, noted that he had gone through half of) Tj
T* (them and dropped them down on the desk.) Tj
T* T* ("Ah, yes," he said, "your work. Very interesting. But not practical. Not mature.) Tj
T* (Unfocused and undisciplined. Adolescent. Originality for originality's sake. Not) Tj
T* (at all in the spirit of the present day. If you want an idea of the sort of) Tj
T* (thing for which there is a crying need--here--let me show you." He took a sketch) Tj
T* (out of a drawer of the desk. "Here's a young man who came to me totally) Tj
T* (unrecommended, a beginner who had never worked before. When you can produce) Tj
T* (stuff like this, you won't find it necessary to look for a job. I saw this one) Tj
T* (sketch of his and I took him on at once, started him at twenty-five a week, too.) Tj
T* (There's no question but that he is a potential genius." He extended the sketch) Tj
T* (to Roark. The sketch represented a house in the shape of a grain silo incredibly) Tj
T* (merged with the simplified, emaciated shadow of the Parthenon.) Tj
T* T* ("That," said Gordon L. Prescott, "is originality, the new in the eternal. Try) Tj
T* (toward something like this. I can't really say that I predict a great deal for) Tj

T* (days that stretched into months behind him, and he could not tell what had taken) Tj
T* (place in the hours of that day, whom he had seen, what form the words of refusal) Tj
T* (had taken. He concentrated fiercely on the few minutes at hand, when he was in) Tj
T* (an office, forgetting everything else; he forgot these minutes when he left the) Tj
T* (office; it had to be done, it had been done, it concerned him no longer. He was) Tj
T* (free once more on his way home.) Tj
T* T* (A long street stretched before him, its high banks, coming close together ahead,) Tj
T* (so narrow that he felt as if he could spread his arms, seize the spires and push) Tj
T* (them apart. He walked swiftly, the pavements as a springboard throwing his steps) Tj
T* (forward.) Tj
T* T* (He saw a lighted triangle of concrete suspended somewhere hundreds of feet above) Tj
T* (the ground. He could not see what stood below, supporting it; he was free to) Tj
T* (think of what he'd want to see there, what he would have made to be seen. Then) Tj
T* (he thought suddenly that now, in this moment, according to the city, according) Tj
T* (to everyone save that hard certainty within him, he would never build again,) Tj
T* (never--before he had begun. He shrugged. Those things happening to him, in those) Tj
T* (offices of strangers, were only a kind of sub-reality, unsubstantial incidents) Tj
T* (in the path of a substance they could not reach or touch.) Tj
T* T* (He turned into side streets leading to the East River. A lonely traffic light) Tj
T* (hung far ahead, a spot of red in a bleak darkness. The old houses crouched low) Tj
T* (to the ground, hunched under the weight of the sky. The street was empty and) Tj

T* T* ("Remarkable. Radical, but remarkable. What are you doing tonight?") Tj
T* T* ("Why?" asked Roark, stupefied.) Tj

T* (room, borrow tools from somebody and do me up a sketch for a department store) Tj
T* (we're remodeling. Just a quick sketch, just a general idea, but I must have it) Tj
T* (tomorrow. Mind staying late tonight? The heat's on and I'll have Joe send you up) Tj
T* (some dinner. Want black coffee or Scotch or what? Just tell Joe. Can you stay?") Tj
T* T* ("Yes," said Roark, incredulously. "I can work all night.") Tj

T* (this fact. He considered Guy Francon an impractical idealist; he was not) Tj
T* (restrained by an Classic dogma; he was much more skillful and liberal: he built) Tj
T* (anything. He had no distaste for modern architecture and built cheerfully, when) Tj
T* (a rare client asked for it, bare boxes with flat roofs, which he called) Tj
T* (progressive; he built Roman mansions which he called fastidious; he built Gothic) Tj
T* (churches which he called spiritual. He saw no difference among any of them. He) Tj
T* (never became angry, except when somebody called him eclectic.) Tj
T* T* (He had a system of his own. He employed five designers of various types and he) Tj
T* (staged a contest among them on each commission he received. He chose the winning) Tj

T* (better than one.") Tj
T* T* (When Roark saw the final drawing of the Benton Department Store, he understood) Tj

T* (space, his windows, his system of circulation; he saw, added to it, Corinthian) Tj
T* (capitals, Gothic vaulting, Colonial chandeliers and incredible moldings, vaguely) Tj
T* (Moorish. The drawing was done in water-color, with miraculous delicacy, mounted) Tj
T* (on cardboard, covered with a veil of tissue paper. The men in the drafting room) Tj

T* (art criticism, but grown into an informal tribune from which Ellsworth M. Toohey) Tj
T* (pronounced verdicts on art, literature, New York restaurants, international) Tj
T* (crises and sociology--mainly sociology. It had been a great success. But the) Tj
T* (building strike had placed Ellsworth M. Toohey in a difficult position. He made) Tj

T* (column, for no one could say what he pleased on the papers owned by Gail Wynand) Tj
T* (save Gail Wynand. However, a mass meeting of strike sympathizers had been called) Tj
T* (for this evening. Many famous men were to speak, Ellsworth Toohey among them. At) Tj
T* (least, Toohey's name had been announced.) Tj
T* T* (The event caused a great deal of curious speculation and bets were made on) Tj
T* (whether Toohey would dare to appear. "He will," Keating had heard a draftsman) Tj
T* (insist vehemently, "he'll sacrifice himself. He's that kind. He's the only) Tj
T* (honest man in print.") Tj
T* T* ("He won't," another had said. "Do you realize what it means to pull a stunt like) Tj
T* (that on Wynand? Once Wynand gets it in for a man, he'll break the guy for sure) Tj
T* (as hell's fire. Nobody knows when he'll do it or how he'll do it, but he'll do) Tj
T* (it, and nobody'll prove a thing on him, and you're done for once you get Wynand) Tj
T* (after you." Keating did not care about the issue one way or another, and the) Tj
T* (whole matter annoyed him.) Tj
T* T* (He ate his dinner, that evening, in grim silence and when Mrs. Keating began,) Tj
T* (with an "Oh, by the way..." to lead the conversation in a direction he) Tj
T* (recognized, he snapped: "You're not going to talk about Catherine. Keep still.") Tj
T* (Mrs. Keating said nothing further and concentrated on forcing more food on his) Tj

T* T* (He stood, looking up at the windows as at a tremendous betrayal. Then came a) Tj

T* (want to hear Austen Heller?") Tj
T* T* (Keating looked up at the loud-speaker with a certain respect, which he felt for) Tj
T* (all famous names. He had not read much of Austen Heller, but he knew that Heller) Tj
T* (was the star columnist of the Chronicle, a brilliant, independent newspaper,) Tj
T* (arch-enemy of the Wynand publications; that Heller came from an old,) Tj
T* (distinguished family and had graduated from Oxford; that he had started as a) Tj
T* (literary critic and ended by becoming a quiet fiend devoted to the destruction) Tj
T* (of all forms of compulsion, private or public, in heaven or on earth; that he) Tj
T* (had been cursed by preachers, bankers, club-women and labor organizers; that he) Tj
T* (had better manners than the social elite whom he usually mocked, and a tougher) Tj
T* (constitution than the laborers whom he usually defended; that he could discuss) Tj
T* (the latest play on Broadway, medieval poetry or international finance; that he) Tj
T* (never donated to charity, but spent more of his own money than he could afford,) Tj
T* (on defending political prisoners anywhere.) Tj
T* T* (The voice coming from the loud-speaker was dry, precise, with the faint trace of) Tj
T* (a British accent.) Tj
T* T* ("...and we must consider," Austen Heller was saying unemotionally, "that) Tj
T* (since--unfortunately--we are forced to live together, the most important thing) Tj
T* (for us to remember is that the only way in which we can have any law at all is) Tj
T* (to have as little of it as possible. I see no ethical standard to which to) Tj
T* (measure the whole unethical conception of a State, except in the amount of time,) Tj
T* (of thought, of money, of effort and of obedience, which a society extorts from) Tj
T* (its every member. Its value and its civilization are in inverse ratio to that) Tj
T* (extortion. There is no conceivable law by which a man can be forced to work on) Tj
T* (any terms except those he chooses to set. There is no conceivable law to prevent) Tj
T* (him from setting them--just as there is none to force his employer to accept) Tj
T* (them. The freedom to agree or disagree is the foundation of our kind of) Tj
T* (society--and the freedom to strike is a part of it. I am mentioning this as a) Tj
T* (reminder to a certain Petronius from Hell's Kitchen, an exquisite bastard who) Tj
T* (has been rather noisy lately about telling us that this strike represents a) Tj
T* (destruction of law and order.") Tj
T* T* (The loud-speaker coughed out a high, shrill sound of approval and a clatter of) Tj
T* (applause. There were gasps among the people in the lobby. Catherine grasped) Tj
T* (Keating's arm. "Oh, Peter!" she whispered. "He means Wynand! Wynand was born in) Tj
T* (Hell's Kitchen. He can afford to say that, but Wynand will take it out on Uncle) Tj
T* (Ellsworth!") Tj
T* T* (Keating could not listen to the rest of Heller's speech, because his head was) Tj
T* (swimming in so violent an ache that the sounds hurt his eyes and he had to keep) Tj
T* (his eyelids shut tightly. He leaned against the wall.) Tj
T* T* (He opened his eyes with a jerk, when he became aware of the peculiar silence) Tj
T* (around him. He had not noticed the end of Heller's speech. He saw the people in) Tj
T* (the lobby standing in tense, solemn expectation, and the blank rasping of the) Tj
T* (loud-speaker pulled every glance into its dark funnel. Then a voice came through) Tj
T* (the silence, loudly and slowly:) Tj
T* T* ("Ladies and gentlemen, I have the great honor of presenting to you now Mr.) Tj
T* (Ellsworth Monkton Toohey!") Tj
T* T* (Well, thought Keating, Bennett's won his six bits down at the office. There were) Tj
T* (a few seconds of silence. Then the thing which happened hit Keating on the back) Tj
T* (of the head; it was not a sound nor a blow, it was something that ripped time) Tj
T* (apart, that cut the moment from the normal one preceding it. He knew only the) Tj
T* (shock, at first; a distinct, conscious second was gone before he realized what) Tj

T* (for the loud-speaker to explode; it went on and on and on, pressing against the) Tj
T* (walls of the lobby, and he thought he could feel the walls buckling out to the) Tj
T* (street.) Tj
T* T* (The people around him were cheering. Catherine stood, her lips parted, and he) Tj
T* (felt certain that she was not breathing at all.) Tj
T* T* (It was a long time before silence came suddenly, as abrupt and shocking as the) Tj
T* (roar; the loud-speaker died, choking on a high note. Those in the lobby stood) Tj
T* (still. Then came the voice.) Tj
T* T* ("My friends," it said, simply and solemnly. "My brothers," it added softly,) Tj
T* (involuntarily, both full of emotion and smiling apologetically at the emotion.) Tj
T* ("I am more touched by this reception than I should allow myself to be. I hope I) Tj

T* (realize--and in that spirit I accept it--that this tribute was paid not to my) Tj

T* (humility tonight.") Tj
T* T* (It was not a voice, it was a miracle. It unrolled as a velvet banner. It spoke) Tj
T* (English words, but the resonant clarity of each syllable made it sound like a) Tj
T* (new language spoken for the first time. It was the voice of a giant.) Tj
T* T* (Keating stood, his mouth open. He did not hear what the voice was saying. He) Tj
T* (heard the beauty of the sounds without meaning. He felt no need to know the) Tj
T* (meaning; he could accept anything, he would be led blindly anywhere.) Tj
T* T* ("...and so, my friends," the voice was saying, "the lesson to be learned from) Tj
T* (our tragic struggle is the lesson of unity. We shall unite or we shall be) Tj
T* (defeated. Our will--the will of the disinherited, the forgotten, the) Tj
T* (oppressed--shall weld us into a solid bulwark, with a common faith and a common) Tj

T* (that determine it. Let us listen to the call. Let us organize, my brothers. Let) Tj
T* (us organize. Let us organize. Let us organize.") Tj
T* T* (Keating looked at Catherine. There was no Catherine; there was only a white face) Tj
T* (dissolving in the sounds of the loudspeaker. It was not that she heard her) Tj
T* (uncle; Keating could feel no jealousy of him; he wished he could. It was not) Tj
T* (affection. It was something cold and impersonal that left her empty, her will) Tj
T* (surrendered and no human will holding hers, but a nameless thing in which she) Tj
T* (was being swallowed.) Tj
T* T* ("Let's get out of here," he whispered. His voice was savage. He was afraid.) Tj
T* T* (She turned to him, as if she were emerging from unconsciousness. He knew that) Tj

T* (direction. It was cold, but they went on, to move, to feel the movement, to know) Tj

T* T* ("Nothing," said Roark.) Tj
T* T* (This ended the first conference on the subject of a residence for Austen Heller.) Tj
T* T* (Later that day Snyte crowded his five designers into a train, and they went to) Tj
T* (Connecticut to see the site Heller had chosen. They stood on a lonely, rocky) Tj
T* (stretch of shore, three miles beyond an unfashionable little town; they munched) Tj
T* (sandwiches and peanuts, and they looked at a cliff rising in broken ledges from) Tj
T* (the ground to end in a straight, brutal, naked drop over the sea, a vertical) Tj
T* (shaft of rock forming a cross with the long, pale horizontal of the sea.) Tj
T* T* ("There," said Snyte. "That's it." He twirled a pencil in his hand. "Damnable,) Tj
T* (eh?" He sighed. "I tried to suggest a more respectable location, but he didn't) Tj
T* (take it so well so I had to shut up." He twirled the pencil. "That's where he) Tj

T* T* ("I don't know. Not a thing. I was working on my research notes all day, and) Tj
T* (nothing had happened at all. No calls or visitors. And then suddenly tonight, I) Tj
T* (had that feeling, it was like a nightmare, you know, the kind of horror that you) Tj
T* (can't describe, that's not like anything normal at all. Just the feeling that I) Tj
T* (was in mortal danger, that something was closing in on me, that I'd never escape) Tj
T* (it, because it wouldn't let me and it was too late.") Tj
T* T* ("That you'd never escape what?") Tj
T* T* ("I don't know exactly. Everything. My whole life. You know, like quicksand.) Tj
T* (Smooth and natural. With not a thing that you can notice about it or suspect.) Tj
T* (And you walk on it easily. When you've noticed, it's too late....And I felt that) Tj

T* (Haven't you ever had a feeling like that, just fear that you couldn't explain?") Tj
T* T* ("Yes," he whispered.) Tj
T* T* ("You don't think I'm crazy?") Tj
T* T* ("No, Katie. Only what was it exactly that started it? Anything in particular?") Tj
T* T* ("Well...it seems so silly now." She giggled apologetically. "It was like this: I) Tj
T* (was sitting in my room and it was a little chilly, so I didn't open the window.) Tj
T* (I had so many papers and books on the table, I hardly had room to write and) Tj
T* (every time I made a note my elbow'd push something off. There were piles of) Tj
T* (things on the floor all around me, all paper, and it rustled a little, because I) Tj
T* (had the door to the living room half open and there was a little draft, I guess.) Tj
T* (Uncle was working too, in the living room. I was getting along fine, I'd been at) Tj
T* (it for hours, didn't even know what time it was. And then suddenly it got me. I) Tj
T* (don't know why. Maybe the room was stuffy, or maybe it was the silence, I) Tj
T* (couldn't hear a thing, not a sound in the living room, and there was that paper) Tj
T* (rustling, so softly, like somebody being choked to death. And then I looked) Tj
T* (around and...and I couldn't see Uncle in the living room, but I saw his shadow) Tj
T* (on the wall, a huge shadow, all hunched, and it didn't move, only it was so) Tj
T* (huge!") Tj
T* T* (She shuddered. The thing did not seem silly to her any longer. She whispered:) Tj
T* T* ("That's when it got me. It wouldn't move, that shadow, but I thought all that) Tj
T* (paper was moving, I thought it was rising very slowly off the floor, and it was) Tj
T* (going to come to my throat and I was going to drown. That's when I screamed.) Tj
T* (And, Peter, he didn't hear. He didn't hear it! Because the shadow didn't move.) Tj
T* (Then I seized my hat and coat and I ran. When I was running through the living) Tj
T* (room, I think he said: 'Why, Catherine, what time is it?--Where are you going?') Tj
T* (Something like that, I'm not sure. But I didn't look back and I didn't answer--I) Tj
T* (couldn't. I was afraid of him. Afraid of Uncle Ellsworth who's never said a) Tj
T* (harsh word to me in his life!...That was all, Peter. I can't understand it, but) Tj
T* (I'm afraid. Not so much any more, not here with you, but I'm afraid...." Mrs.) Tj
T* (Keating spoke, her voice dry and crisp: "Why, it's plain what happened to you,) Tj
T* (my dear. You worked too hard and overdid it, and you just got a mite) Tj
T* (hysterical.") Tj
T* T* ("Yes...probably...") Tj
T* T* ("No," said Keating dully, "no, it wasn't that...." He was thinking of the) Tj

T* (he could die at any moment, Francon would hesitate--in the bitter aftermath of a) Tj
T* (public humiliation--to accept Keating as his partner; if Francon hesitated, the) Tj
T* (game was lost. There were others waiting for the opportunity: Bennett, whom he) Tj
T* (had been unable to get out of the office; Claude Stengel, who had been doing) Tj
T* (very well on his own, and had approached Francon with an offer to buy Heyer's) Tj
T* (place. Keating had nothing to count on, except Francon's uncertain faith in him.) Tj
T* (Once another partner replaced Heyer, it would be the end of Keating's future. He) Tj
T* (had come too close and had missed. That was never forgiven.) Tj
T* T* (Through the sleepless nights the decision had become clear and hard in his mind:) Tj
T* (he had to close the issue at once; he had to take advantage of Francon's deluded) Tj

T* (out and take his place; he had only a few days left.) Tj
T* T* (He remembered Francon's gossip about Heyer's character. He looked through the) Tj
T* (files in Heyer's office and found what he had hoped to find. It was a letter) Tj

T* (faultlessly clean, but the room smelt, somehow, of indigence and of decay. There) Tj
T* (was a single lamp burning on a small table in a corner, and five delicate,) Tj

T* (the cups in the dim light, with a vague, pointless enjoyment. He shuddered a) Tj

T* (over that building of yours. Thank God it's over. Some of our members just) Tj
T* (couldn't swallow your radical innovations. You know how stupidly conservative) Tj
T* (some people are. But we've found a way to please them, and we got their consent.) Tj
T* (Mr. Weidler here was really magnificently convincing on your behalf.") Tj
T* T* (A great deal more was said by the three men. Roark barely heard it. He was) Tj
T* (thinking of the first bite of machine into earth that begins an excavation. Then) Tj
T* (he heard the chairman saying: "...and so it's yours, on one minor condition." He) Tj
T* (heard that and looked at the chairman.) Tj
T* T* ("It's a small compromise, and when you agree to it we can sign the contract.) Tj
T* (It's only an inconsequential matter of the building's appearance. I understand) Tj
T* (that you modernists attach no great importance to a mere facade, it's the plan) Tj
T* (that counts with you, quite rightly, and we wouldn't think of altering your plan) Tj
T* (in any way, it's the logic of the plan that sold us on the building. So I'm sure) Tj
T* (you won't mind.") Tj
T* T* ("What do you want?") Tj
T* T* ("It's only a matter of a slight alteration in the facade. I'll show you. Our Mr.) Tj
T* (Parker's son is studying architecture and we had him draw us up a sketch, just a) Tj
T* (rough sketch to illustrate what we had in mind and to show the members of the) Tj
T* (board, because they couldn't have visualized the compromise we offered. Here it) Tj
T* (is.") Tj
T* T* (He pulled a sketch from under the drawings on the table and handed it to Roark.) Tj
T* T* (It was Roark's building on the sketch, very neatly drawn. It was his building,) Tj
T* (but it had a simplified Doric portico in front, a cornice on top, and his) Tj
T* (ornament was replaced by a stylized Greek ornament.) Tj
T* T* (Roark got up. He had to stand. He concentrated on the effort of standing. It) Tj
T* (made the rest easier. He leaned on one straight arm, his hand closed over the) Tj
T* (edge of the table, the tendons showing under the skin of his wrist.) Tj
T* T* ("You see the point?" said the chairman soothingly. "Our conservatives simply) Tj
T* (refused to accept a queer stark building like yours. And they claim that the) Tj
T* (public won't accept it either. So we hit upon the middle course. In this way,) Tj
T* (though it's not traditional architecture of course, it will give the public the) Tj
T* (impression of what they're accustomed to. It adds a certain air of sound, stable) Tj
T* (dignity--and that's what we want in a bank, isn't it? It does seem to be an) Tj
T* (unwritten law that a bank must have a Classic portico--and a bank is not exactly) Tj
T* (the right institution to parade law-breaking and rebellion. Undermines that) Tj
T* (intangible feeling of confidence, you know. People don't trust novelty. But this) Tj
T* (is the scheme that pleased everybody. Personally, I wouldn't insist on it, but I) Tj
T* (really don't see that it spoils anything. And that's what the board has decided.) Tj
T* (Of course, we don't mean that we want you to follow this sketch. But it gives) Tj
T* (you our general idea and you'll work it out yourself, make your own adaptation) Tj
T* (of the Classic motive to the facade.") Tj
T* T* (Then Roark answered. The men could not classify the tone of his voice; they) Tj
T* (could not decide whether it was too great a calm or too great an emotion. They) Tj
T* (concluded that it was calm, because the voice moved forward evenly, without) Tj
T* (stress, without color, each syllable spaced as by a machine; only the air in the) Tj
T* (room was not the air that vibrates to a calm voice.) Tj
T* T* (They concluded that there was nothing abnormal in the manner of the man who was) Tj

T* (to her chin, to her nostrils. The air shimmered below, sparks of fire shot) Tj

T* (a slender naked body of a man who looked as if he could break through the steel) Tj
T* (plate of a battleship and through any barrier whatever. It stood like a) Tj
T* (challenge. It left a strange stamp on one's eyes. It made the people around it) Tj

T* (unhardened bones. At a second glance one wished to be sure that the overcoat) Tj

T* (but left too much emphasis to the ears that flared out in solitary nakedness,) Tj
T* (like the handles of a bouillon cup. The nose was long and thin, prolonged by the) Tj

T* (a wealth of intellect and of twinkling gaiety that his glasses seemed to be worn) Tj
T* (not to protect his eyes but to protect other men from their excessive) Tj
T* (brilliance.) Tj
T* T* ("Hello, Peter Keating," said Ellsworth Monkton Toohey in his compelling, magical) Tj
T* (voice. "What do you think of the temple of Nike Apteros?") Tj

T* T* (At the first meeting of the proposed organization of young architects Keating) Tj
T* (concluded that Toohey had a wonderful ability for choosing people who fitted) Tj
T* (well together. There was an air about the eighteen persons present which he) Tj
T* (could not define, but which gave him a sense of comfort, a security he had not) Tj
T* (experienced in solitude or in any other gathering; and part of the comfort was) Tj
T* (the knowledge that all the others felt the same way for the same unaccountable) Tj
T* (reason. It was a feeling of brotherhood, but somehow not of a sainted or noble) Tj
T* (brotherhood; yet this precisely was the comfort--that one felt, among them, no) Tj
T* (necessity for being sainted or noble.) Tj
T* T* (Were it not for this kinship, Keating would have been disappointed in the) Tj
T* (gathering. Of the eighteen seated about Toohey's living room, none was an) Tj
T* (architect of distinction, except himself and Gordon L. Prescott, who wore a) Tj
T* (beige turtle-neck sweater and looked faintly patronizing, but eager. Keating had) Tj
T* (never heard the names of the others. Most of them were beginners, young, poorly) Tj
T* (dressed and belligerent. Some were only draftsmen. There was one woman architect) Tj
T* (who had built a few small private homes, mainly for wealthy widows; she had an) Tj
T* (aggressive manner, a tight mouth and a fresh petunia in her hair. There was a) Tj
T* (boy with pure, innocent eyes. There was an obscure contractor with a fat,) Tj
T* (expressionless face. There was a tall, dry woman who was an interior decorator,) Tj
T* (and another woman of no definite occupation at all.) Tj
T* T* (Keating could not understand what exactly was to be the purpose of the group,) Tj
T* (though there was a great deal of talk. None of the talk was too coherent, but) Tj
T* (all of it seemed to have the same undercurrent. He felt that the undercurrent) Tj
T* (was the one thing clear among all the vague generalities, even though nobody) Tj
T* (would mention it. It held him there, as it held the others, and he had no desire) Tj
T* (to define it.) Tj
T* T* (The young men talked a great deal about injustice, unfairness, the cruelty of) Tj
T* (society toward youth, and suggested that everyone should have his future) Tj
T* (commissions guaranteed when he left college. The woman architect shrieked) Tj
T* (briefly something about the iniquity of the rich. The contractor barked that it) Tj
T* (was a hard world and that "fellows gotta help one another." The boy with the) Tj
T* (innocent eyes pleaded that "we could do so much good..." His voice had a note of) Tj
T* (desperate sincerity which seemed embarrassing and out of place. Gordon L.) Tj
T* (Prescott declared that the A.G.A. was a bunch of old fogies with no conception) Tj
T* (of social responsibility and not a drop of virile blood in the lot of them, and) Tj
T* (that it was time to kick them in the pants anyway. The woman of indefinite) Tj
T* (occupation spoke about ideals and causes, though nobody could gather just what) Tj
T* (these were.) Tj
T* T* (Peter Keating was elected chairman, unanimously. Gordon L. Prescott was elected) Tj
T* (vice-chairman and treasurer. Toohey declined all nominations. He declared that) Tj
T* (he would act only as an unofficial advisor. It was decided that the organization) Tj
T* (would be named the "Council of American Builders." It was decided that) Tj
T* (membership would not be restricted to architects, but would be open to "allied) Tj
T* (crafts" and to "all those holding the interests of the great profession of) Tj
T* (building at heart.") Tj
T* T* (Then Toohey spoke. He spoke at some length, standing up, leaning on the knuckles) Tj
T* (of one hand against a table. His great voice was soft and persuasive. It filled) Tj
T* (the room, but it made his listeners realize that it could have filled a Roman) Tj
T* (amphitheater; there was something subtly flattering in this realization, in the) Tj
T* (sound of the powerful voice being held in check for their benefit.) Tj

T* (manner; but insolence had been her first impression of him. He wore evening) Tj
T* (clothes and they looked well on his tall, thin figure, but somehow it seemed) Tj
T* (that he did not belong in them; the orange hair looked preposterous with formal) Tj
T* (dress; besides, she did not like his face; that face suited a work gang or an) Tj

T* (to see a human face presenting a bone structure and an arrangement of muscles,) Tj
T* (but no meaning, a face as a simple anatomical feature, like a shoulder or an) Tj

T* (have looked, meeting her for the first time. She wished she could find some hint) Tj
T* (in his face, if only a hint of his old derisive smile; even mockery would be an) Tj

T* (distance of a few feet from her, like a man who could not possibly permit) Tj
T* (himself to come closer. She thought that this was his form of mockery, after) Tj
T* (what he had not forgotten and would not acknowledge. She thought that he wanted) Tj
T* (her to be first to name it, he would bring her to the humiliation of accepting) Tj

T* T* (Mr. Toohey, for reasons which he could not explain, was not too fond of his son.) Tj
T* (Ellsworth, however, was the ruler of the household, by a tacit, voluntary) Tj
T* (submission of both parents, though his father could never understand the cause) Tj
T* (of his own share in that submission.) Tj
T* T* (In the evenings, under the lamp of the family sitting room, Mrs. Toohey would) Tj
T* (begin, in a tense, challenging voice, angry and defeated in advance: "Horace, I) Tj
T* (want a bicycle. A bicycle for Ellsworth. All the boys his age have them, Willie) Tj
T* (Lovett just got a new one the other day, Horace. Horace, I want a bicycle for) Tj

T* T* ("Not right now, Mary," Mr. Toohey would answer wearily. "Maybe next) Tj
T* (summer....Just now we can't afford...") Tj
T* T* (Mrs. Toohey would argue, her voice rising in jerks toward a shriek.) Tj
T* T* ("Mother, what for?" said Ellsworth, his voice soft, rich and clear, lower than) Tj
T* (the voices of his parents, yet cutting across them, commanding, strangely) Tj
T* (persuasive. "There's many things we need more than a bicycle. What do you care) Tj
T* (about Willie Lovett? I don't like Willie. Willie's a dumbbell. Willie can afford) Tj

T* (not ostentatiously sweet, not reproachful, not malicious; just blank. Mr. Toohey) Tj
T* (felt that he should be grateful for his son's understanding--and wished to hell) Tj
T* (the boy had not mentioned that part about the private store.) Tj
T* T* (Ellsworth did not get the bicycle. But he got a polite attention in the house, a) Tj
T* (respectful solicitude--tender and guilty, from his mother, uneasy and suspicious) Tj
T* (from his father. Mr. Toohey would do anything rather than be forced into a) Tj
T* (conversation with Ellsworth--feeling, at the same time, foolish and angry at) Tj
T* (himself for his fear.) Tj
T* T* ("Horace, I want a new suit. A new suit for Ellsworth. I saw one in a window) Tj

T* (unexpected: Ellsworth did the expected, better than anyone had ever seen it) Tj
T* (done. When they came to compositions, Johnny would stun the class by some) Tj
T* (brilliant display of rebellion. Given the theme of "School Days--The Golden) Tj
T* (Age," Johnny came through with a masterly essay on how he hated school and why.) Tj
T* (Ellsworth delivered a prose poem on the glory of school days, which was) Tj

T* T* (The children called him "Elsie Toohey." They usually let him have his way, and) Tj

T* (Noonan is a fish eater." Johnny never gave him a beating, and neither did the) Tj
T* (other boys, because Ellsworth wore glasses.) Tj
T* T* (He could not take part in ball games, and was the only child who boasted about) Tj
T* (it, instead of feeling frustrated or ashamed like the other boys with) Tj
T* (substandard bodies. He considered athletics vulgar and said so; the brain, he) Tj
T* (said, was mightier than the brawn; he meant it.) Tj
T* T* (He had no close personal friends. He was considered impartial and incorruptible.) Tj
T* (There were two incidents in his childhood of which his mother was very proud.) Tj
T* T* (It happened that the wealthy, popular Willie Lovett gave a birthday party on the) Tj
T* (same day as Drippy Munn, son of a widowed seamstress, a whining boy whose nose) Tj
T* (was always running. Nobody accepted Drippy's invitation, except the children who) Tj
T* (were never invited anywhere. Of those asked for both occasions, Ellsworth Toohey) Tj
T* (was the only one who snubbed Willie Lovett and went to Drippy Munn's party, a) Tj
T* (miserable affair from which he expected and received no pleasure. Willie) Tj
T* (Lovett's enemies howled and taunted Willie for months afterward--about being) Tj

T* T* (It happened that Pat Noonan offered Ellsworth a bag of jelly beans in exchange) Tj

T* (allowed Pat to copy his test. A week later, Ellsworth marched up to the teacher,) Tj

T* (him; Ellsworth remained silent; he explained only that the guilty boy was one of) Tj
T* (the best students, and he could not sacrifice the boy's record to the demands of) Tj
T* (his own conscience. He was the only one punished--kept after school for two) Tj

T* T* (Ellsworth was eleven years old when his mother died. Aunt Adeline, his father's) Tj
T* (maiden sister, came to live with them and run the Toohey household. Aunt Adeline) Tj
T* (was a tall, capable woman to whom the word "horse" clung in conjunction with the) Tj
T* (words "sense" and "face." The secret sorrow of her life was that she had never) Tj
T* (inspired romance. Helen became her immediate favorite. She considered Ellsworth) Tj
T* (an imp out of hell. But Ellsworth never wavered in his manner of grave courtesy) Tj
T* (toward Aunt Adeline. He leaped to pick up her handkerchief, to move her chair,) Tj
T* (when they had company, particularly masculine company. He sent her beautiful) Tj
T* (Valentines on the appropriate day--with paper lace, rosebuds and love poems. He) Tj
T* (sang "Sweet Adeline" at the top of his town crier's voice. "You're a maggot,) Tj
T* (Elsie," she told him once. "You feed on sores.") Tj
T* T* ("Then I'll never starve," he answered. After a while they reached a state of) Tj
T* (armed neutrality. Ellsworth was left to grow up as he pleased.) Tj
T* T* (In high school Ellsworth became a local celebrity--the star orator. For years) Tj
T* (the school did not refer to a promising boy as a good speaker, but as "a) Tj
T* (Toohey." He won every contest. Afterward, members of the audience spoke about) Tj
T* ("that beautiful boy"; they did not remember the sorry little figure with the) Tj
T* (sunken chest, inadequate legs and glasses; they remembered the voice. He won) Tj
T* (every debate. He could prove anything. Once, after beating Willie Lovett with) Tj
T* (the affirmative of "The Pen Is Mightier than the Sword," he challenged Willie to) Tj
T* (reverse their positions, took the negative and won again.,) Tj
T* T* (Until the age of sixteen Ellsworth felt himself drawn to the career of a) Tj
T* (minister. He thought a great deal about religion. He talked about God and the) Tj
T* (spirit. He read extensively on the subject. He read more books on the history of) Tj
T* (the church than on the substance of faith. He brought his audience to tears in) Tj
T* (one of his greatest oratorical triumphs with the theme of "The meek shall) Tj
T* (inherit the earth.") Tj
T* T* (At this period he began to acquire friends. He liked to speak of faith and he) Tj
T* (found those who liked to listen. Only, he discovered that the bright, the) Tj
T* (strong, the able boys of his class felt no need of listening, felt no need of) Tj
T* (him at all. But the suffering and ill-endowed came to him. Drippy Munn began to) Tj
T* (follow him about with the silent devotion of a dog. Billy Wilson lost his) Tj
T* (mother, and came wandering to the Toohey house in the evenings, to sit with) Tj
T* (Ellsworth on the porch, listening, shivering once in a while, saying nothing,) Tj
T* (his eyes wide, dry and pleading. Skinny Dix got infantile paralysis--and would) Tj
T* (lie in bed, watching the street corner beyond the window, waiting for Ellsworth.) Tj
T* (Rusty Hazelton failed to pass in his grades, and sat for many hours, crying,) Tj
T* (with Ellsworth's cold, steady hand on his shoulder. It was never clear whether) Tj
T* (they all discovered Ellsworth or Ellsworth discovered them. It seemed to work) Tj
T* (more like a law of nature: as nature allows no vacuum, so pain and Ellsworth) Tj
T* (Toohey drew each other. His rich, beautiful voice said to them: "It's good to) Tj
T* (suffer. Don't complain. Bear, bow, accept--and be grateful that God has made you) Tj
T* (suffer. For this makes you better than the people who are laughing and happy. If) Tj
T* (you don't understand this, don't try to understand. Everything bad comes from) Tj
T* (the mind, because the mind asks too many questions. It is blessed to believe,) Tj
T* (not to understand. So if you didn't get passing grades, be glad of it. It means) Tj
T* (that you are better than the smart boys who think too much and too easily.") Tj
T* T* (People said it was touching, the way Ellsworth's friends clung to him. After) Tj
T* (they had taken him for a while, they could not do without him. It was like a) Tj
T* (drug habit.) Tj
T* T* (Ellsworth was fifteen, when he astonished the Bible-class teacher by an odd) Tj
T* (question. The teacher had been elaborating upon the text: "What shall it profit) Tj

T* (teacher was about to ask him what the hell did he mean, but controlled himself) Tj
T* (and asked what did he mean. Ellsworth would not elucidate.) Tj
T* T* (At the age of sixteen, Ellsworth lost interest in religion. He discovered) Tj

T* T* ("In the first place, my dear aunt," he answered, "don't call me Elsie. In the) Tj
T* (second place, you're wrong.") Tj
T* T* (The change seemed good for Ellsworth. He did not become an aggressive zealot. He) Tj
T* (became gentler, quieter, milder. He became more attentively considerate of) Tj
T* (people. It was as if something had taken the nervous edges off his personality) Tj
T* (and given him new confidence. Those around him began to like him. Aunt Adeline) Tj
T* (stopped worrying. Nothing actual seemed to come of his preoccupation with) Tj

T* (he attended a few dubious meetings, where he spoke once or twice, not too well,) Tj
T* (but mostly sat in a corner, listening, watching, thinking.) Tj
T* T* (Ellsworth went to Harvard. His mother had willed her life insurance for that) Tj

T* (sociology; she half feared that he would end up as a social worker. He didn't.) Tj
T* (He became absorbed in literature and the fine arts. It baffled her a little; it) Tj

T* T* ("You're wrong, auntie," he said.) Tj
T* T* (Ellsworth's relations with his fellow students were the most unusual of his) Tj
T* (achievements at Harvard. He made himself accepted. Among the proud young) Tj
T* (descendants of proud old names, he did not hide the fact of his humble) Tj
T* (background; he exaggerated it. He did not tell them that his father was the) Tj
T* (manager of a shoe store; "he said that his father was a shoe cobbler. He said it) Tj
T* (without defiance, bitterness or proletarian arrogance; he said it as if it were) Tj
T* (a joke on him and--if one looked closely into his smile--on them. He acted like) Tj
T* (a snob; not a flagrant snob, but a natural, innocent one who tries very hard not) Tj
T* (to be snobbish. He was polite, not in the manner of one seeking favor, but in) Tj
T* (the manner of one granting it. His attitude was contagious. People did not) Tj
T* (question the reasons of his superiority; they took it for granted that such) Tj
T* (reasons existed. It became amusing, at first, to accept "Monk" Toohey; then it) Tj
T* (became distinctive and progressive. If this was a victory Ellsworth did not seem) Tj
T* (conscious of it as such; he did not seem to care. He moved among all these) Tj
T* (unformed youths, with the assurance of a man who has a plan, a long-range plan) Tj

T* (incidentals on his way. His smile had a secret, closed quality, the smile of a) Tj
T* (shopkeeper counting profits--even though nothing in particular seemed to be) Tj
T* (happening.) Tj
T* T* (He did not talk about God and the nobility of suffering. He talked about the) Tj
T* (masses. He proved to a rapt audience, at bull sessions lasting till dawn, that) Tj

T* T* (The years passed, with each busy day of his life like a small, neat coin dropped) Tj
T* (patiently into a gigantic slot machine, without a glance at the combination of) Tj

T* (out among the others: he became known as an eminent critic of architecture. He) Tj
T* (wrote about buildings for three successive magazines that limped on noisily for) Tj
T* (a few years and failed, one after the other: New Voices, New Pathways, New) Tj

T* (the knowledge, and the world--in the eyes of witnesses--looks like a better) Tj

T* (Catherine would remain with him.) Tj
T* T* (In the year 1925 came Sermons in Stone--and fame.) Tj
T* T* (Ellsworth Toohey became a fashion. Intellectual hostesses fought over him. Some) Tj

T* (name--or Wynand considered him too contemptible to be worth restraining.) Tj
T* T* ("One Small Voice" never seemed to say anything dangerously revolutionary, and) Tj
T* (seldom anything political. It merely preached sentiments with which most people) Tj

T* (Cut it out and be here tomorrow at two.") Tj
T* T* ("Okay." Mallory hung up.) Tj
T* T* (Roark dropped the receiver, grinning. But the grin vanished suddenly, and he sat) Tj
T* (looking at the telephone, his face grave.) Tj
T* T* (Mallory did not keep the appointment. Three days passed without a word from him.) Tj
T* (Then Roark went to find him in person.) Tj
T* T* (The rooming house where Mallory lived was a dilapidated brownstone in an) Tj
T* (unlighted street that smelled of a fish market. There was a laundry and a) Tj
T* (cobbler on the ground floor, at either side of a narrow entrance. A slatternly) Tj
T* (landlady said: "Mallory? Fifth floor rear," and shuffled away indifferently.) Tj

T* T* (The door opened. A gaunt young man stood on the threshold; he had disheveled) Tj
T* (hair, a strong mouth with a square lower lip, and the most expressive eyes that) Tj
T* (Roark had ever seen. "What do you want?" he snapped. "Mr. Mallory?") Tj
T* T* ("Yeah.") Tj
T* T* ("I'm Howard Roark.") Tj
T* T* (Mallory laughed, leaning against the doorjamb, one arm stretched across the) Tj
T* (opening, with no intention of stepping aside. He was obviously drunk. "Well,) Tj
T* (well!" he said. "In person.") Tj
T* T* ("May I come in?") Tj
T* T* ("What for?") Tj
T* T* (Roark sat down on the stair banister. "Why didn't you keep your appointment?") Tj
T* T* ("Oh, the appointment? Oh, yes. Well, I'll tell you," Mallory said gravely. "It) Tj
T* (was like this: I really intended to keep it, I really did, and I started out for) Tj
T* (your office, but on my way there I passed a movie theater that was showing Two) Tj
T* (Heads on a Pillow, so I went in. I just had to see Two Heads on a Pillow." He) Tj
T* (grinned, sagging against his stretched arm. "You'd better let me come in," said) Tj
T* (Roark quietly. "Oh, what the hell, come in.") Tj
T* T* (The room was a narrow hole. There was an unmade bed in a corner, a litter of) Tj
T* (newspapers and old clothes, a gas ring, a framed landscape from the) Tj
T* (five-and-ten, representing some sort of sick brown meadows with sheep; there) Tj
T* (were no drawings or figures, no hints of the occupant's profession.) Tj
T* T* (Roark pushed some books and a skillet off the only chair, and sat down. Mallory) Tj
T* (stood before him, grinning, swaying a little.) Tj
T* T* ("You're doing it all wrong," said Mallory. "That's not the way it's done. You) Tj
T* (must be pretty hard up to come running after a sculptor. The way it's done is) Tj
T* (like this: You make me come to your office, and the first time I come you) Tj

T* T* (Toohey said nothing in the limousine, on their way back to Stoddard's apartment,) Tj

T* T* (He went on speaking for a long time, calmly, severely, to a silent huddle of) Tj

T* T* ("It seems obvious, Hopton, that you cannot buy forgiveness by starting at the) Tj
T* (top. Only the pure in heart can erect a shrine. You must go through many humbler) Tj
T* (steps of expiation before you reach that stage. You must atone to your fellow) Tj
T* (men before you can atone to God. This building was not meant to be a temple, but) Tj
T* (an institution of human charity. Such as a home for subnormal children.") Tj
T* T* (Hopton Stoddard would not commit himself to that. "Afterward, Ellsworth,) Tj
T* (afterward," he moaned. "Give me time." He agreed to sue Roark, as Toohey) Tj

T* (Roark.") Tj
T* T* (On the following day "Sacrilege" appeared in the Banner and set the fuse. The) Tj

T* T* (The case of Hopton Stoddard versus Howard Roark opened in February of 1931.) Tj
T* T* (The courtroom was so full that mass reactions could be expressed only by a slow) Tj
T* (motion running across the spread of heads, a sluggish wave like the ripple under) Tj
T* (the tight-packed skin of a sea lion.) Tj
T* T* (The crowd, brown and streaked with subdued color, looked like a fruitcake of all) Tj

T* (distinguished men and well-dressed, tight-lipped women; each woman seemed to) Tj

T* (guarded by resentful glances at the others. Almost everybody knew almost) Tj
T* (everybody else. The room had the atmosphere of a convention, an opening night) Tj
T* (and a family picnic. There was a feeling of "our bunch,") Tj
T* T* ("our boys,") Tj
T* T* ("our show.") Tj
T* T* (Steven Mallory, Austen Heller, Roger Enright, Kent Lansing and Mike sat together) Tj
T* (in one corner. They tried not to look around them. Mike was worried about Steven) Tj
T* (Mallory. He kept close to Mallory, insisted on sitting next to him and glanced) Tj
T* (at him whenever a particularly offensive bit of conversation reached them.) Tj
T* (Mallory noticed it at last, and said: "Don't worry, Mike. I won't scream. I) Tj
T* (won't shoot anyone.") Tj
T* T* ("Watch your stomach, kid," said Mike, "just watch your stomach. A man can't get) Tj

T* (Roark sat alone at the defense table. The crowd had stared at him and given up) Tj
T* (angrily, finding no satisfaction. He did not look crushed and he did not look) Tj
T* (defiant. He looked impersonal and calm. He was not like a public figure in a) Tj
T* (public place; he was like a man alone in his own room, listening to the radio.) Tj
T* (He took no notes; there were no papers on the table before him, only a large) Tj
T* (brown envelope. The crowd would have forgiven anything, except a man who could) Tj
T* (remain normal under the vibrations of its enormous collective sneer. Some of) Tj
T* (them had come prepared to pity him; all of them hated him after the first few) Tj
T* (minutes.) Tj
T* T* (The plaintiff's attorney stated his case in a simple opening address; it was) Tj
T* (true, he admitted, that Hopton Stoddard had given Roark full freedom to design) Tj
T* (and build the Temple; the point was, however, that Mr. Stoddard had clearly) Tj
T* (specified and expected a temple; the building in question could not be) Tj
T* (considered a temple by any known standards; as the plaintiff proposed to prove) Tj
T* (with the help of the best authorities in the field.) Tj
T* T* (Roark waived his privilege to make an opening statement to the jury.) Tj
T* T* (Ellsworth Monkton Toohey was the first witness called by the plaintiff. He sat) Tj
T* (on the edge of the witness chair and leaned back, resting on the end of his) Tj
T* (spine: he lifted one leg and placed it horizontally across the other. He looked) Tj
T* (amused--but managed to suggest that his amusement was a well-bred protection) Tj
T* (against looking bored.) Tj
T* T* (The attorney went through a long list of questions about Mr. Toohey's) Tj
T* (professional qualifications, including the number of copies sold of his book) Tj
T* (Sermons in Stone. Then he read aloud Toohey's column "Sacrilege" and asked him) Tj
T* (to state whether he had written it. Toohey replied that he had. There followed a) Tj
T* (list of questions in erudite terms on the architectural merits of the Temple.) Tj
T* (Toohey proved that it had none. There followed an historical review. Toohey,) Tj
T* (speaking easily and casually, gave a brief sketch of all known civilizations and) Tj
T* (of their outstanding religious monuments--from the Incas to the Phoenicians to) Tj
T* (the Easter Islanders--including, whenever possible, the dates when these) Tj
T* (monuments were begun and the dates when they were completed, the number of) Tj
T* (workers employed in the construction and the approximate cost in modern American) Tj
T* (dollars. The audience listened punch-drunk.) Tj
T* T* (Toohey proved that the Stoddard Temple contradicted every brick, stone and) Tj
T* (precept of history. "I have endeavored to show," he said in conclusion, "that) Tj
T* (the two essentials of the conception of a temple are a sense of awe and a sense) Tj
T* (of man's humility. We have noted the gigantic proportions of religious edifices,) Tj
T* (the soaring lines, the horrible grotesques of monster-like gods, or, later,) Tj
T* (gargoyles. All of it tends to impress upon man his essential insignificance, to) Tj
T* (crush him by sheer magnitude, to imbue him with that sacred terror which leads) Tj
T* (to the meekness of virtue. The Stoddard Temple is a brazen denial of our entire) Tj
T* (past, an insolent 'No' flung in the face of history. I may venture a guess as to) Tj
T* (the reason why this case has aroused such public interest. All of us have) Tj
T* (recognized instinctively that it involves a moral issue much beyond its legal) Tj
T* (aspects. This building is a monument to a profound hatred of humanity. It is one) Tj
T* (man's ego defying the most sacred impulses of all mankind, of every man on the) Tj
T* (street, of every man in this courtroom!") Tj
T* T* (This was not a witness in court, but Ellsworth Toohey addressing a meeting--and) Tj
T* (the reaction was inevitable: the audience burst into applause. The judge struck) Tj
T* (his gavel and made a threat to have the courtroom cleared. Order was restored,) Tj
T* (but not to the faces of the crowd: the faces remained lecherously) Tj
T* (self-righteous. It was pleasant to be singled out and brought into the case as) Tj
T* (an injured party. Three-fourths of them had never seen the Stoddard Temple.) Tj

T* T* ("Mr. Peter Keating!" called the attorney. Peter Keating's face looked attractive) Tj
T* (and fresh, as if he had had a good night's sleep. He mounted the witness stand) Tj
T* (with a collegiate sort of gusto, swinging his shoulders and arms unnecessarily.) Tj

T* (chair was strange: his torso slumped to one side with swaggering ease, an elbow) Tj
T* (on the chair's arm; but his feet were planted awkwardly straight, and his knees) Tj
T* (were pressed tight together. He never looked at Roark.) Tj
T* T* ("Will you please name some of the outstanding buildings which you have designed,) Tj

T* T* ("Aren't you forgetting the most important one, Mr. Keating?" the attorney asked.) Tj
T* ("Didn't you design the Cosmo-Slotnick Building?") Tj
T* T* ("Yes," whispered Keating.) Tj
T* T* ("Now, Mr. Keating, you attended the Stanton Institute of Technology at the same) Tj

T* T* ("Yes.") Tj
T* T* ("What can you tell us about Mr. Roark's record there?") Tj
T* T* ("He was expelled.") Tj
T* T* ("He was expelled because he was unable to live up to the Institute's high) Tj

T* T* ("Yes. Yes, that was it.") Tj
T* T* (The judge glanced at Roark. A lawyer would have objected to this testimony as) Tj

T* (architecture?") Tj
T* T* ("No.") Tj
T* T* ("Will you please speak a little louder, Mr. Keating?") Tj
T* T* ("I didn't...think he had any talent.") Tj
T* T* (Queer things were happening to Keating's verbal punctuation: some words came out) Tj
T* (crisply, as if he dropped an exclamation point after each; others ran together,) Tj
T* (as if he would not stop to let himself hear them. He did not look at the) Tj
T* (attorney. He kept his eyes on the audience. At times, he looked like a boy out) Tj
T* (on a lark, a boy who has just drawn a mustache on the face of a beautiful girl) Tj

T* (that. A temple is a place where man is to experience exaltation. He thought that) Tj
T* (exaltation comes from the consciousness of being guiltless, of seeing the truth) Tj
T* (and achieving it, of living up to one's highest possibility, of knowing no shame) Tj
T* (and having no cause for shame, of being able to stand naked in full sunlight. He) Tj
T* (thought that exaltation means joy and that joy is man's birthright. He thought) Tj
T* (that a place built as a setting for man is a sacred place. That is what Howard) Tj
T* (Roark thought of man and of exaltation. But Ellsworth Toohey said that this) Tj
T* (temple was a monument to a profound hatred of humanity. Ellsworth Toohey said) Tj
T* (that the essence of exaltation was to be scared out of your wits, to fall down) Tj
T* (and to grovel. Ellsworth Toohey said that man's highest act was to realize his) Tj
T* (own worthlessness and to beg forgiveness. Ellsworth Toohey said it was depraved) Tj
T* (not to take for granted that man is something which needs to be forgiven.) Tj
T* (Ellsworth Toohey saw that this building was of man and of the earth--and) Tj
T* (Ellsworth Toohey said that this building had its belly in the mud. To glorify) Tj

T* T* ("I do not condemn Ellsworth Toohey. I condemn Howard Roark. A building, they) Tj

T* (For what kind of men? Look around you. Can you see a shrine becoming sacred by) Tj
T* (serving as a setting for Mr. Hopton Stoddard? For Mr. Ralston Holcombe? For Mr.) Tj
T* (Peter Keating? When you look at them all, do you hate Ellsworth Toohey--or do) Tj
T* (you damn Howard Roark for the unspeakable indignity which he did commit?) Tj
T* (Ellsworth Toohey is right, that temple is a sacrilege, though not in the sense) Tj
T* (he meant. I think Mr. Toohey knows that, however. When you see a man casting) Tj
T* (pearls without getting even a pork chop in return--it is not against the swine) Tj
T* (that you feel indignation. It is against the man who valued his pearls so little) Tj
T* (that he was willing to fling them into the muck and to let them become the) Tj
T* (occasion for a whole concert of grunting, transcribed by the court) Tj
T* (stenographer.") Tj
T* T* ("Miss Francon, I hardly think that this line of testimony is relevant or) Tj
T* (admissible...") Tj
T* T* ("The witness must be allowed to testify," the judge declared unexpectedly. He) Tj
T* (had been bored and he liked to watch Dominique's figure. Besides, he knew that) Tj
T* (the audience was enjoying it, in the sheer excitement of scandal, even though) Tj
T* (their sympathies were with Hopton Stoddard.) Tj
T* T* ("Your Honor, some misunderstanding seems to have occurred," said the attorney.) Tj
T* ("Miss Francon, for whom are you testifying? For Mr. Roark or Mr. Stoddard?") Tj

T* (win this case. I have sworn to tell the truth.") Tj
T* T* ("Proceed," said the judge.) Tj
T* T* ("All the witnesses have told the truth. But not the whole truth. I am merely) Tj
T* (filling in the omissions. They spoke of a threat and of hatred. They were right.) Tj
T* (The Stoddard Temple is a threat to many things. If it were allowed to exist,) Tj
T* (nobody would dare to look at himself in the mirror. And that is a cruel thing to) Tj
T* (do to men. Ask anything of men. Ask them to achieve wealth, fame, love,) Tj
T* (brutality, murder, self-sacrifice. But don't ask them to achieve self-respect.) Tj
T* (They will hate your soul. Well, they know best. They must have their reasons.) Tj

T* (full of kindness and so made a point of rejecting those who could be cured and) Tj
T* (selecting only the hopeless cases. There was a fifteen-year-old boy who had) Tj
T* (never learned to speak; a grinning child who could not be taught to read or) Tj
T* (write; a girl born without a nose, whose father was also her grandfather; a) Tj
T* (person called "Jackie" of whose age or sex nobody could be certain. They marched) Tj
T* (into their new home, their eyes staring vacantly, the stare of death before) Tj
T* (which no world existed.) Tj
T* T* (On warm evenings children from the slums nearby would sneak into the park of the) Tj
T* (Stoddard Home and gaze wistfully at the playrooms, the gymnasium, the kitchen) Tj
T* (beyond the big windows. These children had filthy clothes and smudged faces,) Tj
T* (agile little bodies, impertinent grins, and eyes bright with a roaring,) Tj
T* (imperious, demanding intelligence. The ladies in charge of the Home chased them) Tj
T* (away with angry exclamations about "little gangsters.") Tj
T* T* (Once a month a delegation from the sponsors came to visit the Home. It was a) Tj
T* (distinguished group whose names were in many exclusive registers, though no) Tj
T* (personal achievement had ever put them there. It was a group of mink coats and) Tj
T* (diamond clips; occasionally, there was a dollar cigar and a glossy derby from a) Tj
T* (British shop among them. Ellsworth Toohey was always present to show them) Tj
T* (through the Home. The inspection made the mink coats seem warmer and their) Tj
T* (wearers' rights to them incontestable, since it established superiority and) Tj
T* (altruistic virtue together, in a demonstration more potent than a visit to a) Tj
T* (morgue. On the way back from such an inspection Ellsworth Toohey received) Tj
T* (humbled compliments on the wonderful work he was doing, and had no trouble in) Tj
T* (obtaining checks for his other humanitarian activities, such as publications,) Tj
T* (lecture courses, radio forums and the Workshop of Social Study.) Tj
T* T* (Catherine Halsey was put in charge of the children's occupational therapy, and) Tj
T* (she moved into the Home as a permanent resident. She took up her work with a) Tj
T* (fierce zeal. She spoke about it insistently to anyone who would listen. Her) Tj
T* (voice was dry and arbitrary. When she spoke, the movements of her mouth hid the) Tj
T* (two lines that had appeared recently, cut from her nostrils to her chin; people) Tj
T* (preferred her not to remove her glasses; her eyes were not good to see. She) Tj
T* (spoke belligerently about her work not being charity, but "human reclamation.") Tj
T* T* (The most important time of her day was the hour assigned to the children's art) Tj
T* (activities, known as the "Creative Period." There was a special room for the) Tj
T* (purpose--a room with a view of the distant city skyline--where the children were) Tj
T* (given materials and encouraged to create freely, under the guidance of Catherine) Tj
T* (who stood watch over them like an angel presiding at a birth.) Tj
T* T* (She was elated on the day when Jackie, the least promising one of the lot,) Tj
T* (achieved a completed work of imagination. Jackie picked up fistfuls of colored) Tj
T* (felt scraps and a pot of glue, and carried them to a corner of the room. There) Tj
T* (was, in the corner, a slanting ledge projecting from the wall-plastered over and) Tj
T* (painted green--left from Roark's modeling of the Temple interior that had once) Tj
T* (controlled the recession of the light at sunset. Catherine walked over to Jackie) Tj
T* (and saw, spread out on the ledge, the recognizable shape of a dog, brown, with) Tj
T* (blue spots and five legs. Jackie wore an expression of pride. "Now you see, you) Tj
T* (see?" Catherine said to her colleagues. "Isn't it wonderful and moving! There's) Tj
T* (no telling how far the child will go with proper encouragement. Think of what) Tj
T* (happens to their little souls if they are frustrated in their creative) Tj
T* (instincts! It's so important not to deny them a chance for self-expression. Did) Tj
T* (you see Jackie's face?") Tj

T* T* (He shrugged and lowered the gun. He stood tapping it against the palm of his) Tj
T* (left hand. People always speak of a black death or a red death, he thought;) Tj
T* (yours, Gail Wynand, will be a gray death. Why hasn't anyone ever said that this) Tj

T* (National Convention of Women's Clubs. He sat at the right of the chairwoman in) Tj
T* (an echoing banquet hall filled with the odors of corsages--gardenias and sweet) Tj
T* (peas--and of fried chicken. After luncheon Wynand spoke. The Convention) Tj
T* (advocated careers for married women; the Wynand papers had fought against the) Tj

T* (said nothing at all; but he conveyed the impression that he supported every) Tj

T* (seemed so ordinary, so unexciting, like murder wearing a homey smile.) Tj
T* T* (Nothing was gone--except desire; no, more than that--the root, the desire to) Tj

T* (bloated horse trader, by every drunken deck hand aboard. If he spoke, he heard) Tj
T* (some thick voice answering: "You don't run things around here." But he liked) Tj
T* (this job. When he had no customers, he stood at the rail and looked at) Tj
T* (Manhattan. He looked at the yellow boards of new houses, at the vacant lots, at) Tj
T* (the cranes and derricks, at the few towers rising in the distance. He thought of) Tj
T* (what should be built and what should be destroyed, of the space, the promise and) Tj
T* (what could be made of it. A hoarse shout--"Hey, boy!"--interrupted him. He went) Tj
T* (back to his bench and bent obediently over some muddy shoe. The customer saw) Tj
T* (only a small head of light brown hair and two thin, capable hands.) Tj
T* T* (On foggy evenings, under a gas lantern on a street corner, nobody noticed the) Tj
T* (slender figure leaning against a lamppost, the aristocrat of the Middle Ages,) Tj
T* (the timeless patrician whose every instinct cried that he should command, whose) Tj
T* (swift brain told him why he had the right to do so, the feudal baron created to) Tj
T* (rule--but born to sweep floors and take orders.) Tj
T* T* (He had taught himself to read and write at the age of five, by asking questions.) Tj
T* (He read everything he found. He could not tolerate the inexplicable. He had to) Tj
T* (understand anything known to anyone. The emblem of his childhood--the) Tj
T* (coat-of-arms he devised for himself in place of the one lost for him centuries) Tj
T* (ago--was the question mark. No one ever needed to explain anything to him twice.) Tj
T* (He learned his first mathematics from the engineers laying sewer pipes. He) Tj
T* (learned geography from the sailors on the waterfront. He learned civics from the) Tj
T* (politicians at a local club that was a gangsters' hangout. He had never gone to) Tj
T* (church or to school. He was twelve when he walked into a church. He listened to) Tj
T* (a sermon on patience and humility. He never came back. He was thirteen when he) Tj
T* (decided to see what education was like and enrolled at a public school. His) Tj
T* (father said nothing about this decision, as he said nothing whenever Gail came) Tj
T* (home battered after a gang fight.) Tj
T* T* (During his first week at school the teacher called on Gail Wynand constantly--it) Tj
T* (was sheer pleasure to her, because he always knew the answers. When he trusted) Tj
T* (his superiors and their purpose, he obeyed like a Spartan, imposing on himself) Tj
T* (the kind of discipline he demanded of his own subjects in the gang. But the) Tj
T* (force of his will was wasted: within a week he saw that he needed no effort to) Tj
T* (be first in the class. After a month the teacher stopped noticing his presence;) Tj
T* (it seemed pointless, he always knew his lesson and she had to concentrate on the) Tj
T* (slower, duller children. He sat, unflinching, through hours that dragged like) Tj
T* (chains, while the teacher repeated and chewed and rechewed, sweating to force) Tj
T* (some spark of intellect from vacant eyes and mumbling voices. At the end of two) Tj
T* (months, reviewing the rudiments of history which she had tried to pound into her) Tj
T* (class, the teacher asked: "And how many original states were there in the) Tj
T* (Union?" No hands were raised. Then Gail Wynand's arm went up. The teacher nodded) Tj
T* (to him. He rose. "Why," he asked, "should I swill everything down ten times? I) Tj
T* (know all that.") Tj
T* T* ("You are not the only one in the class," said the teacher. He uttered an) Tj
T* (expression that struck her white and made her blush fifteen minutes later, when) Tj
T* (she grasped it fully. He walked to the door. On the threshold he turned to add:) Tj
T* ("Oh yes. There were thirteen original states." That was the last of his formal) Tj
T* (education. There were people in Hell's Kitchen who never ventured beyond its) Tj
T* (boundaries, and others who seldom stepped out of the tenement in which they were) Tj
T* (born. But Gail Wynand often went for a walk through the best streets of the) Tj
T* (city. He felt no bitterness against the world of wealth, no envy and no fear. He) Tj
T* (was simply curious and he felt at home on Fifth Avenue, just as anywhere else.) Tj
T* (He walked past the stately mansions, his hands in his pockets, his toes sticking) Tj
T* (out of flat-soled shoes. People glared at him, but it had no effect. He passed) Tj
T* (by and left behind him the feeling that he belonged on this street and they) Tj
T* (didn't. He wanted nothing, for the time being, except to understand.) Tj

T* (waiting in a carriage at the curb; he knew she was a lady--his judgment on such) Tj

T* (fist-clenched determination. Without advice, assistance or plan, he began) Tj
T* (reading an incongruous assortment of books; he would find some passage which he) Tj
T* (could not understand in one book, and he would get another on that subject. He) Tj

T* (books. But Stretch Wynand had given the orders--and one did not argue with) Tj
T* (Stretch Wynand. He was fifteen when he was found, one morning, in the gutter, a) Tj
T* (mass of bleeding pulp, both legs broken, beaten by some drunken longshoreman. He) Tj
T* (was unconscious when found. But he had been conscious that night, after the) Tj
T* (beating. He had been left alone in a dark alley. He had seen a light around the) Tj
T* (corner. Nobody knew how he could have managed to drag himself around that) Tj
T* (corner; but he had; they saw the long smear of blood on the pavement afterward.) Tj
T* (He had crawled, able to move nothing but his arms. He had knocked against the) Tj
T* (bottom of a door. It was a saloon, still open. The saloonkeeper came out. It was) Tj
T* (the only time in his life that Gail Wynand asked for help. The saloonkeeper) Tj
T* (looked at him with a flat, heavy glance, a glance that showed full consciousness) Tj
T* (of agony, of injustice--and a stolid, bovine indifference. The saloonkeeper went) Tj
T* (inside and slammed the door. He had no desire to get mixed up with gang fights.) Tj
T* T* (Years later, Gail Wynand, publisher of the New York Banner, still knew the names) Tj
T* (of the longshoreman and the saloonkeeper, and where to find them. He never did) Tj
T* (anything to the longshoreman. But he caused the saloonkeeper's business to be) Tj
T* (ruined, his home and savings to be lost, and drove the man to suicide.) Tj
T* T* (Gail Wynand was sixteen when his father died. He was alone, jobless at the) Tj
T* (moment, with sixty-five cents in his pocket, an unpaid rent bill and a chaotic) Tj
T* (erudition. He decided that the time had come to decide what he would make of his) Tj

T* (tight. He asked himself a single question: what was there that entered all those) Tj

T* (bought? They had shoes, they had coffee, they had...The course of his life was) Tj
T* (set.) Tj
T* T* (Next morning, he walked into the office of the editor of the Gazette, a) Tj
T* (fourth-rate newspaper in a rundown building, and asked for a job in the city) Tj
T* (room. The editor looked at his clothes and inquired, "Can you spell cat?") Tj
T* T* ("Can you spell anthropomorphology?" asked Wynand. "We have no jobs here," said) Tj
T* (the editor. "I'll hang around," said Wynand. "Use me when you want to. You don't) Tj
T* (have to pay me. You'll put me on salary when you'll feel you'd better.") Tj
T* T* (He remained in the building, sitting on the stairs outside the city room. He sat) Tj
T* (there every day for a week. No one paid any attention to him. At night he slept) Tj
T* (in doorways. When most of his money was gone, he stole food, from counters or) Tj
T* (from garbage pails, before returning to his post on the stairs.) Tj
T* T* (One day a reporter felt sorry for him and, walking down the stairs, threw a) Tj
T* (nickel into Wynand's lap, saying: "Go buy yourself a bowl of stew, kid." Wynand) Tj
T* (had a dime left in his pocket. He took the dime and threw it at the reporter,) Tj
T* (saying: "Go buy yourself a screw." The man swore and went on down. The nickel) Tj
T* (and the dime remained lying on the steps. Wynand would not touch them. The story) Tj
T* (was repeated in the city room. A pimply-faced clerk shrugged and took the two) Tj
T* (coins.) Tj
T* T* (At the end of the week, in a rush hour, a man from the city room called Wynand) Tj
T* (to run an errand. Other small chores followed. He obeyed with military) Tj

T* T* (Gail Wynand was twenty when he fell in love. He had known everything there was) Tj
T* (to know about sex since the age of thirteen. He had had many girls. He never) Tj
T* (spoke of love, created no romantic illusion and treated the whole matter as a) Tj
T* (simple animal transaction; but at this he was an expert--and women could tell) Tj
T* (it, just by looking at him. The girl with whom he fell in love had an exquisite) Tj
T* (beauty, a beauty to be worshipped, not desired. She was fragile and silent. Her) Tj
T* (face told of the lovely mysteries within her, left unexpressed.) Tj
T* T* (She became Gail Wynand's mistress. He allowed himself the weakness of being) Tj
T* (happy. He would have married her at once, had she mentioned it. But they said) Tj
T* (little to each other. He felt that everything was understood between them.) Tj
T* T* (One evening he spoke. Sitting at her feet, his face raised to her, he allowed) Tj
T* (his soul to be heard. "My darling, anything you wish, anything I am, anything I) Tj
T* (can ever be...That's what I want to offer you--not the things I'll get for you,) Tj
T* (but the thing in me that will make me able to get them. That thing--a man can't) Tj
T* (renounce it--but I want to renounce it--so that it will be yours--so that it) Tj
T* (will be in your service--only for you." The girl smiled and asked: "Do you think) Tj

T* T* (He got up. He said nothing and walked out of the house. He never saw that girl) Tj
T* (again. Gail Wynand, who prided himself on never needing a lesson twice, did not) Tj

T* T* (He was twenty-one when his career on the Gazette was threatened, for the first) Tj
T* (and only time. Politics and corruption had never disturbed him; he knew all) Tj
T* (about it; his gang had been paid to help stage beatings at the polls on election) Tj
T* (days. But when Pat Mulligan, police captain of his precinct, was framed, Wynand) Tj

T* (a first step. It was not enough to save Mulligan.) Tj

T* (remember this?" The editor glanced at the clipping, then at Wynand. It was a) Tj
T* (glance Wynand had seen before: in the eyes of the saloonkeeper who had slammed) Tj
T* (the door. "How do you expect me to remember every piece of swill I write?" asked) Tj

T* (in that short "Thanks," and very frightening. He did not know that it had been) Tj
T* (an obituary on Gail Wynand.) Tj
T* T* (Wynand walked back to the Gazette, feeling no anger toward the editor or the) Tj

T* (friends objected. "Publishers don't change the name of a paper," they told him.) Tj
T* ("This one does," he said.) Tj
T* T* (The first campaign of the Banner was an appeal for money for a charitable cause.) Tj
T* (Displayed side by side, with an equal amount of space, the Banner ran two) Tj
T* (stories: one about a struggling young scientist, starving in a garret, working) Tj
T* (on a great invention; the other about a chambermaid, the sweetheart of an) Tj
T* (executed murderer, awaiting the birth of her illegitimate child. One story was) Tj
T* (illustrated with scientific diagrams; the other--with the picture of a) Tj
T* (loose-mouthed girl wearing a tragic expression and disarranged clothes. The) Tj
T* (Banner asked its readers to help both these unfortunates. It received nine) Tj
T* (dollars and forty-five cents for the young scientist; it received one thousand) Tj
T* (and seventy-seven dollars for the unwed mother. Gail Wynand called a meeting of) Tj
T* (his staff. He put down on the table the paper carrying both stories and the) Tj
T* (money collected for both funds. "Is there anyone here who doesn't understand?") Tj
T* (he asked. No one answered. He said: "Now you all know the kind of paper the) Tj
T* (Banner is to be.") Tj
T* T* (The publishers of his time took pride in stamping their individual personalities) Tj
T* (upon their newspapers. Gail Wynand delivered his paper, body and soul, to the) Tj
T* (mob. The Banner assumed the appearance of a circus poster in body, of a circus) Tj
T* (performance in soul. It accepted the same goal--to stun, to amuse and to collect) Tj
T* (admission. It bore the imprint, not of one, but of a million men. "Men differ in) Tj
T* (their virtues, if any," said Gail Wynand, explaining his policy, "but they are) Tj
T* (alike in their vices." He added, looking straight into the questioner's eyes: "I) Tj
T* (am serving that which exists on this earth in greatest quantity. I am) Tj
T* (representing the majority--surely an act of virtue?") Tj
T* T* (The public asked for crime, scandal and sentiment. Gail Wynand provided it. He) Tj
T* (gave people what they wanted, plus a justification for indulging the tastes of) Tj
T* (which they had been ashamed. The Banner presented murder, arson, rape,) Tj
T* (corruption--with an appropriate moral against each. There were three columns of) Tj
T* (details to one stick of moral. "If you make people perform a noble duty, it) Tj
T* (bores them," said Wynand. "If you make them indulge themselves, it shames them.) Tj
T* (But combine the two--and you've got them." He ran stories about fallen girls,) Tj
T* (society divorces, foundling asylums, red-light districts, charity hospitals.) Tj
T* ("Sex first," said Wynand. "Tears second. Make them itch and make them cry--and) Tj
T* (you've got them.") Tj
T* T* (The Banner led great, brave crusades--on issues that had no opposition. It) Tj
T* (exposed politicians--one step ahead of the Grand Jury; it attacked) Tj
T* (monopolies--in the name of the downtrodden; it mocked the rich and the) Tj
T* (successful--in the manner of those who could never be either. It overstressed) Tj
T* (the glamour of society--and presented society news with a subtle sneer. This) Tj
T* (gave the man on the street two satisfactions: that of entering illustrious) Tj
T* (drawing rooms and that of not wiping his feet on the threshold. The Banner was) Tj
T* (permitted to strain truth, taste and credibility, but not its readers' brain) Tj
T* (power. Its enormous headlines, glaring pictures and oversimplified text hit the) Tj
T* (senses and entered men's consciousness without any necessity for an intermediary) Tj
T* (process of reason, like food shot through the rectum, requiring no digestion.) Tj

T* (dark nor quite blond; he had the kind of face one could not remember even while) Tj

T* (public. I give them what they really like. Honesty is the best policy,) Tj
T* (gentlemen, though not quite in the sense you were taught to believe.") Tj
T* T* (It was impossible for Wynand not to do a job well. Whatever his aim, his means) Tj
T* (were superlative. All the drive, the force, the will barred from the pages of) Tj

T* (exclusive story with photographs of himself climbing a ladder over raging waves,) Tj
T* (a baby in his arms. When a Canadian village was cut off from the world by an) Tj
T* (avalanche, it was the Banner that sent a balloon to drop food and Bibles to the) Tj
T* (inhabitants. When a coal-mining community was paralyzed by a strike, the Banner) Tj
T* (opened soup-kitchens and printed tragic stories on the perils confronting the) Tj
T* (miners' pretty daughters under the pressure of poverty. When a kitten got) Tj
T* (trapped on the top of a pole, it was rescued by a Banner photographer.) Tj

T* (recovered miraculously two weeks after his capture, was released, and sold to) Tj
T* (the Banner an expose of the ill-treatment he had suffered at the institution. It) Tj
T* (led to sweeping reforms. Afterward, some people said that the lunatic had worked) Tj
T* (on the Banner before his commitment. It could never be proved.) Tj
T* T* (A fire broke out in a sweatshop employing thirty young girls. Two of them) Tj

T* (got nothing but his rent and meals. He lived in a furnished room at the time) Tj
T* (when his best reporters lived in suites at expensive hotels. He spent money) Tj
T* (faster than it came in--and he spent it all on the Banner. The paper was like a) Tj
T* (luxurious mistress whose every need was satisfied without inquiry about the) Tj
T* (price.) Tj
T* T* (The Banner was first to get the newest typographical equipment. The Banner was) Tj
T* (last to get the best newspapermen--last, because it kept them. Wynand raided his) Tj
T* (competitors' city rooms; nobody could meet the salaries he offered. His) Tj
T* (procedure evolved into a simple formula. When a newspaperman received an) Tj
T* (invitation to call on Wynand, he took it as an insult to his journalistic) Tj
T* (integrity, but he came to the appointment. He came, prepared to deliver a set of) Tj
T* (offensive conditions on which he would accept the job, if at all. Wynand began) Tj
T* (the interview by stating the salary he would pay. Then he added: "You might) Tj
T* (wish, of course, to discuss other conditions--" and seeing the swallowing) Tj
T* (movement in the man's throat, concluded: "No? Fine. Report to me on Monday.") Tj
T* T* (When Wynand opened his second paper--in Philadelphia--the local publishers met) Tj
T* (him like European chieftains united against the invasion of Attila. The war that) Tj
T* (followed was as savage. Wynand laughed over it. No one could teach him anything) Tj
T* (about hiring thugs to highjack a paper's delivery wagons and beat up news) Tj
T* (vendors. Two of his competitors perished in the battle. The Wynand Philadelphia) Tj
T* (Star survived.) Tj
T* T* (The rest was swift and simple like an epidemic. By the time he reached the age) Tj
T* (of thirty-five there were Wynand papers in all the key cities of the United) Tj
T* (States. By the time he was forty there were Wynand magazines, Wynand newsreels) Tj
T* (and most of the Wynand Enterprises, Inc.) Tj
T* T* (A great many activities, not publicized, helped to build his fortune. He had) Tj
T* (forgotten nothing of his childhood. He remembered the things he had thought,) Tj
T* (standing as a bootblack at the rail of a ferryboat--the chances offered by a) Tj
T* (growing city. He bought real estate where no one expected it to become valuable,) Tj
T* (he built against all advice--and he ran hundreds into thousands. He bought his) Tj
T* (way into a great many enterprises of all kinds. Sometimes they crashed, ruining) Tj
T* (everybody concerned, save Gail Wynand. He staged a crusade against a shady) Tj
T* (streetcar monopoly and caused it to lose its franchise; the franchise was) Tj
T* (granted to a shadier group, controlled by Gail Wynand. He exposed a vicious) Tj
T* (attempt to corner the beef market in the Middle West--and left the field clear) Tj
T* (for another gang, operating under his orders.) Tj
T* T* (He was helped by a great many people who discovered that young Wynand was a) Tj

T* (used. In each case, the people found that they had been used instead--like the) Tj
T* (men who bought the Gazette for Gail Wynand.) Tj
T* T* (Sometimes he lost money on his investments, coldly and with full intention.) Tj
T* (Through a series of untraceable steps he ruined many powerful men: the president) Tj
T* (of a bank, the head of an insurance company, the owner of a steamship line, and) Tj
T* (others. No one could discover his motives. The men were not his competitors and) Tj
T* (he gained nothing from their destruction.) Tj
T* T* ("Whatever that bastard Wynand is after," people said, "it's not after money.") Tj
T* T* (Those who denounced him too persistently were run out of their professions: some) Tj
T* (in a few weeks, others many years later. There were occasions when he let) Tj
T* (insults pass unnoticed; there were occasions when he broke a man for an) Tj
T* (innocuous remark. One could never tell what he would avenge and what he would) Tj
T* (forgive.) Tj

T* (was the only one on the staff who loved Gail Wynand.) Tj
T* T* (Alvah Scarret, sole survivor of the original Gazette, had risen with Wynand. But) Tj
T* (one could not say that he loved Wynand--he merely clung to his boss with the) Tj
T* (automatic devotion of a rug under Wynand's feet. Alvah Scarret had never hated) Tj
T* (anything, and so was incapable of love. He was shrewd, competent and) Tj
T* (unscrupulous in the innocent manner of one unable to grasp the conception of a) Tj
T* (scruple. He believed everything he wrote and everything written in the Banner.) Tj
T* (He could hold a belief for all of two weeks. He was invaluable to Wynand--as a) Tj
T* (barometer of public reaction.) Tj
T* T* (No one could say whether Gail Wynand had a private life. His hours away from the) Tj
T* (office had assumed the style of the Banner's front page--but a style raised to a) Tj
T* (grand plane, as if he were still playing circus, only to a gallery of kings. He) Tj
T* (bought out the entire house for a great opera performance--and sat alone in the) Tj
T* (empty auditorium with his current mistress. He discovered a beautiful play by an) Tj
T* (unknown playwright and paid him a huge sum to have the play performed once and) Tj
T* (never again; Wynand was the sole spectator at the single performance; the script) Tj
T* (was burned next morning. When a distinguished society woman asked him to) Tj
T* (contribute to a worthy charity cause, Wynand handed her a signed blank) Tj
T* (check--and laughed, confessing that the amount she dared to fill in was less) Tj
T* (than he would have given otherwise. He bought some kind of Balkan throne for a) Tj
T* (penniless pretender whom he met in a speakeasy and never bothered to see) Tj
T* (afterward; he often referred to "my valet, my chauffeur and my king.") Tj
T* T* (At night, dressed in a shabby suit bought for nine dollars, Wynand would often) Tj
T* (ride the subways and wander through the dives of slum districts, listening to) Tj
T* (his public. Once, in a basement beer joint, he heard a truck driver denouncing) Tj
T* (Gail Wynand as the worst exponent of capitalistic evils, in a language of) Tj
T* (colorful accuracy. Wynand agreed with him and helped him out with a few) Tj
T* (expressions of his own, from his Hell's Kitchen vocabulary. Then Wynand picked) Tj
T* (up a copy of the Banner left by someone on a table, tore his own photograph from) Tj
T* (page 3, clipped it to a hundred-dollar bill, handed it to the truck driver and) Tj
T* (walked out before anyone could utter a word.) Tj
T* T* (The succession of his mistresses was so rapid that it ceased to be gossip. It) Tj
T* (was said that he never enjoyed a woman unless he had bought her--and that she) Tj
T* (had to be the kind who could not be bought.) Tj
T* T* (He kept the details of his life secret by making it glaringly public as a whole.) Tj
T* (He had delivered himself to the crowd; he was anyone's property, like a monument) Tj
T* (in a park, like a bus stop sign, like the pages of the Banner. His photographs) Tj
T* (appeared in his papers more often than pictures of movie stars. He had been) Tj
T* (photographed in all kinds of clothes, on every imaginable occasion. He had never) Tj
T* (been photographed naked, but his readers felt as if he had. He derived no) Tj
T* (pleasure from personal publicity; it was merely a matter of policy to which he) Tj
T* (submitted. Every corner of his penthouse had been reproduced in his papers and) Tj
T* (magazines. "Every bastard in the country knows the inside of my icebox and) Tj

T* T* (One phase of his life, however, was little known and never mentioned. The top) Tj
T* (floor of the building under his penthouse was his private art gallery. It was) Tj
T* (locked. He had never admitted anyone, except the caretaker. A few people knew) Tj
T* (about it. Once a French ambassador asked him for permission to visit it. Wynand) Tj
T* (refused. Occasionally, not often, he would descend to his gallery and remain) Tj
T* (there for hours. The things he collected were chosen by standards of his own. He) Tj
T* (had famous masterpieces; he had canvases by unknown artists; he rejected the) Tj
T* (works of immortal names for which he did not care. The estimates set by) Tj
T* (collectors and the matter of great signatures were of no concern to him. The art) Tj
T* (dealers whom he patronized reported that his judgment was that of a master.) Tj
T* T* (One night his valet saw Wynand returning from the art gallery below and was) Tj
T* (shocked by the expression of his face; it was a look of suffering, yet the face) Tj
T* (seemed ten years younger. "Are you ill, sir?" he asked. Wynand looked at him) Tj
T* (indifferently and said: "Go to bed.") Tj
T* T* ("We could make a swell spread for the Sunday scandal sheet out of your art) Tj

T* (industrialists and financiers. He found a new kind of victim. People could not) Tj
T* (tell whether it was a sport, a mania or a systematic pursuit. They thought it) Tj
T* (was horrible, because it seemed so vicious and pointless.) Tj
T* T* (It began with the case of Dwight Carson. Dwight Carson was a talented young) Tj
T* (writer who had achieved the spotless reputation of a man passionately devoted to) Tj
T* (his convictions. He upheld the cause of the individual against the masses. He) Tj
T* (wrote for magazines of great prestige and small circulation, which were no) Tj
T* (threat to Wynand. Wynand bought Dwight Carson. He forced Carson to write a) Tj
T* (column in the Banner, dedicated to preaching the superiority of the masses over) Tj
T* (the man of genius. It was a bad column, dull and unconvincing; it made many) Tj
T* (people angry. It was a waste of space and of a big salary. Wynand insisted on) Tj
T* (continuing it.) Tj
T* T* (Even Alvah Scarret was shocked by Carson's apostasy. "Anybody else, Gail," he) Tj
T* (said, "but, honest, I didn't expect it of Carson." Wynand laughed; he laughed) Tj
T* (too long, as if he could not stop it; his laughter had an edge of hysteria.) Tj
T* (Scarret frowned; he did not like the sight of Wynand being unable to control an) Tj
T* (emotion; it contradicted everything he knew of Wynand; it gave Scarret a funny) Tj
T* (feeling of apprehension, like the sight of a tiny crack in a solid wall; the) Tj
T* (crack could not possibly endanger the wall--except that it had no business being) Tj
T* (there.) Tj
T* T* (A few months later Wynand bought a young writer from a radical magazine, a man) Tj
T* (known for his honesty, and put him to work on a series of articles glorifying) Tj
T* (exceptional men and damning the masses. That, too, made a great many of his) Tj

T* T* ("Your wife has a lovely body, Mr. Keating. Her shoulders are too thin, but) Tj

T* (from the city outside, no windows. He followed her, stopping when she stopped.) Tj
T* (His eyes went with hers from object to object. At times his glance moved to her) Tj

T* T* ("What does that name mean?" she asked.) Tj

T* (childhood was 'You don't run things around here.'") Tj
T* T* (She remembered hearing that he had never answered this question before. He had) Tj

T* T* (She moved idly across the cabin. A smear of reflection followed her on the) Tj

T* (armchair, her ankles crossed, her arms thrown behind her head, and watched the) Tj

T* T* ("I want to hear you explain it.") Tj
T* T* ("Most people build as they live--as a matter of routine and senseless accident.) Tj

T* T* ("I am very much impressed, Mr. Roark." The voice was offensively correct. "I) Tj

T* (withstand the kind of pressure I am in a position to exert. You have gone) Tj

T* T* ("In what way?") Tj
T* T* ("I have liked working for some people and did not like working for others. But) Tj
T* (neither mattered. This time, I knew that the house would be what it became only) Tj
T* (because it was being done for Mr. Wynand. I had to overcome this. Or rather, I) Tj

T* (had to surpass the architect, the client and the future tenant. It did.") Tj
T* T* ("But the house--it's you, Howard," said Wynand. "It's still you.") Tj
T* T* (It was the first sign of emotion on her face, a quiet shock, when she heard the) Tj
T* ("Howard." Wynand did not notice it. Roark did. He glanced at her--his first) Tj

T* (and everything else I've built. You own every structure you've stopped before) Tj
T* (and heard yourself answering.") Tj
T* T* ("In what sense?") Tj
T* T* ("In the sense of that personal answer. What you feel in the presence of a thing) Tj

T* (compulsion are one. Let me give you a simple illustration. Traffic lights) Tj
T* (restrain your freedom to cross a street whenever you wish. But this restraint) Tj

T* T* (Ellsworth Toohey, in dinner clothes, stood lounging against a cabinet. His) Tj

T* T* (Eve Layton believed that her mission in life was to be the vanguard--it did not) Tj

T* (It was late when Toohey left. He felt exhilarated and he decided to walk home.) Tj
T* (The streets of the city lay gravely empty around him, and the dark masses of the) Tj
T* (buildings rose to the sky, confident and unprotected. He remembered what he had) Tj
T* (said to Dominique once: "A complicated piece of machinery, such as our) Tj
T* (society...and by pressing your little finger against one spot...the center of) Tj
T* (all its gravity...you can make the thing crumble into a worthless heap of scrap) Tj
T* (iron..." He missed Dominique. He wished she could have been with him to hear) Tj
T* (this evening's conversation.) Tj
T* T* (The unshared was boiling up within him. He stopped in the middle of a silent) Tj
T* (street, threw his head back and laughed aloud, looking at the tops of) Tj
T* (skyscrapers.) Tj
T* T* (A policeman tapped him on the shoulder, asking: "Well, Mister?") Tj
T* T* (Toohey saw buttons and blue cloth tight over a broad chest, a stolid face, hard) Tj
T* (and patient; a man as set and dependable as the buildings around them.) Tj
T* T* ("Doing your duty, officer?" Toohey asked, the echoes of laughter like jerks in) Tj
T* (his voice. "Protecting law and order and decency and human lives?" The policeman) Tj
T* (scratched the back of his head. "You ought to arrest me, officer.") Tj

T* T* (IT WAS only when the last painter had departed that Peter Keating felt a sense) Tj
T* (of desolation and a numb weakness in the crook of his elbows. He stood in the) Tj
T* (hall, looking up at the ceiling. Under the harsh gloss of paint he could still) Tj
T* (see the outline of the square where the stairway had been removed and the) Tj
T* (opening closed over. Guy Francon's old office was gone. The firm Keating &) Tj
T* (Dumont had a single floor left now.) Tj
T* T* (He thought of the stairway and how he had walked up its red-plushed steps for) Tj
T* (the first time, carrying a drawing on the tips of his fingers. He thought of Guy) Tj
T* (Francon's office with the glittering butterfly reflections. He thought of the) Tj
T* (four years when that office had been his own.) Tj
T* T* (He had known what was happening to his firm, in these last years; he had known) Tj
T* (it quite well while men in overalls removed the stairway and closed the gap in) Tj
T* (the ceiling. But it was that square under the white paint that made it real to) Tj
T* (him, and final.) Tj
T* T* (He had resigned himself to the process of going down, long ago. He had not) Tj
T* (chosen to resign himself--that would have been a positive decision--it had) Tj
T* (merely happened and he had let it happen. It had been simple and almost) Tj
T* (painless, like drowsiness carrying one down to nothing more sinister than a) Tj
T* (welcome sleep. The dull pain came from wishing to understand why it had) Tj
T* (happened.) Tj
T* T* (There was "The March of the Centuries" exposition, but that alone could not have) Tj
T* (mattered. "The March of the Centuries" had opened in May. It was a flop. What's) Tj
T* (the use, thought Keating, why not say the right word? Flop. It was a ghastly) Tj
T* (flop. "The title of this venture would be most appropriate," Ellsworth Toohey) Tj
T* (had written, "if we assumed that the centuries had passed by on horseback.") Tj

T* (Everything else written about the architectural merits of the exposition had) Tj
T* (been of the same order.) Tj
T* T* (Keating thought, with wistful bitterness, of how conscientiously they had) Tj
T* (worked, he and the seven other architects, designing those buildings. It was) Tj
T* (true that he had pushed himself forward and hogged the publicity, but he) Tj
T* (certainly had not done that as far as designing was concerned. They had worked) Tj
T* (in harmony, through conference after conference, each giving in to the others,) Tj
T* (in true collective spirit, none trying to impose his personal prejudices or) Tj
T* (selfish ideas. Even Ralston Holcombe had forgotten Renaissance. They had made) Tj
T* (the buildings modern, more modem than anything ever seen, more modern than the) Tj
T* (show windows of Slottern's Department Store. He did not think that the buildings) Tj
T* (looked like "coils of toothpaste when somebody steps on the tube or stylized) Tj
T* (versions of the lower intestine," as one critic had said. But the public seemed) Tj
T* (to think it, if the public thought at all. He couldn't tell. He knew only that) Tj
T* (tickets to "The March of the Centuries" were being palmed off at Screeno games) Tj
T* (in theaters, and that the sensation of the exposition, the financial savior, was) Tj
T* (somebody named Juanita Fay who danced with a live peacock as sole garment.) Tj
T* T* (But what if the Fair did flop? It had not hurt the other architects of its) Tj
T* (council. Gordon L. Prescott was going stronger than ever. It wasn't that,) Tj
T* (thought Keating. It had begun before the Fair. He could not say when.) Tj
T* T* (There could be so many explanations. The depression had hit them all; others had) Tj
T* (recovered to some extent, Keating & Dumont had not. Something had gone out of) Tj
T* (the firm and out of the circles from which it drew its clients, with the) Tj
T* (retirement of Guy Francon. Keating realized that there had been art and skill) Tj
T* (and its own kind of illogical energy in the career of Guy Francon, even if the) Tj
T* (art consisted only of his social charm and the energy was directed at snaring) Tj
T* (bewildered millionaires. There had been a twisted sort of sense in people's) Tj
T* (response to Guy Francon.) Tj
T* T* (He could see no hint of rationality in the things to which people responded now.) Tj
T* (The leader of the profession--on a mean scale, there was no grand scale left in) Tj
T* (anything--was Gordon L. Prescott, Chairman of the Council of American Builders;) Tj
T* (Gordon L. Prescott who lectured on the transcendental pragmatism of architecture) Tj
T* (and social planning, who put his feet on tables in drawing rooms, attended) Tj
T* (formal dinners in knickerbockers and criticized the soup aloud. Society people) Tj
T* (said they liked an architect who was a liberal. The A.G.A. still existed, in) Tj
T* (stiff, hurt dignity, but people referred to it as the Old Folks' Home. The) Tj
T* (Council of American Builders ruled the profession and talked about a closed) Tj
T* (shop, though no one had yet devised a way of achieving that. Whenever an) Tj
T* (architect's name appeared in Ellsworth Toohey's column, it was always that of) Tj
T* (Augustus Webb. At thirty-nine, Keating heard himself described as old-fashioned.) Tj
T* T* (He had given up trying to understand. He knew dimly that the explanation of the) Tj
T* (change swallowing the world was of a nature he preferred not to know. In his) Tj
T* (youth he had felt an amicable contempt for the works of Guy Francon or Ralston) Tj
T* (Holcombe, and emulating them had seemed no more than innocent quackery. But he) Tj
T* (knew that Gordon L. Prescott and Gus Webb represented so impertinent, so vicious) Tj
T* (a fraud that to suspend the evidence of his eyes was beyond his elastic) Tj
T* (capacity. He had believed that people found greatness in Holcombe and there had) Tj
T* (been a reasonable satisfaction in borrowing his borrowed greatness. He knew that) Tj
T* (no one saw anything whatever in Prescott. He felt something dark and leering in) Tj
T* (the manner with which people spoke of Prescott's genius; as if they were not) Tj
T* (doing homage to Prescott, but spitting upon genius. For once, Keating could not) Tj
T* (follow people; it was too clear, even to him, that public favor had ceased being) Tj
T* (a recognition of merit, that it had become almost a brand of shame.) Tj

T* (and he did not use half the rooms, but he kept them and paid the deficit out of) Tj
T* (his own pocket. He had to go on. He had lost a large part of his personal) Tj
T* (fortune in careless stock speculation; but he had enough left to insure some) Tj
T* (comfort for the rest of his life. This did not disturb him; money had ceased to) Tj
T* (hold his attention as a major concern. It was inactivity he dreaded; it was the) Tj

T* (from him.) Tj
T* T* (He walked slowly, his arms pressed to his body, his shoulders hunched, as if) Tj
T* (drawn against a permanent chill. He was gaining weight. His face was swollen; he) Tj
T* (kept it down, and the pleat of a second chin was flattened against the knot of) Tj
T* (his necktie. A hint of his beauty remained and made him look worse; as if the) Tj
T* (lines of his face had been drawn on a blotter and had spread, blurring. The gray) Tj
T* (threads on his temples were becoming noticeable. He drank often, without joy.) Tj
T* T* (He had asked his mother to come back to live with him. She had come back. They) Tj
T* (sat through long evenings together in the living room, saying nothing; not in) Tj
T* (resentment, but seeking reassurance from each other. Mrs. Keating offered no) Tj
T* (suggestions, no reproaches. There was, instead, a new, panic-shaped tenderness) Tj
T* (in her manner toward her son. She would cook his breakfast, even though they had) Tj
T* (a maid; she would prepare his favorite dish--French pancakes, the kind he had) Tj
T* (liked so much when he was nine years old and sick with the measles. If he) Tj
T* (noticed her efforts and made some comment of pleasure, she nodded, blinking,) Tj
T* (turning away, asking herself why it should make her so happy and if it did, why) Tj
T* (should her eyes fill with tears.) Tj
T* T* (She would ask suddenly, after a silence: "it will be all right, Petey? Won't) Tj
T* (it?" And he would not ask what she meant, but answer quietly: "Yes, Mother, it) Tj
T* (will be all right," putting the last of his capacity for pity into an effort to) Tj
T* (make his voice sound convincing.) Tj
T* T* (Once, she asked him: "You're happy, Petey? Aren't you?" He looked at her and saw) Tj
T* (that she was not laughing at him; her eyes were wide and frightened. And as he) Tj
T* (could not answer, she cried: "But you've got to be happy! Petey, you've got to!) Tj
T* (Else what have I lived for?" He wanted to get up, gather her in his arms and) Tj
T* (tell her that it was all right--and then he remembered Guy Francon saying to him) Tj
T* (on his wedding day: "I want you to feel proud of me, Peter....I want to feel) Tj
T* (that it had some meaning." Then he could not move. He felt himself in the) Tj
T* (presence of something he must not grasp, must never allow into his mind. He) Tj
T* (turned away from his mother.) Tj
T* T* (One evening, she said without preamble. "Petey, I think you should get married.) Tj
T* (I think it would be much better if you were married." He found no answer, and) Tj
T* (while he groped for something gay to utter, she added: "Petey, why don't) Tj
T* (you...why don't you marry Catherine Halsey?" He felt anger filling his eyes, he) Tj
T* (felt pressure on his swollen lids, while he was turning slowly to his mother;) Tj
T* (then he saw her squat little figure before him, stiff and defenseless, with a) Tj
T* (kind of desperate pride, offering to take any blow he wished to deliver,) Tj
T* (absolving him in advance--and he knew that it had been the bravest gesture she) Tj
T* (had ever attempted. The anger went, because he felt her pain more sharply than) Tj
T* (the shock of his own, and he lifted one hand, to let it fall limply, to let the) Tj
T* (gesture cover everything, saying only: "Mother, don't let's ,..") Tj
T* T* (On weekends, not often, but once or twice a month, he vanished out of town. No) Tj
T* (one knew where he went. Mrs. Keating worried about it, but asked no questions.) Tj
T* (She suspected that there was a woman somewhere, and not a nice one, or he would) Tj

T* T* ("Worry is a waste of emotional reserves. Very foolish. Unworthy of an) Tj

T* (a woman rushed up to him as he crossed the sidewalk. She had been waiting by the) Tj

T* T* ("No one is to mention the name of Toohey in this discussion," said Wynand.) Tj
T* T* (Mitchell Layton snapped his mouth open and dropped it shut again.) Tj

T* T* (Wynand said nothing.) Tj
T* T* ("I think that's it, Mr. Scarret," said the banker. "I think that's the solution.) Tj

T* (Banner.) Tj
T* T* (He saw a single picture: the new masthead rising over the door of the Gazette.) Tj
T* T* ("You had better give in.") Tj
T* T* (He made a step back. It was not a wall behind him. It was only the side of his) Tj

T* T* (It's only a bottle cap, thought Wynand looking down at a speck of glitter under) Tj

T* (full of things like that--bottle caps, safety pins, campaign buttons, sink) Tj
T* (chains; sometimes--lost jewels; it's all alike now, flattened, ground in; it) Tj
T* (makes the pavements sparkle at night. The fertilizer of a city. Someone drank) Tj
T* (the bottle empty and threw the cap away. How many cars have passed over it?) Tj

T* (three or four blocks.) Tj

T* (newspaper that transmits to men the pulse beat of the world. A long, even flow) Tj
T* (of separate drops, like marbles rolling away in a straight line, like the sound) Tj
T* (of a man's heart.) Tj
T* T* (Toohey moved a pencil over a sheet of paper, until he realized that the sheet) Tj
T* (lay in the lamplight and Wynand could see the pencil making a water lily, a) Tj
T* (teapot and a bearded profile. He dropped the pencil and made a self-mocking) Tj
T* (sound with his lips. He opened a drawer and looked attentively at a pile of) Tj
T* (carbons and paper clips. He did not know what he could possibly be expected to) Tj
T* (do: one did not start writing a column just like that. He had wondered why he) Tj
T* (should be asked to resume his duties at nine o'clock in the evening, but he had) Tj
T* (supposed that it was Wynand's manner of softening surrender by overdoing it, and) Tj
T* (he had felt he could afford not to argue the point.) Tj
T* T* (The presses were rolling; a man's heartbeats gathered and re-broadcast. He heard) Tj
T* (no other sound and he thought it was absurd to keep this up if Wynand had gone,) Tj
T* (but most inadvisable to look in his direction if he hadn't.) Tj
T* T* (After a while he looked up. Wynand was still there. The light picked out two) Tj
T* (white spots of his figure: the long fingers of one hand closed over an elbow,) Tj
T* (and the high forehead. It was the forehead that Toohey wanted to see; no, there) Tj
T* (were no slanting ridges over the eyebrows. The eyes made two solid white ovals,) Tj
T* (faintly discernible in the angular shadows of the face. The ovals were directed) Tj
T* (at Toohey. But there was nothing in the face; no indication of purpose.) Tj
T* T* (After a while, Toohey said:) Tj
T* T* ("Really, Mr. Wynand, there's no reason why you and I can't get together.") Tj
T* T* (Wynand did not answer.) Tj
T* T* (Toohey picked up a sheet of paper and inserted it in the typewriter. He sat) Tj
T* (looking at the keys, holding his chin between two fingers, in the pose he knew) Tj
T* (he assumed when preparing to attack a paragraph. The rims of the keys glittered) Tj
T* (under the lamps, rings of bright nickel suspended in the dim room.) Tj
T* T* (The presses stopped.) Tj
T* T* (Toohey jerked back, automatically, before he knew why he had jerked: he was a) Tj
T* (newspaperman and it was a sound that did not stop like that.) Tj
T* T* (Wynand looked at his wrist watch. He said:) Tj
T* T* ("It's nine o'clock. You're out of a job, Mr. Toohey. The Banner has ceased to) Tj
T* (exist.") Tj
T* T* (The next incident of reality Toohey apprehended was his own hand dropping down) Tj
T* (on the typewriter keys: he heard the metal cough of the levers tangling and) Tj
T* (striking together, and the small jump of the carriage.) Tj
T* T* (He did not speak, but he thought his face was naked because he heard Wynand) Tj
T* (answering him:) Tj
T* T* ("Yes, you had worked here for thirteen years....Yes, I bought them all out,) Tj
T* (Mitchell Layton included, two weeks ago...." The voice was indifferent. "No, the) Tj

T* (wish to undertake the construction of the Wynand Building at once. I wish it to) Tj
T* (be the tallest structure of the city. Do not discuss with me the question of) Tj

T* (used--which is all that concerns you. It will house the Clarion and all the) Tj
T* (offices of the Wynand Enterprises now located in various parts of the city. The) Tj
T* (rest of the space will be rented. I have sufficient standing left to guarantee) Tj
T* (that. You need have no fear of erecting a useless structure. I shall send you a) Tj

T* T* (She thought: They say the heart of the earth is made of fire. It is held) Tj
T* (imprisoned and silent. But at times it breaks through the clay, the iron, the) Tj

T* T* (Flat roofs descended like pedals pressing the buildings down, out of the way of) Tj

T* T* (The hoist swung like a pendulum above the city. It sped against the side of the) Tj
