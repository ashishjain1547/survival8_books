\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dear Reader,
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Before I get started I want to give you a bit of background about this. The basis for this piece of fiction is taken from a story I wrote for a contest a while back. It has been adapted for Harry Potter, simply because I had 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 the urge to try it out.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Any coincidental similarities between this and other stories are exactly that. With this many people writing stories about the same characters, such things are bound to happen\'85\loch\f0  so, don\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 t flame me for \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 stealing\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  an idea that we had i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n common and I won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t flame you for it, either. ;)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 This is the first piece of \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 fan fiction\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 that I have ever written, and am doing so simply because I am bored out of my skull and need a way to release my pent up creativity, and I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve gotten bored with drawi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ng for the time being. I don
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t claim to be a good writer by any stretch of the imagination, but I like to think I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m not terrible.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 About this story, I want to give you a bit of warning in advance about some of what is to come, in case it might not be your c\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 up of tea. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ve tried to keep the characters true to their roots, but I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ve decided to really shake things up here. We find out some humbling news about Dumbledore (that comes up a bit later), as well as some things about Sirius that we never knew (nothing\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
to tarnish his memory\'85\loch\f0  maybe).
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 If you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re expecting a happy-go-lucky Harry who falls into Ginny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

 out of our hair." She increased the pace of her frantic cleaning while thinking about her nephew, a young man known as Harry Potter. "Thank God for that," she then added under her breath.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes, I suppose you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 re right. As long as he's not doing that\'85\loch\f0 " he p\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 aused, mouthing the word \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 magic\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 to his wife when she looked up to see why he stopped talking.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Vernon!" she shouted quite loudly. "Someone might see you!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Vernon clapped his hand over his mouth, before he realized that the shades were drawn and the only w\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ay someone could have seen him is if they were in the same room. A wave of relief slid over him.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, at least he isn't following us around wanting to watch the news, like he did last year," Vernon said, his large mustache puffing up under each word, as \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a red flush crept slowly over his face.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry, however, was sitting in his room staring out the window at the world outside. Harry was not what you would call a normal boy, by any means. Throughout his short life he had suffered more than anyone should be 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 required to. Not long ago he yet again renewed his intimate relationship with pain and her sadistic sister, suffering. Harry James Potter watched his godfather die, and he was responsible\'85\loch\f0 
 even if only indirectly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry had spent most of his summer simply \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 staring out his window, waiting on himself to wake up. He knew he wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t going to, but it was the only hope he had. Sirius Black, a convicted murderer and so-called second-hand to the Dark Lord himself, was the closest thing to a true family that Harry ha\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 ever had. It seemed to him that anyone who cared about him would be forever doomed to death. Unless, of course, they were like the Dursley\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s, and they despised him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Sitting in front of Harry, on his desk, was a pile of letters from his friends. He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d not r\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 efused to open the letters, they simply didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t seem important now. In his mind he kept playing over his attempts with the Cruciatus Curse on Bellatrix Lestrange. Her explanation of how it had to be done with the intention of causing pain rang in his ears.\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He would make her wish she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d never given her that piece of information.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Balled into a fist, Harry let his hand smash through the glass of his window. He wanted fresh air, and the thought of simply opening the window never occurred to him. He pulled back hi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
s bloody hand and relished the distraction from the scenes in his mind. How he wished he had a pensieve to remove those memories for the time being, so he could work through it. But, then he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d have to worry about the fact that he was still underage and co\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t use it, even if he had it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "HARRY POTTER!" came the shout from his so-called uncle.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Rather than deal with his shouting uncle, Harry walked silently downstairs. Vernon Dursley was waiting at the foot of the stairs for him when he got there.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What was \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 that noise, boy? You better not have --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I broke the window," he said, as he shoved past his uncle. "If you don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t mind, I need to bandage my hand."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "You\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  you\'85\loch\f0  you," stammered the purple-faced man as he tried to suppress his rage. "How did you manage to br\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 eak the window?! You better not have --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Again Harry simply cut him off. He was in no mood to be dealing with the \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 house rules\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 . "I wanted some fresh air, so I opened the window."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Then how did it get broken?! Such a bumbling fool you couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t even open it\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  properly?! How?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He casually lifted his bloody hand, letting the blood drip on the new, white carpet they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d just had put in. If his uncle wished to be a prat about it, he would bleed all over their carpet, it made no difference to him. "That\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s how. Now, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
do you mind if I stop bleeding on the carpet, or do you have more questions for me?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Vernon Dursley\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face stood in stark contrast to the white walls, having turned an even deeper shade of purple as what Harry said finally sunk in. Then he remembered the c\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
arpet. "Get that hand bandaged, and then you can get out the blood stains!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Get them out yourself you bloody sod! I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m busy." With that, Harry marched into the downstairs bathroom to fix his hand, leaving a great imitation of a stammering eggplant with a p
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 uffy mustache standing where his uncle was minutes before.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 His uncle didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t bother him for the next few days, aside from proclaiming that he would pay for the window out of his allowance, and until then it could simply remain broken. Harry would have thoug
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ht that to be a joke, if not for the fact that he knew the Dursley\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know what a joke was, since his uncle presumably knew that he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d never given him an allowance of any kind in his entire life. Then again, as far as Harry was concerned, his uncle w\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
s also a bloody idiot who thought that his treatment of him was lavish and saintly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 There were no repercussions to Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s outburst at his uncle, though. His uncle still hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t forgotten the \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 talking to\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 he had received from Mad-Eye Moody. He had been \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 tal\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ked to\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 by the others there at the end of the last school year, but his uncle was most afraid of Mad-Eye. So, most of the time, no one bothered him aside from what you could call common sense parenting.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The next few days passed without incident, for which \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry was thoroughly thankful. The less time he had to put up with his family, the better. He needed to think. In fact, that\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 s all he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d been doing all summer. Thinking about the prophecy, how he was supposed to kill Voldemort, and about Sirius.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 But, it was\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 not to last. Exactly one week from Harry sticking his hand through the window a piercing shriek filled the house, along with the loud crack of someone apparating into the living room. He had been expecting this visit, for the past few days. He\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 d been get\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ing them regularly since he left Hogwarts.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 He got up and went downstairs to the awaiting face of Mad-Eye Moody, whose magical eye was spinning wildly about. He took a sip from his hip flask before speaking. "Potter\'85\loch\f0 
 what happened to your hand? That git Dur\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 sley didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t do that, did he?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No, I opened the window without moving anything but the pane."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I see. Taken to doing things the hard way, have you?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Something like that. Before I continue, what did you ask me for, for your eye, when you came to pick me up\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 for the Order?" As he finished the question, his hand went to his wand, which was placed inside his belt behind his back.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Alastor \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 Mad-Eye\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  Moody smiled at this question. "Very good, Potter. Constant vigilance is the key," he said, his smile still plaster\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
ed on his face. "I asked you for a glass of water. I still have a bit of trouble with it, every now and then. But, I have to mention\'85\loch\f0 
 when you pick a question like that it should be something no one else will know. Everyone there saw me ask you for a glas\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  of water."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "If you say so. Are we done with the small talk, now?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 At this, Moody sighed. "I was hoping you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d managed to start working past this, by now. So much for wishful thinking, eh?" Harry continued to glare at Moody, who returned the glare in kind. 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Your friends said you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d not been writing to them and were a bit worried something had happened to you. They asked me to check in on you, again."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "As you can see, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m fine."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m glad to hear it. Did you receive their owls?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "And?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "And what?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Aren\loch\af0\dbch\af15\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t you going to respond?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t planned on it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Why?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t seem important."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Moody sighed again. This wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t going how he planned, obviously. "Did he," he indicated Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s uncle with a nod of his head, "stop you from sending owls?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No. He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s quite\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 scared of you, you know." He cracked a sadistic smirk towards his uncle, who was trying rather vehemently to revive his wife who had obviously fainted at the sudden appearance of Mad-Eye in her living room.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s at least good to see you smile."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Thi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s reminded Harry all to clearly of why he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d done so little smiling over his summer. The tiny smile that managed to creep onto his face quickly evaporated.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What do you want, Mad-Eye?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I was just coming to check up on you for your friends. They\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re worried \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 about you, and frankly so is the rest of the Order."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m fine. You can tell the rest of the Order that, as well."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Have it your way, then, Potter," and with that he pulled out two envelopes. One from }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny and the Weasleys}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry reached out and took the envelopes, adding "Is that all?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Aye, Potter, that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s all. I need to get going, anyway. Keep an eye out for yourself," and then\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  he was gone with the accompanying crack of disapparation.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s aunt Petunia had obviously woken up. Not really caring to hear anything from either of them about his \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 guest\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  he t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry, I, as well as our mutual friends, feel it would be best if you spend the rest of your summer at The Burrow with the W\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As such, I have arranged for a portkey to bring you to a pre-arr\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 anged destination at six o\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
clock on the morning of August first. Arthur will be waiting for you when you arrive. The portkey, as you may notice, is the Quidditch captain\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s badge. Professor McGonogall asked that I send it to you.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As you may have guessed, I \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 have lifted the ban on you, as well as Fred and George Weasley. Should you have any questions about your new captaincy, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I will also be paying you a visit the day you arrive at The Burrow, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
as I have some matters of the utmost importance to discuss with you. Please do not mention this when you arrive. My visit is to be a surprise to the Weasleys.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Worry not about your belongings. Arthur has assured me that he will pick them up for you. Simply \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 pack what you wish to bring with you and they will be brought to The Burrow shortly after you arrive.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Also, I would like to wish you a happy sixteenth birthday, Mr. Potter.

\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d not open it until that day.

\par }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Then he began to study the metallic fabric that made up the Quidditch Captain\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s badge. The fabric was a thin patch, but every time h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
e tried to use the scissors on it they had refused to cut. Trying to set it on fire didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t work, either. He tried tossing it out the window, but a breeze had blown it back in every time. Finally he resorted to tossing it into the rubbish bin.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Thankfully, i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s opinion, his friends had taken the hint and not sent him any birthday gifts or cards. After Mad-Eye\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s visit they hadn\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 t sent anything else. If he stayed out of the Wizarding world, maybe he could avoid getting anyone else killed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d managed to \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 read almost everything he was sent over the summer, so far. Mainly letters from Ron and Hermione trying to keep him up to date, since he\hich\f0 \rquote

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Nymphadora Tonks had, in no certain terms, threatened to tie him to a tree and wand-whip him if he didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

nog him senseless in front of everyone, which only appeared as he started to close the letter with no intention of a reply. That threat was one he didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry m\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ade sure to add at the end, hoping to embarrass her a bit, "If you }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 really}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

dwig, he realized it might have sounded as if he were flirting with Tonks. That idea turned his face red, and started a spot of worry in the back of his mind, but it was quickly forgotten when he noticed where his next letter was from.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The letter was from \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 the Office of Deceased Witches and Wizards, addressed to Mister Harry Potter. Harry eyed the letter he had never noticed, before. It must have come after he\hich\f0 \rquote

m sure that bothers you a bit. I can see it on your face when I do it. But, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m working on it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 On to the important things, though. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve named you as my one and only he\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ir. You are my closest living relative; though some would claim it is only a designation, they
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re wrong. To me, you are my son and I hope that I am able to tell you that before you end up reading it in this. If not, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sorry for that, as well.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As my heir \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 you are entitled to a number of things, all of which has been taken care of. I am, however, listing those for you here so that you will know what it entails, and can keep track of it.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Black Manor is now yours to do with as you please. My only request about\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  the house is if the Order still needs to use it that you allow them to do so. I believe in what the Order is doing, and if I
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m not wrong so do you.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 You are also entitled to what some would dub as my \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 fortune\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 . I never wanted it, so I never used it or paid\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 much attention to it. Maybe you can make better use of it than I have. The sum of my fortune is approximately five hundred thousand galleons, give or take a few thousand. A rather large sum in muggle money, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m told. The goblins said it was somewhere in \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 he millions\'85\loch\f0 
 I forget the exact number. I wanted to give you a rough estimate since it might be important, but the goblins said that with that much it wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t really matter, which I found an odd thing for a goblin to say you know.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Next there is the matter\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  of Potter Place. Your parents, as you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ve most likely noticed from your vault, did very well for themselves. They owned a rather large home near Hogwarts, about twice the size of Black Manor. The house elves take care of the house, headed by Master Keltor\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 i
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 . That, as well, is now yours. Your parents left it in my custody until such time as you were old enough.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Lily and James also have left your inheritance. You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve seen your school fund, of course and I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sure you assumed that was your inheritance, but that i
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t is not. As part of my will, the contents of my vault have been added to Lily and James\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  vault at Gringott\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s. Your inheritance is roughly one and one half million galleons. As well as one Golden Snitch from Hogwarts that your father pinched. There are so\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
e other items in there, but as far as I know they were never that important to anyone.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As you can see, you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re what most would call a \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 very rich man\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 . I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m just sorry at how you had to come by it. Lily and James
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  vault is number four-hundred seventy-eight.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 A\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
nd Harry, please always remember that your family is who loves you, not the people you share blood with. I know James and Lily loved you, your friends love you, the Weasleys love you, and most of the Order of the Phoenix love you.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 P.S. - Thank Albus for taking care of this for me.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 P.S. - As you may have noticed, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m forgetful. There is a gemstone in your vault in a wooden box\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 , wrapped in a white cloth. Don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t touch it. It
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s called the Dragon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s Tear. I learned why the hard way. It burns anyone it touches\'85\loch\f0  stings quite a bit, too.
\par }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry wiped the tears on his face as he finished the letter. He had loved Sirius very much, and this\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  simply removed all hope in his mind that Sirius hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t died. There was little there, already, but this simply closed all the doors.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Sirius\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  words, though, burned in his mind. He had true family. He hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t noticed how or when it had really happened, but a \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
family simply crept its way into his life one day when he wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t watching and hasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t left him since.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 For Harry that cinched it. While he wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t anywhere near the point of working through everything he felt, Sirius\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  letter did clarify one point in his mind.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As he reached into the rubbish bin to get the badge, he noticed it was gone. Looking more thoroughly, there was no trace of it. Frantically, he began to search the room for the portkey badg\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
e, but there was no trace of it. A voice in the back of his mind said quite clearly, }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Good man, bit of an idiot, though}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .}{\i\fs24\kerning0

\par }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Next time, avoid trying to des\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 troy me. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d prefer to remain in one piece, you know," }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Not a problem, you were frustrated. Woody got frustrated over much less important things, l\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ike Fred and George. Those two drove him nuts. Speaking of }{\fs24\kerning0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As midnight approached Harry decided, finally, to open the letter from Ginny and the Weasleys. He had been trying to ignore it since he was sure they would be put out with his lack of replies to them.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I suppose it is just the way you are. Not The-Boy-Who-Lived, not the famous Harry Potter, not any of that. You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re just you. A good kid who tries to do the right thing, and\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

y are almost all I have left, now. I never really knew my parents, and with losing Sirius, well\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  it hurt\'85\loch\f0  a lot. I still blame myself for what happened, and I couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t bear the thought of you, or any of your family, being hurt because of me.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m telling yo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 u this in confidence. I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t want anyone else to know anything I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I had plans to leave. Not the Dursley\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s\'85\loch\f0  I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve already mentioned that in my let\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ter to your mother. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 His last \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
will and testament was actually more of a letter, to me. In it he told me that family are those who love you. That means I have a family. It was surprising how much sense that statement made to me, and still does. Having a family, well that means a lot to
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 me. I dare say that because of how I grew up, family is one of the most important things in the world, to me.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 It was just so hard. I didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t mean to worry anyone. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve known what friendship was, and that you worry about your friends, but I guess it never re\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 To answer your question, Bill and Charlie are talking about me. Seems I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve been adopted as their littlest brother. Not that I mind,\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  mind you. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As for dating me, I didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know that it would be so bad for you. I guess I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Those people are not coming into this house! No, no, no," bellowed the oversized man as he slammed open the door.

\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "And to be awake when Dudley notices all the love bites,"}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  he thought to himself.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Chuckling to himself, Harry went back to his room and picked up the portkey. It would be activating in the next two minutes. While he waited, Harry listened to Vernon and Petunia arguing back and forth about how proud h
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e was and how improper she thought it was. No one was listening to Dudley who kept saying, "I think it was the candy! No girls have ever shown me any interest!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The last thing Harry heard, as he felt the familiar jerk at his navel of a portkey was Vernon s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 rst off I would like to thank those of you who so graciously reviewed my first chapter. I appreciate your interest and your kind words, very much. :)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Some of you were very interested that I hurry up with the next chapter, so I thought I'd go ahead and give\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 you the second chapter today, though I won't be releasing a chapter a day very often, I'm sure.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I currently have the first five chapters completed (aside from the perfection period), and about one third to one half of the sixth sitting in another window. \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
It takes me, on average, two days to write a chapter. But, it takes me another day or two to go over it, while I'm already working on the next chapter, to get it to where everything is how I really want it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I won't try to set a schedule for myself, though,\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 for the simple fact that a schedule will decrease the quality of the work. It will feel more like a job than something I am doing because I enjoy it. As such, I will mainly post when I am happy with how a chapter has turned out, not before.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I have, in act\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
uality, spent more than four days on the first few chapters. I was waiting on a beta reader, however I got impatient and just posted it regardless. If you notice any mistakes, they are entirely my fault for being impatient\'85\loch\f0 
 which, I'm doing it again in po\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ting this chapter. ;)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
I am, to be quite honest with you, not as familiar with Harry Potter as some of you probably are. I've only read the last three books, though I am reading the first and second now, as well, in an effort to familiarize myself with the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 story a bit better, since I only saw the movies of those.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I would also like to address something mentioned by lan1. Lan1 brought up the subject of dating Ginny. As you will see, that is a possibility, but unlike some of the other stories I've read, }{\fs24\kerning0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Lady Pyra, I'm glad you liked that line, as I enjoyed it as well. Sadly, I don't have very much of a sense of humor, so I can't interject humor like I've read \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
in many stories. Things such as that are the best I can do, really. :)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 In any case, I've wasted enough time blabbering about the reviews and all that. On to the story!

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry was standing atop a small, grassy hill a short walk from The Burro\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 w, and Dumbledore was walking directly towards him. Harry couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t help but smile. His prank on Dudley went even better than expected, and he was finally away from that place.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Good morning, Harry," Dumbledore welcomed as he approached, a smile on his face\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 . "How was your trip?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Fine, sir. I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t particularly like portkeys, but it wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t as bad as the floo."
\par }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Tell him!"}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  the badge barked.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, and before it tries to drive me crazy, the badge," Harry indicated the Quidditch captain\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s badge in his hand, "told\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  me to tell you that it isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ah, yes. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m quite sure it did. It can be rather quirky at times, if I do say so myself," stated Dumbledore, the familiar twinkle lighting his eyes.
\par }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I resemble that remark,"}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  the badge mocked.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Walk with me, Har\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ry. We have a while before the Weasleys are expecting you, and I need to speak with you about a few things of importance."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded, and the two walked towards the lake not far from The Burrow in silence, Harry considering his prank and Dumbledore cons\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
idering what to say to Harry. They walked quickly, Harry taking larger strides to keep up with Dumbledore\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s pace.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Upon reaching the lake, Harry sat down by the edge and waited patiently while Dumbledore seemed to gather his thoughts. Harry just sat watchin\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
g the ripples traveling along the surface, thinking how much he was like that ripple, how everything he did seemed to affect everyone around him, more often than not in a bad way.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry, I thought you would wish to know that Sirius has been cleared of all\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 charges levied against him. He will be given a proper ceremonial service, as well as several commendations from the Ministry. His criminal record will be expunged, and several public statements are to be made about the grievous error that was his impriso
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ment."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded mutely, unable to speak over the lump that appeared in his throat the moment Sirius\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 name was mentioned. Immediately his eyes glossed over, brimming with unshed tears that he tried to hold back. He had cried enough that summer and didn\hich\f0 \rquote \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t feel like breaking down again.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "They are also providing with those commendations a sum of money as reparations for his improper imprisonment, for those twelve years, and the time he was in hiding equal to what he could have earned. The sum is three hundr
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ed thousand galleons, as well as fifty thousand galleons for services to the public. All of which is now yours."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Again Harry nodded, not yet trusting his ability to speak; now more so because of rage than the lump in his throat. His godfather was dead, it \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
was his fault, and they were trying to give him money for causing it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It was not your fault, Harry. Never think that," Dumbledore stated, seeming to have read his mind. "The recompense will be placed into your vault at Gringott\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s this afternoon, with your
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  approval of course."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 At this Harry finally decided to try speaking over the rage and the lump still filling his throat. "Sir\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  can\'85\loch\f0 
 can it be placed into vault number four-hundred seventy-eight? That is my vault, now."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore nodded, "I expected as muc\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 h, and have already made that adjustment for you."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Sir, does the Order have any financial requirements," he trailed off sheepishly, realizing how stupid his question really was. "I\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  what I meant was, I know the Order has financial requirements\'85
\loch\f0  can I help\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  with any of them?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry thought he saw a flicker of surprise wash over Dumbledore\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face, but before he could get a second look it was gone. "Thank you, Harry, however the Order\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s financial situation is quite stable, I assure you." Dumbledore smiled warm\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ly at Harry, "Should we ever be in monetary need, though, I will keep your offer in mind. I highly doubt that should ever be the case, though, Harry."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Is this what you needed to speak with me about," Harry asked, finally managing to get his emotions under\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  control. "I am guessing this was a way to break the ice for something."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Indeed you are correct, Harry. I have asked you here to see how you are coping with Sirius\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  death."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Fine," Harry answered, far too quickly for it to have been a thoughtful answer. A\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 fter a short silence he spoke again, "I still blame myself for it, but\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
 something he put into his\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  letter\'85\loch\f0  reminded me that even though I blame myself, I can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t sulk about it. Which reminds me, he requested that I thank you for taking care of his\'85\loch\f0 
\hich\f0  letter\'85\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 or him."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore nodded his head somberly as he looked at the young man before him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "He also requested that I allow the Order to use Black Manor for as long as they need. I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t think I could spend much time there right now, anyway. Oh, and he wanted m\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
e to free Kreacher. Is it safe to do that, now?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore nodded again, apparently having expected this. "Most of what Kreacher could divulge, we assume has already been shared and have taken the proper precautions. You can free him with no adverse affec
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ts to the Order. Since we found out what he did we have kept from Kreacher everything we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve done," explained Dumbledore.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Good. I want to carry out Sirius\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  last wishes to the best of my abilities."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore nodded, as he again went silent to gather his t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
houghts. He smiled as he looked out over the small lake, watching the wind push small ripples across the surface and listening to the rustle of the trees. The indignant twitter of a small group of birds carried through the leaves, as a strong wind rustled
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 their nest a bit more roughly than they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d have liked.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "This is such a peaceful place, Harry. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m glad you can find some measure of comfort here."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "What do\'85\loch\f0 " he trailed off. After a time, he asked, "How did you know? Even I really didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It shows in\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0  everything you do. Every breath, every move, every whisper\'85\loch\f0  they speak profoundly of just how truly at peace you are here. The only other place I\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 ve seen you relax in such a manner is at Hogwarts."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I never knew I was that transparent."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh I doubt many o\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 thers would notice\'85\loch\f0 
 you have nothing to worry about in that regard. It has been my responsibility to keep you safe for so long that it seems I have come to recognize your spirits through your actions. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sure you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ve often wondered if I could peer into yo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
r mind. I can not, at least not in the way you think. I can, however, watch your expressions, your actions, the shifting of your breathing. It all speaks volumes, my dear boy."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sort of like being able to recognize a friend is upset due to a subtle shift i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n behavior," ventured Harry.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Indeed. But, I suppose we really should get back to the point. The Weasleys will be expecting you soon."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "The point?" asked Harry. He was very curious what Dumbledore could want. Harry waited patiently, while Dumbledore gather\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ed his thoughts again, watching the lake coursing into the small river by The Burrow.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I was hoping to find a more subtle way of asking this, however the best course of action seems to be a direct attack. Harry, would you be willing to teach Defense Agains\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t the Dark Arts, this year?"

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eyes widened as the realization of what Dumbledore just asked fully set in. "Y-Y-You want }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 me}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 to teach?! Why?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "The students coming to Hogwarts are not prepared for what is to come. They have no idea what is happening i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
n the world. Cornelius finally acknowledged that Voldemort has returned, as well as announcing it to the public. However, he still asserts that Voldemort is of no consequence, out of fear that it will cause panic if he does not.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Cornelius has agreed to wo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 rk with the Order, but he still greatly fears the loss of his position as Minister. An admission of his blatant ignorance of the truth would likely result in exactly that.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Thus, the students coming to Hogwarts will be unable to perceive the threat ahead. \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
You can correct that problem and prepare them for the dark times ahead. You proved yourself when you organized Dumbledore\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s Army\'85\loch\f0

ght he added, that twinkle again dancing in his eyes, "And it would be a terrible shame to destroy the record all the previous professors have worked so hard to create."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry was still too shocked to notice the joke Dumbledore had just made about the \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 cur\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 se\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0  surrounding the Dark Arts position. "But, how\'85
\loch\f0  I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m going into my sixth year, now. I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know enough to teach!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore smiled knowingly, "Harry, I reviewed the O.W.L. results this morning before I arrived. If you had to venture a guess, who would \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
you think received the highest marks in Defense Against the Dark Arts?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry looked confused for a moment then spoke his answer, "Someone that was in the DA." Almost as an afterthought he added, "Hermione, probably."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Again the twinkle danced throughout Du\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 mbledore\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s eyes, madly this time, as if looking for a way out. "The highest marks for the Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. was received by you."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry let that information sink in before responding. "Even so, it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s only because Umbridge refused to teach\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  us anything!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore gave Harry a knowing smile before he spoke again, "You misunderstand, Harry. You received the highest marks in the }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 history of Hogwarts}{\fs24\kerning0 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 . Harry," he stopped a moment to check if Harry was still paying attention, because Harry was st\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 aring right through him into oblivion. "Harry?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I did?" was all Harry could think of, so that was what he asked. He was far too surprised, happy, confused, and shocked to think clearly, any longer.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Indeed. The\'85\loch\f0  DA, I believe you called it, had varying sc\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ores, but they all did particularly well, also. I do not believe my faith in your ability to handle this burden is misplaced."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "But that still doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t change the fact that I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m just a sixth year. There is no way I could possibly teach N.E.W.T. level classes\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 !"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I have considered that as well. Should you decide to accept my offer, I will privately prepare you for the next two years of classes. That gives us exactly one month. Just enough time, I do believe."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Is this a joke, sir? It has to be a joke. One month\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0  to prepare for two years of classes? Me teaching? I just\'85\loch\f0 "
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "This is far from a joke, Harry. I am quite serious." Harry realized the truth of this when he glanced at Dumbledore and noticed the smile that was on his face mere moments ago was entirely gone. \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
The twinkle that was dancing in his eyes had also utterly vanished. Regardless of his change in attitude, Dumbledore\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s soft and calming presence was still filling the area.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I have never made such an offer to a student. I have never known a student who cou\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ld handle such a burden. You have proven your ability, and now it is needed." Dumbledore was almost pleading with Harry to accept.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry let out a resigned sigh. "Do I get all the perks of being a professor," he asked smiling weakly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Talking as they \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
walked back to The Burrow, Harry got an idea of what the rest of his summer would be like. He was a bit irritated to find that he would need at least four hours of training per day to be able to learn everything needed over the next two years of Defense A
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ainst the Dark Arts classes, not to mention the studying required to learn the theoretical side.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He would be teaching one class per day during his normal free period, and then seven classes on Sunday so that he could get in two classes per week without int\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
erfering with his own school schedule. It was upon hearing this that Harry began to think he might have made a mistake in accepting. He couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t even fathom how he would be able to manage homework.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Who would you have gotten to teach the class, if I didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  accept," Harry asked.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore paused a moment. It was obvious that he hoped he wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t have to answer this question. "Remus Lupin agreed."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Wait, we could have had Professor Lupin back?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, yes. He agreed, however it was with reluctance. Both he \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 and I felt it would be better to have him continue in his current capacity with the Order."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, I see. Well, what about those perks?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The twinkle in Dumbledore\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eyes was back. "Perks?" he asked with a slight smile on his face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, yeah. Since I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m tech\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 nically going to be a professor now, do I get all the perks that goes along with it? You know, private quarters, house points, detentions, pay?"

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ah, yes. I wondered if you would ask about that. I must admit, though, you asked sooner than I expected." The \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
bearded old man considered the questions thoroughly, and finally continued, "The answer to your question is yes. You are a professor and as such you can do the same as any of the staff. However, I do expect you to be responsible with these \hich\f0 
\lquote \loch\f0 perks\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 . I also\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 expect you to be civil with the }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 rest}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 of the staff."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The emphasis put on the word \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 rest\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 made it clear to Harry that Dumbledore was meaning he had to be civil with that greasy git Snape. Harry happily nodded, though, enjoying the fantasy of sending Malfoy t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
o detention on a daily basis, and removing house points from Slytherin much like Snape chose to do to Gryffindor.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sir, about my pay. What will it be?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The old man regarded Harry over his half-moon spectacles for a moment, before responding to his inquiry.\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  "Along with room and board, as well as food, you receive one year\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s pay at five hundred galleons per month. Your will be exempted from tuition as you will be considered staff."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I see. Could I make certain arrangements for my pay, then? I really don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t nee\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Certainly, Harry. How would you like for me to explain why Hogwarts is providing the Weasleys with staff pay for a year?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry again wondered if Dumbledore could read his mind, as he peered at the old man\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s half-smile.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "As I mentioned, Harry, I ca\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n not."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You know that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s almost creepy, right, sir," chuckled Harry. "But, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll explain it to them. I think I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m going to have to explain a lot to them."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore smiled and nodded as they continued the walk by the river up to the main area where The Burr\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ow was situated.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sir, have you told anyone else about this?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Not yet," he said cautiously, seeming to sense what Harry was going to say.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Can you keep it a secret, then? I know you said you wanted me to be civil to the staff, but I really want to see the\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  look on Professor Snape\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face when he hears."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 A small frown appeared on Dumbledore\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face at this, however he couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t hide the mischievous twinkle dancing swiftly through his eyes. "If that is your wish, Harry."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It is."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 And thus ended their return walk\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
. As they arrived at The Burrow both noticed something was not normal. The Burrow seemed to be a frantic collection of shouts and running. At two minutes after seven, The Burrow was in a frantic fit. The entirety of the Weasley family looked as if it was 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 reparing for a war, and most of them disapparated out without even noticing him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry spotted Ron who was frantically looking through a trunk for something, and walked over to him and asked his friend, "Hey, Ron, what\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s going on?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve gotta save Harry!\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  Those muggles of his must have done something to him, because he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s not here," replied the redheaded, lanky boy to whom Harry
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s question was directed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Really? Wow, mind if we help, then," Harry asked with no trace of humor in his voice, however the look o\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n his face said it all. Harry was grinning from ear-to-ear and Dumbledore\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 s eyes were again twinkling madly with suppressed laughter.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sure, Harry, just get whatever you can find to do damage!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Great, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m read --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry!" Ginny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s ecstatic shout overrode \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s voice, as the fiery redhead streaked across the room, bowling him over in the process. The hug into which Harry was pulled was rather strong considering Ginny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s small size, which, when he considered it, was not that small compared to his own simil\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 r size. All the breath was knocked out of him and he couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t seem to draw another. Ginny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s grip on his middle wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t loosening, though.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  breathe\'85\loch\f0  help," was all Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s breathless and struggling frame could manage, as his face began to turn a viole
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t color from the lack of oxygen.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry?" Ron was looking at him, just now realizing to whom he was talking just a moment before.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Help," Harry squeaked again. "Air good!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "}{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Separatus!}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 " called Mr. Weasley from the door. As soon as the intonation left Mr. We\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 asley\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 s mouth Ginny was removed from Harry, who was absolutely giddy about being able to breathe again, by a pair of invisible arms. "You nearly choked the poor boy, Ginny!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Thank\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  you\'85\loch\f0  Mr. Weasley," gasped Harry who was beginning to return to his normal \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
color, as he watched Ginny who was beginning to turn a very fetching shade of red. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 m\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  glad\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  to see\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  you, too\'85\loch\f0 
 Ginny," he gasped out between breaths.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "M\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 sorry," she quickly stated, looking down between her feet in embarrassment, while Ron was trying to h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 elp Harry up into a chair.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore, who no one else seemed to notice yet, was stifling a chuckle at everything that had occurred. "Marvelous," was all he said, before saying hello to Mr. Weasley.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hello, Albus. What are you doing here," Mr. Weasley aske\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d the older man, a smile on his face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Actually, I came to speak with Harry. I must be leaving, in a moment, but I also wanted to give him his birthday gift, before I had to return to Hogwarts," the Headmaster said as he pulled out a tiny package and waved
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  his wand over it, causing it to expand.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry looked at the gift once it had expanded, curious as to what it could be. The gift was exceptionally neatly wrapped. Navy blue paper of a starscape with clouds gently sliding over it, neatly tied over with silv
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 er ribbon, and topped with a sparkling silver and gold bow faced him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry, if you don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t mind, I would like to see you open it before I leave," Dumbledore said as he smiled warmly at Harry.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded as he carefully removed the wrapping on the gift, t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 rying not to damage the paper. He wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t sure why, but he really wanted to keep that paper. There was something soothing to him about what it displayed, and he made plans to place it beside his bed later. Finally, he finished opening the paper and he pull\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d open the box.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Inside the box he found a silver dish inscribed with various runes around the rim that seemed familiar to him. Then realization struck him, and with it came its friend shock. Harry couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t believe it. He glanced at Dumbledore, then back in\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 to the box. He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d been given a pensieve. Harry stared at the gift in shock a moment more, then quickly pulled the Headmaster into a hug.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Thank you, sir. I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t think you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll ever know how much that means to me."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore simply smiled his knowing smile, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 and patted Harry on his back. "The instructions for its use are in the box, as well," he said. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sure you\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 ll make good use of it, Harry. And, now I must be going."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Thank you again, sir," Harry added, as Dumbledore said his good-byes and left to return \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 to Hogwarts.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "While I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m thinking about it, where was everyone going when I got here," Harry asked, once he remembered everyone apparating out as he arrived.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Oh fu\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  err\'85\loch\f0  fudge! They apparated out as soon as you didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t show! They\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re all at the Dursleys tryi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ng to rescue you," Ron exclaimed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry went wide-eyed at this piece of information. Mr. Weasley, however, having recognized the problem, immediately disapparated to bring them back before any irreparable damage was done. About ten minutes later he returne
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d with a frantic Mrs. Weasley, a cackling set of twins, and their two very angry looking older brothers.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Bill was the first of them to speak. "That no-necked, mustached, purple-faced bugger was a real arsehole!" he growled eliciting a laugh from Harry, Ron\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  and Ginny.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "William Weasley, you watch your language," snapped Mrs. Weasley who had been jerked back to reality for a moment by the particular choice of language her son used.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "He may not have said it nicely, mum, but he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s still right," Charlie stated in \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 his brother\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s defense.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yeah, mum --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re just being --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "honest about it," said the twins, bounding between each other what they were saying.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Mrs. Weasley sighed, then, finally noticing Harry and pulled him into a very tight hug to which she seemed s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d never let him out of. "We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
re so glad you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re all right, dear," she said as she choked the air out of him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Air... help," was all Harry could muster, having been hugged out of breath for the second time in less than an hour.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "}{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Separatus!}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 " called Mr. Weas\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ley, again saving Harry from being choked to death by a hug. Mrs. Weasley, unlike Ginny, wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t going to give up so quickly. She fought the spell for a moment before realizing that she was being pulled away because she was choking Harry.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry thought to h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 imself that it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 d be a really embarrassing way to go\'85\loch\f0  he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d faced down Death Eaters and even Voldemort, only to be killed by a rogue hug. He chuckled to himself, which Mrs. Weasley misunderstood as him laughing at her.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sorry, dear. We were just so worri\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ed," she said, seeming to gather her wits about her.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Everyone around nodded, and happily greeted him. As they all started to talk with him, though, he pulled out the stack of letters he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d written, as well as the batteries he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d taken from his clock for Mr. \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Weasley, since he didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t have time to buy any. He walked over to each of them, giving them their letter, and asking them to read them in private, before they decided to talk to him any further.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Mrs. Weasley nodded and walked into the kitchen, the twins app\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 arated up to their room and Ron bounded up the stairs to his. When he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d given Mr. Weasley his letter, which also contained the money he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d sent for batteries, he also handed him the batteries. The look on Mr. Weasley\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face was much like that you would see
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 on a child on Christmas. He immediately ran outside to tinker with the batteries and read his letter, after thanking Harry.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As he approached Bill and Charlie he told them, with a smile on his face, that he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d be happy to take them up on their offer, wheneve\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 r they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d like, as long as they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d let him sleep some first. They grinned, and happily agreed, before Harry thought about their other brother.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Where is Percy," Harry asked, wondering where their younger brother was.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Bill and Charlie both went into a bit of \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a scowl, before Charlie said, "He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s at work."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded, not missing the looks on their faces. "Is he supposed to be by here, today? I have a letter for him, as well. He wrote to me apologizing for his behavior."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 At hearing this, their scowls faltered. \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Apparently they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d not been expecting this sudden change in behavior from their younger brother.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "He did?" Bill asked cautiously, as if expecting to hear that this was a joke of some kind prepared by the twins.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry simply nodded in reply.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Good," the two \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 brothers said in unison.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "He doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t get to stop by often. Since Fudge found out Voldemort," Bill twitched at the mention of the name, but Charlie continued without pause, "was really back, he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s had to work overtime a lot."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "He also hasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t wanted to see us\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 , for a while," Bill added casually, "we weren\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t very nice the last time we saw him." 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry chuckled at the understatement. "Well, I need to give Ginny her letter, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll talk to you guys later?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 They nodded and glanced over at Ginny, and Bill spoke up. "Yo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 u\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d better hurry, then," Bill said as he put his hand on Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s shoulder and turned him to face where Ginny was. "She looks like she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s about ready to hex you something fierce, mate."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry winced at this. He had seen her put her famous Bat Bogey Hex to us\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
e on the twins, and quickly excused himself to go talk to her before she decided to use it on him, as well. "Yeah, I better get over there."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As Harry made his way to Ginny, he could see the daggers she was shooting at him from her eyes. If looks could kill\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 , he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d have been dead many times over. As he approached he made sure to keep his head down as a sign that he was apologetic, in hopes that she would wait to hex him until she had at least read his letter and thought about it first.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hi, Ginny," Harry tried\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  as he got close.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hello," she said, and there was no mistaking the coldness in her tone.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I wrote you a letter, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d like you to read it before you decide to," he gulped once, "hex me."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Her glare faltered at his admission to her, and he then realized why s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 he was mad. She thought he hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t written to her, she had been too worried to remember her promise to knock some sense into him. He was slightly thankful for that fact.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You did?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Of course," he said, as if it should have been completely obvious. He pulle\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d the letter out of his pocket, as proof. As she reached for it, he tucked it back into his pocket and said simply, "C
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 mon." He then turned and walked out the door.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny, confused for a moment about what he said, quickly caught up with him. As she stalked\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  beside him, he walked back to the lake he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d been at with Dumbledore, and leaned up against a tree. Once settled, he pulled out the letter he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d written to her, and handed it over, as he studied the shape of the lake. It was then that he realized the lake 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 as shaped much like a human heart, pumping water into the river much like a heart pumps blood.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Have a seat," he requested, and she sat down on the grass. She grinned and broke the seal to the letter, and began reading. Almost immediately, tears formed in \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
her eyes, and slowly rolled down her face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I knew it was hard on you, but I never knew it was }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 that}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  hard. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ve always had family that cared about me, so I guess I just took it for granted. Did you really consider just vanishing?" Harry nodded. Ginny frowne\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d, but she went back to reading.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "They\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re really calling you little brother, now," she asked suddenly, interrupting his thoughts about the lake\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s odd shape. Again, Harry nodded, and again she went back to reading.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 After a few minutes, Harry glanced up and \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 saw a pink flush slowly overtake her, starting at the ears and working its way down. A smile crept onto Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s face, and he began watching her more intently. As each second passed she turned even deeper shades of red. Finally, she read the last sentence,\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
looked up at him in with her face a mixture of anger, shock, and humor and groaned as she fell over and tried to hide her face from him. Harry could no longer hold back his laughter and began rolling around on the ground holding his sides.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re mean!" s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 he shouted, however Ginny wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t angry, or at least she didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t seem to be, Harry thought. "I can\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 t believe you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d do me that way!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry put on his best puppy dog impression and just looked at her innocently, letting his lower lip tremble just slightly enou\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 gh to make him seem hurt. He then asked in a shaky voice, "You think I
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m mean?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny looked at him completely mortified. Never before had he acted like this, with her, so the thought that it was a joke never even occurred to her. Her heart almost shattere\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
d at the thought that she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d hurt him. In response she did the only thing she could think of to prove to him she didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t think he was mean\'85\loch\f0 
 she pulled him in and kissed him, with everything she could muster. She released the years of devotion she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d had for \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 im into that one earth-shattering kiss.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eyes instantaneously went wide with surprise. He had only been joking with her, and the look of horror on her face had shocked him into silence. He hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t even noticed as she pulled him into the kiss, and the\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
n there he was being kissed. Her soft lips pressed into his, welcoming him to join. Her arms snaked around to cradle his neck and her scent teased his nose as she pushed him back against the ground. It felt like she was pouring everything she felt for him
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 into that one kiss, and so he gave in to it, enjoyed it\'85\loch\f0  joined it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry," shouted Ron from a distance. "Oi, Harry, where are you?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s mind tingled with excitement. She\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d always had a crush on Harry, but had never been able to tell him. She thought\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  she was over him when she
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 d started going out with Michael Corner, but now she was lying on top of him by the lake, kissing him with everything she had\'85\loch\f0 
 and he was kissing her back. Everything she felt before came rushing back, even stronger.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Then Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s v\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
oice broke through the barrier in her mind, and she immediately broke off the kiss in wide-eyed horror. She mumbled an apology then jumped up and ran off, before Harry even had a chance to consider what just happened, let alone trying to stop her. He simp
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 y continued lying on the ground, staring at the sky.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As he continued to lie there, he wondered when the sky had turned so blue and the clouds so white. A moment later Ron came over to where he was, though Harry didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t even notice his presence until he spok\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e, rather loudly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You alright, mate? You look like someone just snogged you senseless."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "M\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 fine," mumbled Harry, as he continued to marvel at the blueness of the sky. "Jusfine."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ginny didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t hex you, did she? Wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t be surprised if she did. What\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d you \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Idnthnso. Hattawaitunsee."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Are you sure you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re alright? You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re not making much sense there, Harry."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Great, isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t it?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ron shook his head at his friend, then ad\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ded, "Right then. Mum wants you to come on in, now."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ok."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Arriving back at The Burrow, Harry was still in a somewhat amused and bemused state from Ginny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s kiss. Mrs. Weasley took one look at him, and proceeded to question him very thoroughly on if h
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e were all right, if he was not feeling well, and various other questions to all of which Harry just nodded his head repeatedly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Finally managing to get his senses back, he asked Mrs. Weasley, who insisted that he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d known her long enough to call her \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 Molly\loch\af0\dbch\af15\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
, if he could speak with her and Mr. Weasley in private. She agreed, and went to pull her muggle-obsessed husband out of his shed, and returned to the kitchen with him in tow.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As they were sitting down, Bill and Charlie came in to see what was going on, b\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ut Mrs. Weasley shooed them out of the kitchen and told everyone to stay away until they came out. She was about to take her seat again, but she then set about casting silencing charms all over the room, muttering about the twins and their extendable ears
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ok, dear," she said, as she sat back down. "What did you want to talk to us about?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m not quite sure how to put this, and I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m not quite sure how you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll take it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Just spit it out, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sure you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re not going to tell us anything we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve never heard.\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 Seven children can do that, to you, dear," she smiled at him, but the worry was evident on her face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, ok. Dumbledore just offered me a job as a professor at Hogwarts."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The two Weasley parents gaped at him, their jaws having dropped open.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ok, I get \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 the feeling I just told you something that none of the others have ever told you." Harry grinned. "But, that wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t exactly what I wanted to tell you."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "That was a nice little pallet of bricks that you just dropped on us, right there," stated Mr. Weasley, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 the awe clear in his voice.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, I told them to give my pay to my family, because I really don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t need it. I just found out between last night and this morning that I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ve got nearly two and a half million galleons in my vault, not to mention treasures, and\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  also my school funds." Mrs. Weasley gasped at the amount of money Harry stated that he had, but Mr. Weasley took it in stride.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, that was very nice of you dear, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sure they will appreciate the gesture, even if they don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t appreciate you," said Mrs. \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
Weasley, who obviously thought he was talking about the Dursleys and disliked them very much.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, I wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t talking about the Dursleys. My pay from Hogwarts will be placed into the Weasley family vault on a monthly basis for one year, starting come Septe\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
mber first," Harry said.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Mr. and Mrs. Weasley immediately began to protest his statement. "Dear, that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s very thoughtful of you, but we can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t take that," said Mrs. Weasley who seemed to have not picked up that he called them family. Whether she was intentio\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 nally ignoring it or she thought he might not have been serious, Harry could not tell.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I must agree with Molly, Harry. We can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t accept it, it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s too much." Mr. Weasley smiled, but his statement was quite firm.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes, you can," Harry argued, "it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s already be\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 en arranged, anyway. Please, just hear me out. You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 ve all given me so much\'85\loch\f0 
 much more than I ever could have hoped for. You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve treated me like family. But, it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s not that I feel like I owe you something, that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s not why I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

he two, as they both accepted, however reluctantly, and pulled him into a crushing hug. It was the first time he told them he considered them family, and the significance of that was too important to let pass unnoticed. Previously, when Harry received a h
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
g from Mrs. Weasley he accepted it uncomfortably, having never received any emotional contact from the Dursleys. This time, however, with both Arthur and Molly Weasley crushing him in the middle of their kitchen, he gladly accepted and reciprocated their 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ug.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
They continued to talk for a while about why Harry was becoming a teacher and his wish to keep it secret, before Harry remembered he needed to make a trip into Diagon Alley to see about the book his anonymous friend mentioned to him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "While I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m thinkin\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 g about it, is it all right if I go into Diagon Alley for a little while, today? I need to pick up a book," Harry asked. "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s rather important."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Of course, dear. We can make a trip of it and get some of the school things out of the way," Mrs. Weasley sai\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d happily. "I can normally never get the children to avoid the school rush."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry smiled, then muttered something about taking a shower.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh my!" exclaimed Mr. Weasley. "I was supposed to pick up your things. In all the commotion I forgot all about it. Ex\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 cuse me, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ll be back soon," said Mr. Weasley, as he ran outside to the new car the Ministry granted him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Mrs. Weasley simply shook her head, as her husband ran out of the house. "Poor man would forget his head if it weren\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t firmly attached to his neck. An\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
yway, dear, you just wait about ten minutes, then you can go ahead and shower. As long as you spend in the shower, he should be back with your things by the time you get out."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry blushed then nodded, and made his way upstairs. As he was passing Ginny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s o\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 k, Ginny," he said to mollify her discomfort. "I promise, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m not mad."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "A-A-Are you s-sure? I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m just }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 soooooo}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  embarrassed."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes, Ginny, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sure. And there is no need to be embarrassed."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Thanks, Harry. I really am sorry, though."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 At his soothing words sh\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e seemed to relax, and the red shade she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d turned started to lighten. }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh no, can\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 t have that now,"}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  Harry thought to himself.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No problem, Ginny. I rather enjoyed it, actually." He grinned, and winked at her. As soon as he saw the red coming back, he start\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ed off up the stairs. "We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 
ll have to talk more later, Gin, I really need a shower\'85\loch\f0  a cold one."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 She stammered for a moment, at his pronouncement, then she turned the deepest shade of red he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d ever seen on her face. She immediately spun on her heel and ran \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
back into her room slamming the door.
\par }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ohmigod! Was he flirting with me?! It seemed like it, but I dunno. I mean, the remark about him needing a cold shower definitely seemed like flirting. Maybe he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s just hot,"}{
\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  Ginny thought, as she wondered about what ju\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 st happened.

\par }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Finally she fell on the bed and screamed into her pillow in frustration. }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Every time I think I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny groaned at that \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 thought, and began to pound her fist into her pillow.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry walked into Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s room, with a giant grin on his face. He was thoroughly enjoying watching Ginny blush, knowing that he caused it. Though, he couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t tell you }{
\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 why}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  was enjoying it, because e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ven he didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 After he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d showered, he scratched at his face, which already had stubble on it from the last time he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d shaved a few days before. Unlike most tee\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
nage wizards who could ask one of their parents to magic away the stubble, Harry had to shave it off. Mrs. Weasley had already come and asked for his clothes, as she was doing laundry, so he didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t have anything to put back on.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry knocked on the door to\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  the bathroom, and waited until he heard Mrs. Weasley respond from the steps. "Yes, dear?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Is Mr. Weasley back with my things, yet?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m afraid not. If I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d known he wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t have been back, yet, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d not have taken your clothes."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s not your fault, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  sure the Dursleys are being stubborn about it, somehow. They\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re not exactly the nicest of people."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, Harry, I think your bathrobe is still in Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s closet from your last visit. You can wear that until Arthur gets back, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll just go ge -- Oh dear, I t
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 hink something is burning," she gasped, then Harry heard her running away from the steps.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry wrapped the towel firmly around his waste then walked swiftly back to the room he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d be sharing with Ron and pulled his robe out of Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s closet. He looked it ov
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 er and realized with a bit of sadness that he was the same size as he was on his last visit to The Burrow. At that very instant Ginny walked into the room saying something directed at Ron, who was nowhere to be seen.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The instant she spotted a shocked Harry\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
, who had on nothing but a towel, she immediately turned a red so bright she reminded Harry of a muggle stoplight. As Harry whipped the robe around and tied it about his waist, he couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t help but laugh at the horrified look on Ginny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face. She began to\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 apologize profusely while backing out of the room with Harry laughing the entire time.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny fell o\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 nto her bed as she considered that thought. The summer really was shaping up quite well, in a way. Harry had been open with her, she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d kissed him, he\hich\f0

\par }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny groaned into her pillow again, }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "This summer is going to kill me."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Not a problem, sir. You mean an electronics store?"

ll leave you to get dressed, I want to tell Molly about some of the things I saw," Mr. Weasley said, and then he was bounding down the stairs.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry chuckled at the man\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s excitement, whil\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
e he pulled out some of his clothes. He locked the door, having decided not to take a chance on Ginny walking in this time. Being seen in a towel is one thing, but he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d really rather her not see him entirely naked.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Once he was dressed Harry went downstairs\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  to find out where the twins were, but they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d already left. Harry was curious about some of the new inventions they\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 d mentioned. Mrs. Weasley informed him that they had to tend their shop in Diagon Alley, but asked her to make sure Harry stopped in on the\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 r visit today.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
They went in early to interview some new applicants, to help out Mrs. Weasley while she ran the shop during the school year. Mrs. Weasley had made it quite clear that they were going to go back to school and finish their seventh year, or she
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  would make them regret it. Harry could almost hear the twins saying, "And she could do it, too. A howler\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s got nothin\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  on mum."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I spoke to Albus and he agreed to let them retake their seventh year over, since they only quit because of that troll of a wom\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
an," said Mrs. Weasley, fuming at who he could only guess was Umbridge. "It took them a bit of convincing, but the boys knew what was best for them," said Mrs. Weasley matter-of-factly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Where is Mr. Weasley? He said he was going to tell you about some of \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 the things he saw at the electronics store."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, he had to go into the office for a few hours on urgent business, but he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 ll be back in time for your par- err\'85\loch\f0  he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll be back in time for supper, dear."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry smiled inwardly at the motherly woman\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s slip up. \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He had been prepared for the possibility of a party, but her words confirmed his belief.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hello, Harry, Mrs. Weasley," called someone from behind him. He looked around to see who it was, and was pleasantly surprised to see Hermione standing in the doorway.\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 She seemed positively apprehensive, though.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hello, Hermione. How\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve you been?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Good," she said, as if waiting for him to slap her.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Are you all right, Hermione? You look like someone\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s going to try to take your head off!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, you never wrote to me, I\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0  thought you might be mad at me about something\'85\loch\f0 " she trailed off.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Oh\'85\loch\f0  about that, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sorry. It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s been rough. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 ve not really written to anyone\'85\loch\f0 
 aside from Tonks, but she threatened me if I didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s ok, I understand," she said, but her tone made it\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  clear she wished he would open up to her. He simply didn't feel like doing that, though.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So, what have you been studying," asked Harry, jokingly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh! I picked up some new books before the summer and have been studying some new material. Very interesting\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 stuff about the different types of innate abilities certain wizards and witches could have. If you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re interested, I can let you borrow it. It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s a great --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hermione, I was joking!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh," she said, blushing furiously. "Sorry."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You two run along, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sure\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  Ron and Ginny would like to know Hermione is here, and I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ve got a few more things to do before we go to Diagon Alley," said Mrs. Weasley, going back to her chores.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry and Hermione walked upstairs to get Ginny, who was still hiding from Harry in her roo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 m. Harry bounced up the steps, and knocked on Ginny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s door. As she opened it, and saw Harry, she immediately started stammering and turned a light red, much like that of ripening strawberries.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione, not expecting this, asked her what was wrong without \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
even thinking. It was Harry who answered. "Oh, she walked in on me this morning when I was nearly naked and has been blushing about it ever since," said Harry in a way that made it seem like an every day occurrence.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As the realization of what Harry said st\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ruck her, Hermione also turned a bright shade of pink to match that Ginny had turned.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re going to blush now, too? Ginny, I think you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re catching."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s joke question only made it worse for the two girls, as they started to stammer apologies. He\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 finally gave up on his fun and asked Ginny where Ron was. She tried to explain that he was in his favorite hiding spot, but Hermione made it quite clear that she was coming with them, regardless.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry fell behind and allowed the two girls to talk, catchi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ng a giggle here or a snicker there. He was enjoying the outdoors as they walked near the lake to a small circle of bushes and trees. Harry couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t explain why, but his eyes kept being drawn to Ginny, who had obviously grown since he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d last paid much att\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ntion to her.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
Standing at about five and a half feet, her flaming red hair was laying lazily on her shoulders. She had filled out in all the right places, and Harry was definitely enjoying the view far too much, he thought, considering that she was Ron\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 s l\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ittle sister. His lack of concentration proved to be a problem when he tripped over a stump and fell directly into Ginny, landing on top of her causing Hermione to let out a startled squeal.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny, who had been blushing nearly all day, decided not to let t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
his chance pass her by. As Harry pushed up and off of her, she rolled over under him. She then gave him her most innocent expression, and asked in the most serious tone she could muster, "So, you just couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t keep your hands off me, hrm?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 It was Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
urn to blush, she thought happily, as the red flush replaced his normal color. Hermione and Ginny both began to laugh raucously. Hermione had only been teased once by him, but revenge was still sweet. Harry, decided he would at least not be the only one b
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ushing, though.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
"Well, can you blame me," he asked, eyeing her from head to toe somewhat hungrily with a grin on his face, which had the desired result. Ginny went wide-eyed, then turned a red that matched her hair. Harry was a bit surprised when Hermione 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 changed colors as well, though.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry! I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m surprised at you. Last year you couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t even talk to a girl without sounding like an idiot, and now you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
re almost a Don Juan," said Hermione, who was rather impressed, though it sounded like she was mocking him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry turned a bit of a deeper red at this, and decided to cut his game short before he said something stupid. "C\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 mon, let\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s find Ron."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 And so they continued to his secret hiding places. As they entered the clearing inside the circle of bushes and trees, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
Ron was sitting up against a tree staring dreamily at a picture. He obviously hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t heard them enter his hiding place, because he nearly jumped out of his skin when Harry spoke directly to him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hey, Ron, whatcha looking at," Harry asked, his curiosity ge\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 tting the better of him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hm? Oh, nothing," Ron replied while he quickly tried to put the picture away. He was, however, not quick enough for the reflexes of a seeker. In an instant Harry was looking at the picture Ron was just holding.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Interesting," Harr\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 y said, and then smiled wickedly. "Very interesting, indeed." Harry then handed the picture back to Ron, without another word about it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So, what was it," asked Ginny who was so curious that she was ready to try to snatch the picture herself.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "He was stari\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ng at a picture of his save at the Quidditch game, where they carried him out singing Weasley is our King. He showed it to me earlier. He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s been utterly fascinated with it ever since."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Thanks, mate," whispered Ron, as he hid the picture.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Of course."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 veryone joined Ron sitting on the ground, he asked the obvious question, "What\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s up?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, I just got here, and we came looking for you because we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re going to be going to Diagon Alley in a little while," answered Hermione.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, really? What are we going \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 there for," Ron asked, having not heard anything about Harry needing to go.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "A book," ask\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ed Hermione, her curiosity piqued by the mention of reading material. "Which one?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "}{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Laws of Ancient Wizards}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ," he replied.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sounds absobloodylutely fascinating, if you ask me," Ron said sarcastically.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry just rolled his eyes, and explained the events of \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
the last night to the group. Hermione was overtaken with an obsessive need to research this law, and started making plans to do exactly that. Ron rolled his eyes at Hermione, whom he kept glancing at every few seconds when he thought no one was looking. W
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 at most interested all of them, though, is who would notify Harry about such a loophole, and why.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry shrugged, then. "I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know, really. But, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m curious enough to find out."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It might be one of those sods at the Ministry trying to get you convicted \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 again," Ron said, trying to put forth some logic. "It wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t be the first time, don\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 t forget about Umbridge."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I agree, Harry. Be careful with this," added Hermione seriously.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Upon arriving in Diagon Alley, they all needed to go to the bank. Hermio\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ne only had muggle money with her, and Harry didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t have any money at all with him. Mrs. Weasley wanted to get some out of her vault as well, but Harry adamantly refused this idea. He explained that he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d need some help sorting out what was in his vault, a
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d that for their help he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d take care of anything they needed today, since it was, after all, his idea.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The group walked slowly down to Gringott\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s, enjoying the hustle and bustle of everyone running around getting their errands done. The chatter around them\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 was soft, and they could only pick out bits and pieces here and there.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Unicorn horns at eight galleons a piece?! They\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re mad!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What do you mean my broom wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t ready? They promised it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d be ready today!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes, well she gave her boy what for. Turned him i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 nto a ferret and bounced him off the walls like she heard happened up at Hogwarts!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t help but laugh loudly at hearing that, because they were almost absolutely sure it pertained to Draco Malfoy. When Mrs. Weasley ask\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ed what they were laughing at, Ginny explained with added comments from Ron. After they finished their story, Mrs. Weasley was wide-eyed that the professors would be allowed to do such a thing.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t worry, mum. It wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t the real Moody, it was that s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
od Bartemius Crouch junior," Ron said, earning him a very quick reprimand as well as a couple of threats involving mucking out a pig pen and the absence of a wand.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Once they reached the walls of Gringott\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s and made their way inside, Harry went to the nices\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t looking goblin he could find, which isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t saying much, where he collected the key to his new vault. He also requested the contents of his old vault be transferred into his new one.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 When they arrived at his vault, Hermione looking very green from the ride\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 , the goblin unlocked Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s vault, and allowed the small group entrance. If Harry had any notions of trying to hide the gold, they were immediately tossed out the window. His new vault was the size of an entire house and was filled with gold, silver, br\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
o\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 nze, and various treasures. All the treasure in the vault had an odd effect. It caused the small lantern they had to light up the entire room by reflecting the light all around.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione, Ron, Ginny and Mrs. Weasley stood behind him with their jaws almost \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
touching the floor. Hermione tried to say something but her stammering simply trailed off into simply opening and closing her mouth as if talking without sound, as she looked over everything in the vault.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ron said the first thing that came to mind, which f\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 or him was a bad course of action. "Bloody hell, Harry, your vault\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s as big as The Burrow!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ronald Weasley, you watch your language," Mrs. Weasley said though she didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t sound angry. She seemed more as if she agreed but was acting the parent because it wa\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
s expected.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry, however, wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t paying any attention to them. His eyes were immediately drawn to an ornate wooden pedestal, atop which was a gold and scarlet pillow surrounded by a glass dome. Various runes were carved into the pedestal\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s mahogany finis
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 h. Just above the center of the pillow was a floating, golden snitch. Harry assumed it was the one his father had in the memories he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d seen in Snape\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s pensieve. He let his hand rest on the dome, as his eyes glazed over with hot tears that began to streak \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 own his face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 It was Mrs. Weasley\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hand on his shoulder that brought him back to reality. He looked back at her, and she smiled softly at him. A pang of guilt shot through him as he looked at her. The Weasley
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s had always been great to him, but he couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 t help wondering what could have been\'85\loch\f0  if not for Voldemort.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 At precisely that moment his scar began to throb. As he hissed in pain, everyone began crowding him to see if he was all right. It was Mrs. Weasley who finally managed to get him some room to bre\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
athe. He began to rub the scar, trying to get the pain to stop, but it wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t. So he did the only thing he could think of. He fell to the floor.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione was the one to first voice their common fear, "This means You-Know-Who is near!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No," growled Harry\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 , "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s not him. It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s different this time. Something\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s calling me. It keeps telling me to touch the egg."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Everyone looked around the room for anything out of the ordinary, but no one heard anything. Again Hermione was the first to voice their concerns, "Ha\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 rry, no one is saying anything."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Shut up!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sorry," muttered Hermione as she screwed up her face sourly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Not you, this voice. It keeps telling me to touch the egg! It says there -- ARRRRGHHHHHHH," screamed Harry as pain knifed through his scar. It wa\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
s then that he realized his scar was cold. "The scar, it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s not burning. It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s freezing. So cold."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Suddenly, from Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s mouth but in an entirely different voice came what Harry had been hearing, "He must touch me, I am the egg. If he does not touch me, the\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 pain will kill him. Free me from my prison of cloth and wood, and give me to the Dragonmaster. He is near, I can feel him."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry let forth a piercing scream that filled the chamber, as Mrs. Weasley tried to comfort him. Convulsions wracked his body. "Don\loch\af0\dbch\af15\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  know\'85\loch\f0 
\hich\f0  want\'85\loch\f0 " he gasped, trying to understand. Finally the voice began to show him images of it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 prison\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 
, but each one knifed through his mind like a hot knife through butter. "Box\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  wooden\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  trimmed in gold\'85\loch\f0  has a," he trailed off and let loose yet an\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 o
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ther pain-filled scream.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
Mrs. Weasley was doing the best she could to hold herself, and the others, together. She could not bear to see this young boy in such pain. "Look for a box! See if you can find it," she shouted. As the others began to search, she s
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 tarted using a heating charm on Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s scar to see if that would lessen his pain. To her great relief, it did.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Thank\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  you," gasped Harry. "The box\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  it has\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  a jewel in it\'85\loch\f0  it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s called the Dragon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It has a solid black lock," Mrs. Weasley shouted, to make sure everyone heard. When she turned around, the goblin was still standing outside the vault, watching calmly. "Go get help," she bellowed at the tiny goblin, who bl
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 anched and disappeared, presumably to get help.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Mum, I found it," Ron shouted as he ran up. "But I couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t find a key."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As Ron got closer, Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s scar renewed its torture of him. He let out a howl of pain and nearly blacked out, before Mrs. Weasley put \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
it together and yelled for Ron to get the box away.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry, we can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t find the key. We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
re going to try to find some help, just hold on," Ginny said. She was kneeling on the opposite side of her mother trying to cradle his head as she wiped away a few tears \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 that managed to escape her eyes.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Open my prison," the voice said, again using Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s mouth.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "We can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t," said a frantic Mrs. Weasley, "there\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s no key!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Break the damned thing," Harry shouted as pain once again surged through his body.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Break it, Ron!" Mr\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s. Weasley shouted.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
But, before his mother even started to voice her command, Ron was already hurling the box at the wall with all of his might. The box slammed into the wall so hard that the box splintered, showering the room in pieces of oak. The only th
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ing unscathed was the lock and the jewel inside. The Dragon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Tear rolled out of the protective cloth, and onto the floor of the vault.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ron was dazed from the box\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s destruction. He was hit by most of the shards of wood, and had pieces of them embedded into\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 his skin. Hermione was trying to help him remove them, because Ginny had already moved to get the jewel. As Ginny tried to grab the Tear to get it to Harry she recoiled with a howl of pain, and began to sob.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Mrs. Weasley, however, was already helping Harr\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
y on his way to the transparent blue jewel lying on the floor of his vault. The closer he came, the more pain it seemed to give him, until finally he collapsed to the floor, his hand falling on the jewel. Then his mind and body exploded with pain, and he 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 lacked out.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As Harry began to regain consciousness, he could hear people speaking near him. He couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t make out the voices, though. They were muffled, like he had wax in his ears. He just continued to lie there with his eyes closed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "-- still can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 believe what he did."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I just want to know how he did it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 An itch made Harry reach up to scratch his ears, and it was then that he realized why everythin\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
g seemed muffled. He really did have wax in his ears. As he pulled out the wax, the voices came into focus. They also sounded like very calm explosions of sound.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Stop yelling," Harry said softly. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve got a terrible headache, you know."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The voices, which\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  he had identified as Mrs. Weasley, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny continued at the same volume.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Seriously, stop yelling," Harry requested again. "Head\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s killing me."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The voices still continued in that calm shout, despite his request.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Stop shouting," yelled Ha\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
rry as loud as he could manage, which almost caused him to black out from the ringing it set off in his ears. The other voices stopped, except for Mrs. Weasley telling the others to wait. As he heard the door open, Harry opened his eyes and realized he wa
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  alone in what appeared to be a hospital room.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He glanced around and noticed a couple of chairs by his bed, a nightstand-like table, and a large window with the curtains pulled tightly shut. There was also a closed door in the corner, which Harry could onl
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 y assume was the toilet. He looked up towards the door and saw a bit of red hair coming in.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry, dear, are you ok?" Mrs. Weasley shouted into the room, again setting his ears to ringing.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry put the wax back into his ears, hoping to dull the sound. "I\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  would be if everyone would stop shouting. Did the twins set this up? Sonorus Suckers, or something like that?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What are you talking about, Harry?" She was now standing beside his bed, and every word she said set off an explosion in his head. "Do you reme\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 mber what happened?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No, but could you please whisper? My ears seem to be rather sensitive at the moment."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I am whispering, dear. You don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t remember anything?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Not really. The last thing I remember was touching the egg."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, a good bit happened after\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  that, Harry. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 ll tell it to you as best as I can remember it\'85\loch\f0  not that I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d ever forget anything like what you did."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry screwed up his face in confusion as he looked at her.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "When you touched the jewel, you let out a yell that rattled the entire vault,\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  and I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m not joking about this.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Then you started to pound your fist on the ground and from what we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve been told, most of Diagon Alley thought it was an earthquake. Then you just stopped, and stood up as if everything was fine.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Imagine that," Harry said. For some reason he simply couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t muster the emotion req\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 uired to be shocked by it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Is that all you have to say about it," Mrs. Weasley asked incredulously.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "At the moment, yes." He then pulled the wax out of his ears, as he concentrated on weakening his hearing to get it to a tolerable level. He sighed content\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
edly once his hearing was at a level where he could hear without it feeling like someone just tried to drop a bomb on his eardrums.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So, am I going on trial for underage magic, again?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Mrs. Weasley stammered something about how he could hear her, but then \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 she nodded mutely. She knew that this time he didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t have a worthy defense that would protect him, because no one\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s life had been in danger.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No worries, Mrs. Weasley. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll be fine. When is the trial?"

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, good. We can be done with t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 his business today, then. I need to get to work on a lesson plan for my new students. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Mrs. Weasley became frantic at hearing this. Here was a boy under her care \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 who had nearly died, set off an earthquake in Diagon Alley with just his fists, and broken the underage magic law }{

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 She could not make Harry explain any further, though, because the aurors walked in and rushed her out, as they took him into custody for h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 At the trial, Fudge again presided over everything. Even though he was working with the Order of the Phoenix, now, he still seemed to h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ave some kind of personal grudge against Harry, for whatever reason. Harry simply smiled and sat down in the chair, and waited for his trial to begin. Dumbledore came to Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "If I may, sir, I no longer reside there," Harry interrupted. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll more than likely be moving to Potter Place when I finish my sixth year at Hogwarts. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fudge glare\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d at Harry, obviously disliking the interruption. "You mean }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 if }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

I said exactly what I meant, Cornelius."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore closed his eyes in a resigned fashion when he heard Harry refer to the Minister by his first name. To him it appeared that Harry was attempting to make things worse on himself. Luckily for him, however, h
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e did not know that Harry was trying to do exactly that.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fudge was dumbstruck for a moment, but decided to ignore it and continue with the trial. "Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Magic; Amelia Susan Bones, Head of the Department of Magic\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
al Law Enforcement; Atticus Veritas Snape, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister. Court Scribe, James Matthew Eriset." Then, remembering what happened the last time, he added, before Dumbledore could speak, "Witness for the defense, Albus Percival Wulfric
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Brian Dumbledore."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Before we continue, I would like to greet Madam Bones," Harry said, as he stood and bowed. "It is a pleasure to see you once again, my dear lady." Madam Bones smiled happily at him and Harry again took his seat.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Glaring once more at Har\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ry, Fudge pulled out the parchment containing the charges against him, and cleared his throat. "The charges against Mr. Potter are as follows," boomed Fudge. "That he did knowingly, deliberately, and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions invo
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 k\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 gality of these actions, the court submits that he has on previous occasion received warnings for similar charges, as well as being called here nearly one year ago for a disciplinary hearing.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You are Harry James Potter, of number four, Privet Drive, Littl\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e Whinging, Surrey?" Fudge asked, glaring at Harry in the same manner as he did at Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s last trial.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I believe we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve already discussed this, Cornelius. I am no longer a resident there. I already stated my new residence. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sure Mr. Eriset has it on rec
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ord if you need it repeated."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Eriset simply gaped at Harry for a moment before he went back to taking notes. He had never seen anyone show such blatant contempt for the Minister of Magic. He knew from personal experience that the Minister was a bit of a pr
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 at, so he was getting a nice chuckle out of this.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You will address your superiors properly, Mr. Potter, or you will find yourself in very deep waters."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I always address my superiors properly, Cornelius," Harry said with a smirk on his face. "Can we get o\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n with this? I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d like to finish my shopping, if it\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 s not too late, yet."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fudge\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eyes nearly popped out of his head in indignation at the implied insult in Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s proclamation. "Yes, let\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s do, Mr. Potter. I will enjoy this."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "As will I, Cornelius."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumble\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You received an official warning from the Ministry for using illegal magic four years ago, did you not?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes, I did," Harry replied pleasantly. "A very nice warning it was, too."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fudge glared again, before continuing. "You had a disciplinary hearing la\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 st year, did you not?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "And yet you invoked a healing charm not just once, but twice, today?" Fudge asked smugly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You did so knowing that those you healed were in no danger of death, did you not?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Of course."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "And you did all this knowing t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 hat you are not permitted by British Wizarding Law to use magic outside of school while you are under the age of seventeen?" Fudge asked as he smiled triumphantly.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Indeed."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Then you admit your guilt?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Absolutely not."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Good, then -- WHAT?!" shouted Fudg\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e. "You admitted to all of the charges, but still maintain that you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re innocent?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "That is correct."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "And how so," Fudge asked incredulously.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It is quite simple, Cornelius. That law does not apply to me." Harry smiled happily. "Are we done, now?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fudge be\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 gan to laugh, as did many of the others in the court. "The famous Harry Potter now believes that laws no longer apply to him! Marvelous!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Minister, if I may," Madam Bones interrupted, "he said that particular law does not apply to him."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Thank you, Madam \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
Bones, I am glad to see not everyone here is ignorant of the English language," Harry said, smiling at her, before he returned his attention to the Minister. "I never said no laws apply to me, Cornelius, I said }{\i\fs24\kerning0 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 that}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  law does not apply to me. According to t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fudge, however, knew nothing of\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 the old laws and simply believed this to be a joke, as did the rest of the court, aside from Madam Bones and Atticus Snape who were watching with obvious interest after having noticed Dumbledore\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s reaction. "That was a nice bit of fiction, Mr. Potter, bu\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  stories won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t help you," spat Fudge.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Stories," snorted Harry, "are for children. But, I suppose I will have to prove myself." As he finished his statement, Harry rose to his feet and began to utter in a language long dead as he traced an intricate patter
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  in the air in front of him with his wand.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The Minister shouted quite loudly, "How does he still have his wand?! You incompetent fools!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As Harry finished the invocation, he looked up at Fudge and stated in a clear voice, "Let those who are of age be shown\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 !" Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s voice echoed off the walls, and nothing seemed to happen, to which Fudge gave out a very snide belly laugh. Then everyone in the room began to glow softly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "If you would like to verify the purpose of the spell, you may bring in the Weasleys and \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Miss Granger. The only one of them who will glow is Mrs. Molly Weasley."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Do it," said Fudge, and a guard opened the door to usher them in. As the four entered, none of them glowed at all. Fudge laughed triumphantly, but mid-laugh, Mrs. Weasley began to gl\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ow softly.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s going on?" Mrs. Weasley asked, as she was obviously a bit confused. "Why is everyone glowing?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione, Ron, and Ginny looked as if they wanted to ask Harry what was happening, but the look on his face froze them in place. Harry was sta\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ring directly at Fudge, with no emotion visible on his face. The only trace of emotion in his whole being was in his eyes, which flickered between rage and irritation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry explained, his eyes never moving from Fudge. "It is showing who in this room is of\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  legal age to perform magic, without restriction."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "But\'85\loch\f0  but, you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re glowing too, Harry," Ron said, more of a question than a statement.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded, keeping his eyes on Fudge the whole time. "So, Cornelius, are we done now?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No," spat Fudge as his nostr\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ils flared, and his eyes flashed with anger, "We most certainly are not! You have violated British Wizarding Law! Regardless of any other laws, ancient or otherwise!"

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I take it then that you are refusing to acknowledge my status as being of legal age?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "O\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 f course I am!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
"I will give you this one warning then, Cornelius. I am of legal age. By denying my rights as laid down by the first Confederation of Wizards you are violating those rights. Should you continue to deny my rights, I will be forced to take ac

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, and what action would that be, Mr. \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Potter," Fudge asked in a snide tone of voice, ignoring Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s last statement. "Are you going to strike us down?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Of course not. I am not a murderer, Cornelius. We have Voldemort for that job, or have you forgotten so soon?" Most of the people in the ro\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 om flinched at the mention of Voldemort\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 s name. "What I will do is drain every iota of your magic permanently from your body, for my own use, turning you into a muggle. I submit to the court, \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 Those who act under false laws in an attempt to deny a wizard

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fudge had fallen back onto his bench, visibly shaken by \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
the prospect that he may lose his magic. His anger, however, outweighed his fear and he steeled himself, and gave his verdict without even asking for a vote. "I find you gu --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore leaped to his feet, about to voice his objection, but Harry was once\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  again standing. Muttering in that long dead language, his eyes locked on Fudge\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s and his wand again tracing another intricate pattern. As he approached the final verse, the fear was visible on Fudge\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face. The final verse invoked, Harry looked to all on\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 the benches, then intoned his words clearly for all to hear. "Let Fudge\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s loss be an example to all!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fudge immediately began to glow in a bright blue light that connected him to Harry. The connection remained for several minutes with no one moving, until \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
finally Fudge fell to the floor muttering about bad cheeses. Once he managed to get his bearings and get back to his feet, Fudge pulled out his wand and attempted the full body bind on Harry, who was smiling knowingly at him. Nothing happened. He tried se

\par }\pard \sb100\sa100\nowidctlpar\faauto {\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dear Reader,
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 First off, I would again like to thank all of those who have reviewed my work. I must say that I am somewhat overwhelmed by your reviews. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ve never before considered myself to be a good writer; I just write what I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d like to read. \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m glad you all enjoy it so much.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 I wanted to go ahead and post the third installment. I will, more than likely, not post any more until I can finish at least the tenth chapter. Well, unless I become impatient again, of course\'85\loch\f0 
 in which case, you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll get a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  new chapter earlier. ;)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t really have much to say here, but I want to address some issues mentioned in the reviews. Exodus5 believes that my portrayal of Harry is grossly inaccurate. I appreciate the criticism, as it does give me something to look a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
t when writing. I do, however, disagree.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Exodus5 is correct about one thing. Sirius did not consider the Weasleys as Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s family; that was his job. When he was }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 alive}{\i\fs24\kerning0 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 . Sirius knew that if he died, Harry would need a family to help him through it. The clo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 sest thing Sirius knew of was the Weasleys, and he knew they cared about him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 What about Lupin, you might say. Lupin is a werewolf who once a month turns into a mindless beast intent on killing or changing anyone he may meet, if he misses his potion. Siriu\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
s also knew that Lupin would be dealing with his death in his own way (he may have gotten a letter as well ;).
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Finally, the point about Harry not crying over a letter\'85\loch\f0  if you remember Harry did not cry }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 in front of Dumbledore}{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
. They never addressed what he d\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 id }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 alone}{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
. Harry is a tough kid, around others. When he is alone, though, that is another matter entirely. In front of Dumbledore, he didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t want to appear weak so he let his anger control him, at least in my opinion. In his room, with no one around, he had\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  no reason to stop himself from crying.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 In any case, my ramblings are through. On to the story!
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 -Master Eldryn
\par }{\fs24\kerning0 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Everyone in the chamber was openly gaping at Harry James Potter, an unassuming young man who had just done the impossible. He ripped the magic f\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
rom an adult wizard. Furthermore, he was entirely unaffected by having done so. Harry simply sat in his chair and watched with his fingers steepled in front of his face, a grim smile gracing his otherwise boyish face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Mrs. Weasley and Hermione were watchin\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
g him in absolute horror, because of two irrefutable facts. The first fact, Harry just made a muggle out of the Minister of Magic, the leader of the British Wizarding community. The second, he was openly flaunting that he could and would do it again.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Both \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ron and Ginny, who were still standing right beside Hermione and Mrs. Weasley, were performing their best impressions of a goldfish.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore, his half-moon spectacles about to fall from his long nose, was regarding the young man beside him, as if he had\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 just grown horns and caught on fire. In all his years he had never seen a lone wizard do what the man of sixteen years sitting beside him just did. Nor had he see such a drastic change in a wizard\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s behavior in a matter of hours.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sir, if you continue to \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 stare at me like that, you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ll burn a hole in the side of my head," Harry joked. The whole time, however, he never took his eyes off of Fudge, who was weeping uncontrollably. Finally his grim smile turned into a slow and good-natured grin and he called out
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 in a loud, booming voice, "Cornelius!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The room fell completely silent. No one wished to tempt the young man, who had just ripped the magic directly out of the Minister, into making him or her Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s next target. Madam Bones realized someone needed to tak\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e charge, and so she was the first to respond to the silence that had fallen over the court.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Mr. Potter, what have you done to the Minister," she asked him gently, attempting to avoid provocation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I have meted out retribution for the denial of my rights,\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  and I will continue to do so each time someone attempts to give forth a verdict of \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 guilty\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 ," Harry stated in a calm and matter-of-fact voice.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 James Eriset, the clerk, was frantically taking note of everything said. The mumbling in the room was not making\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  it easy on him, however, and he looked as if he were about to faint from the stress.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Madam Bones balked at Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s statement. "Mr. Potter, that is blackmail!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I do believe you are correct, my dear lady. But, it is effective none the less, is it not," he \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 asked while smiling pleasantly up at her.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Madam Bones, a Slytherin in her own day, could not help but smile at the devious nature of the young man sitting so confidently before her. "You have a mind befitting a Slytherin," she said admiringly. "I am impres
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 sed."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry stood and bowed to her at her obvious compliment. "Why thank you, Madam Bones. The Sorting Hat actually considered placing me there, but I requested Gryffindor."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Madam Bones grinned at the boy before her, then said loud enough for all to hear, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "All in favor of a verdict of guilty?" Harry arched an eyebrow as if daring someone\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
 anyone\'85\loch\f0  to speak. Everyone in the room stopped breathing for a moment, as they waited for someone to tempt fate. No one did.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "All in favor of a verdict of innocent, and gr\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 anting this young }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 man}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 his rights as being of legal age," she asked. Everyone in the hall, including the clerk, shouted a collective vote of yes, to which Madam Bones smiled at Harry. "I believe that your rights have been acknowledged, Mr. Potter. Congratul
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ations."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Thank you, milady," he said as he stood. "Cornelius, can I assume that if I give back your magic you will be a good little boy, and not trouble me any longer," Harry asked the weeping man, openly mocking his childish behavior.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Y-yes," the Minist\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 er sputtered between sobs as he continued to sprawl on the floor. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m so s-s-sorry. For everything!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Indeed," Harry said and proceeded to mutter in that long dead language once more, tracing figures once more in the air with his wand. As he invoked the f\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
inal verse he once again locked eyes with Fudge, and said in a ringing voice, "I grant you my forgiveness, let what was once yours be yet again."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The Minister immediately gripped his wand in a shaky hand and attempted to levitate the piece of parchment con\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
taining the charges against Harry. When nothing happened, Fudge fell to the floor wailing once again about his lost magic.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Cornelius," bellowed Harry, causing the older man to fall silent. "It will take }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 time}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  for your magic to return. I confiscated all of 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 it. With it restored you still need to rest. Within a month you should be returned to your original state."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Th-thank you, sir!" the Minister breathed ecstatically, "Thank you so much!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Cornelius, you may call me Harry," he said as he smiled pleasantly at\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 the sniveling wizard before him. "Now, if you will all excuse me, I must be going." No sooner had the last word left his mouth before Harry blacked out once more for the second time that day.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 When Harry finally awoke he was in his bed in The Burrow.\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 Sitting beside him in an uncomfortable looking wooden chair, holding his hand no less, was Ginny. Her head was lying on the bed beside his stomach, where she was sleeping rather uncomfortably, Harry thought. As he gazed at her she whimpered slightly, and
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 the corners of his lips twitched into a smile.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hello," he said while lightly caressing her face. "Wake up."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 She shifted uncomfortably and tightened her grip on his hand. "No, Tom, I won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t do it," she cried out, and the smile forming on his face quickly va\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
nished. Harry realized she was having a nightmare and he gently shook her awake. She groaned at him to let her alone before blearily opening her eyes. When she finally saw him, she smiled softly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hello, there," he said, again, as the veil of sleep retreat\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ed from her mind. "What\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s going on?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 She yawned then and muttered a sleep-filled good morning. When she noticed she had been gripping his hand, she quickly let it go and began apologizing to him. The red flush she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d been sporting since he came to The Burro\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 w sneaked its way back onto her face, and Harry again found a smile twitching onto his face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hey," Harry exclaimed in mock indignation. "Either you give that back," he said motioning towards her hand, "or we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll see just how many shades of red you have in \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 you."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny groaned inwardly. He couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t have any idea what he was doing to her, she thought. She couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t have been more wrong, though. He knew exactly what he was doing to her. Reluctantly, yet not unwillingly, she took his hand back into hers, fearing \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 he would do exactly as he had threatened.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "That\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s better. Now, could you explain just how you came to be by my side, holding my hand," he asked of her. Trying to ignore that she was holding the hand of the boy she had been crushing on since before her firs\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
t year at Hogwarts began, she gave him the most straightforward answer she could.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You asked me to."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I see," he said, his emotions unreadable. "Would you explain to me exactly what happened after I said I had to leave?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 She looked puzzled by his request, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
but answered his question to the best of her ability. "Well, after you said you had to go, you looked directly at me with glowing blue eyes and asked me to stay with you until you woke up. Then you fell to the floor, and mum almost went to pieces.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Profess\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 or Dumbledore checked you over and said that you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d be fine. Then he told mum that we should get you home where you could rest on something more comfortable than the hard floor of a courtroom.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So, we brought you home and put you in the bed," she finished, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 looking at him to see if her explanation was suitable.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I see," he said again, no hint of emotion in his voice. "Interesting. And you did as I asked?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "That she did, Harry. She has been with you for the past two days, much to her mother\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s dismay," the soft\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 voice of Professor Dumbledore stated, a twinkle in his eye. "I see you are yourself, again."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What do you mean, sir," Harry asked, the puzzled look on his face matching that of Ginny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It was not you, per se, that was at your hearing, young Harry. As I \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 told you just a short time ago, your actions are to me an open book. Whoever was at that trial was not you."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny looked between the two, her confusion written on her face. "It was Harry, I saw him!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It looked like him, Miss Weasley, and it was his body.\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  But his mind was not his own," Dumbledore said in his calm and collected voice.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I believe I can explain that," said an ethereal voice from within Harry, who looked utterly startled that he was speaking. "I am preparing my master for what is to come. What\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 you saw was in truth him, but without restraint.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What he does in that state is what he most desires. It is a side-affect of his limited exposure to what you call the Dragon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Tear."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Both Dumbledore and Ginny listened intently, the latter of the two not r\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 eally comprehending what she was hearing.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "When he came into contact with me for the first time, my master gleaned only that which he wanted to know most. What Master wanted to know most was how to heal his brother and his mate," it said.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eyes near\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ly leaped out of her head when she heard this, as this she understood perfectly. The red flush that had just started to fade from her face came back in full force and threatened to make her glow. Her mind began to race endlessly through scenarios she
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d on\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 y dreamed of.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore, however, was not nearly as surprised. There was a twitch of a smile on his face, and then it was gone, and he resumed waiting patiently for whatever was speaking through Harry to continue.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "He also wanted to know the ancient law, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
how to verify it, and how to enforce it. Once he had these things, he separated his contact with me, before I could finish giving him his gift. I have never gifted a human before, and so I was unprepared for this possibility. Until the transfer is complet
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d, he will continue to act without restraint and without much control."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I see. What is this gift you mentioned," Dumbledore asked of the voice.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "His gift is that of his station\'85\loch\f0  knowledge and power," the voice said as if it were the most obvious thing in \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 the world.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 In Dumbledore\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s long life he had seen so much that he had come to believe that he could no longer be surprised by anything that happened. The young man before him was proving how utterly and incomprehensibly false that belief truly was.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny, t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 hough still sitting with them, clutching Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hand, had heard nothing after the she had been called Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s mate. }{\i\fs24\kerning0 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ohmigod, ohmigod, ohmigod!"}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  kept running through her mind at a frantic pace.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "My master must complete the transfer by midnight before the \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 fire rises in the sky once again, or he shall forfeit his gift," the voice added.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m afraid that may be the course of action we decide to take. Young Harry is in no position to make such a decision for himself," Dumbledore stated decisively, "if he is in\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
deed acting without constraint."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "That is most unfortunate, Master\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s grandfather. Master will receive his death by the next rise of the fire in the sky, if the transfer is not completed. It is quite clear in Master\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 s mind that he would like a modest ceremo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ny consisting of those closest to him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "His decline will be most painful, and I would dislike that very much. My intention was not to cause him pain. Please try to make him as comfortable as possible," it said, sadly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The word \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 death\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  hit Ginny like a punc\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
h to the stomach. She looked up at Harry, whose eyes had rolled back in his head, and gasped. "No," she shouted, "He can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t die! I won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t let him!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore, now scowling quite visibly, stroked his index finger and thumb over his white beard before speakin\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
g. "I quite agree, Miss Weasley. I will personally see if an alternative can be found. We know nothing about this Dragon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Tear, or the dangers it may pose.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I will retrieve the Dragon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Tear from his vault, immediately. If I can find no further informatio\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
n before eleven, we will simply have to take our chances with letting him receive his \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 gift\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ," Dumbledore said as he rose to his feet and proceeded out the door.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t touch it," Ginny managed to say through the lump that had risen into her throat. "It ha\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s some kind of protective magic. It burned me. Don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t touch it," she reiterated and Dumbledore nodded to her.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Goodbye, Dragonmaster\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s grandfather," the voice said to Dumbledore. "My master must rest now." With that proclamation, Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s head fell back to h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
is pillow and he once lost consciousness.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny began weeping at the thought of losing Harry, and she clutched his hand even tighter. She just had, moments before, the hope of him finally recognizing that she was more than just a girl who had a crush on hi
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 m, more than just her brother\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s little sister. Now she was facing the possibility that she might lose him forever, without ever actually telling him how she felt about him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore laid a comforting hand on her shoulder, which caused her to weep even ha\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 rder. He squeezed her shoulder slightly, then turned and left quickly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The next several hours passed in a haze. Ginny remembered something about her mother trying to get her to eat. Harry was in an out of consciousness most of the day, more often out\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 than in. As the time approached closer to half of eleven, she began to worry that Dumbledore wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t arrive in time until finally he stepped quietly into the room. Ginny was almost ecstatic, until she noticed that Dumbledore was empty-handed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Did you fi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 nd anything," she asked hurriedly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I am afraid not. There are no records that I can find of anything called the Dragon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Tear," he said quietly, his tiredness etched into his normally jovial face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re not just going to let him die," she screamed at th\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e older man, her frustration and panic releasing itself in the form of anger. "You can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t!"

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Calm yourself, Miss Weasley. You are quite right. I can not allow harm to come to Harry while I have an option available to me, no matter how untested that option m\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ay be. I left the jewel with your mother, would you kindly go and retrieve it, Miss Weasley?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny gave him a relieved, grateful look, then ran out of the room. As soon as she was gone, Dumbledore had a seat by Harry and gave him an appraising once over.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hello, Master\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s grandfather. I am glad to see that you have reconsidered. I have waited many years for Master. We have bonded, and I would not like to lose him, now. He has had much hardship in his life, and I do not wish to cause him more."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore si\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 mply looked at Harry. Harry was not looking well. Since Dumbledore had left earlier, dark circles appeared under Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s eyes. He was sweating profusely, and he was as pale as Nearly Headless Nick. He was apparently freezing, as well; his body being wrack\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d by shivers though he was covered in three duvets.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "How long will it be, before Harry is as we knew him," the old man asked, his voice very weary.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Master will never be as you once knew. Master will have his gift. He can never be what he once was."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I see\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 . Will he still be Harry?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I can not know that. I have never shared my gift with a human or with someone so close to adulthood. Every bond before has always been with a newborn. He will be who he will be, that is all I can promise."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore shook his h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ead slightly, finally understanding. The Dragon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s Tear was giving Harry knowledge and power no human ever had. How that might affect him, no one could even begin to fathom.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny came running into the room, with the jewel tightly wrapped in a new cloth. Sh\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e handed it to Dumbledore, and was about to return to Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s side. "Miss Weasley, it would be safer if you would wait outside."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No," she shouted adamantly. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m not leaving him until he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s better. He asked me to stay, and I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m going to!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore frowned\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  at her, then nodded, and then turned to Ginny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s mother, who was now standing in the doorway, worry etched into her tired face. "Molly, it would be best if everyone waited outside. I have no way to determine how dangerous this will be. I would move Harry \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 o
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 utside, however in his current condition I fear that would not be safe."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Mrs. Weasley nodded her head and went to get everyone out of the house, after trying once more to convince Ginny to come with her. Ginny, of course, adamantly refused to leave Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  side. Once Dumbledore saw that everyone was outside and safe, he again sat by Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s side.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What must be done?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Lay me by Master\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s side. Remove the spell holding the cloth, and then step away. I will take care of the rest. Fear not, Master\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s grandfather\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
. Master care\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s much for both of you, and will not allow harm to come to you," the disconnected voice said from Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s lips.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore did as the voice said, and pulled a reluctant Ginny, to one side of the room. Slowly Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hand lifted from the bed, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 and laid itself onto the Dragon\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 s Tear. Immediately his eyes flew open, his backed arched at an almost impossible angle, and he began to howl in pain. His eyes weren\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t the green jewels that Ginny so admired, any longer. They were cobalt blue orbs, lacking\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
any whites at all. A blue light was coming out of his eyes, illuminating the entire room as the unearthly howl filled her ears.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny buried her face into Dumbledore\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s robes, unable to watch Harry in so much pain. She began to weep and Dumbledore wrapped h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
is arms protectively around her, allowing her to do just that. He, however, kept his eyes fixed on Harry for any sign of danger, consciously ignoring the pain the young man before him was obviously experiencing in great quantities.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 After nearly ten minutes\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 of Harry howling, the air around him began to crackle with raw magical power. Approaching fifteen minutes, arcs of magical lightning, in a swirl of blue, black, and white, began to bounce around the room. Each time one came near Dumbledore and Ginny it s
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 emed to hit an invisible barrier and moved on. This continued for what seemed like eternity with Harry screaming the entire time.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Several times Ginny tried to break away from Dumbledore and go to Harry, but Dumbledore held her tightly. She kept screaming a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
t him to help Harry, but he never did. What she did not know was that he wished he could. He would have given anything, even his own life, to take this pain from Harry, but it would do no good. Dumbledore simply stood strong, and waited.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 After almost an ho\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ur, the lightning weakened. Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s screaming had stopped what seemed like hours ago; his voice had completely given out. It was then that Dumbledore felt a familiar tingle. Harry was drawing all the surrounding magic into himself. Realizing, having seen \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 omething very similar once before in his life, what was about to occur, Dumbledore whipped out his wand and threw up the strongest shield he could manage.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Then Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s body exploded, and The Burrow was destroyed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Nearly an hour passed before the ligh\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t from Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s explosion died down enough that, from inside the shield, Dumbledore could see what was happening. Shards of wood, metal, paper, and the Weasley\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s belongings were being scattered in a torrential downpour of magical energy. Dumbledore was una\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 le to mourn the loss of the young man he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d grown to love, as it required every bit of concentration he had to maintain the shield around them.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny, who had earlier fallen to the bottom of the bubble-like shield screaming to be let out had mercifully fain\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ted less than twenty minutes after it happened. Dumbledore looked at her and realized, with a pang of regret, that she was now in a nightmare-filled sleep, more than likely replaying what she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d seen nearly an hour before.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore slowly collapsed to his\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 knees, as he drained every ounce of magic he had into his shield. It took every iota of power he could draw on to maintain it against the fury of the magical explosion once known as Harry James Potter. Once he had no energy left, Dumbledore\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 s shield fell\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ,\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  as did he. The debris, however, continued to be thrown around them as if hitting a solid wall. Then, just as suddenly as the storm had begun, it ended.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Floating several feet above the ground was a man glowing in the same blue that had been emitted from Ha\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
rry earlier. His hair standing in the air, much like it would if hanging upside down, was a tall, muscular man, his arms raised toward them. Slowly they floated to the ground outside the remains of The Burrow. As Dumbledore was about to lose consciousness
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 the figure raised his hand and a line of blue light connected them. Mere moments later Dumbledore was completely refreshed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny slowly regained consciousness, looking around immediately for Harry. She, however, could not find him. Then she remembered the\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 explosion and she began to sob uncontrollably, pounding her fist into the ground under her knees.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The rest of the Weasley family looked as if they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d just been struck by lightning. Their home was just destroyed, Harry was nowhere to be seen, and there was \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
a glowing naked man floating around over the remains of The Burrow. The figure looked at them and smiled at them happily, each of them looking to the other in complete and utter confusion. As he saw this he began to laugh uncontrollably.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny was the firs\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
t to react to his laughing. She leaped to her feet and stormed over the remains and tackled the floating man. She began to pound against his chest, slamming her fists against him in a fury. The man, however, did not fight back. He simply lay on the ground
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 where she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d knocked him, and waited until she wore herself out. Slowly her blows weakened, and she stopped hitting him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Once she stopped he looked up at her and asked in a gratingly calm voice, "Are you done, now?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 This was the wrong thing to say to her, t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 he man realized, because she renewed her assault. All the while she was yelling, "Why\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d you kill Harry?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 When she had again tired herself out, he looked at her and smiled softly. He reached up, and using his thumb, he pushed away the tears that were strea\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 king her face. "Ginny, I\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 m right here," the man said to her, as if that was supposed to make her understand.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m not blind," she screamed at the man laying on the ground under her. "Why\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d you kill Harry?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The man under her, in response to her shouts, slo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
wly began to change. His hair remained the same but he became shorter, and his face took on a more boyish appearance. The last to change were his eyes, which changed from the solid blue orbs into the emerald green that she so admired and recognized so wel
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 . Finally, he resembled the boy she knew as Harry Potter.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny, happy beyond words that he was alive, just grabbed him and pulled him into a bone-crushing hug. Harry returned her hug, then smiled and asked, "Now, would you mind getting off of me?" As an a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
fterthought he added, "Not that I mind, but I am quite naked, and I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t think your family would approve."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny, realizing that Harry was right, immediately turned the color of fresh raspberries, jumped off of him and ran towards the lake. Harry started \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
to call after her, but decided he would need to explain what was going on to the rest of the Weasleys, first. As he stood, he tried to collect his thoughts.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry dusted himself off, then, completely ignoring the shocked looks from the entire Weasley famil\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
y. Dumbledore, however, seemed extremely amused as well as happy to see Harry alive and well. As Harry looked down over his naked body, he decided the first thing he needed was some clothes.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Walking quickly over to Dumbledore, Harry asked in a calm voice, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sir, if you wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t mind, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 m a bit tired\'85\loch\f0 
 could you whip me up some clothes, please?" Dumbledore nodded, and a moment later he handed Harry some underclothes, a pair of black trousers, and a black T-shirt to which Harry smiled, and began putting them o\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 , while adding to everyone around that he was sure they would like an explanation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, that explosion was the egg," he held up the Dragon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Tear, which was considerably smaller than before, "doing what it needed to save my life. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m quite sorry about Th
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e Burrow, by the way." The Weasleys just stood there gaping at Harry, as he continued. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll be happy to answer the rest of your questions later, but for now I think we all need a good night\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 s rest. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m going to try to calm down Ginny. When we return, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  have you as my guests until The Burrow can be rebuilt.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Now, if you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll excuse me, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ll be right back," and Harry strode off toward the lake, where Ginny had ran off just a few moments earlier, leaving behind eight bemused Weasleys and one slightly amused \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hogwarts Headmaster.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As Harry approached he could see Ginny was wading in the lake, splashing about madly and raving about how much of an \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 inconsiderate prat Harry Potter\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 was. He could not help but smile at this, as she was entirely soaked, her red \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 hair whipping about in the moonlight. A small group of birds were giving out an indignant twitter at having been disturbed so late in the night.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t believe he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d do that! He went and blew up the house, blew up }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 himself}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
, made me worry about him, tricks \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
me into attacking him, and then embarrasses me in front of my entire family by being naked," she shouted. She had obviously not seen him approach, and sit down by the edge of the lake, pulling his knees up and resting his arms on them.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Are you about done,\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  yet," he asked in an amused tone, shocking her out of her tantrum.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No," she bellowed at him, stalking towards him with angry intent written on her face, her fists clenched so tight her knuckles were white. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m going to hurt you until I feel better!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  I come out of this safe, and you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re mad at me for it," he asked, again doing his best impression of a puppy dog. "And here I thought you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d be happy."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 She was taken aback only for an instant before she growled at him, then huffily sat down beside him. "You\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  scared me, you know," she told him, as if far away.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I know, and I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sorry."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I was really worried."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I know, and I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sorry."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Then you embarrassed me."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 At this he grinned and said, "It was fun, too." He smiled as he pulled her head into his shoulder. "Do\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t you agree?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No," she muttered under her breath. She then looked at him and appraised him. "You seem different."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 am}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  different. Knowing what I know, now, would make anyone act differently. It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s odd, you know\'85
\loch\f0 " He frowned as he stared off over the lak\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e. "A week ago, I was a fifteen year old boy who was worried about how to deal with the guilt of getting his godfather killed and an annoying family. Now, I\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 m a sixteen year old man who knows more than he ever wanted to."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What do you mean," Ginny asked, l\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ooking up at him as if for the first time. }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I know he looks the same, but he seems older somehow," }{\fs24\kerning0 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 she thought to herself.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s not important, right now. Tonight, we all need some rest. Come on, milady," he said, as he stood and reached out for her hand w\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ith a flourished bow. "I believe we should get back. After that earlier scene, they might start to worry about your purity." He grinned, as she again turned red.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Stop that," she chided.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Your wish is my command, milady."
\par }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "If only,"}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  she thought to herself.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 They returned to the others in silence. Mr. Weasley was attempting to console Mrs. Weasley who was visibly shaken by the ordeal they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d witnessed. Their home of many years was nothing more than a pile of debris, now. The twins were in awe, trying to figure\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 out how to recreate such a storm, while Bill and Charlie were attempting valiantly to find out any information they could from Dumbledore, who was patiently explaining that he knew about as much as they did.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As they noticed Harry come into view, Mrs. Weas\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ley bolted away from Mr. Weasley and pulled him up into a rough embrace, crying the entire time. Harry just smiled and returned her hug, all the while whispering assurances that everything would be fine. As she started to calm down, Harry gave her an assu
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ing squeeze of a hug and turned her back to Mr. Weasley who gave Harry a grateful look for helping to calm her down.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "As I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sure you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll all want an explanation, we will wait until tomorrow when Hermione and the rest of the Order can be there as well. I wo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
uld prefer not to explain this more than once, you see."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Everyone nodded, however reluctantly. It was Bill who finally broke the silence that had come over them as soon as Harry and Ginny had returned. "Where exactly is \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 there\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
," he asked.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "My family home,\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  of course. Potter Place."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I thought your family home was Godric\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Hollow," Charlie said.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 It was Dumbledore who answered this question for Harry, "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m afraid not, Charles. Godric\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Hollow is actually my own family home. As I was at Hogwarts most of the ye
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ar, I felt it would be the safest place for Harry and his parents. I am sad to say I was mistaken."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Wait, Godric\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s Hollow\'85\loch\f0  are you descended from Godric Gryffindor," Ron asked in awe.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore smiled at the inquisitiveness of the young man before him, t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 hen said, "That I am, Ronald."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, this is all very exciting, but I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m quite tired. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m sure the rest of you are as well. So, I think we should be going now. Sir, could you possibly provide us with a makeshift floo," Harry asked, addressing Dumbledore.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 D\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 umbledore nodded. He pulled out his wand and made a cross shape in the air, before intoning clearly, "}{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Eriflacep}{\fs24\kerning0 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 !" The fireplace inside the remains of The Burrow reformed, immediately. He pulled a small jar of floo powder from inside his robes, and slowly e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ach of them took enough for a trip.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry was the first to step in. He smiled and then called out clearly for them all to hear, "Potter Place!" He was immediately lifted up and on his way to his family home, for the first time in his life, that he could re
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 member.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Once everyone had arrived to find Harry sitting happily inside a large kitchen, Harry walked quickly over to a bell-pull, and gave it a sharp tug. Everyone looked around the kitchen silently, taking in what they saw.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry returned to sitting\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 at a large table, surrounded with simple wooden chairs. Off to one side was a long counter with various knives and cutting boards. Behind Harry was a sink with two compartments, where a brush was happily scrubbing away at a few plates and glasses, while 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 umming an off-key tune.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
Lining the walls were shelves loaded with pans and pots, and just above them were cabinets with open glass windows, full of plates, glasses, bowls, and the like. Under the counter were several drawers where they could only guess the
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 y utensils were stored.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 After about five minutes of complete silence, a tall, slender man strode swiftly into the kitchen with a look of shock plastered on his handsome face. The man immediately greeted Dumbledore.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Salutations, sir. It is excellent to see\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  you again after these many long years," the man said, his hands held behind his back.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Salutations, Connor," Dumbledore said, nodding his head to the man in greeting.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Everyone else, aside from Harry, was simply too caught up in gaping at the man known sim\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ply as Connor to do or say anything. The young man stood before them in a forest green tunic, loose black trousers, and forest green, dragon-hide boots. That, however, wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t what was so unusual about him\'85\loch\f0 
 the young man before them had long, shining, silv\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
r hair that complimented his pale skin quite well. As he turned to face the group standing in the kitchen, he pushed the hair on one side of his head behind his ear. As he did so, everyone in the room, again aside from Harry and Dumbledore, gasped. His ea
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s were quite pointed, or at least the one they could see was.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Smiling happily, he looked over the group before him with a pair of shocking emerald eyes that fit in with his softly masculine features too well for words to describe. As he finally laid eyes o\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
n Harry, his extremely white smile grew quite large, and he immediately pulled Harry into a rough hug. "It is good to see you again, young Master Potter!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 After the embrace was broken, Harry smiled warmly at the young man before him. "Salutations, Master K\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
eltori. It is nice to meet you, as well," Harry said to the young man before him, leaving everyone in the room stunned. The young man before them blushed a moment, before regaining his composure. "Please, forgive my manners, young sir. It has been so long
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 since I have seen you I simply forgot myself. Salutations, Master Potter."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Please, call me Harry," he said and the man nodded his head to Harry.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You know him, Harry," Ron whispered, to which Harry just nodded.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I suppose greetings are in order. I would l\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ike to introduce you all to Master Connor Keltori. He is the groundskeeper of Potter Place, and a close family friend," Harry said, addressing the Weasleys. He then turned to Master Keltori, and introduced the Weasleys to Master Keltori.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Please, call me C\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 onnor. My people are staunch on formality, however I am not as rigid as they," he said to the group before him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So then, you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 re not human," Fred\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  or maybe it was George\'85\loch\f0  asked, to which Mrs. Weasley immediately screeched at him to mind his manners.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It is\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0  quite alright, madam. I do not mind," he said, flashing Mrs. Weasley a big toothy smile. He then turned to George\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  or maybe it was Fred\'85\loch\f0 
 and addressed his question. "No, I am of elven blood, young sir."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Elven," the other twin asked, "But, you don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t look \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 anything like a house elf!" As soon as he finished, Mrs. Weasley screeched then at him about his manners.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Master Keltori flashed her another smile, and she seemed to calm down instantly. "Indeed, young sir. House elves are a relation of true elves, but the\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 y\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
re not full-blooded elves. Most of wizarding kind seems to have forgotten about true elves. House elves are actually a separate breed of elves that mated with goblins," he said, shaking his head, "if you can believe that, young sirs.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m not a purist by\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 any means, but I have no great like of goblins. Had a fairly nasty run in with them about thirty years ago. They tried to cheat me out of some gold, you see, and I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve never gotten along with them very well, since."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Thirty years," gasped Ginny. "How old a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 re you?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ginny Weasley! I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m so sorry, Master Kel --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Please, call me Connor, madam, and it is quite alright. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve been dealing with children for centuries, and their questions never change," he said flashing that placating smile once again. "To answer y
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 our question, young miss, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll be one thousand five hundred seven years old this September."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eyes grew as wide as saucers, at hearing this. The rest of the group was shocked silent, aside from Fred and George who were whispering something back and \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
forth, between them. Harry was simply sitting on the kitchen table with his feet propped up on one of the chairs, watching with glee.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Indeed I have, young sirs," Master Keltori said, addressing the twins. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d be happy to tell you all about them, once we \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
have some time." Fred and George looked up at the elven man in shock. "Elves have very good hearing, young sirs," he said with a grin as he pointed at his pointed ears.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll need to be careful with those two, Connor, or they might even run }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 you}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  ragged,"

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I see you picked up some of your father\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s bad habits, Master Potter. He used to try to drive me mad by sitting on the table as well," the elven man said.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Please, call me Harry, Connor, and yes, I may have picked up a few of the\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 m somewhere down the road. I have a few things we need to discuss, and as it involves my guests they might as well hear it."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Master Keltori nodded his head, and waited patiently as Harry began to explain.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "The Weasleys and I will be staying here indefinite\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ly. About half of us will be leaving for Hogwarts on the first of September. In case you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re curious as to why they\hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Please get them all situated, as each will need a room, for the time being. The twins\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  will more than likely wish to stay together, so if you could give them Eliza and Elicia\hich\f0 \rquote

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Everyone in the room, including Master Keltori and Dumbledore, were staring at him in s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 tunned silence. For all they knew, he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I will indeed have their supplies lists delivered here. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  sure the owls will be most grateful for a shorter trip," Dumbledore said.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Master Keltori bowed to Harry, and smiled happily. "It will be marvelous to have a family within these walls once more," he said excitedly, "It will be as you request. I will have t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore nodded his understanding and prepared to leave. "I am afraid I must be going\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
. It is quite late, and I have many preparations left before the beginning of the first term. If you will excuse me," he said, and moved toward the fireplace.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The others, who had already seated themselves at the table chattering excitedly, did not notice a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore regarded Harry for a moment, taking note of the flash of anger in his eyes, before he nodded. "When," was\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  his monosyllabic response.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know just yet," he growled. "But, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m going to tell them the truth. They\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve treated me like family, and they deserve to know. }{

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 When Bill woke up in the morning, he found his\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 clothes freshly cleaned and pressed lying neatly over a chair facing his bed. He got up, and quickly stepped into his private bath to take a shower. He made sure to wake up Charlie first, though, as they were going to get to know their \hich\f0 \lquote 
\loch\f0 littlest brother\hich\f0 \rquote \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 today. Once both were dressed they headed down the mahogany stairs.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 They managed to get a bit lost, but were directed by one of the paintings, of Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s father, no less, to the main dining area. James explained how to get there and told them that is where
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  Harry was, with Master Keltori.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 They both arrived in the large, elegant dining room to find Harry sitting with Master Keltori, laughing quite happily. As they approached, Master Keltori stood and bowed to them. "Good morning, sirs. Would you like some bre
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 akfast? I make a smashing blueberry and ice cream pancake, if I do say so myself," the elven man added.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "He does, indeed," Harry chimed in, a smile of satisfaction plastered on his face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sounds great," Bill said, smiling.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll try anything once," agreed \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Charlie.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
Master Keltori left quickly for the kitchen, to prepare the breakfasts, while Bill and Charlie seated themselves at the enormous table. Moments later a house elf appeared carrying a silver tray holding utensils, a bottle of milk, a pot of coffee, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a carafe of orange juice, cream and sugar, and mugs for Bill and Charlie. The house elf placed the tray in the center of the table before asking if they needed anything.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No, Loretta, I do believe that will be fine. Thank you," Harry replied warmly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sir i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s too kind," the house elf replied, positively beaming as she left.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It almost seems like you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve been here for years, Harry," Bill said, grabbing a mug and pouring some coffee into it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yeah, a bit creepy, really," agreed Charlie as he did the same, but ad\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ding a bit of sugar to his.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry chuckled, then promised to explain once everyone else had arrived. He continued to drink his apple juice, while grimacing at the coffee the two eldest Weasley children were consuming. Coffee reminded him too much of his 
\hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ncle\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  Vernon who always had a cup first thing in the morning, complaining that he couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t think clearly otherwise.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Charlie noticed his grimace and asked, "Coffee not your thing, eh?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry just shook his head, as he took another sip of his apple juice.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "H\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
is father had a particular distaste for it as well," Master Keltori said as he returned with two plates, stacked high with hot, blueberry pancakes topped with ice cream that was already starting to melt. "His mother, however, loved it. She always added Ir
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 sh cream and a bit of hazel nut, though."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Actually, we just met his father. Well, the painting of him, anyway," Bill said. "As first I thought it was Harry, but then I noticed the eyes. Harry looks almost exactly like him."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Master Keltori nodded. "That is\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  how I recognized him when you first arrived. It was quite a shock, really. But, please, eat before it melts," he smiled.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Both of the brothers began to eat, Charlie stopping after the first bite to give Master Keltori a thumbs up, before adding, "These are\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  great!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 While the others ate, Master Keltori and Harry continued their conversation. Harry didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t want to disturb the two who had not eaten since the previous afternoon, having to go on a mission for the Order.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve been here for the last fifteen ye\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ars, with just you and the house elves," Harry asked in a surprised tone.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Indeed I have. It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s not as bad as you might think. The house elves kept me company, as did the paintings. I must say, though, it is good to finally have a family in the house again.
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  Since your father and mother have been," he trailed off a moment, a catch in his throat. "Since they have been gone, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve not had to order repairs to the house, and it just seems so bizarre."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry let out a loud laugh at this. "I can see how that might b\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 e the case\'85\loch\f0  how has the house vault held up over the years?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "The interest accrued is still much higher than any expenses, especially with the house having been more or less empty for the last half-again decade. The balance at last check was approximately \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
forty million galleons, give or take a million or so."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hearing this Bill and Charlie both began to choke on their breakfast. Master Keltori, noticing the problem, waved his glowing hands over their throats causing their throats to relax. Finally able to br
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 eathe again, Charlie and Bill looked up at Harry with wide eyes.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry, you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re a bloody millionaire," Charlie said in awe as Bill began to laugh.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Actually, that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s the house account. My personal allowance isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t nearly that much," Harry said. "Not that I c\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ould ever use it all anyway."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Bill, having moved beyond the issue of the money, was now addressing Master Keltori, "By the way, Master Kel --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Call me Connor," he interrupted. "Master Keltori just seems so\'85\loch\f0  rigid."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ok, Mas -- Connor. I noticed you used m\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 agic a moment ago, without a wand. How?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Connor chuckled at that, "Well, there are many types and ways of using magic. Magic, technically, is just power. Anything with a connection to magic can use it, really."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So you mean that what we do using a wand is \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 just tapping into the same thing you tapped into when you cleared our throats," Bill asked, becoming thoroughly interested in this conversation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Exactly, young sir, exactly," he said.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So even muggles could do magic," Charlie asked doubtfully, not sure he\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  could believe such a thing.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Some of the greatest wizards and witches in history started their lives as muggles, young sir. They simply learned how to do what non-muggles could innately do, which is to tap that power. Most of the teachings of it were lost
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  around a thousand years ago." Connor then added, "Shortly after, Merlin decided that most humans were too stupid to have magic, as a matter of fact."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You knew Merlin," Charlie and Bill asked in unison. "That\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s so cool!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So, wait, there were muggle witch\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 es and wizards? Freaky," Bill said. "I just don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t think I can believe that."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh there still are, young sir. Just not to the degree they once were. During the last year James and Lily stayed here, I spent a bit of time in the muggle world. I had to change \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
my hair color, but otherwise I looked more or less human. During my time there, I read up on what they now call \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 magic.\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s not even close to what it used to be, but they
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re starting to put it back together," he said, smiling. "I would guess that within\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
the next millennium, muggles will rediscover what they once knew and re-insert themselves into the world of magic.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It is one of the reasons all of elven-kind scoff at the idea that there is such a thing as a pureblood wizard or witch. What most humans hav\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
e failed to realize is that non-muggles can simply tap into magic as an instinct. Muggles have to learn it, but they can do it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "And I almost hope Voldemort does achieve immortality, just so I can laugh in his face when he finally realizes how futile his a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ctions have truly been," Connor added with a grim chuckle, as Bill and Charlie flinched involuntarily at the mention of Voldemort\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s name.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry, who had remained quiet throughout the conversation, laughed quite hard at that sentiment, before addressing an \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 issue he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d been thinking about all morning. "Connor, is the Quidditch pitch still in good shape?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Of course, Harry, it has been kept in prime condition. Would you like to examine it?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Not quite yet. We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll all need replacement brooms, first. I managed to \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
annihilate ours in the mayhem at The Burrow. Would you like to run some errands, Connor? I think it would do you some good to get out and see the world, again."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Connor smiled happily at this, and said in an excited voice, "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d love to."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Excellent. We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll n\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
eed one broom for each of us, as well as one for Hermione who will be arriving later. If you would, please test them out, and pick that which you believe is best over all. I trust your judgment," Harry said to the immediate protests of Bill and Charlie.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "L\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 isten, Harry, we don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t really need new brooms," exclaimed Charlie.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Of course we don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t," Bill added.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I insist. I want a good game of Quidditch to get in shape for the new season, and for that we need brooms," he chuckled happily.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Is there anything else y\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ou\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll need, sir," Connor asked, as he rose.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Actually, yes. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d like for you to have the brooms delivered, and take the rest of the day for yourself. Bill anything you need to the house account, and enjoy yourself. Take as long as you\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 d like. After fifteen\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  years, you deserve a vacation."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Connor frowned a bit at the word \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 vacation\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 , then nodded. "Anything else sir?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry thought about it a moment, then added, "Actually, yes. I would like for all the house elves to be given proper clothes."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 A mortified look \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 appeared on Connor\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face upon hearing this. "My word, sir. You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re freeing them? What did they do to upset you? I\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 m sure it can be corrected, just tell me what it is and I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll take care of it," he said, speaking very quickly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You misunderstand, Connor. Dur\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ing my second year at Hogwarts my life was saved by a house elf with very good intentions. He again helped me in my fourth year. The house elves are technically in my service. Until they learn that freedom is not a punishment I would never dream of freein
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  them.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Since you will be the one giving them clothes, they will all be kept in service here\'85\loch\f0 
 if they wish to stay, of course. I am not sending them away, Connor. I am rewarding them for their loyalty to my family. I want them to be given a uniform and clo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
thes of their own. I also want them to be given a fair wage, as set by the elf who saved my life\'85\loch\f0  one gold galleon per week."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I see, Harry. I apologize," Connor said, a smile on his face. "You are indeed as great a wizard as your parents. They were one of\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 few families who did not force the house elves to work unnoticed. Most wizards look down upon house elves. I am pleased to see that you are willing to treat them with respect as your parents did."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry smiled, and then said, "You may take them in rotatin\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
g shifts, using his or her off time to get their clothes, which I want charged to the house account. Rework the schedule if necessary, but see to it that each gets at least one day off a month. If they would like more, grant them up to two days per week."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Connor grinned happily upon hearing this. "It will be as you say, though I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m not sure how they will take the suggestion, at first."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sure they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll understand. If they don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t, simply have them come speak with me," Harry said smiling. Bill and Charlie, who\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 had remained silent until now, began to laugh very hard. Charlie almost fell out of his chair.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I think Hermione got to you with that spew, thing, didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t she," Bill asked, chortling the whole time.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Spew?" Connor asked in a bemused tone of voice. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes, i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s something Hermione was going on about," Harry said rolling his eyes. "In any case, how long should it take for the brooms to arrive, Connor?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I will be on my way now, unless you need anything else, and you should have them before the morning is throug\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 h," Connor said, his green eyes twinkling merrily.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Excellent. Please have Loretta stop in once an hour until the others are up. They will most likely want breakfast, as well," Harry added thoughtfully.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Of course, sir. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll be on my way, then." Connor bow\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ed and swept quickly out of the room.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry, mind if I ask you something," Bill asked quietly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ask away," Harry said cheerily.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "I thought pureblooded elves were extinct\'85\loch\f0  so how do you have one working for you?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "My thoughts exactly," Charlie added.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  laughed then, a happy, carefree laugh. "Elves aren\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t extinct, they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re hiding. The human magical community looks down on non-humans as }{

 Most pureblood elves are hiding in the muggle world. As you heard Connor a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 dmit, they don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t have to do much to fit in.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 They spent the next couple of hours telling each other about their times at Hogwart\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
s, the best pranks, and their adventures; which Harry had them both beat in. Bill and Charlie gawked at Harry as he told them how he saved the Sorcerer\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harr\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "We always do, little brother, we always do," Bill said, as they disapparated out of the room.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The next few hours passed very slowly for Harry. Everyone seemed to be waking up late,\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 leaving Harry to explore his new home. Potter Place, which would best be described as a mansion, contained numerous rooms full of ancient artifacts. After having looked through most of the house, Harry ended up in the library.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Around half past noon, Loret\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ta poked her tiny head into the library. "Sir\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s guests is just coming downstairs, sir. Would sir like Loretta to direct them in, sir?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No need, Loretta," Harry said as he stood and stretched. "I think I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll join them for lunch. If you would, please direct \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
them to the dining room." When Loretta nodded, Harry added, "Thank you." The house elf again walked off with a positively ecstatic smile plastered on her tiny little face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 When Harry joined the others in the dining room, they all looked happy and rested. A\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
s he sat, he called in Loretta again and asked her what were the choices for lunch. She grinned happily, and repeated the choices to them. Once everyone had a plate of food and drink, Mrs. Weasley finally broke the ice on the question everyone wanted to h
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ar the answer to.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry, what happened last night," she asked, ignoring her food.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Seventeen minutes," Harry frowned. "Well, I lost that bet."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Everyone looked at him confused.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I had a bet with Connor. I figured you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d ask within the first fifteen minutes.\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  He said you wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t. I lost," Harry explained. "By only two minutes, too."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The twins were grinning excitedly. Betting was one of their favorite activities just under Pranks and Quidditch. "So Harry --"

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "He wanted one of the rooms of the house blown up, within the week, if he won. If I won, he would have to take a month\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s vacation."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The confusion on everyone\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s faces deepened as they heard this. To them \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 this seemed backwards, as well as a little psychotic.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry, I think you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve mixed up the bets," Ron said, trying to get Harry to think about it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry thought about it a second, then said, "No. I said it right. He wants a room of the house blown up so tha\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t he can fix it. I want him to take a vacation, because he hasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t had one in nearly fifteen years."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Mr. Weasley looked at Harry dumbfounded, "Why does he want a room of the house destroyed?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, that. He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s a carpenter. He likes to build things. All the pr\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
evious residents of the house would accidentally blow up a room while experimenting or training. No one has done that in nearly fifteen years, now, and he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s bored." Harry smiled as realization dawned on everyone.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I think I satisfied his urge to build by o\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ffering to let him rebuild The Burrow, though, and he even agreed to take a small vacation this morning," Harry said smiling. "I don\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 t know what to do about the bet now, though."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "This is all very interesting," interrupted Mrs. Weasley, "But, I would very \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 much like to know what happened to The Burrow." The rest of the Weasley family nodded in agreement to their mother
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s question.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry smiled, "I promise I will explain everything soon. Hermione should be here within the hour, as will Professor Dumbledore. B\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ill and Charlie should be back by then, as well. I will explain everything once they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re all here."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny, through all this, remained silent, thinking to herself. }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Why did the jewel call Dumbledore Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s grandfather?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, it also called Ron his brother\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 . Oh, and what did it call you, again?"}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  her inner voice mocked once more, causing her to blush very much.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ginny, stop that," Harry grinned. "I didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t even say anything yet!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The entire Weasley family turned to stare at Ginny who seemed to be blushing for \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 no apparent reason, then at Harry, then back at Ginny trying to figure out what was going on.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Mr. Weasley, I have a gift for you. I think you will enjoy it very much," Harry said, pulling out a small, black, box-shaped object and effectively changing the \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
subject. "My father called it a recepticon. He made them for my mother. She was muggle-born, and missed certain things occasionally like radio and television. They accept plugs from muggle things that run off of electricity so you can run them.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d like f\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
or you to have one. It should allow you to test any of the muggle devices you get that use electricity," he said as he tossed the little black box to Mr. Weasley, who looked like this was the happiest day of his life.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Thank you, Harry. I-I-I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know wh\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 at to say," he grinned happily.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No need. Just enjoy it," Harry said, smiling.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 At a quarter after one, Hermione arrived. She was frowning quite sternly as Lorette, Loretta\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s sister, lead her into the room. Lorette was smiling happily, as were all the\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 house elves since they had someone to serve again, the entire time.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hello, Harry," Hermione said in an accusing tone, throwing a glance at Lorette. "I see you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re enjoying the finer things in life."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Thank you, Lorette," Harry said, ignoring the accusatio\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n. "Have my packages arrived, yet?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sir, your packages is waiting for you. Would you like Lorette to get them for Master Potter," the house elf asked in her squeaky little voice.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No, that won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t be necessary. Thank you, Lorette," he said, beaming a smile \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
at her, which caused her, like her sister, to trot away grinning happily. Once the house elf was gone, Harry rounded on Hermione angrily. "Now, Hermione, I will thank you not to offend my house elves. They are quite happy, and I would like to keep them th
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t way," Harry shot back.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eyes flashed in indignation, and she huffed irritably. "I can see you never took S.P.E.W. seriously."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry simply sighed and pointed Hermione to the library where the Weasleys were waiting. Once she joined them, she beg\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
an huffily telling Ron and Ginny how Harry was contributing to the enslavement of house elves. Ron, of course, rolled his eyes at this and said nothing. Ginny couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t help but laugh at her friend\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s vehement support of house elf liberation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Once those in \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
the Order who know me fairly well have arrived, I will explain everything. Until then, I ask you all to wait patiently," Harry said over the hum of the room. A few nods here and there, as well as a bit of grumbling from the Ron and Ginny, made it clear th
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t they would wait.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
Bill and Charlie had returned about fifteen minutes before Hermione arrived and both were in an expressive conversation with both Arthur and Molly Weasley. The twins were trying to test out one of their new treats on Hermione, but she ke
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 pt adamantly refusing anything they offered her, much to their chagrin.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 About ten minutes later the members of the Order that Harry had the most contact with started to enter the room. The first to arrive was Tonks, who Harry kept referring to as \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 Nymph\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 . \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
Each time she would scowl and her hair would change color with an audible pop. The third time he called her Nymph she turned into a great impression of Dudley and began chasing Harry about the room making kissing noises.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Remus Lupin was the next to arrive,\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 pulling Harry into a hug before asking him if he was doing all right, to which Harry could honestly answer that he was doing much better. They talked for a few minutes, before a crash resounded through the room. Tonks had tripped over one of the rugs and
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 fell into the twins, sending them careening into one of the bookshelves along with the treats they kept trying to trick Hermione with.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Mad-Eye Moody arrived and was, if possible, even more edgy than normal. His magical eye kept falling directly to Harry an\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
d then stopping entirely. Every time he addressed Harry, his eye would stop, as if it wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t sure what it was seeing, and what seemed almost like fear combined with curiosity would flicker across his face for a split-second, then his mask of gruffness wou\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d return.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
The last of the Order to arrive was Dumbledore, who kept his greetings short, immediately falling into one of the plush chairs sitting around the library. "I am afraid that Mr. Shacklebolt and Hagrid will not be here, Harry. They had work of the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 utmost importance."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
"That is fine, one of you can fill them in. For those of you here, what I am about to say is to be kept private, for the time being, with the exception of Kingsley and Hagrid, of course. I have invited you all here to fill you in on som
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e changes that have come to my attention," Harry said to those assembled.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "A few short days ago I came into contact with a jewel known as the Dragon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Tear. I came into contact with that jewel again last night. The result was the utter destruction of The B
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 urrow," Harry said followed by a loud gasp from Hermione who\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s wide-eyes stared at him in complete horror, before she began to offer her sympathies to the Weasleys.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Now, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sure you all have questions. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll go ahead and answer what I know will be asked. \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Then, if you have any more questions, I\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 ll answer them as best I can. What happened at The Burrow, I think is the first and foremost on everyone\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s mind. The simplest answer is that I lost control. I managed to contain the destruction, but that is the best
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I could do once the chain reaction began.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What did the Dragon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Tear do to me, is the next question. The simplest answer is that the Dragon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s Tear laid on my shoulders the responsibility of what is known most simply as the Dragonmaster. In all honesty, I \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
wish it had chosen someone else. I have enough to worry about as it is," he said an uncomfortable grin lighting his face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "What is a Dragonmaster\'85\loch\f0  well, I suppose it would be best to explain in detail. Dragons are highly intelligent creatures," Harry said \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
to which Charlie nodded enthusiastically, "The Dragon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Tear is an egg containing the collective knowledge of the race of dragons. It was stolen nearly seven hundred years ago. The thief\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s name was Mundungus Fletcher. I believe you all may know a relative\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
of his," said Harry as he smirked. "About two hundred years ago a relative of mine purchased the Tear, believing it had healing abilities. She studied the Tear for two decades, before giving up on it. It has been passed down in my family ever since, until
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 it came to me.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
"Due to my aunt a few generations back being exposed to the jewel for so long, its magic began to," he paused a moment while considering his words, then continued, "leak, I suppose is the best word, into her. A few generations later, I was b
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 orn. My parents were killed, so I never saw the Tear. When I finally get near it, it sees in me the potential to restore all of dragon-kind to their former glory\'85\loch\f0 
 and it chooses me for that responsibility. Yay me.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "The Tear, when it sensed me, called out a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
nd that first call nearly shattered my mind. When I touched it the second time it passed to me everything it passed to the dragons. Which is essentially, everything that any creature who ever touched it knew."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Upon hearing this Ginny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s head snapped up. Har\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ry noticed this, and had been expecting it, so when she looked up she did so directly into his eyes, and he gave an almost imperceptible nod.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So, I have quite a bit swimming around up here now," Harry said while tapping his forehead and giving a small lau\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 gh. "Now, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll answer whatever you want to ask."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione, ever the student, immediately raised her hand. Harry chuckled before reminding her they were not in school, and she did not need to raise her hand to ask a question. She indignantly tossed out, "I 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 just thought it would be more orderly." She then blushed and asked her question. "You mentioned new abilities. What can you do?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Honestly, I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know. It would be better to ask me if I can do something specific. I know everything the Tear put into my he\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ad, but until I want or need it, I really don
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know that I know. I hope that makes sense.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "But, as an example can I apparate," he said and with a loud crack he disappeared and then reappeared behind Hermione, who nearly jumped out of her seat when he laid\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  his hand on her shoulder. "That
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s a yes, by the way."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Mrs. Weasley was the next to speak up. "How did you switch places with that naked man, last night."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Her question was met with a bevy of odd looks from the Order members, as well as Hermione, since no o\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ne had mentioned this odd little piece of information.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ah, yes. I forgot about that. The floating man you saw," Harry said as his body slowly shifted into the taller and more muscular figure, his voice becoming a bit deeper as he did so, "was me." He grin
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ned at the shocked faces in the room. The man before them was indeed Harry, but he was older\'85\loch\f0 
 in his early-twenties it appeared. It was obviously him, because he still had the same untidy hair, and the brilliant green eyes, as well as his scar, though it \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
as lit with a blue light making it seem as if he had a piece of lightning embedded in his forehead.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Tonks squealed as she asked him delightedly, "Are you a morphmagus?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry pondered the question for a moment, then answered as best he could. "Well, let m\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
e first answer your question how you meant it. No, the reason I can change appearance is not because I am a morphmagus. This is my new body.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "The Harry Potter you knew before was a moderately powerful wizard, I will grant you that, but that body was nearly\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  torn apart under the strain of what was required. That\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Now on to your actual question. Am I a morphmagus. No. I am, however, a shapeshif\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ter. As I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Tonks nodded admiringly. "Lucky bugger," she muttered under her breath.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What ways are you not restri\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 cted that she is," Bill asked.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Nymph, would you like to answer this one?" Harry again ducked away as she tried to smack him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re going to make me hurt you, you know. But, sure," she said growling at him. "Well, let\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s see\'85\loch\f0  where to start. A shapeshifte

m a fairly strong morphmagus. Most can hold a memory \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 for about two days. I can hold it for about two weeks. The strongest, that I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ve met holds onto his memories indefinitely. He still has memories from his childhood and he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s close to ninety, now.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t do objects, though, you see. Can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t get a memory off t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Better explanation than I could have given," smiled Harry. "Thanks much, Nymph."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Stop bloody calling me Nymph!" she exclaimed. "Sirius used t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 o call me that, and it drove me batty!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I know," Harry said. "He touched the egg, too," he said sadly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Oh\'85\loch\f0  oh" Tonks said, knowingly. "Wait, you know everything Sirius knew?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Up to the time he touched it, yes. That was just before my parents\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  deaths."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 T\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 onks blanched when she heard this. "So you know what I --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What you look like in your natural state?" he interrupted. "Yes," he smiled deviously then.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh no," she said as her hand went to her mouth, her pale face standing out in stark contrast to her blo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 od-red hair.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Remus was the first to ask, "Well, what does she look like in her natural state?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Should I tell them, Nymph," Harry asked, looking her directly in the eye. "Or better yet, show them?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t!" she muttered wide-eyed. "You wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t dare\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 !"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Bill and Charlie immediately started chanting, "Show us!" A few seconds later Remus joined in, followed by the twins.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Tonks was looking around, a look of pure horror plastered on her face. "Harry, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll do anything you want for as long as you want, just \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 please do not show them. I\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 m begging you."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 It was then that Hermione spoke up, as the voice of reason. "Tonks, there is no reason to believe he could show them if he wanted to. He claimed to be a shapeshifter, but we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ve not seen him do anything, yet."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Tonk\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s immediately latched onto this bit of hope. "Hey, she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s right. How do know you even }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 can}{\fs24\kerning0 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  show them," she asked doubtfully.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s response was to grow his hair longer, changing it silver as he did. After a moment his hair stopped growing and his skin pale\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d to a pasty color, as if he hadn
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t seen the sun in years. Immediately following that he changed the green of his eyes into a deep ruby. Finally, he grew his ears to a point. One thing Tonks hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t mentioned is that whenever a morphmagus changes, they mak\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  an audible pop, however slight. A shapeshifter makes no sound, whatsoever.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The entire room, aside from Dumbledore, began to gawk at the pureblood elf standing before them. Harry smiled widely, and in a soft Scottish accent asked, "What be the problem? Yeh\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 all look like yeh seen a ghost!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As he slowly returned to normal, Tonks redoubled her efforts to avoid everyone seeing her natural state. "As I said, anything you want for as long as you want. Anything at all, I swear!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "If I weren\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t such a gentleman," he\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  grinned, as everyone in the room gaped at his un-Harry-like joke. "What? It was just a joke."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny, however, didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t think it funny. She was sitting in her seat, fuming at him. }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Here he is, knowing exactly how I feel about him, and now he\hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face turned bright red. His game was fun, but only when he wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 on the receiving end of it. "No, I know you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
re not going to like this, but Sirius believed you needed to quit hiding. If you really want me not to show them, I won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t\'85\loch\f0  but I agree with Sirius."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Tonks began to stare at the floor in silence. After about five \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 minutes, she finally nodded to him, to go ahead. At her nod, Harry slowly began to assume Nymphadora Tonks\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 natural state. Slowly his face transformed into one matching Tonks\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  current look, then it proceeded to soften. When he was finally done, standing b\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
fore all present, was a stunning young woman in her mid to late-twenties.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Her shoulder-length hair was a lightly-curled, deep brown that hugged her pleasantly soft face. Her eyes, a light hazel rimmed with violet flecks, simply accentuated the elegance of \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
her face. As everyone\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eyes took in the sight before them, they glanced back and forth between Tonks and Harry. Everyone in the room, even Dumbledore, was dumbfounded.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You look more like a Nymphadora, than a Tonks," Hermione said after the shock had worn\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  off.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
"Sirius told me the same thing," she said, still not having looked up. She was completely unaware that every male in the room, Dumbledore and Moody excluded, was staring at her in admiration. Mrs. Weasley glanced at her husband then punched him in th
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e arm before saying, "Trying to catch flies, Arthur?" He immediately snapped his mouth shut, before apologizing profusely to her.
\par }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s why he was flirting with her,"}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  Ginny thought to herself. }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I can\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 t blame him, she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s beautiful\'85\loch\f0  I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m gonna kill him."
\par }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As Harry returned to his new taller, more muscular version of his old self, Moody decided to bring the conversation back on topic. "That explains a good bit, Potter. To be specific, it explains why you\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 ve been giving my eye the screaming abdabs. So we get\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
that you can shapeshift. You mentioned it rebuilt your body," he said, to which Harry simply nodded. "So, what can this new body of yours do?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry frowned as this question was asked. "I was hoping no one would ask that, to be honest. But, since it has be\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 en asked, let\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s go ahead and address it." Harry disapparated and a moment later he returned with a pile of rocks in his arms, which he promptly placed in the center of the room.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "}{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Finite Incatatem!}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 " he said, and the rocks expanded to be the size of small bo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ulders. "What can this new body do," he said aloud. Harry reached down and picked up one of the small boulders with one hand, embedding his fingers into the rock with a cracking noise. He lifted the rock in front of them, and then swung his other arm towa
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d it in a lightning-fast motion. When his fist connected with the rock there was a loud crack, and the room was showered in dust from the pulverized rock.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m a little stronger than before," Harry laughed uncomfortably as everyone in the room opened and c\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
losed their mouths repeatedly, unable to speak. "My reflexes are a bit faster, too," he said. A second thunderous crack reverberated through the room as another rock exploded without being touched. Everyone in the library looked at each other, as if askin
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  what happened. As they looked at Harry, he was frowning, his hand held before his face. In it was a chunk of rock that wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t there before.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Bloody hell," Fred whispered to George. "Remind me not to piss him off!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry laughed. "Fred, George, my hearing \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 is a bit better, too. Actually, all of my senses are more powerful."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ron growled at all of this. }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "The famous Harry Potter becomes a bloody super man! Just perfect, really. I thought it was bad before, it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s going to be horrible now!"}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  Ron tossed in his angry\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  question here, but no one except Ginny noticed the hint of anger, "So you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
re bigger, you can break boulders, you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re fast as lightning, and you can hear what someone is saying from another country?! That about sum it up?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Not exactly. I am stronger, but I\loch\af0\dbch\af15\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m not exactly faster. I am, but it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s all relative to how much stronger I am. What you saw were my reflexes. I couldn
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t outrun someone on a Firebolt, or anything like that\'85\loch\f0  but I could snatch them off of one as they passed by at top speed."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny punched R\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 on hard on the arm. He looked at her angry, but the look she returned snapped his mouth shut.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I also have some posts that I have to distribute. They\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve not been delegated to anyone in well over a thousand years and it is about time the world once again sa\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
w them," Harry added, grinning from ear-to-ear.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Posts? What posts might these be, Harry?" Dumbledore looked excited. It wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t often in his life that he could find something new in the wizarding world, and when it occurred, he was quite happy to patiently\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  listen.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Those I will need to speak with the potentials about. Once they have accepted, I will then allow them to explain it to you themselves," Harry said, becoming quite tight-lipped about the subject.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "In the meantime, I do believe we need to make anot\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
her introduction," Harry said, as he walked to stand behind Dumbledore who instantly knew what was coming, and braced himself. "I would like you all to meet, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. Descendent of Godric Gryffindor, descendent of Salazar S

\par }\pard \sb100\sa100\nowidctlpar\faauto {\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dear Reader,
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Again, I want to thank you all for \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 the wonderful reviews. So far I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 ve received thirty-six reviews on this story (only one on my other, though\'85\loch\f0 
 but I suppose it balances out), and all of them have been good save for one which I addressed with my comments in chapter two. I appreciate greatly\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 your support. :)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Now, to address why I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m updating so soon. I started a new story, as some of you may have noticed. I had a severe case of writer\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s block on this one story. Very irritating it was, too. But, it has been solved, for now. ;)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Some people have c\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ommented on my sneakiness or my plot. I am not being sneaky. I simply don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know what I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m going to write until I write it. I have the ending firmly in mind, and as I mentioned I think you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll all hate me when you see it, but everything else I am simply wri\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ing what comes to me at the time.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 There was also a bit of irritation that I gave Fudge back his magic. Well, if I remember correctly I address that in this chapter as well. I think you'll like the implied insult... though I won't begrudge anyone who misses
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  it, it is rather subtle.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Will Harry end up with Ginny? Well, I really don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know... I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m on chapter seven right now, and by that point she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s more or less not talking to him. But, it really depends on whether a certain Slytherin manages to capture Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
eart. What? Malfoy? What the hell are you talking about?! Erm, in case you missed the joke, Malfoy is }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 not}{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  the Slytherin I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m talking about. You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll get to see her next chapter, though, so remain patient. ;)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Someone mentioned how is it possible that Dumbledor\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 e is a descendant of Gryffindor and Slytherin. Well, you see, when two people meet and fall in love\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  erm\'85\loch\f0 
 sorry. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m in a bit of a good mood since I finished chapter six, so I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m joking around a bit. Anyway, the Gryffindor/Slytherin issue will be addressed\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 at a later date, and it will be a major issue.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 But, I will say no more. Mainly because I may change my mind and relegate it into nothingness, as just an explanation of why the Sorting Hat had trouble sorting him. If not, though, I think you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ll like what I\hich\f0 \rquote \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ve got planned.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Someone also mentioned the \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 super Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 issue. Yes, Harry is a bit of a badass in this story (something someone else mentioned), but that was hinted at in the Order of the Phoenix. He did, after all, whip out his wand and told Snape quite \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
calmly that he was considering what curse to use on Malfoy.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 But, the \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 super\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  problem gets addressed here, a bit further down, at least the start of it, anyway. Harry never gets it easy, and I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m not going to be the first to go soft on him! ;)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Anyway, yes, I\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  know I said I wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t update until I had ten chapters or I got impatient. Well, I got impatient. I was so happy when I finished chapter six, and even got started on chapter seven, that I decided to post another piece. :)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 So, on to the story!
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 -Master Eldr\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 yn
\par }{\fs24\kerning0 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 All eyes immediately fell on Dumbledore, their owners shocked into a disbelieving silence. The old man\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s eyes were twinkling merrily, a small smile curling his lips. Regardless of what was to come when Harry got him alone, he was happy to finally have \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
the secret off his chest. After a moment of a silence, he realized the silence was becoming oppressive. "Surprise?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Bloody hell, Harry, the most powerful wizard alive is your grandfather?" Ron exclaimed. It was a tribute to the all-encompassing shock that\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 had fallen over the room that Mrs. Weasley had not immediately shouted for him to watch his language. In fact, she never did.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The room remained quiet a while longer, while Harry moved toward the only available chair in the circle and seated himself. He th\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
en steepled his fingers as if he were summing them up for an attack. "I guess, Ron, that is one way to put it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Silence again fell as it all began to sink in. While everyone else was trying to process everything Mrs. Weasley broke the silence, her face a p\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 icture of utter rage. "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
re his }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 grandfather}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 , and you sent him to live with those\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  those\'85\loch\f0 
 muggles," she spat the last word as if it were dirty. "How could you, Albus?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I am afraid, Mrs. Weasley, that I know the answer to that question all too well," Har\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ry said, pressing down on the bridge of his nose as he closed his eyes. Dumbledore turned to Harry; sadness had come over his old face. He simply watched and waited to hear what would come next. "My grandfather, as Ron so succinctly put it, is one of the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ost powerful men alive. But, he did not know how to handle being a father. Not that I can particularly blame him for that\'85\loch\f0  I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t know how I would take being a father, either.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "But, that is why my father\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s last name, and my own, is Potter\'85\loch\f0  not Dumbledore.\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  My father was given his mother\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s name. My grandfather knew so much and held so much power, but yet fatherhood frightened the daylights out of him. I know this, because he admitted it to my father.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "At this point I venture into the realm of guesses. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m su\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 re if I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m wrong he will correct me. When my parents died, he knew I needed to be with a blood relative so that I could be protected in case Voldemort were not truly dead, or his Death Eaters sought vengeance. My mother\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s parents died long ago, as did my f\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ther\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s mother. My grandfather had to decide if I would be better off with my aunt Petunia, or with him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "He was still far too afraid of the role of fatherhood to consider raising me, so he left me with them. It really is rather ironic when you consider tha\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
t he has worked with children most of his life. In all honesty, I think he would be an excellent parent.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "But, the rest I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sure you all know, by now," he finished. Dumbledore had tears streaming down his face. The only other person in the room whose emoti\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ons were plainly visible was Mrs. Weasley, who was absolutely livid by this point. She could not fathom how a grandparent could do such a thing to his only grandchild, especially when he has proven so well that he knows how to care for children.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Albus," s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
he said as she walked up to him, "I am ashamed to know you." No one, save Dumbledore, expected her to do what she did next. She drew back and slapped Dumbledore hard across the face, and a deafening silence settled over the room. Dumbledore, however, did

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Mr. Weasley walked over, and pulled his wife across the room. No one said a word, the entire time as Harry simply continued to watch them all like bugs in a box.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "My father \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 forgave him," he said, nodding in Dumbledore\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s direction. "It took him many years to do so, and to accept my grandfather\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The rest of the meeting passed rather well, with everyone congratulating him on findin\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 about magic than almost anyone alive. Now he was just Dumbledore, still a great wizard, but it was obvious that under the wizard was still just a man.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry was a bit disappointed, though, because due to all the excitement they didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t get to try out their \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
new brooms or have their game of Quidditch. He enjoyed the rest of the day, though, assuring himself that they would do so the next day.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione woke up early the next morning, having chosen to stay the night at Potter Place, to find her clothes fre\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
shly cleaned and ready to be worn again. She scowled at the clean garments, the labor of oppressed house elves she thought to herself. Irritated by Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s lack of care for house elves, she took a long soak in the bath, trying to wash away some of her ten\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ion. About fifteen minutes in, a tiny house elf tapped on the door and stuck her head into the bathroom.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Is miss finding her bath good? Miss need anything?" the house elf squeaked.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m fine, thank you," Hermione said warmly after she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d managed to calm he\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
r racing pulse. The house elf, though Hermione never mentioned it, had frightened her more than the twins with their bloody-nose inducing candies. From what she had heard and seen, most house elves were expected to work unnoticed, yet here was one who jus
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  came right out and spoke to her directly. "Aren\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t you supposed to work unnoticed," she asked.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Work unnoticed, miss? Why would Lorette do that?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I thought that was the purpose of a house elf," she said dumbly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Lorette looked at her as if she had three he\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ads. "Master Potter would never make us hide, miss," she said happily. "Master Potter is wonderful, just like his father and mother."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "But, don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t you want to be free, Lorette?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Why would Lorette want to be free, miss? Lorette is happy right here."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "But, y\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ou deserve to be free!" Hermione exclaimed indignantly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Why, miss?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "So you can\'85\loch\f0 " she sputtered off at a loss for words. "Well, isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t there anything you want to do?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh yes, miss."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What is it," Hermione asked triumphantly, knowing she had found a way to\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  make the poor house elf want freedom.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Lorette\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 d like to see Master Potter in a game of Quidditch. His father played, but since\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  well\'85\loch\f0 
" she began to weep. Her sobs, a very squeaky noise indeed, echoed off the surrounding walls of the bathroom. "There has \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 been no Quidditch since!" she cried out, still sobbing pitifully.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione, however, finally realized what Hagrid had been trying to explain to her about it being cruel to demand freedom for house elves. "So you really are happy here, Lorette?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes, miss,\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 " she said, perking up immediately. "Dobby was right, miss, Harry Potter }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 is}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 the greatest wizard to ever live," she smiled happily, as she closed the door.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione just stared at the door, thinking over what the small house elf had said, as she continued t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 o soak in the warm water. Why was she trying so hard to secure freedom for house elves if they
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re happy where they are, she wondered. It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s the ones who are treated badly that she should be trying to help, she admitted to herself. With that, Hermione found\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a new cause to support. No longer would she try to force through S.P.E.W. on a world that was not ready. That morning Hermione found a new cause.

t without a doubt. It was just so hard for him to handle. His brothers all had something he didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t have.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Bill and Charlie were cool as ice and tough as nails, working for the Order. Percy, prat that he was, was still moving his way up through the Ministry \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
quickly. The twins were making themselves rich running their joke shop. His sister had, as depraved as this sounded to him, been special because she was chosen by Tom Riddle to open the Chamber of Secrets.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Even his best friends had things on him. Hermione \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 was bloody brilliant, of course. Bit of a stickler for the rules, though. But, then again, that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry stood in the center of his large, padded gymnasium, lost in thought. He hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t been asleep since he had been \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 reborn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 , yet he wasn\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 t tired. Finally he broke himself out of his thoughts and cleared his mind, taking note of everything in the ro\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
om. He eyed the thirteen wooden, man-shaped figures he set up around him as targets, before he burst into action. His mind went pleasantly blank, he thought to himself, as he prepared to destroy the figures standing in a circle around him much like the De
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 th Eaters had after the Tri-Wizard Tournament.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As he approached the first figure, images flashed through his mind of the night he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d watched Cedric Diggory die for no other reason than he was there. As the anger flooded through him, the figure before him to\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ok shape in his mind as Wormtail, and with a reflexive stab of his arm, the head of the figure exploded. In his mind it was the head of Peter Pettigrew.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He proceeded through the next few figures without such violent imagery, until the thought of Hagrid in \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
such distress over Buckbeak appeared in his mind, again filling him with a rage that demanded blood. As he rolled to his feet from the attack on the last figure, he leaped from his crouching position and his foot exploded through the next figure\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 s chest. \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n his mind he exulted as MacNair\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s bloody corpse fell to the ground, as he landed beside it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He tore through the next two figures with blinding speed and accuracy, his mind again clear of the bloody imagery assaulting him. As the shattered wood flew around\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 him, he simply enjoyed the peace flowing through his mind as he moved in and out of the figures with effortless ease, not stopping to dwell on the gore filling his mind.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 When he eyed the next figure, his mind was immediately filled with the images of Dobb\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
y protecting him from Malfoy as he backhanded the head off the figure. The head bouncing and rolling across the ground was of course that of Lucius Malfoy.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The following figure put him in an even bigger rage, as he saw Sirius fall back behind the veil once\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  again. "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ll pay," he shouted to the empty room, "in pain!" The ensuing scene was gruesome, if seen from his mind, to say the least. Bellatrix Lestrange was standing before him as he methodically tore the wooden figure in front of him to pieces. A shar
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  kick to the left knee left her leg at an impossible angle as a scream of pain left her lips, putting a very dark smile onto Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s face. A swift roundhouse sweep ripped the other leg off entirely, as if it were nothing more than paper. Before the wooden\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
figure could fall to the ground, though, an animalistic howl tore from his lips and his arms shattered through the wood at the waist severing the lower body. Bellatrix\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s eyes were staring at him in horror, still not having fallen to the ground. He shouted\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 for her to die, and with one last spin his elbow connected with the figure\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s head as it exploded into a powder of wood and nothingness.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Finally Harry turned to the last figure. The last image that assaulted him was that of Ginny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s near lifeless body in the\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 Chamber of Secrets, and a growl of primal rage erupted from his throat. Standing before him in his mind was the Dark Lord himself, Voldemort. A malicious grin of pure joy marred Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s normally pleasant face. With a single punch to the chest of the figu\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e the entire body was obliterated. Harry howled in triumph. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m coming for you," he whispered in a deadly hiss, "and nothing can stop me."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Voldemort bolted upright in his bed clutching at his forehead as a burning pain surged through it, vaguely in the sh\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ape of a lightning. He was sweating profusely, having been unable to wake up throughout that entire nightmare. He replayed everything he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d seen in his mind unwillingly, unable to remove the images. What Voldemort had witnessed was exactly what Harry saw i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry moved to his chair, watching the door. At one minute until no\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 on, all three walked through the door. Harry could tell from the looks on their faces what they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d decided. Each one had a look of grim determination set firmly in place as they said in unison, "I accept."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry frowned a moment, then beckoned them to follo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
w him. They walked out to the Quidditch pitch, each of them in silence as they did so. Harry ran through his mind, bracing himself for the pain he was about to cause each of them, hoping that one day they would be able to forgive him the entire time.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He to\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ok Ron first, knowing that he wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t back down from this at any cost. He was determined to help his friends, to protect them. He was also determined to become more than }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 just}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 Ronald Weasley. His determination seemed to radiate from him. Harry told him to \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
sit, and they did. Face to face they sat, their legs crossed the entire time. Harry asked him before he began, "Are you sure? This is your choice?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It is," Ron responded without the slightest hesitation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So be it." With that Harry waved his hand in front\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  of him, and a fire appeared between the two, a small dish full of a silver liquid floating above it. Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s body glowed for nearly an hour. Throughout that time the liquid in the dish slowly changed, its bubbling surface turning from a bright silver to \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 void of darkness, with a tiny speck of gold in the center. Once the glow had subsided, Harry looked at Ron. The young man before him appeared calm, however Harry knew that inside he was a torrent of worry.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Drink it," Harry said quietly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ron looked startl\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ed for a moment, but then reached out and took the burning metal dish into his hands with a grimace of pain. Harry stood and walked away knowing what was to come. As Ron poured the boiling liquid into his throat his body began to shake from the pain of ho
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ding the scalding dish, as well as drinking the lightly boiling liquid.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione and Ginny, tears streaking down their faces, watched, refusing to look a way. They did so as proof of their own conviction to see this through. Harry had hoped that seeing thi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
s would change their minds, but they watched in silence as Ron completed the ritual. Seeing this, he knew there would be no talking them out of it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ron finished the liquid, and the burns on his hands healed almost immediately, as did those in his throat. H\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
e immediately began to scream in pain, as tears streaked down his face. "Make it stop, make it stop, make it }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 stop}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
," Ron cried out as loudly as possible. "God, it hurts!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 After nearly an hour of his screaming for it to stop the shadows from the hoops making\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  up the goals on the Quidditch pitch slid across the ground and covered Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s body in a blanket of shadow. As it did, Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s screaming began to subside. Once Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s entire body was covered in his blanket, he smiled weakly up at Hermione and Ginny. "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s not
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 so bad, really," he choked out to them before he lost consciousness.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "He needs to rest now. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sending him to his room," Harry said. With a gesture of Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s wand Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s body melted into the shadows and slid across the ground to the house. "I need to know\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  now. Do you still want to do this?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes," both girls replied determinedly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What do I need to do," Hermione asked.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sit," Harry said, and the cycle began again. The only difference between Hermione\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s ritual and Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s was the liquid. It began in a clear w\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
hite and slowly transformed into a hazy purple swirl. After his body stopped glowing, Harry again told a friend to drink a substance he knew would cause great pain.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione, like Ron, grabbed the bowl and drank the substance down. Harry again left his fri\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 end to their pain. Hermione\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s screams were worse by far than were Ron\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 s. Her shrill cries echoed around the pitch. Ginny simply watched in resignation as her friend suffered. Unlike Ron, though, Hermione did not request it to stop. She suffered the pain w\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 i
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 thout a word.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Finally, as the end of her trial approached a thick purple fog appeared about Hermione. Once it was over she laid on the ground unconscious, as well, breathing weakly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s done. Home," Harry said with a gesture of his wand and her body disa\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ppeared. He looked at Ginny, then walked over to her. "Gin, please just tell me no. Just tell me you won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t do it," he pleaded with her.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You know I can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t do that," she said to him solemnly. "You know what he did to me. If I can help stop him, I will."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harr\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 y nodded and pulled her into a soft, warm embrace, which she returned. Once they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d separated he motioned for Ginny to sit, as the others did. The procedure was again the same. The liquid in the dish was clear, like water. Harry again assumed the familiar \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
low. As he finished he conjured first earth, then water, then fire, then air forcing each into the liquid. Once he finished, he simply stood and walked away.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny already knew what to do. She, like the others, grabbed the dish and drank the swirling subst\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ance in the dish. Once she was finished she too fell to her side on the ground, but throughout the entire trial she never made a sound. As her trial finished, her body went through each stage of her new abilities. She was absorbed into the ground, came ba
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 k out as a puddle, burst into flames, then evaporated into the air.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 When her body finally reformed, it did so directly in front of Harry who was sitting far from where her trial had happened. He smiled weakly at her, and she stumbled over to him, to which \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
he seemed utterly shocked.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s not as bad as I thought it would be," she said to Harry earnestly. "I thought from watching the others that mine would be just as painful, but it didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t feel like it."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m surprised you can still walk," Harry said looking \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 her right in the eye. "Every time this was done before the recipients couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t do anything for nearly twenty-four hours."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny frowned at him. "Anyway, when do we start training? I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m a bit anxious about it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "When the others are able to join us, we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll beg\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 in. I need to get you all into the basics before the start of the first term," Harry said after a moment. "If you all don
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t learn to control yourselves, you could cause some serious damage, but for now you need to rest. I want you to get up to your room a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t want to see you out for at least ten hours, but I would prefer fifteen."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 She mockingly frowned at him. "You don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t want to see me?" she asked, pouting at him, mocking his puppy dog impression from just a few days earlier.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You know that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s not what\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  I meant."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Of course not," he said, pulling her into friendly hug. "I just want you to be safe."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny nodded. "It feels different, you know?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I know. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve already experienced it," he said. "Welcome to my world, Ginny Weasley."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Remus wo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ke up this fine morning with an urge, a primal and animalistic urge. He wanted the hunt, and he wanted it badly. He wanted the exultation that came with the hunt, the freedom it allowed. Remus Lupin felt alive for the first time since he was bitten. He en
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 j\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 oyed this feeling, and he made a decision. He wanted\'85\loch\f0  no, he }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 deserved}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  to live!
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Lupin found Harry out by the Quidditch pitch where he was sitting, staring up above it as if there was a game happening in his mind. "Hello," he said as he took a seat next to H\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
arry. "Interesting game?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You could say that," he chuckled, watching the area above the pitch. "You see them?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "The falcons? Yes. Why do they keep dropping that mouse?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s a game, as you said. They let it almost hit the ground and speed down as fast as\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  possible to catch it. They\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ve been doing it for the past hour," he grinned.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sounds a bit cruel, don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t you think?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I suppose. I think it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s a way of settling their food dispute without fighting."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Odd."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Maybe, but so far neither of them have let it hit y\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
et. I assume the first to miss is the loser and will have to find a new hunting ground," Harry said as he continued to watch the morbid game playing out in the air far above them.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oops. Looks like you jinxed it. Seems we have a winner."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry chuckled as \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 he continued to watch the beautiful birds. "Are you angry with me, about last night?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Remus considered it for a moment, then smiled, his gray eyes twinkling. "Not at all."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You ready?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Thought you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d never ask," Remus grinned wolfishly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The two proceeded t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 o the gym in silence, simply enjoying the company. When they arrived in the large padded room Connor was waiting on them, patiently.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Salutations, sirs," Connor said, smiling. "Shall we begin?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Connor\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face shifted into one of stone as he watched the two \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
young men before him. Harry and Remus stood facing each other before bowing to each other, keeping their eyes on the other the entire time. "Begin," called out Connor.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Both Remus and Harry began to circle the other like a wolf on the prowl. Harry and Remus\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  both were brimming with excitement. Remus was the first to strike. He leaped into an arcing jump over Harry
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s head kicking out behind him before landing in a roll and quickly returning to his feet. Harry took the blow to the back, rolling with it and com\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ng to his feet at the same time as his former teacher.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Both of them lunged to the center and began raining blows on the other. The blur of movement was barely visible as they expertly countered each other and immediately returned an attack of their own. Co
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 nnor continued to circle outside them, watching with hidden glee. Remus let out an exultant howl as he renewed his assault.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry happily rose to the battle, quickly sweeping his werewolf-friend\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s legs out from under him. With a growl of triumph Harry leap\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
t atop his former professor and slammed his fist into his shoulder. A howl of pain erupted from Lupin\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s throat and he flipped Harry over him onto the ground. Both quickly hopped directly to their feet from a lying position, before turning to grin at the o\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 her.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Lupin\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s eyes had already shifted from their familiar gray into the dark gold of his werewolf form. His wolfish grin lit his face again as they continued the sparring match. The longer it went on the more wolfish Lupin became in an attempt to best Harr
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 y. Soon Lupin was a complete mesh of human and wolf.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 His fur-covered body bounded around the room as excited snarls escaped his half-snout. His pointed ears listened for every sign of movement as he and Harry continued to trade blows. Connor continued to w
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
atch the exciting match before him with a carefree happiness that could only be attributed to an elf, considering the situation he was witnessing. Lupin sat back on his haunches before leaping across the enormous room towards Harry. He never had a chance 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 f finishing his pounce.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "}{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Wingardium Leviosa!}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
" someone shouted from behind Harry, stopping Lupin in mid-air. An angry growl erupted from the half-man, half-wolf at having his hunt interrupted. Harry whipped around angrily to see who had interrupted his fun \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
to find a very frightened looking Mrs. Weasley. His face softened immediately, as he remember no one knew about what happened the previous night.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry dear, are you alright?" she asked shakily.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m fine, Mrs. Weasley. Could you let Moony down, though? W\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 olves aren\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t particularly fond of flying," Harry said softly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "M-Mo-Moony? W-W-Who is M-M-Moony?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, sorry. Remus Lupin\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s nickname is Moony\'85\loch\f0  rather fitting, don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t you think?" Harry was grinning at her.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Molly, I assure you I would never harm Harry," the \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 wolf-man said in a growling voice. "We were just having some fun."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Mrs. Weasley looked up at the wolf-man in shock. She had obviously not been expecting him to speak. After a moment she snapped into her familiar sabertooth mode, "Fun?! You call that fun?! \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
That was the most vicious thing I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve ever seen! One of you could have been hurt, or }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 worse}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 !"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Slowly Remus began to resume his human form. Once he was fully human again, Mrs. Weasley lowered him to the ground. "H-h-how?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s a werewolf," Harry said, as if \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 that explained everything, however Mrs. Weasley\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s confused look was evidence that it didn\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 t.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry came to my room last night as I was changing. Nearly caused me to have a heart attack, too," he growled at Harry. "Basically, he helped me understand the na\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ture of the magic that resulted in werewolves."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What do you mean," she asked curiously. "I though that you just turned into a beast once a month."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, that was a result of it," Harry said. "The magic was intended as a bonding between beast and man. The\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 problem is that the nature of the man fights the nature of the beast. The beast fights to get out, the man fights to control it. Most of the time the man\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s will is stronger, but the full moon makes the beast stronger," he said as they all had a seat on o\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e of the benches.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sir, if you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll excuse me, since this is over I need to work on that task you set for me with the house elves," Connor said, smiling.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "That\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s fine, Connor. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll see you at dinner?" Harry asked.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Of course," he said, smiling at Harry befor\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e directing his attention to Mrs. Weasley. "If you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll excuse me, Madam," he said, and left the gym.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "As I was saying," Harry continued, "once a month the beast manages to fight its way out. Since both spirits share the same body, they both can exert some m\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
easure of control. The man forces the beast to try to expunge the \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 curse\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  by biting people, since that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s how they got it. It doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 
t work of course\'85\loch\f0  just passes it on.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "But, I digress. Werewolves were an attempt to create better warriors, and it worked. Th\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e problem is that the person has to be willing for the merger to occur. Most people who get bitten weren
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t willing and don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know how to control it. I simply showed Moony how to control it. Now he is a }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 true}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  werewolf."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Remus grinned happily. "In all honesty\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  I would have chosen not to have this occur in the first place, but I can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t believe I tortured myself all those years by fighting it. All I had to do was truly give in and the pain stopped. It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s not nearly as bad if you can control it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Mrs. Weasley took i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t all rather well, really. She fainted dead away, but once she woke up later that day she seemed much more at ease with the situation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The next few days passed without any trouble or really any noteworthy events at all. Hermione and Ron were still to\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
o tired to work on learning to use their new abilities, most of the time not even leaving their rooms to eat. They just stayed locked up in their rooms depending on the house elves to bring them food.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t visited since everyone found out that\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  he was Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s grandfather. He was still trying to prepare everything for the beginning of the first term, but he made sure to floo Harry at least once a day to ensure everything was still all right. Now that everyone knew, he wanted to spend as much tim

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Tonks also wanted to visit, but she was busy with missions for the Order, which Remus joined her for. Once he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d mastered the control of his transformation, the wolf in him was intent on
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  getting back into the action. The prankster he was made him swear Harry, Mrs. Weasley, and Connor not to tell his new secret, since he could conceivably get some laughs out of it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The end of August quickly approached. Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Birthday had been quickly for\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Leave me alone," Ron called back in a raspy voice, as if he hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t used it for two weeks straight.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "R\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 on, get out here now," Harry said, losing his patience with his friend.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Piss off!" Ron shouted through the door. "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve got no right to give me orders! You did this to me!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 His friend\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s accusation, however, was the end of Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s patience. Everything in \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry and Ron stood in silence outside of Hermione\hich\f0 \rquote \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s door. They hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t said a word to each other since Harry had blown Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Go away, Ron!" Hermione shouted. "Please, just go away!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 R\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 on quirked his eyebrow at Harry, wondering how Hermione knew he was outside since they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d not knocked or said anything.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ron, go to the Quidditch pitch and wait for me there. Hermione and I will meet you there in about half an hour," Harry said. Ron was sti\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ll curious, but he nodded at Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s instruction and walked away in silence. "Hermione, can I come in?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry?" She asked the question as if she couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t believe he was really there. "Is it really you?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes, Hermione, can I come in," he asked softly. "Pl\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ease?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 She hesitated for a few minutes, then finally agreed. As he opened the door he noticed Hermione\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s room was in shambles. Her clothes, pillows, and just about everything else had been trashed about the room. Worse yet, Hermione was still glowing, a si\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 gn that she was still tapping into her new abilities unintentionally.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry walked quietly over to her large bed and sat down on the edge. Hermione was huddled up in the corner, covering her ears, crammed in between a nightstand and the bathroom wall as if\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 it were a fortress protecting her.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "So loud\'85\loch\f0  can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t think\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  people near\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  closer are\'85\loch\f0  the louder," she said softly, not making very much sense.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t stop it, can you," he said more as a statement, than a question.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 She shook her head curtly. "I tried to\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  find it again, but I couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t focus enough," she laughed wryly. "First time you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ve known of Hermione the bookworm not to be able to read, huh?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry chuckled at her weak joke, "Yes, I guess it is a first." His tone sobered almost immediately. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m going \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
to help you, Hermione. You just have to focus. Concentrate on my voice and let everything else go." He continued to drone on like that for several minutes, slipping in instruction here and there. After ten minutes he smiled and said, "Done. Now, we need t
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  get down to the Quidditch pitch before Ron falls into depression again."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Thank you, Harry," she said as she hugged him tightly. "Now, why is Ron depressed?" she asked as she pulled back and regarded him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "He blames me because he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s a living shadow, now," \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry said simply, ignoring the shock on Hermione\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s face. "Shall we?" He then turned and strode from the room without another word.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As Hermione and Harry approached the Quidditch pitch, the former of the two jogging intermittently to keep up, they we\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
re greeted with the site of a man-shaped shadow sitting against one of the posts holding up the rings, covering his eyes in shame. Ginny was running around the pitch in circles with her arms spread like the wings of an airplane, with a giant smile on her 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ace.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oi, Harry, I think Ginny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s lost her damned mind," said Ron in a mocking voice as Harry approached. "She\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s been doing this since I got out here."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No, she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s fine, Ron. She\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s enjoying herself. Something you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll learn to do as you learn some control. I g\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Great. I get to be a freak with power," Ron muttered bitterly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry grinned\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  at Ron, "Welcome to my world, Ron. Let\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s get started shall we? I need to test your instincts first."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh? And how do we do that," Hermione asked, falling into her natural role as a student.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Like this," Harry said as he launched a ball of flame at her. He\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 r eyes grew wide in shock and she threw up her hands as if to block the attack. Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s angry shout at Harry was abruptly cut off as the flame arced around Hermione, leaving her unharmed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Brilliant," Ron said in awe. "Bloody brilliant."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione looked up a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 nd around her, as if expecting to see that she was on fire. "Harry! How could you?! You scared the daylights out of me!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "That was the intention, Miss Granger," Harry said in a mock serious voice. "I needed to ensure that you could use your new abilities i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 nstinctively."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What if it had hit me?!" She was shaking with anger as she said this. The ground around her was tearing loose and floating up around her idly as she started to gather her new power about her.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What if it had?" Harry asked looking at her in \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 confusion. "Did you really think I would have thrown real fire at you?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 A sheepish look overtook Hermione as she realized her mistake. "Oh," she said as the clumps of grass and dirt fell to the ground. "M\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 sorry."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry rolled his eyes at her, then turned t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 o Ron. "Your turn."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yeah, but I know it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll be an illusion," Ron said, as if he would be wasting his time, now.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Illusion? Who said anything about an illusion? You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve already stressed me out today, and if I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 try}{\fs24\kerning0 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  to hurt you, I might just do it." Harry\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  said, disapparating as soon as he finished his statement, causing him to miss the look of fear on Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s face. When Harry returned he had a boulder in his hands, which he hurled directly at Ron without a second thought. Ron stared in shock at the rock fly\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ng towards him. At the last instant his body dissolved into shadow and slid across the ground where he reformed beside Hermione.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Very good, Ron. Now, would you care to work on how to return yourself to your natural state, or do you plan to remain a shade \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 for the rest of your life," Harry asked peevishly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Unlike Hermione, Ron was very thickheaded about getting control of himself. That irrefutable fact made teaching Ron to resume his human form a time consuming process. After two hours of Harry working\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 with him nonstop on it, Ron managed to work himself back into his human shape. Once he could consistently shift between his shade and human forms Ron spent the next hour trying to beat down his pride so that he could apologize to Harry for blaming him.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 It\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 was about that time Ron felt a tug on the back of his trousers. Looking down he was shocked to see a small puppy made of solid ice trying to get him to play with it. He looked up at Harry who just shrugged at him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry taught me how to do it," Ginny squ\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ealed. "Isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t he cute?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Um\'85\loch\f0  yeah, Ginny, I guess he is," Ron said frowning at it. "How did you do it?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry smiled at Ron in a smug manner. "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s a combination of her elemental magic and her normal magic. Air and water to create ice, then an animation c\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
harm to get him to act like his form. Unlike you and Hermione she didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t hide in her room for two weeks straight."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione and Ron both stared at their feet for a few minutes before muttering apologies for being pigheaded. Hermione made sure to add, thoug\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
h, that unlike Ron she was in pain around others so her excuse was at least partially valid. Ron didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t feel like arguing, so he just rolled his eyes.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ginny, I think these two slackers need an example. I want you to continue what we worked on yesterday," \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
Harry said to her. Ginny nodded and almost immediately ice began to form in her hands and slowly shaped itself into a very deadly-looking long-sword. Hermione and Ron stared in awe at the girl in front of them, and they seemed to notice for the first time
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 that she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d changed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
Two weeks prior Ginny was a soft, beautiful young woman. Now she was still a beautiful young woman, but the softness was gone, replaced by an athletically toned body. Her muscles flexed as she began to spin the long-sword in her hands m
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 enacingly. Once she had a handle on the sword\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s balance, the ground let forth three men formed from tightly packed earth.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Without a moment\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hesitation she tore into the earth-creatures before her. Within two minutes she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d managed to destroy two of the thr\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ee, only halting on the last long enough to reform her sword into an axe. She then hacked the earth-creature to pieces, grinning the entire time.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione and Ron gazed in awe at her proficiency with the new weapons, before Hermione finally asked, "Will we\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  be able to do that?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry laughed softly, "No. Your abilities are all quite different, though you can all do some of the same things in different ways."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Like what?" Ron asked dumbly. He was still too surprised to think properly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, for example, each\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 of you can move objects in some way. Hermione can latch directly onto the object and move it. You can latch onto its shadow and force it to move by moving its shadow. Ginny can harden the air around it and float it. Same result different cause," Harry gr
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 nned. "We would actually already be to that point by now, if you two hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ok, we get it!" Ron and Hermione shouted in unison.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Good, let\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s get started shall we?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 After three hours of training, the last fifteen minutes of which Ginny kept havin\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
g her ice-puppy bite all of their ankles playfully, Hermione finally asked the question Harry had been expecting someone to ask for the past few weeks. "Harry, most wizards have to use a wand for most things, right?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes, Hermione."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You did magic without\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  a wand when you removed the shrinking spell on those boulders the day I got here, didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t you?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes, Hermione."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Geroff! Damnit, Ginny, get this pup off me," Ron shouted in the background. Frost, the name Ginny had chosen for him, was playfully tripping R\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 on up every time he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d try to take a step. Ginny was rolling around on the ground, laughing wildly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "How," Hermione finally asked, after watching, with mild interest, Ron falling as Frost tripped him again. Ron tried kicking at the dog, but that didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t work\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 as well as expected. Unlike most dogs Frost didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t shy away from his foot and when Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s foot connected with the ice-dog it nearly broke all of his toes.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "With great precision," Harry chuckled at his own joke.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You know what I mean, Harry," she chided.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "O\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 f course I do," he smiled. "Once you have the basics under control, we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ll work on the more advanced things. The sooner we finish that, the sooner we can start your advanced training."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ok, Harry, but I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m holding you to that," she said.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sure you will,"\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  agreed Harry.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
Having finished training only fifteen minutes before, Harry sat quietly in the library with Hedwig sitting on his shoulder. She occasionally would nip his ear to remind him she was still put out with him for not spending time with her 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 since he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d left the Dursley\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s. It was the first time in the past few weeks that he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 l treats she liked so much.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Harry looked around the room and admired the d\'e9\loch\f0 cor. He knew his father didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t make the layout. The only thing his father really changed about the library were some of the books, and adding a safe-like compartment behind one of t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 he pictures.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
There were three large tables in the room, each one a light tan in color with a deep shine. At each table were three plush dragon-hide chairs. The carpet seemed to be enchanted because everyone that had stepped on it commented on how it felt, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 each one saying something different about it. Whoever designed the library did an excellent job, as far as Harry was concerned.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hedwig returned Harry from his thoughts with a particularly nasty bite on his ear. Finally she hopped down to his leg and looked\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  at him for a moment as if telling him that she doesn\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 t like being ignored then she playfully nipped his finger to let him know she had forgiven him. She hopped back up to his shoulder then nuzzled his neck softly while they waited. Connor had told him ea\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 r
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 lier that he had a visitor, and Harry wondered what was taking so long.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Good afternoon, Mr. Potter," a tall, thin man said as he appeared in the door of the library. His longish, black hair fell lightly around his pointed face, standing in a deep contrast\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 with his pale skin. "It is good to see you again," he said with a pleasant smile.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He was dressed in a mixture of black, white and green. His shirt was a baggy, black, silk, tunic-like thing. His shirt was covered by a soft white vest, which seemed to blen\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
d into his white trousers. Over his clothes he was wearing a dark green robe trimmed in silver. Harry couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t help but think he looked familiar, until he realized this man was at his trial at the beginning of the month.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Thank you, and welcome to my home,\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  Mr. Snape," Harry said in reply.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, please, call me Atticus," the main said smiling. He politely remained standing until he was asked to sit, which Harry noted.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "As you wish, Atticus," Harry said, nodding his head for the man to have a seat. "How may I \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 help you?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Actually, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m here on a social visit. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 ve heard so much about you from my nephew\'85\loch\f0 
 and, well, after your trial I thought I must see if the rest was true," he chuckled.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Your nephew? Are you by any chance related to Severus Snape?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The man grinn\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ed as he replied, "That would be the nephew in question, yes."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry smiled at the man before him. The resemblance was there, but, unlike Severus, Atticus didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t seem to be a greasy git, though Harry kept that thought to himself. He seemed normal, friendly
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  even. "You mentioned that Professor Snape spoke of me. Only good things, I hope?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Atticus Snape laughed loudly at this; a friendly laugh almost like Sirius would give off when he was enjoying a particular prank. "In a manner of speaking," he said cryptica\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 lly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
"Oh?" Harry asked in genuine surprise. The idea that Severus Snape may have said something good about Harry was a truly amazing thing. The only thing Harry believed that Severus Snape would ever say was good about him was that he was a perfect example
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  of a waste of space.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Atticus laughed uncomfortably for a moment before answering. "Well, in my opinion they were good things. He mainly flung out insults about how you waste his time."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "And these are good things, in your opinion?" Harry asked, the confusi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 on evident on his face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sevvie and I, well we never really agree on much. My brother was a bit of a prat, too. Sevvie takes after him."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sevvie?" Harry had to stifle a chuckle at hearing this. He was already beginning to like Atticus, and he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d rather not \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ruin that by insulting him in the first few minutes of their conversation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, yes, my pet name for him. Orpheus, my brother, was so serious about the name that I picked Sevvie to irritate him. It worked, of course, so it sort of stuck. Sevvie hates it as\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  well, but he
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s never been able to tell me that. I figure once he manages to work up the courage to tell me, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 ll call him by his full name\'85\loch\f0  until then I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ll enjoy my fun," he said, a smile playing on his lips.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You know, I think my father and godfather wou\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ld have liked you," Harry said earnestly. "Would you like a drink?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What would you recommend?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "How about some Elven Brandy? My grounds keeper makes it himself."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sounds delightful, Mr. Potter," Atticus said smiling.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Please, call me Harry," he said as he\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 rose and pulled open a small picture of a blue and silver phoenix. Portas, the phoenix, trilled out beautifully in indignation at being disturbed. Behind the picture was a small opening, much like a safe, in which was housed a large square bottle full of
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a dark, red, transparent liquid and four glasses. Harry pulled out two of the glasses and the bottle, and returned to his seat.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "This is amazing," Atticus said as he eyed his almost full glass after drawing a sip. "It tastes faintly of cherries, I believe.\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "If there is one benefit to having Connor as a grounds keeper, I believe this is it," Harry said in agreement, a smile twitching his lips.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry and Atticus continued their chat for a few hours until they walked into the dining room, singing the en\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
tire time. Harry had invited Atticus to dinner, and he had happily accepted. Both men were acting quite cheerful, and had anyone paid close enough they would have noticed that Atticus was slurring his speech slightly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Atticus was delighted to meet the Weas\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 leys, as well. He mentioned that \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 Sevvie\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 had mentioned them as well. He also mentioned one incident that his nephew kept constantly returning to having something to do with Bubotuber Pus, a \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 William\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 , and a \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 Charles
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  to which both Bill and Charlie began \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 o cough loudly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 When Connor entered for dinner his hair was entirely black, but no one mentioned it. He eyed Atticus for a moment before asking Harry quite clearly, "How much Elven Brandy did this man have?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry chuckled guiltily at the question. "Well, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 we finished off the bottle in the library."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Connor\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eyes went wide as he asked in a scandalous tone, "He had half a bottle?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry immediately became serious, "Of course not, Connor. I wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t even do that to his nephew!" Atticus let out a hefty chuckle\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 at hearing this, as did Ron, Bill, and Charlie. "No, he had about a quarter of a bottle, I drank the rest."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Connor began to open and close his mouth repeatedly, but words had failed him completely. Elven Brandy, Connor knew, was some of the strongest alco\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
hol on the planet. The fact that Atticus was only slightly drunk after a quarter of a bottle was amazing unto itself, but the fact that Harry had finished the rest and was unfazed was a miracle. "How," asked Connor, which, should he be quite honest about 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t later, was all he could manage to put into words.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Slowly and with great pleasure?" Harry said guiltily, again. "It was delightful, Connor," he said truthfully.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry Potter, I can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t believe you!" Mrs. Weasley had realized exactly what he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d said. "I can\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 understand a small drink here and there, but a whole bottle?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Madam, I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t think you understand the implications of what he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s done," Connor said seriously. "Elven Brandy would make Fire Whiskey seem like water."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Bill and Charlie\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eyes went wide simul\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 taneously as they stared first at Harry then at Atticus, the latter of whom was smiling like the cat that ate the canary.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Damn, son," exclaimed Charlie admiringly to Harry. "Good show!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Charles Weasley, do not encourage him!" admonished Mrs. Weasley.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Har\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ry chuckled softly. "It was not that big a deal really. It just has a very nice flavor. In all honesty, the alcohol didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t do very much for me. I believe Atticus enjoyed that part a great deal more than I did."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Indeed," Atticus said, not realizing the ser\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ious nature of the conversation around him. "A slight little sip, a bite then a nip. Good as good can be, it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s Elven Brandy for me," he said happily.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "He doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t seem anything like Snape, does he," Ron whispered to Ginny. "I wonder if they dropped \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 Sevvie\hich\f0 \rquote \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 on his head as a babe." Ginny chuckled softly, before her mother shot her an icy glare that silenced her immediately.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Mrs. Weasley, how about I make you a promise," Harry said softly. "If Connor can find a way to replicate the taste of the Elven Brandy w\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ithout the alcohol, I will save the brandy for special occasions."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Mrs. Weasley stared Harry in the eye a moment as if appraising whether to believe him. "Connor," she said, without taking her eyes away from Harry, "can it be done?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t make a non-alc\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
oholic Elven Brandy," he said without even thinking about it. When Harry began to object, he held his hands up to halt him. "However, I can make it as tame as butterbeer, possibly," he said after a moment\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s consideration. "Though I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sure it will take me \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ome experimentation."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, I suggest we have a party the night before the beginning of term, Bill said as he pulled his hair back into a loose ponytail. I want to try some of this brandy," he grinned at Harry.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "William Weasley!" Mrs. Weasley exclaimed in\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  shock.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Indeed, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m a bit curious myself, really," Mr. Weasley said by accident.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Arthur!" Mrs. Weasley swatted her husband\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s arm.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, right. I forgot my manners. We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll have to ask our host if that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s all right with him," Arthur said after a moment\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s thou\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ght.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "ARTHUR WEASLEY!" Mrs. Weasley\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face had turned pink and she was positively fuming. The chuckles from the twins, Ron, and Ginny weren\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t helping very much, either.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Molly," Harry said to Mrs. Weasley, which immediately snapped her attention to him. He\loch\af0\dbch\af15\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d never called her \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 Molly\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 before, that she could remember. "I promise not to corrupt my family," he said smiling softly at her.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Very well, dear," she said after a moment. "So long as you keep them in line."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Now, Connor if you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d have a seat, I think din\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ner should be waiting," Harry said smiling. Now that the commotion had passed the only above average noise was Atticus who was huddled with the twins, laughing maniacally. Only Harry and Connor could hear what they were saying, and he was very glad about 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 hat. "So, about this party," Harry said with a grin.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry!"

\par }\pard \sb100\sa100\nowidctlpar\faauto {\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dear Reader,
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 First off, I appreciate all the suggestions for how the romance should go, however I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve made my decision. You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll no\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
t find out until chapter seven, though. Does Harry end up with Ginny, or will he end up with the girl you meet in this chapter, or for that matter will he end up alone? Only I know, and I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m not telling. :)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Someone has asked why Dumbledore didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t give Harry\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  his training. I thought that was rather clear, but I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll go ahead and state it. Harry\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 s \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 gift\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  from the egg was knowledge and power. Why would he need training from Dumbledore, when he now knows everything he needs for his new position? And, to be quite h
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 nest, he knows at least as much, if not more, than his grandfather knows.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Someone mentioned I should explain more about the new abilities. Well, that has already been taken care of (also starting in chapter seven). I can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t explain everything at once, becau
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 se they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re still learning. Well, I could, but it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d be a rather boring chapter. ;)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Now, all I will say about the romance, since that seems to be a key point, is this. What will be, will be. As you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll see in this chapter, whoever he ends up with (if either o\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
f them) may have their work cut out for them.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 And, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sure some of you are wondering why I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m posting again so soon. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m quite bored, really. I have most of chapter seven down now, so I am releasing another chapter to see if I can spur my ideas along. If n\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ot I may take a break from this story and work on another story I\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 ve been considering, for a while.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 -Master Eldryn
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 P.S. - Thanks to David305 for pointing out that I for some odd reason said that Seamus had a Scottish accent. I know he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Irish (I remember t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
he scene from Prisoner of Azkaban, I think it was). Just me typing too fast to think, I believe. :)
\par }{\fs24\kerning0 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I have such a headache," Ron muttered hiding his eyes from the sun streaming into their compartment. "If you ever offer me another glass of Elven Brandy, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry, so help me I\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 ll kill you."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You may be like --"

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "we agree with --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "ickle Ronniekins," Fred and George said, finishing each other\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s sentence while the other groaned in agony.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "He didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t force you to drink it," Hermione said h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
uffily to the three Weasley brothers. "If I remember correctly, he told you it was probably too strong for you." She was also speaking rather loudly, Harry thought. More than likely teaching the three redheaded brothers a lesson.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry simply laughed at hi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s friends and continued looking out the window of the train. He was quite happy, now that he thought about it. He was going to Hogwarts, he was going to teach, and he was }{
\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 definitely}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  going to be pulling some pranks. Knowing everything he knew, he thought to\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  himself, was worthless if you couldn\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 t have a bit of fun with it once in a while.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry, not that I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 m defending my brothers\'85\loch\f0  I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 m not\'85\loch\f0 
 but how much of that stuff did you give them?" Ginny was looking at him like he had poisoned her brothers, but she was a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 lso getting a bit of a laugh out of it, too.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Half a glass."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione and Ginny both snapped their attention back on Harry at the same time. Harry wondered what was running through their minds, as he again stared out the window. If he could hear what they \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
were thinking, he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d have heard Hermione wondering how he could have drank three quarters of a bottle alone and he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d have heard Ginny thinking about how much of a wimp all of her brothers were.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry Potter?" a soft, siren-like voice asked from the door of\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  their compartment.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry had been so intently staring out the window that he hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t heard the girl standing in the opening to their compartment. Everyone else had, though. Ron looked up and his eyes went wide as he took in the sight before him. He began s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
lapping at Fred, who was siting beside him. Fred and George had been planning something, and were rummaging through a bag at their feet.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fred looked up, finally, to see what Ron was slapping him for, to notice the girl standing in the doorway to their comp\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
artment. With a gaping jaw he began to slap at George who was still digging through the bag at his feet.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What Fred?" he asked as his brother continued to slap at him while he was looking for whatever had his attention in the bag. "Damnit, Fred, what?!" he\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 asked as he looked up and began imitating his brothers. All three of them sat there with their mouths opening and closing like a fish out of water.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 But, who could blame them, really. Standing in the doorway was what could best be described as a goddess. T\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
he girl, Ginny noticed, was about three or four inches taller than her, lightly tanned, with platinum blonde hair, and green eyes to match Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 What had captured the \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 boys\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  attention so well, though, was how she was dressed, no doubt. Her hair was pull\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
ed into a loose ponytail, and she was wearing very short, cut-off blue jeans and a tight, sky-blue shirt showing most of her stomach, which just happened to be very toned, and accentuating her\'85\loch\f0  other assets.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The girl, however, took no notice to the Weasley\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  brothers. She was looking at Harry, who was still staring obliviously out the window. She turned to Ginny and asked, "Is that Harry Potter?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny wanted to ask her, "What business is it of }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 yours}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ?" Instead she decided to just answer the question. "Yes, th
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 at\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Harry."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, good," the girl said with obvious relief. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve checked most of the compartments and no one looked like the pictures I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d seen. Or for that matter how he was described. This was the last compartment, and he is the closest I found." The gir\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 l explained, smiling nervously. "Could you prod him for me? I would try but I wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 t want to seem rude," she asked Ginny.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sure," Ginny said and poked Harry roughly in the ribs.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ow!" Harry frowned at Ginny, then noticed the girl in the door. "Why\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d you \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 poke me\'85\loch\f0  and who is our visitor?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "She asked me to, and she hasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t introduced herself yet," Ginny said angrily, but trying to hide it. She didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t do a very good job, though.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sorry," the girl said softly. "I forgot to introduce myself, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m Blaise Z\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 abini."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ah. Well, hello Blaise." Harry smiled. "So, why do I have a new bruise, now?" Harry asked, taking note out of the corner of his eye that Ginny turned slightly pink at his question.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Could I speak to you privately for a moment?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry glanced aroun\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d and noticed that the Weasley brothers were green with envy, so as he got up he whispered into Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s ear, "Ron, close your mouth and pay attention to Hermione before she hurts you." Then he and Blaise disappeared.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione and Ginny simply scowled at the \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 remaining three boys and began fuming about \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 boys\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 , as well as instantly deciding they didn\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 t like the girl who had been standing in the doorway.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sorry if I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve gotten you into trouble with your girlfriend," Blaise said apologetically. "I didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 mean to\'85

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s not my girlfriend, and be my guest. How can I help you?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh," Blaise smiled at hearing this. "You know, you don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t look like the pictures I saw."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Harry chuckled softly. "Growth spurt\'85\loch\f0  then again, those pictu\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 res in the paper are usually horrible anyway."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s why I wanted to talk to you. The pictures I saw weren\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t in the paper. Um\'85\loch\f0  uncle Sirius showed them to me."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t hide his shock at hearing this, but he looked the girl over lightly. "My \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 word, are you Jenny Paddington\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s daughter?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "I\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  how\'85\loch\f0  you know my mother?" she stammered out, clearly not expecting Harry to know who she was.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "In a manner of speaking, yes."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "When we heard what happened with Sirius, we couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t believe it. He visited us of\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ten after he broke out of Azkaban, and\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
" she choked back a sob. "I know\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  I know how much he cared\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  about you, and I\'85\loch\f0  I just wanted to offer my condolences."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry pulled the girl in front of him into a hug, and let her use his shoulder for comfort. "Thank \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 you. He was a good man," he said softly. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m glad you got to know him."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Me too," she said, drawing comfort from his sympathetic shoulder.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So," Harry said, trying to lighten the mood. "How did the daughter of the ultimate Gryffindor get sorted into Slyth\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 erin house? More to the point, how did your mother take it?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Blaise began to laugh between her sobs, until her laughter slowly replaced it. "Well, as for how, my mother blames my dad. And she took it about as well as could be expected. I got a howler."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Har\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ry laughed merrily, "Yes, that sounds like something she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d do, all right."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Zabini, who is your friend," a drawling voice called from the door.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry recognized the voice immediately and looked up to see the face of Draco Malfoy, whom Blaise seemed to disl\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ike as much as he did. When she opened her mouth to tell Malfoy who he was, she glanced over and saw Harry shake his head \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 no\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 . He figured if Malfoy wanted to be a git, he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d have some fun.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s\'85\loch\f0  a family friend," she said cryptically. "Now piss off, Malfo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 y."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Probably a mudblood," Malfoy said to the snickers of Crabbe and Goyle. "What more could be expected of a half-breed like her."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Mudblood?" Harry asked quizzically to Malfoy. "Just what is a mudblood?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Draco scoffed at Harry, still not recognizing who \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 he was. "What more can we expect from a muggle-born piece of trash." Crabbe and Goyle again snickered.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Malfoy, pi--" Zabini started but was interrupted by Harry.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Malfoy, leave before I hurt you." Harry said and then he turned back to face Blaise to conti\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
nue their conversation. He glanced up and noticed that all three boys were staring at him in shock. "What? Did I turn into a ferret and start bouncing off the walls?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Blaise snickered softly, remembering the stories she heard about the fake Moody.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 tempting --" Malfoy was saying before Harry interrupted him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes, yes. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m tempting fate because Daddy Death Eater is going to break out of Azkaban and teach me a lesson. Blah blah blah, yada yada. Is he enjoying the cell we put him in," Harry hissed up a
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t Malfoy, as realization struck him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Potter?!" Malfoy asked as he glared at Harry. "Yes, I see the resemblance now. You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll pay for what you did to my father, Potter. Your mangy little dog of a godfather was just the --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Draco Malfoy couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t finish that s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
entence because Harry calmly got to his feet, his eyes turning deep blue in the process, and he picked Malfoy up by the throat, slamming him against the wall.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Tell me," he hissed into Malfoy\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s ear, "why I shouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t snap your miserable little neck right no\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 w?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Crabbe and Goyle would have come to his defense but Blaise had her wand out and trained on both of them. "If you move you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll wake up in the infirmary," she told them. "And you know I can do it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Tell me," Harry growled into Malfoy\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s ear, "tell me why \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I shouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t kill you right here and now, you arrogant little bastard. I\hich\f0 \rquote

\par }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Malfoy\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s eyes were bulging out of his head. He was starting to lose consciousness, because Harry had cut off his air supply. He was turning an absolutely fetching shade of violet, though.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Because\'85\loch\f0  you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 re\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  not\'85\loch\f0  a killer." Malfoy gasped out.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You th\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ere! Let Mr. Malfoy go this instant," a voice called from behind him. Harry turned around and trained his flaming blue eyes on Minerva McGonogall. Upon seeing the look in his eyes she blanched with the realization that he might very well make good on his 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 hreat, then she noticed the glowing, lightning-shaped scar on his forehead.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "As you wish, Professor," Harry said and he dropped Malfoy\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s now unconscious body to the floor in a heap, "He just needed a lesson in manners." Harry smiled at them, turned, and pu
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 shed his way through the train back to his original compartment without intending to say another word.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Mr. Potter?" she asked incredulously, as Harry passed her. "Is that you?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes, Professor," Harry said quickly. "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s good to see you again." He then qu\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ickly disappeared into the crowd that had surfaced around his little scuffle.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As Harry was about to enter the compartment to rejoin the Weasleys and Hermione, a streak of black with a green spot slammed into him pinning him to the ground. Sitting on \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
top of his chest was Blaise who was grinning at him like an idiot. She quickly leaned over and planted a kiss on his cheek. She then began to spout nonsense.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Malfoy fall, bam, sweet Harry!" she said, and a perplexed expression appeared on Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "B\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 laise, that made absolutely no sense."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, sorry," she blushed lightly. "What I meant was thank you for what you did to Malfoy. You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
re my hero, now," she said as she smiled at him, not noticing the fact that most of his friends were looking out the door a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 t them\'85\loch\f0  which was good, because Ginny was glaring daggers at her.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "No problem, Blaise. Could you get off me, though? I have this nasty habit called breathing\'85\loch\f0 "
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The blonde girl smiled sheepishly then climbed off of him and offered him a hand up.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Would you \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 like to join us?" he asked, to which the Weasley brothers all began grinning like it was Christmas. They didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t notice Ginny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s reaction, or Hermione\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s, to the idea that the girl might be staying.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t want to intrude," she said shyly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, no intrus\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ion at all," Ron said immediately, earning him a glare from Hermione that he never saw.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, if you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re sure," she said with a smile and walked into their compartment. The twins, somehow, managed to maneuver it so that she was sitting right between them. \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
Harry noticed Ginny kept glaring daggers at Blaise, who pretended not to notice. Finally, once Harry had enough, he whispered into Ginny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s ear, "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re cute when you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
re jealous." Her reaction was to tighten up her face to try to hide the smile that had ap\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 eared, and turn a very pretty shade of pink much like a fresh rose.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Firs\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  years!" Hagrid\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s voice boomed out over the area. "All firs\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  years follow me."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hi, Hagrid," Harry said as he walked up to Hagrid.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Err\'85\loch\f0  hullo. Do I know yeh?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry then reali\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 zed that Hagrid hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t been told, yet, about him. This could only mean that he had just returned from his business for the Order. "Hagrid, it\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 \hich\f0 s me\'85\loch\f0  Harry," he said smiling.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry? Well prancin\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  pixies. Yeh\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve grown!" Hagrid said, grinning. "Yeh\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll have to\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  tell me all about it later. Righ
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  now I gotta get the the firs\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  years up to the castle."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded, then pointed behind Hagrid. He glanced over his shoulder then spun and broke into a run. One of the first years had prodded the Thestrals one too many t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 imes, and they didn\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 t like it. Harry chuckled to himself and walked over to where Hermione, Ginny, and Blaise were waving him over. Once the girls got past their jealousy they realized that Blaise was actually rather nice.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As Harry approached a devious ide\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
a took him. If two blushing girls were fun, then three would be hilarious. He vaguely wondered where the Weasley brothers were, but that thought quickly disappeared from his mind.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ah," he said as he approached them. "Three lovely ladies and me, alone, in \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 a carriage. What ever is a young man to do?" Hermione and Ginny, of course, began to blush profusely\'85\loch\f0 
 so much so, in fact, that their faces matched Ginny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s flame red hair. Blaise on the other hand grinned impishly at him. }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh bloody hell. This isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t going 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 to turn out well at --"}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  but Harry didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t get to finish that thought as he was abruptly cut off.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Blaise quickly pulled Harry close to her and he let out a \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 mmph\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  as she gave him a }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 very}{\fs24\kerning0 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  friendly kiss. She pushed her lightly glossed lips, tasting faintly of s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
trawberry, against his and slowly slid her tongue out and licked his top lip before she slid it softly into his mouth, teasing his tongue to play with hers. She moaned lightly into his mouth, and he closed his eyes instinctively. He vaguely thought he hea
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d a strangling noise, but immediately lost it to the lips pressed firmly against his own, the closeness of her warm body, and the smell of citrus on her hair.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry would have pulled away but he was shocked witless, so he just stood there and didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t really\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  do anything at all. He couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t say he didn
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t enjoy it, though. Once Blaise separated her lips from his, he had a goofy grin on his face much like Ron whenever someone mentioned the Quidditch game he helped win for Gryffindor.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Blaise smiled at him, then l\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 eaned in and whispered into his ear, "Mmm. You taste }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 good}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 and I definitely wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t mind doing that some more, but you really should remember that the blushing game works two ways." As she started to climb into the carriage she stopped long enough to say, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
grinning the whole time, "Well, after that little taste, Harry, I would say anything you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d like."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry turned a deep shade of red, verging on purple as he began to analyze the patch of ground between his feet. It was about that time that he realized what \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
the strangling noise he had heard was. Hermione was }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 trying}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0  to forcibly restrain Ginny who looked ready to strangle either him or Blaise\'85\loch\f0 
 or maybe both.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I can not sit near him right now. If I do, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll kill him." Ginny said to Hermione before sitting \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 down at the table, away from Harry. "I still might!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ok, Ginny, but we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll be there if you want to join us," Hermione said softly before she squeezed the younger girl\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s shoulder and walked over to sit down beside Ron who kept complaining that the sorting s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 hould come after the food. "Boys!" Hermione said huffily.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ron rolled his eyes before he glanced over at Harry and asked, "So, who do you think is doomed this year?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hrm? What are you talking about," Harry asked quizzically.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Defense Against the Dark Arts.\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  Who do you think is doomed this year?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hopefully someone who can handle it. I can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t handle another Umbridge," Harry said, trying not to smile.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I agree," Hermione said testily. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m all for theoretical study, but it is useless without the practical appli\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 cation."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well," Dean said leaning over towards them, "I heard it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll be a vampire this year."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hell, we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve had everything else, why not?" Seamus said in his soft Irish accent. "When it comes to that job, I wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t be surprised to see You-Know-Who himself,
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 " he said sending the surrounding people into laughter.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Shh!! The sorting is starting!" Hermione said giddily. "This is my favorite part!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ron rolled his eyes again at her.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ron, if you do that one more time, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll hurt you," she said, glaring at him out o\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 f the corner of her eyes causing him to smile weakly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t hurt a sick man, would you?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Your mental health is of no concern to me at the moment," she said then stuck out her tongue at him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hey --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "WATCH!" she whispered loudly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Professor McGonog\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
all had just placed the hat on its rickety stool. After a moment the brim of the hat seemed to tear open, and the hat once again spoke to the school of Hogwarts, its voice calm and bone-chillingly clear.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Dark days are coming, heed what I say; Death and de\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 struction, night and day.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Silence greeted the end of the Sorting Hat\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s song. No one who heard what was said could mistake what was meant. The Sorting Hat had warned them that Voldemort was coming, and that one person would rise against him with or w\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ithout help. Everyone in the room was looking at Harry, so he did the only thing he could think of. He jumped up as fast as he could, overturning his chair with a loud crack, and shouted, "BOO!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Everyone in the room flinched at Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s joke, but then began\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  to burst into laughter. Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s joke was sorely needed after what the Sorting Hat dropped on them. Even Snape, who normally was as dark as they come, laughed at Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s oddly executed joke.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore smiled, and raised his hand to calm everyone. "The Sor\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ting hat makes a very good point. We must unite and face Voldemort together, or we will all surely perish in the days to come. However, I am quite famished, so I believe we should get back to the sorting, so that we can begin the feast."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Everyone twitched,\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  gasped, flinched, and some even fainted at the mention of Voldemort\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s name, but, like Dumbledore, most were too hungry to really care at the time. Professor McGonogall explained how the hat worked, then began to call out names, quickly. Most of the sorti\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
g passed quickly, however a few of the first years seemed to stump the Sorting hat.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 One particularly bad case ("Harper, Prudence") had the hat tell her to choose her own house, because she was equally suited for all of them, something that seemed to shock \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
Professor McGonogall. The girl then asked the hat to explain about the houses, who was the head of each house, and the like for nearly twenty minutes. Finally, she said, "I choose Gryffindor, but which house is Harry Potter in?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry simply started bangin\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 g his head on the table, with one hand raised into the air to signal the table he was at. All his friends couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t help but to laugh at him. Even Ginny, who was still mad at him, was laughing at him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore again silenced the room and stood, looking ou\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t over his half-moon spectacles. "I have a few small announcements before we begin the feast. I will keep them short, because I am sure you
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re all just as famished as I," he said and with a wave of his wand several short looking cats appeared with a small\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 sign on each side that said simply \hich\f0 \lquote 
\loch\f0 announcements\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 . After a moment, and laughs from most of the students, he continued.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "All first years please note that the Forbidden Forest is so named for a reason. Some of our older students," he flashed a glance to Har\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ry, Hermione, and the Weasleys before continuing, "would do well to remember that, as well.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "There is, I have been told, also a rumor going around that I have employed a vampire as a professor this year. As far as I know there are no vampires among the sta\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ff. I am, however, an adventurous man, so I make no promises about next year.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Finally, I believe our new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor would like to have a word with you." This statement piqued the curiosity of most of the students, as well as t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hello, everyone," Harry said, drawing all attention to him. "My name is Harry Potter, though most of you will come to know me as Prof\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
essor Potter. I am your new Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry smiled as all eyes snapped to him. The Weasley brothers, Hermione, Ginny were in shock wondering why he hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t told them. Malfoy and his cronies were whispering in outrage. Blaise
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  was laughing like a madwoman. Behind him, at the Head table, he could feel Snape\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eyes boring into him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m looking forward to this, and I hope you are as well. This will be a fun year indeed," Harry said, grinning broadly. "But, for now, let\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eat!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .o\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Oo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "HOW COULD YOU NOT TELL US?!" Ron bellowed thunderously into the common room, as soon as they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d moved through the portrait. "We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re your friends!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I am my father\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s son," Harry said simply. "It was worth the looks on your faces to keep it a secret."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Har\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ry patted Ron on the shoulder as he was opening and closing his mouth, trying to object but being completely unable to find a response to that. He walked off and left Ron standing there, opting to sit with Ginny and Hermione. Harry glanced over at the twi
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s who kept glancing at him quickly, then going back to speaking in hushed voices. Harry tried to listen in, but the hum of the common room was making his ears useless.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So," he whispered softly into Ginny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s ear, "are you still mad at me?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes! I mean no! \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 What makes you think I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m mad?" she asked, scowling at him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, the fact that a Manticore would be hiding from the scowl you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re giving me was the first clue." He grinned at her and raked his fingers back through his already messy hair. "The other was tha
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t you almost broke Hermione\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s arm to try to get to me when Blaise kissed me."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Stop right there!" she whispered to him tersely. "I am not mad!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh?" he asked her with a grin on his face. "Then what are you?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 She mumbled something that he couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t understa\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 nd.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What was that?" he asked as a puzzled expression stole onto his face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I said," she whispered softly, "that I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 m\'85\loch\f0  jealous."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Of what?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Her. She\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s beautiful and sweet and she obviously likes you and she even kissed you," she said, staring at the ground\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "C\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 mon," he said, and grabbed her hand. "We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re going to go for a little walk."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry and Ginny walked outside the castle and headed off towards the lake. The moon was half-full and shining down creating a glittering effect as the ripples drifted ac\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ross the water. The giant squid was lazily moving across the lake, and every so often an owl would hoot in the Forbidden Forest.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Why are we out here, Harry," Ginny asked him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, I figured it would be better to talk in private. The twins seem to be pla\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 nning something, and I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t want to be interrupted."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh," she said softly as she sat down by the lake where Harry joined her.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He noticed she was shivering so he pulled up a blade of grass and with a wave of his wand he transfigured it into a warm cloak, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
which he placed around her shoulders. She smiled warmly up at him, and pulled it tighter around her.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Now, what\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s all this about Blaise," he asked suddenly, catching Ginny totally off-guard.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 She blushed softly, before she began. "Well, it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s like I said, sh\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s beautiful and --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So are you," Harry said calmly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Her eyes, which had been analyzing the grass between her feet, quickly snapped up to see Harry smiling as he stared out over the lake.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "And she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s sweet, and --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So are you," he again said to her claim\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "And she kissed you."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So did you," he said, a goofy grin appearing on his face. "So, what\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s the problem," he asked as he looked at her expectantly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Well\'85\loch\f0 " she trailed off, as she began to lose her nerve. "I guess it made me a little jealous," she said.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry frowned and looked at her as though he was disappointed at what she said. The disappointment quickly faded and he smiled at her, making her feel as if all was right in the world. Ginny couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t really decide whether he forced the disappointed look a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 way or it just happened, but she was glad it was gone. That disappointed look made her want to profess her undying love for him and ravage him right then and there.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 She mentally shook herself and thoroughly considered slapping him for making her feel this \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 way about him. She wanted to not care about him the way she did, but she couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t. She hated him because she loved him. A battle raged in her mind, one half of it fighting to kiss him the other to slap him. So, she did the best thing she could think of at\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 the time.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
Her hand cracked like a whip as she slapped him hard across the face. His eyes opened wide as her hand connected with his face, leaving a red handprint on his left cheek. Then, before he had a chance to respond, she grabbed his shirt and pulled h
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 im forward and for the second time kissed him, again by a lake. She vaguely wondered what it was about lakes, but that thought was quickly put aside so she could focus on what she was doing.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Her soft, strawberry-colored lips pressed hard against his and he\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 instinctively parted his lips for her. She snaked her arm around his head and used her body to push him back onto the grass, as she enjoyed the softness of his lips and the warmth of his body. She heard a growl of pleasure escape his throat.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 She pulled ba\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ck a moment and looked into his eyes and was surprised to see a hunger\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  a lust\'85\loch\f0 
 dancing in his eyes. She leaned forward lightly bit his lower lip, before resuming their sensuous kiss. She felt his hands slide under her shirt and a shiver exploded through \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
er as his fingers caressed her bare back.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry wrapped his arms around her waist and rolled her over so that he was on top, before he leaned in and bit down on her neck. Ginny yelped in pain for an instant, but it was quickly replaced by a groan of pleasu
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 re that simply spurred him on. She wanted him and she could feel that he wanted her, but he pushed away from her and she couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t hide the hurt she felt.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry groaned in irritation. "Damnit, Ginny, do you have any idea what you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re doing to me?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "What\'85\loch\f0  wh\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 at do you mean?" she stammered. "What I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m doing to }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 you}{\fs24\kerning0 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes. What you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re doing to }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 me}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ," he repeated accusingly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What are you talking about?" she asked curiously.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 ve kissed me twice, now\'85\loch\f0  and I almost couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t stop myself this time. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve not wanted t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
o let go. It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s like I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m underwater and you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re my last breath of air."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Is that so bad," she asked as she inched closer to him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "YES!" he shouted angrily, causing her to jump back in fear. "No. Maybe. I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny reached her hand out and intertwine\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
d her fingers with his. "You know how I feel," she said softly while hoping he would look at her, but he just nodded, and continued to look away. "Do you feel the same?" she asked through a catch in her throat.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He continued to look off towards the castle, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 trying to avoid her gaze as he thought about it. After a few long minutes, he shook his head as if clearing his mind. "I really don\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 t know Ginny. I know so much now, even what other people think of as love. But, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve grown up without it for my entire life\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know if it is even in me to care about someone that way. It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s easy to have friends\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s so much harder to love someone when the on\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s heart wrenched as she thought about the fact that the boy before her really was just tha\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
t. He might be of age and he might have the weight of the world on his shoulders, but he was still just a boy. A boy that she loved, but who just admitted he didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t really know what love was. In that instant, she resolved to show him what love really was,\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 no matter how long it took.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry, let me ask you something," she said softly. "Do you trust me?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Of course," he said without hesitation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ok, close your eyes," she said, as he glanced at her with an arched eyebrow. "Just trust me, I won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t bite\'85\loch\f0  at least\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  not yet, anyway."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He glanced at her as if she were about to do exactly that and she couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t help but chuckle, but he closed his eyes anyway. "If you bite me, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m going inside," he said.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ok, fair enough," she said as she moved towards him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry felt her\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 kneeling beside him, and his breath hitched in his throat as he wondered if she was going to kiss him again. Slowly, agonizingly so, he felt her press her palms gently against his chest. He started to voice his objections, but she put a finger to his lip
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  and spoke softly into his ear.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Shh\'85\loch\f0  Just trust me," she breathed into his ear.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He relaxed under her soft hands, and she put her palms back to his chest. She pushed softly and he fell back onto the grass once more. He felt her body press lightly against h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
is side as she lay there on the grass beside him, and he shivered as he felt her hot breath on his neck. She pulled him to his side and rested his head on her shoulder and simply held him, and he felt safe as he fell asleep in her arms.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry? Harry\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ," he heard someone saying softly into his ear, "it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s time to wake up."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He stirred slightly and realized there was someone very soft and warm next to him. He opened his eyes tentatively to find Ginny smiling softly at him. As she caressed his face with her\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 soft fingers, the rising sun made her hair seem as if it were on fire.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ginny?" he asked tentatively.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Are we outside?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Why?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Because after you fell asleep I didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t have the heart to wake you up."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Oh\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  thank you\'85\loch\f0  for staying with me, I mea\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t leave you, Harry," she said and smiled at him again, a smile that for some reason made him feel both warm and safe. "Now, please wake up? My arm has fallen asleep\'85\loch\f0 "

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sorry," he stammered, as he stood and helped her up. Her legs were\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t altogether steady, though, because she fell forward and he caught her at the last minute.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Thank you," she mumbled as she began to turn a soft, rose-like color.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hey, none of that right now," he said with a grin. "I like watching you blush, but you can\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0  at least wait a few hours\'85\loch\f0  we did just sleep together after all."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "WE DID WHAT?!" Harry heard someone shout from behind him at the same time as Ginny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hand covered her face. He turned to see who it was, granting him just enough time to throw up a shield 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 for the fist flying at his head to slam into. Ron apparently heard him, and misunderstood. "That\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s it, Potter, time to die!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ron, calm down," Harry tried saying, but Ron was already swinging at him again so he dodged away leading Ron away from Ginny, so s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 he wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t accidentally be hit. Harry continued to dodge and leap away from Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s blows, trying to wait until he wore himself out. It was not to be.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ron noticed that he wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t going to be able to hit Harry the normal way, because Harry was simply too fast\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 for him. So, he shifted into his shadow form and swung at Harry, who tried to dodge, but in Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s shade form he could stretch his arm. As Harry tried to dodge, Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s fist connected with his jaw, knocking him to the ground and placing a nice cut on his li\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 . Both Ron and Harry were ignoring Ginny who was shouting at them to stop.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ron, I tried to give you a chance to liste--" Harry was cut off mid-sentence by Ron, who backhanded him hard across the face, knocking him back to the ground. As Ron swung his fist\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 toward Harry again, he caught it and jerked it towards him. Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s shadow-covered body stumbled forward, and Harry backhanded him hard across the jaw. Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s head snapped back and he flailed as he soared through the air landing in the lake.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry simply wat\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ched with an emotionless face as Ron trudged back out, spouting obscenities and threats at him. When Ron drew back to punch him again, something began to pull him back. Harry glanced over and saw that Ginny had put up with all she was going to from either
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 of them.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Let me go!" Ron yelled at her, as the lake held him in place.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "NO!" she shouted back. "If you would listen, instead of jumping to stupid conclusions, I wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t even be having to do this!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I agree," Harry said.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Be quiet, Harry. I think my broth\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
er needs proof that I can take care of myself." She smiled grimly at her brother. The water near him began to swirl and take shape in front of his eyes. Slowly, a fluid copy of the giant squid emerged, and it swung one of its giant tentacles like a whip, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 k\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 nocking Ron out of the water and back onto solid ground.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ow," he groaned as he tried to stand. She wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t going to let that happen, though. He looked up just in time to see a very large ram, formed of solid stone no less, rise out of the ground. A second 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 later it butted him hard in the ribs knocking his shadow-covered body spread eagle onto the ground again. He grimaced as he glanced up at the stone beast which kept scratching at the ground with one hoof.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ginny, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m --" he was interrupted this time by a f\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
iery phoenix as it burned a hole through his body, causing him to scream in agony. He gasped as he tried to reform the hole the phoenix had burned through him, finding it hard to breathe. Harry watched calmly as Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s shadowy body reformed into its origin\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 l state\'85\loch\f0  not without some small amount of pain on Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s part, though.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ginny, please --" again he was interrupted as a sword point was pressed against his throat. He looked up to see his sister standing over him covered in a suit of crystal-clear ice-armor\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 with spiked and dangerous looking edges.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Tell, me, Ron," she hissed at him, "do you think that if anything did happen between Harry and I that it was not willing on my part?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He glanced nervously at the sword point pressed against his throat, then back u\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 p at his obviously very perturbed sister. "No?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Good answer. Now, apologize to Harry. Nothing happened last night, but if it ever does it won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t be any of your business," she growled.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "M\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 sorry," Ron mumbled out as he shifted back into his human form. Ginny\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  spun on her heels and all of her constructs faded away, as she stomped towards Harry.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sorry about this," she whispered to him before giving him a peck on the cheek. "But, I really did enjoy our time together."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry smiled softly at her and whispered\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  back, "So did I. Best night\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s sleep I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve had in months."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 She gave him a quick hug, glared once more at her brother and headed for the castle. Harry watched in amusement and Ron in bemusement as the fiery-tempered woman sauntered off, leaving them alone.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 You know, mate," Ron said after a moment, "if anything did happen, I feel sorry for you."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry furrowed his brow and he looked quizzically at Ron, "Why\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s that?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Because, you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll be stuck with her."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry sat back in his chair as the bell rang, and h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
e watched as people flittered past his door, some taking a moment to glance in out of curiosity, but most continuing to pass in a hurry. He put his hands behind his head and leaned back while his class filtered in. His first class of the day would have to
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
be with Malfoy, else it would have been a good day, he thought. He had just begun planning a good way to make Malfoy force him to turn the little arse into a ferret and bounce him off the walls when the bell sounded.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry glanced out over first class, con\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 sisting of Slytherins and Gryffindors, and noticed that Malfoy was absent. As he finished calling attendance, Malfoy sauntered in and sat down. "Malfoy, you

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes," he drawled confidently, but his eyes betrayed his fear.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry decided then that he\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  would not let Malfoy get to him, today. "Why?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I had to speak with Professor Snape about something."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Very well," Harry said smiling. "Let\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s begin. Who here believes I am not qualified to teach you?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Most of the students looked apprehensive, but the Slyt\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 herins all raised their hands, except for Blaise. Harry grinned inwardly, because he was going to enjoy this.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Very well," Harry said as he smiled to them all. "Pick one person to duel me. If I win, you will accept me as your professor and do your best to \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 pay attention in my class."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "And when you lose?" a sneering voice that Harry recognized instantly asked from the door.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "}{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 If}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  I lose, professor, I will resign my position and suggest you as my replacement," Harry said with a smirk on his face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "We choose Prof\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 essor Snape," Malfoy drawled, his fears put to rest with his trusted head of house with him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I would rather not do that," Harry said quickly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Afraid, Potter?" Snape sneered.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No," Harry said with a frown on his face. "Clear the desks away, please."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 There\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  was a scraping sound as all the desks were moved away from the center of the classroom. Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s class divided into two groups who formed a straight line as the boundary for the duel. Snape had a cocky sneer on his face as they bowed to each other, and pr\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 pared to begin.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hermione, please decide for us when to begin," Harry asked her, and she nodded.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As soon as she began to tell them to start, Snape was shouting out "}{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Expelliarmus!}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
" Harry simply let it hit him and his wand flew from his hand straight into Sn\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ape\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s open fingers. He grinned and handed both wands to Malfoy, and walked towards Harry intently.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As Snape approached he turned his walk into a jog and Harry met him in the center of their arena. They began to trade blows, blocking each other in what appe\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ared to be a well-choreographed dance. Snape would kick, Harry would jump over it, Harry would punch, and Snape would try to throw him off balance.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Finally, Harry became bored with waiting on Snape to realize that he was holding back on him, so he decided \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
to up the ante on their little game. When Snape swung at Harry again, he snaked the meeting arm over, around, and under Snape\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s and levered it tightly behind his back with his fist pressed into the other man\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 s chest. With a quick jerk he dislocated Snape\hich\f0 \rquote \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  shoulder with a nasty pop.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
Everyone in the class groaned and screwed up their face when they heard it, but Snape refused to make a sound. He instead kicked his opposing leg up in an attempt to hit Harry in the face, but Harry noticed his movements and pre
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 pared himself. With Snape\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s dislocated arm still in his grip he leaned back pulling Snape off balance mid-kick. He quickly straightened and kicked Snape\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 
s legs out from under him. Snape groaned in pain\'85\loch\f0  Harry hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t let go of his dislocated arm, and was h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 lding him up by it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m done," Harry said quietly, but everyone in the room heard him. The quiet that had fallen over the class was so perfect you could hear each breath taken.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No -- Potter," Snape grunted as he pushed himself up with his good arm, the o\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ther hanging limply at his side. "This is not over yet."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Before Harry could object Snape was again attacking him. He tried, unsuccessfully, to wait him out, but the greasy-haired, potions professor was determined not to lose. It was when Snape began blindl\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
y attacking him, almost hitting students, that Harry realized he had to end this before Snape hurt someone. When Snape attempted to backhand him Harry saw his opportunity and grabbed Snape by the robes and rammed his forehead into Snape\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 s nose. He let the\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 man slump to the ground unconscious.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So," Harry said menacingly as he looked up at the class, his face covered in blood, "who still thinks I am not fit to teach."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 No one said a word.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "That problem can be corrected," he hissed dangerously.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 They paid no attention to Pettigrew, who was on his knees spitting up blood onto the ground, as they returned to Voldemort\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s private quarters. Shortly thereafter Pettigrew heard a bone-chilling scream a

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry entered the common room after his first day, and the hum abruptly halted. He groaned inwardly as he noticed that all of them were loo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 When Harry sat down beside her, Ron looked over and started to s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
cowl, but immediately looked away when Ginny caught him. Harry chuckled to himself as he watched this continue for several minutes. Ginny would look down at her book, Ron would look up and scowl, she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d catch him, and he\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 d look away quickly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ginny, help me\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ." Harry pleaded, once he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d finished laughing at Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s goofy behavior.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 She glanced up at him worriedly, and asked, "What\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s wrong?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, let\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s see. I woke up this morning to get pounded on by one of my best friends, I spent two hours taking my transfigura\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry looked up at her to again plead for her help, and realized that her face was a soft rose color and slowly darkening to a pretty raspberry-\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
like shade. He grinned at her, but decided not to tease her about it. He couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He wa\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
s snapped out of his reverie when she abruptly hit him in the head with the book she was reading. He realized it was unintentional when she jumped up and started stalking towards the table Ron was sitting at. The twins promptly vacated the premises, optin
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  instead to sit by Harry.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hey, Harry," Fred said.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "We heard you slept with our sister," George tossed out from nowhere.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry tried not to blush, but it was a futile effort. He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d not been expecting such a proclamation and so he simply reacted the best way\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 he could think of. He started stammering incoherently.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Calm down," Fred said quickly. "We didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t mean it like that!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "We know better than to call Ginny a scarlet woman, especially concerning you."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 George and Fred again glanced at each other, that grin plastered on their faces.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yeah, I was wondering that myself," piped George. "We heard she more or less propositioned you."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry chuckled at hearing this. Hermione must have told Ron, who must have mentioned it to the twins. Which would also explain\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 why Ron was ready to beat him bloody earlier. He must have thought that Harry was trying to swing two girls at once, one of which is his little sister.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Blaise is the daughter Sirius\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0  ex-fianc\'e9\loch\f0 e," he said. As he noticed the looks on their faces he added, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No, she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So, you have no romantic interests in her at all?" the twins asked in unison. "You have to admit, s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 he is }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 hot}{\fs24\kerning0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry tried to stifle a laugh, but couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t help it. Harry\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  laughed all the more when Snape glared at them both and promptly left.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry, can I ask you a personal question?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You just did, but I can let you have one more," he said chuckling softly. "But I make no promise to answer it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 She looked at him intently \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 for a moment, then asked him her question. "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 re sweet, friendly, handsome, and all that\'85\loch\f0  so why don\hich\f0 \rquote

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, no, but I want to know who \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 has been gossiping about me!" he said, laughing.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 A hopeful look appeared on her face for an instant and she asked, "Well, is there anyone you fancy?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 It was Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s turn to frown, at this. He really didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know what to tell her, because he really didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t kn\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ow the answer. He liked Ginny, true enough, but he also liked Blaise. With Ginny it was a long-standing friendship, with Blaise it was an almost animal magnetism drawing him to her.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sort of," he answered, deciding to try to keep his answers as cryptic as \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 possible. She scrunched up her face and stuck out her tongue.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I think you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re just trying not to tell me," she said with a hint of irritation in her voice.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Maybe, maybe not."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 She then looked at him thoughtfully for a minute or so, then leaned in close to \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
him. Whispering softly into his ear, so that her breath was teasing his face, she asked him a question that brought a slow, rosy flush rising to his cheeks and left his eyes wide in surprise.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Just think about it," Blaise purred so\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ftly into Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

t pay it much attention. He was still pondering four small, yet sig\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ificant, words.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Just think about it," she told him\'85\loch\f0 
 and that he did. For the next ten minutes, anyway, and then he blocked it from his mind so he could concentrate on other matters. In five minutes he had double potions, where he could only assume that Sn\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ape would get his revenge for the previous day.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry glanced around the Great Hall to notice that everyone was staring at him. He then realized why. Ron and Hermione were sitting in front of him waving at him frantically, trying to get his attention. They
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  both had very worried expressions, and their mouths were moving but he didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t hear anything.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "HARRY!" Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s voice finally broke through the daze in his mind.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "There\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s no need to shout, Ron," he said while wincing. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sitting right in front of you."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 need to shout?!" asked Hermione, her voice shaky. "We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, sorry. I was just thinking, and I guess I got a bit distracted."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You th\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ink?!" Ron replied sarcastically.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Once Hermione and Ron stopped acting like fish out of water, the Great Hall returned to its familiar buzz. Ron and Hermione stood with their books in hand and latched onto Harry. It seemed they were intent on making sure h

\par }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Bloody hell! Skiving off potions is a brilliant idea!"}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 Harry thought as he was being pulled out of the doors to the Great Hall toward the dungeon. The thought of trying to trick them occurred to him, but he knew \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 that while he might be able to convince Ron, Hermione wouldn\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 t fall for it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the potions dungeon intent on sitting as far from the front as possible. The idea was a lost cause, however, because the rest of the Gryffindors in\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 the class had the same idea. The only available seat was directly in front of Snape\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s desk.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "If I didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know any better," Ron whispered irritably, "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d say Snape planned this!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry started to agree wholeheartedly, however Snape had just whisked into th\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
e room with his robes billowing behind him as if someone was walking behind him to hold them up. He arrived at the front of the classroom and faced the class. The first thing Snape seemed to notice was where Harry was sitting.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Snape smiled maliciously at H\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
arry, and sat on top of his desk. "It seems our Hogwarts celebrity, Potter," Snape indicated Harry with a sneer in his direction, "knows more than we could have ever guessed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "After our little duel yesterday, I am still a bit out of sorts. I will be turnin\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 g the class over to }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Professor}{\fs24\kerning0 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  Potter, today." The contemptuous smirk on Snape\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face was unmistakable. He was trying to embarrass Harry. "I will be but a humble observer, today."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 A soft chuckle broke out among the Slytherins as Snape waited on Harry to ste\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
p forward. Harry knew better than to refuse. He tried to refuse the duel and all that got him was the mess he was in now. So, resignedly, he stood and walked to the front of the class.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I had planned to explain the Potis potion, however --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s too\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 simple for this class, Professor," Harry interrupted, ignoring the scowls from Snape as well as the class. Snape was angry at the interruption, the class was angry because Harry seemed to be choosing something harder for them to do than Snape had origina
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ly planned. "Will you be testing the potion yourself, Professor, to insure that I have done it properly?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Another malicious grin spread over Snape\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face. "Certainly, }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Professor}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 . I could do no less, you understand."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Of course, Professor," Harry said, then \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
faced the class to address them. "Today we will be preparing Veritaserum. I understand that is a N.E.W.T. level potion, however I have faith that you will all do well." Harry smiled warmly over his temporary class.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry took a sidelong glance at Snape who\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 se grin had been utterly annihilated by what he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d agreed to do. Harry smiled inwardly and retrieved the necessary supplies from the potions cabinet. Snape was still to horrified by his agreement to speak, so he simply glared at Harry.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Before we begin, are\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0  there any questions?" Harry asked warmly. "Oh, come now\'85\loch\f0  don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t be shy."
\par }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Malfoy,"}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  Harry thought to himself as the familiar drawl pierced the quiet, }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
"would have to be the first to speak up."
\par }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Potter --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Pardon?" Harry asked as if he had not heard Malfoy.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Potter --" Malfoy said a bit more loudly, before he was interrupted again.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "That will be ten points from Slytherin," Harry said as he frowned at Malfoy. Malfoy\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s mocking smile quickly changed to shock when he saw the tiny emeralds used to keep house score
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s evaporating from the Slytherin tally. "When I am teaching, Malfoy, you will address me as Professor, or Professor Potter," Harry irritably told the blonde-haired Slytherin.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Snape, who had been sitting in silent anger, snorted at Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s statement. He had\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 decided that the chances of Harry creating a working Veritaserum potion was very unlikely, and as such he returned to thinly-veiled mockery.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sorry, }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Professor}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  Potter," Malfoy said as he tried unconvincingly to hide the malice in his voice, "how are we goi

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Snape\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s ears perked up as his favorite pupil said this. He wondered why he had not remembered that fact himself. He knew the potion didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t take that long to mature, but it did take t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 hree days. The worst that Potter could do to him, he remembered, was to brew the potion. He couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t test it!
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "That, Malfoy, is true only if you need full strength Veritaserum. We do not need it to be as strong to verify that it works." Harry grinned tooth\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ily at the class. "Now, let\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s begin. I will demonstrate, you follow. Take notes as we go, please."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry pulled out a silver Unicorn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s horn, chopping it into equal portions. "You will be working in groups of two, to conserve supplies. That which is not in \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
your potions kit will be provided for you," he said calmly as he finished with the horn. "Could I have a volunteer, please?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hand instinctively shot up, and it was the only one in the entire class. Everyone else was too busy fretting over his or\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  her coming potion.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Very well, Hermione," Harry said with a smile in his voice. "Please pass out the Unicorn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s horn. One piece of the horn to each pair, please. Oh, and five points to Gryffindor."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione was positively beaming as she passed out the horn\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 . By just raising her hand she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d earned Gryffindor five points. Once she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d finished she returned to her seat.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Now," Harry said as he positioned the horn below his knife, "take the horn and lay it on the flat side. Dice the horn into one eighth of an inch \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
cubes. When finished please slam your knife point into your desk."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Once Harry heard the audible whump of the knives slamming into the wood of their desks, he walked around the desks, analyzing the cubes. He gave minor comments as he passed, earning him gla\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
res from many of the Slytherins who were never criticized in the potions class. }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Too large, Malfoy. Wrong shape, Parkinson. Wrong }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ingredient}{\i\fs24\kerning0 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 , Goyle.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Class, please have a look at Mr. Longbottom," Harry said as he stood over Neville who \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
was now quivering in fear that he was about to be mocked, again. As the class surrounded Harry, Neville began to run over in his mind what he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d done wrong.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Longbottom is a walking potions disaster, }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Professor}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 . You should know that by now," Snape sneered be\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "His work is a prime example of the }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 perfect}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  way to dice a Unicorn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s horn," Harry said, ignoring Snape\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 s comment. "Ten points to Gryffindor, Mr. Longbottom."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Neville almost fell off of\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  his stool as Harry made this pronouncement. A blush appeared on his face, but he couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t hide the smile that appeared on his face behind the tears that had almost rolled down his face a moment before. Harry patted Neville on the back and walked back to \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 he front of the class.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Next we must balance the Unicorn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s hand again instinctively flew above her head. Harry noticed it, but decided to give someone else a try. Harry noticed Blaise had her hand above her head, as well\'85\loch\f0 
 the only Slytherin to do so, in fact.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Blaise?" he called.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Dragon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s blood."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Very good, ten points to Slytherin," Harry said, earning him a shocked look from everyone in the room as well as a disbelieving look from Ron who couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t believe he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d give points to Slytherin.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Now, who can tell me why?" he asked, but no one moved\'85\loch\f0  not \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 even Hermione. "Very well, Dragon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s blood, the way it is used here, is a curative. It restores the person to their natural state. The more blood used, the more quickly they will recover from the Veritaserum."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry smiled and pulled out several small cryst\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 al bottles. "The blood must be contained in crystal, else it will be tainted. Glass is }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 not}{

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Malfoy\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hand snapped into the air, earning him odd glances from everyone, including Snape. He volunteered hopi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ng to gain points for his house, for those he\hich\f0 \rquote

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Now, for our purposes, two drops of Dragon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s blood will suffice. More will destroy the horn; less will taint the potio\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "One person from each group please come up and collect a silver pestle. A silver pestle }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 must}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Now, take two cubes of the horn and crush it into a fine powder. Grind it as fine as you can," Harry said as he mashed his horn into a fine dust. "Now, on\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ce you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry grinned as he heard them. "If everything has gone to\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  plan so far," Harry said smiling, "your mix should turn a light pink."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Snape watched with veiled interest as Harry explained this potion to them. He recognized the ingredients as those of the potion Harry claimed to be brewing, but this was not the proper\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 procedure to brew Veritaserum. He wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t sure what the result would be, but he was almost positive that it would be either disastrous or amazing. Little did the greasy man know that it would be both.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry walked around the room looking at the pastes his \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
class had created. "Very good, Malfoy. Slightly too much blood, but not enough to harm the potion," he said as he passed the pest. "Crabbe, I said four ounces, not eight, that is why it is orange. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m afraid you fail. We don
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t have time for you to catch u\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 . Clean up and each of you join another group and watch."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry returned to the front of the class, and picked up his bottle of blood. "Take your bottle and pour the rest into the cauldron with the water. Place it back on the fire and let it boil until it \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
emits a sweet vapor. When you hear a small pop, take it back off the fire."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 After the various pops from the blood-water filled the room, they removed the mix from the fire, and waited for instructions. The entire class, even the normally irksome Slytherins\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
, had become eager pupils.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Heat your obsidian stir until you can feel the heat on the handle, then stir the contents of your bowl clockwise for one minute and twenty-three seconds. No more and no less. Once you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ve done that, heat it again and stir it coun\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ter-clockwise for the same amount of time."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry retrieved the three final ingredients from the normally locked cabinet and returned to the front of the class to find everyone waiting patiently for the next bit of instruction. He grinned happily as he wat
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ched Snape without being seen.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "In your kit you should have two lotus blossoms. Please take out two of them and pull off all the petals. Once you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ve done this, burn three of the petals and pour the ash into the cauldron. Place three of the unharmed petals \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 into the bowl."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
There were loud yelps as the petals dropped into the bowls burst into flames. Harry chuckled as he walked around with a crystal vial full of a clear liquid. "Remove all but two of the remaining lotus petals," he instructed. He walked quickl
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 y around the room and poured a single drop of the clear liquid on each of their two remaining petals.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Once he returned to the front of the class, he held up the bottle and said, "Phoenix tears." Most of the class gasped, a few whispered among themselves. "\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 In a normal Veritaserum potion this wouldn
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t be done. I, however, do not wish to poison anyone. Since we are not using the proper maturation cycle, this must be done else the potion will be quite fatal. Burn one of the petals and add the ash to the cauldr
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n. Place the other in the bowl."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Again the petals caught fire, but the yelps were absent as most expected the fires this time. "Very good," Harry said happily. "Who can tell me what the nectar of Jupiter is?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hand shot up, and Neville\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s slowly r\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ose into the air above his head.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Mr. Longbottom?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "The nectar of J-J-Jupiter," Neville stammered since he hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t expected to be called on, "is an herbal drug for relaxing the mind. I-I-It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s mainly used for people w-wh-who need to relax, or are hysterical \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 due to some f-fo-form of mental stress."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione and Ron glanced at each other as they realized why Neville knew the answer. His parents had been tortured into insanity by the Cruciatus Curse. They likely needed the nectar of Jupiter whenever they remembe
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 red what happened to them. A snort from Malfoy\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s direction earned him a glare from the both of them, which he ignored. Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s glare, however, caused him to turn very pale and hide his eyes behind his hand.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry turned back to Neville and smiled warmly at\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  the young man, and nodded his head. "Very good, Mr. Longbottom. Twenty points to Gryffindor.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Now, you will add one ounce of the nectar of Jupiter to your cauldron," Harry said as he measured out the liquid into small bottles for the class. "It isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t as n\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ecessary to be exact with this ingredient as others, because this simply relaxes the person being questioned. But, you must be careful to remain close to the proper amount.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "A nervous or excitable interrogatee is useless, as is one who is so relaxed that t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 hey can not open their mouth. The closer to the proper amount, the easier your job will be when questioning them.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Now, with your silver stir, stir the concoction in the cauldron counterclockwise for one minute exactly. If done properly you will hear a sig\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
hing sound, and then a very citrus-like smell, much like that of oranges or lemons."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Everyone smiled as they smelled the orange and lemon odor that pervaded the room.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Very good," Harry said as he inhaled deeply. "Smells delicious. Now, for the final ingre\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 dient," Harry said with a smile. "A pinch of plain sugar."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Everyone in the room, including Snape, looked at Harry as if he were completely off his rocker. "Common sugar?!" Snape snapped from his seat. "Do you know nothing about the intricacy of the Veritas\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
erum potion?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Indeed I do, Professor," Harry said with a mischievous smile on his face. "I also know that there is no need for someone to gag themselves to death every time they quaff one of your vile potions.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Now, as I was saying before I was so rudely\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 interrupted, add a single pinch of common sugar, then combine the contents of your bowl into your cauldron. Bring it to a boil once more. Once it is boiling let it boil for precisely four minutes and eight seconds.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "This will burn off any impurities in th\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
e potion, so that you get the prime effect from it. Once the time is up immediately remove the cauldron from the fire and place a lid over your cauldron. They need to mature for seventeen minutes exactly in the dark.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 If you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve done everything properly then\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 the lid of your cauldron will pop off after the seventeen minutes is up. You will need to be ready to catch it. I will not be sending anyone to the infirmary due to negligence," he said with a grin so that everyone knew he was joking.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 After the time was u\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
p, the lids did indeed fly from their respective cauldrons. Harry went around and sniffed each of the potions, and looked at the color. Once he was done he stood at the front of the class with a grim expression on his face, and muttered the charm to empty
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 all the cauldrons. Everyone in the class looked shocked that he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d done this, and many cried out in outrage.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You all did very well," Harry said, the grim expression being replaced with one of excitement that everyone created a proper potion, except for of \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
course Crabbe and his partner, Goyle, who failed miserably. "Full marks for everyone except Crabbe and Goyle, and twenty points to both your houses. Crabbe, Goyle, since neither of you argued with me about failing half marks to both.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "And, now for the test\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ing. Professor Snape, if you would?" Harry said a grin of pure joy lighting up his face. Snape rose and walked to the front of the class with a sneer on his face. He was fully expecting the potion to fail, having watched it being created.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You realize, Pot\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ter," Snape said through the corner of his mouth, "that you didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t create Veritaserum, right?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh? We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll see," Harry said, a mysterious smile on his face. He then turned and addressed the class. "One drop in eight ounces of water is enough for a test, I b\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
elieve," he said as he handed Snape the glass. "Please, drink it all."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Snape guzzled down the substance and felt nothing, and a smug smirk appeared on his face. A moment later he felt the first twinges of a full strength Veritaserum taking him, and he thou\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Everyone in the class watched, with some measure of amusement, the look on Snape\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s face. He was smiling\'85\loch\f0  not the sneer, th\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
e malicious grin, or any of that, but a smile of pure joy. He looked truly happy. It looked like something he hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t done in years, and seemed very much out of place on him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Tell me, Professor," Harry said softly, "are you a professor at Hogwarts?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes,"\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  he responded from his trance-like state.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Are you the head of one of the four houses?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes, the Slytherin house."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Were you truly unable to teach today?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Why did you ask me to teach?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I wanted to embarrass you for what you did to me during our du\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 el."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Do you wish you could stop yourself from responding to me?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Absolutely."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So, class," Harry said, turning to address them, "as you can see, the potion works quite well. It should wear off in the next two hours, or thereabout. In the mean time, class\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  is dismissed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "If anyone needs me, I am going to take Professor Snape to his room and lock him in until this wears off. I am quite sure he wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t wish to walk around under the influence of Veritaserum," Harry said, gaining him chuckles from the Gryffind\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ors. Harry then led the unhappily truthful professor from the room.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Come in, Harry," Dumbledore called.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry opened the door and stepped into the office. Fawkes looked up at him from his perch and nearly fell off. The phoenix trilled sharply at Dum\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 bledore, who smiled and nodded.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Amazing. Even Fawkes can read me like a book," Harry said with a bit of a frown, and Dumbledore\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s head snapped to him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You understood him?" Dumbledore asked quickly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded an affirmative, gaining him a curious glanc\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e from Dumbledore. "Are you a phenixian, Harry?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Harry shook his head. "Not exactly\'85\loch\f0  one of the people who touched the tear was a phenixian. It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s sort of the same way I became a parseltongue."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore nodded, as he began to formulate ideas. "Interesting\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
, very interesting," he muttered before remembering that Harry came to visit him, presumably for a reason. "What can I do for you, Harry?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, I came to tell you that someone will need to take Snape\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s classes for the next few hours. It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d be safer if the\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
y did it for the rest of the day," Harry said softly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore shook his head trying to get the thought that Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d beat him senseless again out of his mind. "You didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Of course not. You know as well as I do that I was only defending myself," Har\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ry said gaining a sigh of relief from Dumbledore. "No, he wanted to embarrass me, so he forced me to teach his class, today. He agreed to test the potion himself, and I mixed a batch of Veritaserum."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It takes three days to brew Veritaserum, Harry." Dumble\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 dore said quietly, though it was more a question than a statement.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Veritas Erum was a brilliant man, grandfather. He released only the first working Veritaserum potion he created, since it was the safest. I gave Severus a weaker variety of one of Veritas\hich\f0 \rquote

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No worries, sir, I took the necessary precautions. I keyed the potion to my family li\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ne. Only someone related to me can make him answer their questions, which is\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  well

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh? This could be very useful," Dumbledore said as he considered what was said.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded as he pulled out four vials of the potion he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d just made and handed them\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  to his grandfather. "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore nodded, "Well, I suppose I will take his classes for the rest of the day, then." A smile appeared on Dumbledore\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face. "It has been many years since I have taugh\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I also wanted to talk to you about something else," Harry said quietly. "It has to do with the Order."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Do any of you know what a Runemaster is?" asked Harry softly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I read something about them, once," \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Bill Weasley said while he thought about it. "They could imbue magic into a symbol, or something like that."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Close enough," Harry said as he held up a piece of parchment with a drawing of a phoenix who looked identical to Fawkes, except it was silver inst\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ead of red, on it. "This was drawn by a Runemaster. It holds several types of magic in it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry rolled up his sleeve and showed them a duplicate of the phoenix. It was emblazoned onto his arm. Slowly the tattoo disappeared from his arm, then reappeared. \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
He touched the charm and disappeared and reappeared in the center of the group.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded and whispered, "Bit of a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  sting." He placed the paper on Dumbledore\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 since you started flirting with her."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry scratched his head as he thought about it. "I guess, but she should understand that shoving me away like that isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t going to make me fall into her arms anytime soon. It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Zane and Hermione reached out and touched the m\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ark and Harry activated the portkey. They arrived outside Hagrid\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hut with Hermione looking surprised and Harry laughing.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hey, Ron," Harry said as he sat down in the now grassy classroom. "How\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s the plan \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 going to get me back for being an insensitive jerk?"

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 And that it was. They had an uneventful class and just went over everything they had from their fifth year. Trying to divine the future by t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 While Harry was in Divination, down in the dungeons Albus Dumbledore was teaching his first class in many a year. As he walked into the class of fir\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
st years, he smiled at them all. "I welcome you to potions. Professor Snape is ill today and I will be teaching your class."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Prof -- Head -- Sir?" a young Ravenclaw asked timidly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You may call me Professor, if it will help," he said with a comforting smi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 le. "Now, you had a question, Tonya?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Will you be teaching potions for long?" Tonya asked hopefully.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, as soon as Professor Snape is better he will be returning," Dumbledore said with a soft smile, gaining frowns from the entire class composed of Huf\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 flepuffs and Ravenclaws.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Today we will be making a Forgetfulness potion," Dumbledore said as he wrote the directions on the board. "Hopefully I haven\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t forgotten how," he said with a chuckle.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ok, let\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s begin." And that they did. They worked the entire cl\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ass, and it was discovered, by most of the first years present, that Dumbledore couldn\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 t make a potion to save his life. His first mistake was to melt his cauldron, which he repaired effortlessly. He then combined two rather explosive ingredients, which d\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
cided they would rather join the rest of the class. Finally, Dumbledore seemed to get into the swing of things and they made it through most of the potion.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As they were about to add the last two ingredients, Dumbledore mixed them up. The class, having beco\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
me less than vigilant since he seemed to know what he was doing after his brief stint of clumsiness, followed suit.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As their potions exploded in their faces, Dumbledore\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s singeing a part of his beard in the process, Tonya raised her hand once again. She wa\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
s the first and last person to raise their hand during that class.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes, Tonya," Dumbledore asked with that soft small of his.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Please tell Professor Snape I hope he gets well soon," she said with a grimace as she tried to wipe the destroyed potion off of \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
her robes. The entire class nodded in agreement, with a few murmurs of "Me too."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore had that familiar twinkle in his eye as he thought, }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So do I, child, so do I."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "That, Potter," Snape said with a sneer as he shook his hand a bit to relieve the sting of his punch, "is the least of what you \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 deserve."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "If you say so, Severus," Harry said as he stood up and dusted himself off. "Was nice talking with you. I have work to do, though."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Famous little Potter gets what he deserves, and his fame still drags him away," Snape taunted.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry growled at t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 he smirking potions professor. "Well, Severus," he said softly, "what I deserved was taken from me when I was a child by Voldemort, a man }{\i\fs24\kerning0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh," she said with \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a relieved laugh.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Have a seat."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 She moved in and sat beside him, glancing furtively at him every so often. "I noticed you didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t come to dinner," she said tentatively.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded quietly and continued to stare at the first years who were in a playful wr\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 estling match with the squid. "I wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t hungry."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh," she said with a frown. She pulled a piece of chicken and two rolls wrapped in a napkin out of her robes. "I guess you don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t want these, then."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry glanced over and noticed the food, then smiled. "Tha\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 nks," he said as he took one of the rolls and began to munch on it. "Not really hungry, but I suppose I should eat }{\i\fs24\kerning0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Because you run off doing something stupid a lot?!" she said as she scowled at him from his chest. "I have a good mind not to move. Least then you won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t run \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry heard a \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 harumph\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 and looked up in time to see Ginny stalking up the stairs, and he groaned inwardly. "Can I stand up, now, Blaise? I promise not to run off trying to get myself killed at least for the rest of the\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  night," he said with a grin.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, fine. But, if you do I get to chain you up in my bedroom," she said with a frown.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I thought the purpose was to get me }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 not}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 to try to get myself killed," he said with an impish grin, and she slowly turned a rose color. Aft\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 er he dusted himself off, he leaned over and whispered into her ear, "Gotcha."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Her immediate reaction was to slap him again, this time on the arm. "Well, I could think of a few things to say that would turn you as red as a Chinese Fireball," she said with \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a grin. "But, I

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Question?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Just think about it," she reminded him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh," he said with a nervous smile. "Well, I really don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know, Blaise," he said honestly. "The closest I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve had to a girlfriend was Cho Chang\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 She nodded but not without some small amount of disappointment. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve really only known you for three days.\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m not asking you to promise me marriage, especially not after that short a time. I just want the chance to get to know you. If anything more comes of that, then so be it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I know you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re attracted to me. I could feel it when I kissed you," she said with \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a mischievous grin. "I just want the chance to see if anything more comes of it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded. While they were talking they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d ended up in front of the Slytherin portrait hole. Blaise grabbed Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hand and pulled him into a guard post where a set of arm
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 or was standing, and she kissed him once again. This time it was a soft, tender kiss though still passion-filled like the kiss from the day before.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Instinctively he kissed her back, and he found he quite enjoyed it, and obviously so did she. They continued\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 like that until the armor tapped them and pointed quietly. They both looked up to find Snape glaring at them. Blaise quickly kissed Harry on the cheek and disappeared.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Watch out, Severus," Harry said as he turned to walk away. "Your mother may not have m\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 entioned it, but if you keep making faces it could end up stuck like that."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As Harry clamored through the portrait hole into the empty common room, he was rather surprised. Normally people were still up at this hour, but it was entirely empty, he tho\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ught. Then he noticed someone sitting in one of the chairs in front of the heatless fire.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Where is everyone," Harry asked to whoever was on the chair.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "They left after I knocked out the twins," Ginny replied coolly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You did what?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I knocked out the twi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ns," she repeated irritably.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Why?" Harry asked in genuine curiosity
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "They mocked me at the wrong time," she said calmly, "so I kicked them both in the head."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry laughed as he sat down beside her, in the other chair. "Interesting way to handle it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 uppose. I finally figured out why you like Blaise better than me," Ginny said quietly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry started to object, but Ginny cut him off. "Just listen. The difference is that she doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t really know you, and I\'85\loch\f0  well, you know how I feel. She doesn\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 t make you \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 feel like you owe her a commitment. I make you feel like you owe me something, because of how I feel.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Am I close?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Not really," Harry said with a grin, "but I can see you put a lot of thought into it. Ginny, I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 like her better\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  as you put it. I\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 m a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ttracted to both of you, but I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t belong to you. You can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t go off getting mad at me because you see me in an odd position.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "The night we got here, she kissed me, not the other way around. When I admitted I was attracted to her, you missed when I said I \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
fancied you as well. Tonight, she tackled me after I fought a dragon. I didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t pull her on top of me. Every time, you got mad at }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 me}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 for something I really couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t control."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What about tonight," she asked softly. "The portraits were telling each other how\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 Potter and Zabini\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 were kissing by the armor down in the dungeons."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, now that you can get mad at me about, I guess," he said after a minute. "She kissed me, but I did kiss her back."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No, I can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t get mad about that, either," she said as a pair of t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ears rolled down her face. "If I hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t kept getting mad at you, then you might not have been there."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Maybe, but I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m going to tell you the same thing I told Blaise. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sixteen years old. Cho Chang is the closest thing to a girlfriend that I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ve ever had, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 and that didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t go well. I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know if I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m ready to try that again," he said softly as she stared into the fire.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry, do I even have a chance with you," she asked after a moment.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ginny, you have as much chance with me as she does, if that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s what you\hich\f0 \rquote \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 re asking. I just have to know that I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m ready for something before I consider it again." She nodded quietly. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m going to head up to bed, I think. It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s been a long day."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As Harry passed the couch he felt a pair of soft hands spin him around, and push him \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
down roughly onto the couch. Ginny crawled over him like a cat on the prowl, and leaned in and bit down on his neck. Harry groaned in pleasure as her mouth moved up to his, and she kissed him deeply.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "G\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 night, Harry," she said and smiled softly at him, the\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n hopped up and ran up to her room.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Knight? Where?" Harry asked dazedly as he looked around for a man in armor.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No! Kreacher begs forgiveness, sir!" the little bat-eared creature named Kreacher screamed. "Kreacher was not meaning what he did!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh,\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s not a problem," Harry said as he growled at Kreacher. "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Kreacher broke down in sobs. "Kreacher\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s \'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  not \'85\loch\f0  want\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 in\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0  \'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  to \'85\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, you won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t be leaving," Harry said with a dangerous glint in his eye, and out of nowhere a sword \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 appeared in his hand. "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Now, someone asked if I will ever tell who the mystery person was that se\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 nt Harry that information. The answer is yes, I will. They\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ve been looking for it for five years (almost since the end of Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s first year). That\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s the only clue you get, for now\'85\loch\f0 
 mainly because the mystery person will be sending another note soon. ;)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 So\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
meone else asked why Harry is still staying in the dorms. Part of the reason he likes Hogwarts so much is because of the people there. He could stay in his own room, but why would he want to? The only reason he asked about it is if he needed a place for s
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 cret meetings (our Fearless Foursome, formerly a Terrible Trio, does a good bit of skulking, you know). ;)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 What can I say about Kreacher? Some of you are happy that Kreacher got what was coming to him. Some seem worried about it being Harry that killed him\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
. Further still, some seem worried that Harry killed him and Sirius might not have wanted that. Let's address all three.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 For those happy that Kreacher got what was coming to him\'85\loch\f0  bravo! Glad I'm not the only one. ;) For those worried about Harry killing hi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 m\'85\loch\f0 
 well, as you can see the end of the last chapter was in fact a dream. I'm not saying that Kreacher won't die, nor am I saying that Harry won't be the one who does it. :)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 For those worried about Sirius' true wishes, I will point out two minor facts that \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 come to mind about the whole situation of Kreacher\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s death.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 One, Sirius' will was written before his death, indirectly caused by Kreacher. Sirius was a man who seemed to believe in just rewards. He, after all, wanted to kill Peter Pettigrew for what he did\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 to James and Lily (and in turn what he did to Sirius). I don't think he'd have been too angry with Harry killing off Kreacher for, more or less, the same reason he wanted to kill Peter Pettigrew. In fact, I don't think he'd have cared in the least, becau
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 e Kreacher (as Dumbledore mentioned in Order of the Phoenix) didn't really seem to matter to him at all. I expanded on this by having Harry free him\'85\loch\f0  he didn\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 t want him free because he wanted him happy. He wanted him free because the house elf was driving\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 him bonkers and didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t want Harry to have to deal with that same problem after his death.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Two, Sirius just asked Harry to free Kreacher. I don't really think he cared what happened to him after he was gone, so long as he wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t still in the house causing t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
rouble. So, in the dream, Harry fulfilled Sirius\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  wishes. He freed Kreacher, and }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 then}{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  he killed him. ;)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Now, someone mentioned my improper usage of certain words. I'm not specifically sure what words those are (they didn't mention any examples). I went bac\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
k over the story, and the only thing I could really notice was the fact that I mix up twinge and tinge sometimes (a bad habit of mine). I didn't go over the story with a fine-toothed comb, mind (I'm not that bored). But, that is all I noticed from looking
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 over it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 If you see problems and want to report them without cluttering reviews with them, feel free to e-mail me at master_eldryn@hotmail.com\'85\loch\f0  I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t check it often, but I do check it. Most any mistake I make, that I've noticed anyway, is because I wasn'\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
t paying attention. I would prefer they remain in e-mail, though, so that I can more easily find it if I need to look at it again. Trying to find it in the reviews would just be annoying as hell\'85\loch\f0 
 even in the review e-mails (they all have the same subject!\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Gah!). ;)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 On the subject of Gareth, Zanith and dragons in general.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Some people like Zane, some don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t. He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s probably going to be playing a part in the stories, in a large way. If you don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t like him, the best I can say is try to read the parts involving him \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 really quickly. ;)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Gareth\'85\loch\f0  this character I can promise is going to become a pain in Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s backside. I won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t say how, of course, because that would be telling. No, the best I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll offer is that he doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t much like Harry, now. :)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Finally, the subject of Gi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 nny and Blaise\'85\loch\f0  as I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ve gotten one comment already (and probably more on it, eventually) I will go ahead and make this clear. I know many of you don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t like the Ginny/Blaise triangle. Some even seem to hate it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Those mainly come from people who either think\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 that Harry and Ginny are the only people that should ever be paired or from people who hate the idea of Harry being with more than one girl at a time. Let me go ahead and address those two issues, before I address everything else. Harry and Ginny, first.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 In the books, I am almost sure Harry will end up with Ginny. It just seems like a no-brainer, to me\'85\loch\f0 
 I have a theory behind it, which all has to do with the eyes. Harry looks like his father with green eyes like his mother. I would guess that Ginny will, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ully grown, look like his mother with brown eyes like his father. But, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 m not Rowling\'85\loch\f0  whoever I pair him with, in the end, really doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t matter except to my story and any following stories. :)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I know you all have your opinions, and that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s great. I, pers\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 onally, and a big Harry and Ginny fan. }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Most}{\i\fs24\kerning0 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  of the authors on my favorites list, if you notice, have Harry and Ginny stories (or at least one that caught my eye to get them there). But, I still have to do what I think is best. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Next the issue of Harry bein\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
g with more than one girl. First of all, it is, to an extent, reluctant on his part. They are pursuing him, not the other way around, he is simply resigned to the fact and doing what he can to enjoy it. Many of you think it wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 t be in his nature to do\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 this. But, I pose this question\'85\loch\f0  do any of you really know what is in his nature, after the egg changed him? ;)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Now, do I have any belief at all that some of you don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t like the triangle\'85\loch\f0  I have, joking though they may be, gotten death threats over it (no, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I didn
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t take them seriously, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m just using them as an example). I would have to be as dumb as a post not to realize that some people are agitated about it. Some want one, some want the other, some like it, some don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t. I, personally, don\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 t mind. To me, i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  is hard to choose which it should be.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 But, it is a choice I will make without influence\'85\loch\f0  some of you may take offense to this statement, but I can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t really help it, so here it is. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m not going to do what you want. Telling me to make it one way or another\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t much matter to me, for the simple fact that due to my experience in another field I have learned that you can\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 t make everyone happy. So, instead, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m just going to tell my story, my way. If you like it, that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s great. If not, well\'85\loch\f0  I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sorry.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Now, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
I hope you take that the way I meant which is, basically, "I appreciate your comments, your support, and your criticisms. I will consider them, but when it comes down to it I have to do what I think is best." I really do appreciate your perspectives, as t
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ey give me some concepts of what I might be doing wrong\'85\loch\f0 
 but, most of the comments on that subject are not so much a matter of bad characterization as it is personal bias on the part of the reader
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Oh, and one other thing\'85\loch\f0  YES! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! I kn\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ow I only accept signed reviews! Read my profile! I changed it so people would stop telling me that! :P
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Again, I thank you all for your thoughts, concerns, praise, and your criticisms. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m glad some of you find my work enjoyable enough to come back and rea\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
d it. I really am. Thanks much, and I hope you enjoy the next piece.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "GAH!" Harry shouted as he woke up from his nightmare. }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ever since I f\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry?" Ron asked as he rubbed at his sleep-filled eyes. "You alright?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yeah, Ron, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m fine," he replied automatically.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Another nightma\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 re?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yeah," Harry said as he pushed his fingers back through his sweat-filled hair. "I think I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m going to take a shower."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Right then," Ron yawned. "Morpheus, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m yours," he said as he laid his head back onto his pillow.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry took a quick shower, mainly \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
interested in getting the sweat off of him, and stepped out. He tightly wrapped a towel around his waist and looked into the mirror. Out of boredom he began to change his appearance. He didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t think he looked right with red hair, like the Weasleys. Though\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a neatly trimmed goatee and mustache, he didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t mind. He also found that his hair was actually manageable, when long, like Bill\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 After about ten minutes he started going more outlandish. An animalistic nose, blood-red eyes, a pair of leathery bat-like wi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ngs, and two large curved horns later Harry laughed at his reflection which really did look quite monstrous. It wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t have been so bad had Ron not walked into the Gryffindor\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s common bathroom in a sleepy stupor, just as Harry was growling at the mirror\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 As soon as Ron looked up he screamed like a scared little girl, and fell straight onto his backside scrambling backwards. He didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 stop}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 screaming until Harry had reverted to his natural state.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Good lord, Harry! You trying to give me heart spasms?!" Ron \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 shouted at him, as the Gryffindor boys began to clog the doorway.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sorry, Ron," Harry said with a guilty grin. "I was bored."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 A minute later Hermione busted in on them. Harry, who was still in a towel, looked at her like she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d lost her mind. "Is everything\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 all right? I thought I heard a girl scream from here!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "That was just Ron," Harry said with a chuckle. "He did sound a lot like a little girl, didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t he?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ron turned bright red, starting at the ears and working its way down to his face. "Look, he looked l\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ike a bloody demon when I walked in," Ron whispered to her, as if that explained everything.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione, however, caught none of that. She was staring at the nearly naked Harry with a goofy grin on her face. }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "DAMN! Ginny was right, he really }{\fs24\kerning0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ron glared at her and started waving his hand in front of her face, but she didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t notice. Harry had turned a light shade of pink from his shower\'85\loch\f0  so much so, to h
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 is delight, that he wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t blushing. If not for his shower and the stuffy bathroom, though, his embarrassment would have been quite noticeable.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hermione!" Ron shouted at the bushy-haired girl who was on the verge of openly leering at Harry. As Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s voice\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 penetrated the thick fog that had clouded her mind, she looked up at him. She had so much built up sexual frustration first with Ron being too thickheaded to notice her that seeing Harry like that pushed her over the edge. With a guttural growl she grabb
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d Ron, a maniacal expression on her face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Mmph!" Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s voice squeaked out as Hermione\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry walked over to them with a wide smile on his face and pushed them out of the bathroom. Hermione continued to walk backward with her arms around Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  silver dragon, of a variety McGonogall had never seen before, erupted from his hand. McGonogall began stammering out the word \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 how\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

 as she walked out the door, and away from the classroom.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, Zane, I\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0  must say\'85\loch\f0  I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m honored I am your Patronus," Harry said with a grin, "but, you can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Zane frowne\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d, but nodded. "When do I get a wand, then?" he asked, not even thinking about the compliment.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll see," Harry said with a shrug. "Not sure if there is much I can do about it, but I can probably work something out for you."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As Harry and Zane approached the livid professor, they glanced at Malfoy and noticed that he had in fact lost consciousness. It looked as if his collarbone was what had been broken. "He did it," Harry said
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  pointing at Zane.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Who the bloody hell is that?" Snape demanded in a low whisper.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "That young boy could not have done this," Snape said indicating Malfoy. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m not stupid, Potter."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "And you need to learn Legillimency, because you obviously can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t tell when someone is telling you the truth," Zane snapped back. "Are you sure I can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ahem," Dumbledore said with a twinkle in his eyes. "Is there a problem, Severus?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes, Albus," Snape replied calmly. "Someone attacked Mr. Malfoy. Potter claims it was that }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 child}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ." He said

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, he qui\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 te clearly shouted Expelliarmus," Dumbledore said with that twinkle dancing in his eyes, "and I would approximate Mr. Malfoy\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  passed into the center of the Great Hall, which the Snapes had been charmed to direct them to, a large bucket of what appeared to be water splashed on all three boys.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 It wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t water, though. It was magical dye. Each boy\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hair changed a new color, as did\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 About that time Peeves cackled and flew away singing quite off-key, "Lavender, pink, white and green, funny, funny, but I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 George pointed at his pocket where they had a colossal dung bomb with a short fuse, and Fred pointed at \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 his where he had a corked vial of Bubotuber pus. "Atticus asked us to --"

\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hut with Harry explaining to Zane what Fred and George had planned.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hagrid, you there?" Harry called as he knocked on Hagrid\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s door.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hold on," Hagrid called. "Back Fang! Back! In with you."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hi, dad," Zane said with a smile.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hullo, Zane. Have a fun \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
day?" Hagrid asked with a smile, as he lifted up the young boy into a bone-crushing hug. Zane finally had to end it by turning into a dragon, right in his arms and blowing a small flame in Hagrid\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What the blue blazes was that fer?!" Hagrid as indi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 gnantly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Uncle Harry might be able to handle those hugs, but I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m too little," Zane said as he shifted back into his human shape. "You gotta be easy on me. In this form I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m easily broken, I guess." Without stopping Zane then went into an explanation of his\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 whole day, as the moved to the table. Hagrid ended up falling off his chair with pride when he heard about Malfoy and he laughed a happy, belly laugh when he heard about the prank.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hagrid, can I see your wand for a moment," Harry asked quietly, once ever\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ything had settled down. "I know you keep it in your umbrella."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hagrid looked guiltily around his hut for a moment, then just nodded. "Righ\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  then. Been spectin\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

" Harry muttered and the sixteen-inch oaken wand, with its Unicorn hair core, glowed softly as the wood began to reach out and knit itself back together into a solid wand. Hagrid ga\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Thank yeh, Harry! Y\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 eh\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll never know what this means to me!" Hagrid exclaimed as quietly as a half-giant could.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Think nothing of it, Hagrid. Just hide it well. You being able to do magic could be useful, since no one expects you to have a wand," Harry said seriously, and Hag\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Zane stared at the wand. "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s too big," he said as he held it almost like a sword.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded, and told him to grasp it firmly. "}{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Adaptare Wand!}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 " Harry mutt\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The next week passed far too slowly for Harry. Each of his classes paid atten\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

s because of all the internal injuries and brain damage. Finally,\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 his irritation with his class came to a head at the end of the week.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "The next time I ask a question, I expect an answer. If I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t get one, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Immobilize them," a young Ravenclaw responded quickly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Very good! Five points to Ravenclaw!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Having found that his tactic of a threat was enough to break them out of their shell of fear, Harry used the tactic with every class. It didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
work very well on a class of seventh year Slytherins, though. One of the boys laughed at him, believing that Harry not only didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t mean it, but couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t do it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He woke up in the infirmary three days later with a broken leg. Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d tossed him out the windo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s love life was not becoming any simpler. In fact, it was becoming a bit more complicated. Ginny and Blaise continued their relentless pursuits\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 of him, each trying their best to win his heart. Harry was caught several times, with Blaise and Ginny. Usually by Ron, but occasionally by Hermione, various teachers, and a few of the ghosts as well as the other girl. One particularly bad day Blaise gra
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
bed Harry just as he was leaving potions and pulled him into an empty classroom. Sir Nicholas was the one who found them and was so shocked his head nearly fell off of his shoulders as he yelped apologies and fled from the room.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Out of them all, Ron was th\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e most irritated. He tried several times to beat Harry bloody, but it seemed like every time he tried Ginny knew. She\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d appear out of nowhere and threaten to teach him another lesson. Finally, Ron resigned himself to the fact that Ginny would do as she wa\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ted and he couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t stop her. It was, not surprisingly, right after she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d whacked him in the back of the head with a rather large ice mallet.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 But, Ginny seemed to hate the idea of sharing him with someone else. She went along with it for some reason Harry \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t understand, though. She tried to tell herself that she didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t mind, but it was apparent by the scowl on her face, when she caught Harry and Blaise behind one of the larger statues, that she did. When Harry asked her why she was willing to share h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
m with someone else, somewhat hurt by the idea that she didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t mind, she explained.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I made you a promise, Harry. I told you I wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t leave you, and I meant it," she said as tears welled up in her eyes. "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re one of my best friends, and I won\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 t abandon\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0  you\'85\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s Ginny had done.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Neither of the girls ever got angry with Harry for his perceived infidelity, though, as long as he didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t bring it up. He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d made it clear to both of them that he just couldn

Once Ginny and Harry finished laughing at the two, they returned to listening to what Harry had to tell them. Harry made plans to spend up to December prepping them for their exams. He had already arranged, if Ginny was willing, to ha

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Speaking of O.W.L.s," Hermione muttered, "why haven\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t we gotten our results yet?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ron shrugged, "I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t rightly know, but I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m fairly sure mum didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t believe me when I to\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ld her that I still hadn\hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny, however, heard none of this. She was more interested in one specific statement. "So I will be in the same year with you, and I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s simple reply was, "Yes."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re bloody right it is," she stated \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
triumphantly. "One less year of dealing with Snape is worth the extra studying." She then broke out into her jig once again, and pulled Hermione into it with her. Eventually, so they wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, we could sneak it in or we could get Dobby to do it," George said as he examined a handful of the crystals. "But, if we get Dobby to do it then we have a witness to worry about."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Right then, so we sneak it in," Fred said\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  seriously. "Same as always?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Of course," George muttered. "Do you think we should test a bit of this, just to make sure?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You can if you want, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m not swallowing a single crystal," Fred stated resolutely.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 George glared at his brother. "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s better if on\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e of us gets a bit of a shock than we accidentally kill someone," he said firmly. "Same time?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fred rolled his eyes. "I guess. I still don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t like the idea of testing anything myself, since that Peppermint Psychosis."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes, but this isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t supposed to induce\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  a mental breakdown, it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s supposed to shock someone\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s socks off."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "One crystal each, then?" Fred asked and George nodded. "Right then. On three. One, two, three." On three Fred and George both tipped their heads back, but Fred kept his crystal firmly betwe\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
en his fingers, still remembering the candy Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 d given him\'85\loch\f0  he wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t going to take one of these at the same time as his brother so that if he needed help, he could get it for him.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t feel anything at all," George muttered. "I guess I was wrong. \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Maybe you didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t put in }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 enough
}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  electrum extract. Go ahead and try yours," he added with a warm smile. "And thank you."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What?!" Fred tipped his head back and swallowed the crystal in his hand, ignoring that his brother knew he didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t try it already and kne\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
w why. They were very close, even for twins. "But\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  but\'85\loch\f0  I put in almost half-again what you told me!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Uh\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  Fred\'85\loch\f0  why are your eyes glowing?" George asked as he looked at his brother who was frantically reading over the directions again.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What?" he asked as\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  he glanced up and dropped the paper. "F-F-For the same reason yours are, I guess," he stammered with wide eyes.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Fred, what the bloody hell did you do?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "How the hell should I know," Fred shouted back. "I just followed the ingredient list we made up! You\loch\af0\dbch\af15\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re the potions expert, not me!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 George glanced at the list again. "Well, we can always ask Harry what went wrong."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fred\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s smile brightened, "Right! Nearly forgot about that. Maybe he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll be able to help us out with it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 George sighed and looked at his brot\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 her. "Well at least we only got glowing eyes out of it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "That we know of. For all we know we may have made glowing eyes, sex change crystals," Fred joked, but at the frightened look from his brother, both immediately checked that everything was still in p\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
lace.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 With a sigh of relief, George muttered, "Don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t ever joke about that."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Both boys packed up their new creation, whatever it was, and headed out of the borrowed classroom. They needed to get back to Gryffindor tower before anyone noticed them skulking a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
bout, so that they could get to the Halloween feast on time.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 They strode down the halls at a quick pace with their eyes barely open, so that no one would notice them. They were supposed to be in the common room\'85\loch\f0  the professors said they had a surprise. Try
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ing to hide, if caught, would be useless as there weren\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t any other students with glowing eyes, that they knew of, except for Harry who could obviously hide his whenever he wanted.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The conversation and chatter all but stopped as the doors to the Grea\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
t Hall crashed open. Everyone turned slowly to look at the man standing in the doorway to the Great Hall. The silence was palpable as most wondered exactly what was going on.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The man stood regally, as if daring anyone to question him. His long, cobalt cape\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 hung loosely over muscular shoulders, clenched in one hidden fist, a silver, brocade, rune pattern bordering the bottom and trailing up the side around the opening of the cowl. His other arm hung limply at his side, covered in a large silver, dragon-scal
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  glove, the grip of a wand extending near the base of the hand. The cowl of his cape was pulled up around his head, cloaking his face in an almost solid wall of shadow.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The man turned around slowly and pulled the doors to the hall closed, his cowl never mo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ving. He turned silently back to face the assembled students and staff, where many of the staff had their hands tentatively on their wands. The man paid no notice as he tossed his cape back and straightened his vest, which was made in an identical design 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 o the gloves that covered his hands.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 His black, mesh shirt looked almost like a second skin and showed off his form very well, aside from what the vest covered of it. It stopped at the very top of the man\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s neck, a fact only noticeable by the subtle glitte\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 r given off in its cloak of shadows, and went down inside the man\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s gloves.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As the mystery guest began to walk towards the head table, everyone took in the rest of his attire. A pair of loose, black, dragon hide pants moved easily over his muscular legs wi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
th each long stride. They bunched up slightly just above the top a pair of matching, silver, dragon scale boots that came up to the top of his calf.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Once the man stopped at the main table, he bowed to the assembled staff who inclined their heads cautiously\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
. The only one of them not on the verge of hexing the man was Dumbledore. Dumbledore smiled and greeted the man as if he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d known him all his life, "Welcome! Would you care to join us for our Halloween Feast?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Whispers broke out among the students as Dumble\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 dore posed this question. Hermione turned to Ron, "You suppose he knows who that is?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No, \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 Mione, I think he just invited him to dinner to make a new friend," Ron replied sarcastically, earning him a slap on the arm from Hermione.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Just because we got }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 us}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 sorted out, don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t think I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m going to start taking lip from you," she admonished as she turned back to stare, like everyone else, at the mystery man.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The man began to shake, slightly. Finally, his hands moved up and took hold of his cowl. With a swift motio\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
n, the cowl was laying behind his head. Before them, laughing about something Snape had just quietly said to McGonogall that only the mystery man and Dumbledore overheard, was Harry Potter.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Everyone was openly gaping at him, except Dumbledore, whose eyes w\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ere twinkling madly. McGonogall who was in the middle of taking a drink to calm her nerves had accidentally spit her pumpkin juice right in Snape\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face at the stranger\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s unveiling. The greasy-haired professor had just finished commenting that the \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 strang\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 r\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  would }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
even put Potter\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s fame seeking to shame}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
. But, even he barely noticed the pumpkin juice rolling down his face, as he too was openly gawking at Harry. His trademark sneer had combined forces with a look of utter shock and invaded his face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry, st\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ill laughing, turned and strode quickly to the Gryffindor table where, true to her word, Ginny and Blaise were sitting about four feet apart seeming rather rigid and cold towards each other. It was obvious they didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t really care to be near what they deem\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d as their competition. He sat beside them while thinking about his motivation to wear these rather odd clothes.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He decided to have a bit of fun this Halloween, so he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d ran back to his dorm after his chat with Ginny and transfigured some of his new clothes\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  into an ancient Battle Wizard
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s uniform. It took him longer than expected, but the extra work was worth it. He wanted to surprise everyone, and it seemed he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d done exactly that.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry," Ginny said both softly and earnestly as he sat between her and Blais\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e, "that looks }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 amazing}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I agree," purred Blaise into his ear. "How much longer do we have to stay here?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny bit her lip so hard she almost drew blood. It was taking all her strength not to blow her top at the blonde Slytherin. Harry noticed this and g\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
roaned inwardly. This was, partly, what he wanted to avoid. He didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t want them near each other, with him around, because it would be almost like a competition to see who could maintain his attention.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ok, before this goes any further," Harry said quickly.\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  "This is not a fight to see who can keep me occupied. If that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s what it turns into, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ll go ahead with my plans and head for the forest."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Both Ginny and Blaise scowled a bit, but relented as soon as he moved to stand up. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m not joking," he said seriousl\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 y. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m not going to stick around if you both make me regret it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The rest of dinner, for the most part, was enjoyable. The girls were reluctant to talk with each other, but did so to keep him from leaving. It was hard to miss the icy tones they used with \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
each other, but Harry did his best to not notice. About half of the way through dinner someone pointed out that Neville had his elbow in the butter-dish, causing both Harry and Ginny to burst out laughing.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Blaise, irritated that she was being left out of t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 he joke, asked what was so funny. "Just something Ginny did a few years back," Harry replied vaguely, earning him an irritated glare from Blaise.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s nothing important," Ginny said, trying to head off the situation. She didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t want to be the cause of rui\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ning Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s night. "I just did something embarrassing when I was younger," she said with a slight blush.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, it was obviously important enough that you both remembered it and thought it was funny," she retorted hotly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Look, please don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t act like this,\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 " Ginny said quietly. "We don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t have to like each other," she told the other girl, "but Harry wasn\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 t even going to come tonight. I talked him into it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "That\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s your fault," she stated angrily, "not mine!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry growled and tried to remain calm. "I knew I s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 houldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t have come," he stated in a strained voice. "I should have gone for a run."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s not your fault," Blaise and Ginny said in unison, "it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hers!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry jumped from his seat without another word. He stalked towards the entrance to the Great Hall with\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 anger written on his face. Without a second thought he knocked one of the doors off its hinges and walked over the splintered remains, completely oblivious to the entirety of the Great Hall\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s visitors staring at him in shock, completely oblivious to Ginn\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  and Blaise screaming angrily at each other.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry, just the bloke we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve been lookin\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  for," George said as he sat down beside Harry, Fred doing the same on the other side, in the common room. Harry\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 d headed straight there after he left the great hal\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 l. "We need you to look at something for us, since you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve got all that magical know-how, now. We were going to prank the Slytherin\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 s food tonight, but we must have messed up the ingredients."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh?" Harry asked with a grin. "What was the prank?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d been \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 working on shocking salt, but somehow }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 we}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 messed it up," Fred said glaring pointedly at George.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Damnit, Fred," George muttered quickly, "I can make a mistake! You remember your first attempt at the Headless Hats?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fred paled a bit, then answered a bit less\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  irritatingly, "Yes, I remember."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s this?" Harry asked quietly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Fred\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s first attempt at the Headless Hats turned only your skin invisible. Was right gruesome, it was."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Tell me about it," Fred muttered. "I was retching into the sink for nearly an ho\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ur."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry, however, was laughing madly. "Sounds great," he said with a grin. "So, what\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s wrong with the shocking salt?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re not exactly sure. Our first attempt worked, but Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hair was stuck up for a week," Fred said with a laugh.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "And, every t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ime he touched something metal he acted like someone dropped a bomb on him," George added.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "And to hell with taking a bath," Fred said with a smirk. "He couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t even wash his hands without looking like someone had set him on fire."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry cackled madly, fo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 r a moment. "Ok, how\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d you make it?" George handed him a list, and Harry looked over it. "Looks fine to me. You went exactly by the list?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh," Fred said with a bit of a guilty look. "We --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No, you," interrupted George, with a triumphant smile. "Not we.\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  You."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Fine, }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  put in half-again what the list said for electrum."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry looked up at Fred with wide eyes. "Please tell me you didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t use this on anyone," Harry asked hopefully.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Nobody," George said with a slight shrug. "Well, we tested it, but that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s it\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face snapped to George. "YOU DID WHAT?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "We tried it --"

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "but, no one --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "else had any," they said nervously.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re both lucky, then," Harry said through gritted teeth. "That much electrum, by all rights, should have killed\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  you."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What?!" Fred asked incredulously.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "But\'85\loch\f0  we only had a two crystals!" George said quickly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yeah, we liked the glowing eyes," Fred said, his shoulders trembling slightly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Wait, that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s how your eyes were glowing?" Harry asked expressionlessly, as he\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0  remember the twins showing off at dinner. "That would mean\'85\loch\f0 
 no. Do you still have the crystals?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Both nodded, and pulled a small bottle out of each of their pockets. "We had more than this," George said, "but when it just made our eyes glow we got rid of \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 the rest."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
Harry nodded thoughtfully. "Ok, while no one is watching," he said as he rolled up his sleeve where the mark was, "touch the mark." Both stuck their hands on the mark and were portkeyed to the Quidditch pitch. "One crystal each," Harry said quic
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 kly. "I have to see this again."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Both looked uneasy at the idea of taking more of the crystals if there was enough in them to kill someone. "Uh, Harry?" George said tentatively.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m with George, are you sure about this?" Fred asked, the tinge of worry not\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 iceable in his voice.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Actually," George said seriously, "I was going to ask how the hell we got outside."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fred looked around as if just now noticing where he was. "What the?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh," Harry said with a chuckling laugh. "I forgot you didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know," he said as\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  he tapped the mark on his arm. "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s a portkey."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Not that we --"

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "the rules, but --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "we could be caught!" they bounced worriedly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, that," Harry said with a grin. "My grandfather knows we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re out here."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "He what?!" George exc\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 laimed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "How?!" Fred asked in an identical tone.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I told him. Look, we can talk about this later. Right now, I wanted to see if what I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 m thinking is true. One crystal each, please\'85\loch\f0  if anything happens, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fred and George glanced at each o\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ther. "Bottoms up," Fred said with a shrug and popped a single crystal into his mouth at the same time as his brother. Almost immediately their eyes began glowing.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry palmed his face as he looked at them both, their eyes glowing incandescently in the ni\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ght. Fred\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eyes, glowing an electrical cobalt, looked at him curiously. George
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s, a freakish, sparkling crimson, looked the same. "Don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t I have enough to do," he muttered to no one in particular. Without a second thought a fireball formed in each hand an\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  he launched one at both of young man.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fred and George had no time to be afraid. Both threw up their arms in the shape of an \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 x\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
, their eyes closed tightly. Only Harry saw the full results. The illusionary fire slammed into circular, electrical shields in \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 front of both.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
"What the bloody hell was that," George asked indignantly as he looked up at Harry, his eyes flashing more brightly with his anger. Fred turned and held his brother back, as George was ready to beat some sense into their friend.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "George, you\loch\af0\dbch\af15\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
re usually the sensible one," Fred said with a smirk, and George calmed down quickly, more out of shock than any desire to think. "He knew what would happen. He had to. Do you really think Harry would try to hurt us?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry grinned impishly at them. "Yes,\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  George, do you?" he asked with a smile.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, no," George admitted. "But, you did just throw a flaming fireball at us!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, fireballs usually do flame," Harry joked, "but it wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t real. Just an illusion. If it had hit you, it wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t have hurt you\'85\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 much."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So, what happened?" Fred asked, not wanting to ponder what that \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 much\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  meant.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Well, you discovered\'85\loch\f0  actually, I should say rediscovered, how to locate Stormwalkers."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What?" George asked in complete confusion. "Stormwalkers?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes," Harry said ser\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 iously as he had them sit down near him on the steps to one of the Quidditch stands. "Stormwalkers. It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s a form of magus. Morphmagus/Metamorphmagus, Animagus, et cetera. One of the few that, in the magical world, can remain unnoticed."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Wait, we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve got som\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e kind of bloody magical powers that we didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know about?!" George asked quickly. "Not possible."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No, if my guess is right," Fred said thoughtfully, "then it is extremely possible. It has something to do with weather. Based on what I saw the instant I op\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ened my eyes, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d guess lightning."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry reached up and touched his index finger to his nose. "It doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t just involve lightning, but that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s the majority of it," he said with a tilt of his head, before continuing his explanation. "The main way to recogniz\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
e a Stormwalker is to shock them. In the magical world that only really left one option. Stand outside in the middle of a lightning storm.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "If you get struck by lightning and all it did was make your eyes glow, then you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 re a Stormwalker. If you died\'85\loch\f0  well,\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  then you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
re not," he said seriously, but both Fred and George let out a small chuckle. "Too many idiots stood outside and got themselves electrocuted, so they made something similar to shocking salt. It was a potion, most of the same ingredients as your 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 hocking salt actually.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "At five years old, they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d administer it to a child as a test. If a Stormwalker was found, they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d begin training. After about ten generations without a single Stormwalker, they assumed there would be no more and stopped testing."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ," George said quietly, "we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re Stormwalkers?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded. "The first }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 known}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  Stormwalkers in half a millennium, I would guess. There have probably been others that just didn
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Can we get rid of it," Fred asked hesitantly. "I like the idea of this, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 a little\'85\loch\f0  but it seems like it would require being responsible, and I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m not sure I can handle that kind of pressure."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Fred," George stated firmly, "we have a duty to use this to help, if we can. We wanted to join the Order. We wanted to help people. This \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 is our chance!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Maybe," Fred said, but it was obvious he wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t sure. "We put on a brave face, and we joke around a lot," Fred said in uncharacteristic seriousness, "but I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t want to be responsible for hurting someone."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "That\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s exactly why you need to \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
learn to control this," Harry stated bluntly. "The reason Stormwalkers were trained from the age of discovery is because if they ever were charged, then they could really do some damage."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Charged?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded, again. "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve both been charged. Three tim\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 es, in fact. You have no choice but to learn to control this. Even if you don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t use it, you have a responsibility to master it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 George, like Fred, was beginning to reconsider. "Fred might be right, Harry. We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re not exactly known as the responsible types."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry glanced at both of them. "Why did you try the crystals yourselves?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "We didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t want to hurt anybody," George and Fred said in unison, eliciting a smile from Harry.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Exactly. You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re not }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 known}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  as the responsible type, but you }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 are

t tested those on yourself, first, I would actually consider removing the gift from you," Harry said seriously. "But, you did."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So you can remove it," Fred stated clearly. "If we screw up or can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t handle it, you can take this out of \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 us?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes and no. I can take it from you, if I have to. But, I won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t do it just because you want me to."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Why not?!" the twins asked, irritated that he refused to comply with whatever their wish may be.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Because," Harry said quietly, "it would most likely \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 kill you."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fred and George\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eyes became wide with both surprise and fear. "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 re\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  uh\'85\loch\f0  you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 re only joking\'85
\loch\f0  right?" George stammered out, his question more out of hopefulness than curiosity.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Not in the slightest," Harry said without hesitation. "Drawing m\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 agic out of an object is simple. Drawing it out of a living being, where it has meshed with them\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "In the rare cases wher\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fred and George glanced at each other simultaneously, then spoke in unison, "Bloody hell."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face remained looking \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
at them as his eyes moved upward in thought. After a moment, he leaned over and placed his elbows on his knees and looked out over the Quidditch pitch. He smiled, softly at the sight before him. The Quidditch pitch was one of the places where Harry James 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 P\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 otter, Dragonmaster, The Boy Who Lived, Enemy to Voldemort, could actually be free. "That is exactly," Harry said seriously, not looking up at them, "what I mean."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Why us?" Fred muttered.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry replied almost immediately, "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve been asking that question f\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 or going on fifteen years," he said through a bitter laugh. "If you ever get the answer, let me know."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fred and George glanced at each other. They immediately knew what the other was thinking. They were worried about Harry. Ever since he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d been changed, he\loch\af0\dbch\af15\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well," George said to break the silence. "I guess we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll have to make the best of the situation. What can we do?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yeah," Fred said with a grin. "How can we use this to prank people?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry laughed then, a true, happy laugh. He \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 rolled his eyes and looked at them. "Well, first I think you need to be filled in on what\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s happened over the past few years," Harry said seriously. With that, he gave Fred and George a detailed account of his first year at Hogwarts. Specifically the info\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 mation about the Sorcerer
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Stone. Both twins remained silent as they took the information in.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 When finished, they asked the first question that came to mind. "Professor Quirrel had Voldemort sticking out of the back of his head?" George asked quietly, and\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  Harry nodded in reply.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, no bloody wonder his turban smelled so awful!" Fred said dryly, sending all three into uncontrollable laughter.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry smiled and then explained his second year, including what had happened in the Chamber of Secrets. Most peop\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 le knew he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d gone in, and that he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fred\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face went into his hands and he groaned l\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 oudly. "So that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s why she hexed me!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 George and Harry looked at him curiously, wondering what he was talking about. Finally George asked, "Who hexed you, and why?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ginny!" Fred exclaimed. "Right after her first year she was so depressed that I thought a b\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
it of a joke would make her feel better. I put an animated toy snake on her bed," as he said this, both Harry and George winced. "She came tearing into the room, you were downstairs\'85\loch\f0  that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 George bust\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ed out laughing at Fred. Harry was a bit shocked, but he still had enough sense to ask, "What?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 George looked up from his laughter. "I remember that day. I came back upstairs with a snack and Ginny had Fred pinned to the wall as a group of bats kept landin\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

o say, and he started detailing what happened in his third year. It was when he explained that he knew who Moony, Padfoot, Prongs, and Wormtail were that both of them became completely silent.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You sure you want to know," Harry said with a mysterious smile\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 . "Once you know, you can never go back." Both of them nodded without hesitation. "Remus Lupin, as you know, is a werewolf."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "What does that\'85\loch\f0  MOONY!" George said after a moment, causing Fred\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eyes to snap wide open. Harry smiled and nodded.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "We lived with\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  a Marauder!" Fred and George said in a reverent whisper.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Actually," Harry said seriously, "you lived with three of them."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, you still haven\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t really told us what we are. You just called us Stormwalkers," George said calmly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Right," Har\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ry nodded. "Stormwalkers are called Stormwalkers because they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re attuned to the weather. You may have noticed you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 When both nodded their understanding, he continued\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 . "The majority of your power comes from raw energy in the form of lightning. I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

, one in each open palm. "These," Harry said as he slid the apex of the fire across the grass, scorching the tips, "are real. Now that I know you can protect yourself, if only instinctually, I have to prepare you."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Both Fred and George stared wide-eyed as \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 the flickering balls of flame hovered above his palms. The fires\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 elemental fury reflected in the two pairs of eyes beholding them, and without a second thought Harry launched the balls at his two newest students. This time they didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t flinch, they simply\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 watched as the balls of flame hurtled towards them and slammed into a thick barrier of energy directly in front of them.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "That --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "was --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "AMAZING!" they finished in unison.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Did you feel it," Harry asked the two excited seventh years. "Did you feel the \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 core of power?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I felt a little tingle when the shield appeared," George said and Fred shrugged.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I was too busy watching those wicked fireballs," Fred said with a wide grin, "to pay much attention to it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well," Harry said with a smile, "good. Now, pay \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
attention to the core this time. Try to find where it is. The easiest way to learn how to grasp the power is to feel how you do it on instinct," he said and two more balls of flame appeared in his hand. He launched them without hesitation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Again they slamm\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ed into the round shields. "I sort of felt it," Fred said as he scrunched up his face, "but it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hard to tell where."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll keep trying," Harry said simply, and that they did. For the next hour, Harry launched fireball after fireball at Fred and George. E\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ach time they seemed to get a better idea of where their core of power was. Finally, George tapped his.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Holy hell," George exclaimed as he grasped his core of power for the first time. "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s like\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  like\'85\loch\f0 " he trailed off, his eyes glowing a bright, sparklin
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 g crimson.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Like trying to hold lightning?" Harry supplied.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "EXACTLY!" George said. "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s amazing, exciting, and terrifying, all rolled into one."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Now," Harry said with a mischievous smile. "Let it go."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "But, I just got it," George muttered in irritation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
"Yes," Harry said simply. "I know. Now you need to work on being able to grasp it whenever you want, not just after spending an hour of letting instinct guide you. So, let it go completely and then summon it back. Just keep doing it until you can tap it a
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t will.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "In the mean time, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m going to work with Fred. We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll work for one more hour, tonight, then pack it in. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m getting tired," he said and stifled a yawn.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The two brothers nodded mutely. George released the power and his eyes stopped glowing immediate\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ly. "Harry," George said curiously, "when we tap the power, will our eyes always glow?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Not unless you want them to," Harry said with a shrug. "It has a purpose, but you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re not even really recognizing that yet. You can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t really control the power right now
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 , so you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re using that ability without thinking about it. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m not teaching you how to do it, because it drains power and that is partially the point of doing all this.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t want you going into the dorm\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s and roasting everyone because you had a particul\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
arly bad nightmare or an erotic dream," he said with a shrug, and both boys felt a hot flush creep onto their faces. "Oh, grow up," Harry laughed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "We couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t really do that, could we?" Fred asked after a few minutes of silence. "Roast someone because we \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 had a nightmare or an\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  exciting\'85
\loch\f0  dream?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Most Stormwalkers who caused major accidents were young children having nightmares without control and too much power, or teens between the ages of thirteen and nineteen. Most of them destroyed their homes, and a f
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ew unfortunate ones accidentally killed their families," Harry said seriously. "So, you tell me."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fred and George both became very serious for the rest of the night. Pranksters they may be, but the idea of hurting people who didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t deserve it was no joke, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
to them. Harry worked exclusively with Fred until finally he tapped into his core of power as well, with an ecstatic grin.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry smiled, summoned his cape, and slipped it back on. He walked over and sat back by the steps while Fred and George finished up t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
heir second hour of training by simply tapping and releasing their power, repeatedly. Near the end, George collapsed to the ground completely exhausted. Shortly after, Fred joined his brother in a heap on the damp Quidditch pitch.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry grinned, and walked\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  over to them. He leaned down and pushed his sleeve up enough that the mark was showing. He propped the twins\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 hands on his mark, and portkeyed directly into their dorm room.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So," Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s grandfather began as Harry took the seat before him, "who was\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  giving off that spectacular light show, if you don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t mind my asking?" He removed his nightcap, and placed it on the corner of his desk. Harry glanced over at it and nearly choked, as Dumbledore was pouring them both a cup of tea. The powder blue cap was \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 c
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 overed from top to bottom in pink hearts.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore, hearing the sudden clearing of Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s throat, looked up and noticed where his grandson\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s attention was. "Ah, yes," the old wizard said with a twinkle in his eyes. "It was a birthday gift from Minerva."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry arched an eyebrow, but smiled. "The light show," Harry said, righting the conversation off of the odd sleeping clothes, "was made by none other than the Weasley twins. They\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
re Stormwalkers." As Harry finished his statement he noticed his grandfather\loch\af0\dbch\af15\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eyes almost imperceptibly glance at him in shock.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So," Harry said with an appraising stare, "you know what a Stormwalker is?" It wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t a question and his grandfather knew that.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Actually, yes," Dumbledore said after a short time. "What do you know abo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ut them?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
Harry again gave his grandfather that appraising stare, then answered his question. "They were created nearly two thousand years ago by King Auric Stravarian to fight in the War of Lights against the Dark King of that time, Umbric Stravarian. Umb
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ric made Voldemort look like a teddy bear, at least in deed\'85\loch\f0  I would guess they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re about equal in power. Hence his title of Dark King.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "The power is at its strongest when wielded by twins because they seem to charge each other, and draw from each other. Th\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ey have some control over the weather, but mostly handle energy. Specifically lightning. Need I go on?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No, I do believe you know most of it," Dumbledore said with a bit of a smile. "I have some experience with a pair of twin Stormwalkers. I did most of t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 he research on the subject for them."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Did you ever see their training? I would like to know if they ever achieved the second or third level," Harry asked excitedly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "There are levels?" Dumbledore asked curiously, becoming a bit excited himself.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s ex\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
cited face turned somewhat dejected. "The second level for a Stormwalker allows them to literally become energy. I know that may not sound very useful, but it is. As far as I know, only two Stormwalkers without a twin were ever able to achieve it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "They we\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eyes were twinkling madly. "Well," he told Harry softly, "I can inform you that they did reach the second level. It was quite interesting to watch."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s excited face returned. "What color?! I have a theory about this, but I want a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  final test case to prove it," he said with as he listened intently.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore looked curious for a moment, but answered. "One was --"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Stop," Harry said as his eyes began to glow a deep, golden color. He focused his gaze on his grandfather. "Amazing. Wer\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e you going to tell me?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore faltered for a moment. "Tell you what, Harry?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "One was red and one was blue," he said calmly. "I believe this is a proof for my theory, if the Weasley twins can attain the third level then I will have my definite proof.\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The twinkle in Dumbledore\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eyes dimmed slightly. "I haven\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Why?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Would it have mattered?" the ol\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d wizard asked as he stroked his fingers through his long beard. "Would it have changed anything?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Not really," Harry admitted after a moment. "But, you didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t have to keep this a secret. It wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t like you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d have been shunned for it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No," Dumbledore sa\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 id softly. "I likely wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t have, but people would have treated me as if I were somehow special. I get enough of that as it is," he said with a smile. "I
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sure you know the feeling."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry rolled his eyes. "Oh, yes. Very much."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So, what to do with this\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  information?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "That is your choice," Harry said seriously. "This secret really doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t affect anyone but you, so it isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t my place to make that decision for you." He stated the last firmly.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore smiled proudly at his grandson. "Now, I do believe we \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 need to speak about something Minerva has been on about since you arrived."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Let me guess," Harry said with a soft chuckle. "She believes that I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m unbalanced, off my rocker, completely nutters."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well," Dumbledore said with a stifled laugh, "that is one wa\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
y to put it. She is worried that you really would have harmed Mr. Malfoy on the train." Dumbledore sighed. "I promised her I would speak with you about it, or I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d not have even brought it up."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded. "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s perfectly fine, grandfather. I can understa\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 nd her worry."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore nodded. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sorry, but I have to ask. Would you have made good on your threat?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry shrugged. "Yes. If she hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t caught my attention, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d have snapped his neck without a second thought. It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hard," he said as he stared into hi

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He stopped for a moment and squeezed the bridge of his nose in deep thought. "They\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re always there. Their\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
"Now we have all these rules and regulations, all these stupid moralities that killing is wrong. The only thing that keeps me in check is the fact that before all this, I held those same thoughts. So did Sirius and my father. Their opinions matter to me
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 , and it is helping me to reconcile the rest of these memories\'85\loch\f0  good or bad. I even refrained from losing control when Snape hit me.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore listened calmly to this, no display of emotion on his face. "Sometimes," he told Harry \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
in a weary, old voice, "I agree with you. When I was a teenager, the killing curse was used by aurors to fight back dark attacks, much like the muggles with their guns. We believed, then, that if a life could be saved the trade was considered to be worth 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sometimes, that line of thinking occurs to me. Usually when I read of the death of innocent people who died for no other reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong time. I won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t tell you that these thoughts are wrong. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d be a hypocrite, if I di\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded. "Did I mention that I stopped myself from killing Snape?" he asked brightly as the happy twinkle r\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 eturned to his grandfather\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eyes.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry slept well the previous night. No dreams that he could remember, and he woke up happy. He caught George and Fred and told them to meet him in his private quarters, and gave them directions. Most everyone else

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 No one in the room could believe Harry was saying these things. It seemed so out \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 of character for him, especially when he was saying them to one of his best friends. But, that was Hermione\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 s breaking point.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 She leaped at Harry, her power charging her every move. As she landed, she began to attack him. Harry dodged the first few, judgin\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Why is it," Ron mused aloud, "that I always get made out to look like an arse after he knocks me on mine."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Be\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 cause you are one most of the time, anyway," Ginny responded absently as she lifted Hermione up and placed her onto Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Um," Fred interrupted. "We already took some newt practice tests. All our work on our pranks sort of requires us to know our stuff. We both did fine, except I sucked in potions."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Your answer," Voldemort asked seriously, "to this Gareth?"

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "But," he said, interrupting Harry who was beginning to state his objection, "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve lost my four best friends in the world to that }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 thing}{\fs24\kerning0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Remus\loch\af0\dbch\af15\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  eyes slowly changed wolfish and a growl escaped his throat. "I say we do it. If it saves a life," he said seriously, "even if it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s just one life, then it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll be worth the potential immorality of the action."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So be it," Dumbledore said wearily. "Mr. Weasl\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ey, if you will please make the necessary preparations. Alastor, you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

ut how some lines shouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t be crossed."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded and walked from the office, Percy following shortly behind. "Harry," he called, and Harry stopped and faced Percy. "I wanted to say thank you."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "For what?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Percy reached into his pocket and pulled out t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 he letter Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Everyone deserves their chan\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ce, Percy," Harry said seriously. "Don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t waste yours."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Percy nodded. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m trying not to. About getting to know you better," he said sincerely, "I think I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d like that."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry smiled as Percy nervously pushed his glassed up on his nose, awaiting Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s answ\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 er. "I think I would, too," Harry said with a smile. "I need to go, though
\'85\loch\f0  don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t forget. Half an hour after he arrives," Harry said seriously as he shook Percy\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hand.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Percy smiled and nodded, then went back to Dumbledore\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s office.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The rest of the d\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ay passed quickly, for the most part. After a while of thinking about everything, he realized a very real problem that faced him. He returned to Dumbledore\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s office to discuss the issue, and after a short time a decision was reached. They both portkeyed t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  the Granger residence to have a talk with the Mr. and Mrs. Granger.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 When they returned from the talk, Harry walked up to his room to find another plain white message, with a plain, wax seal. It was almost identical to the first he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d received on August fir
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 st. The only difference was the message.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I would also like to take a moment to warn you. Tom Marvolo Riddle has been in contact wit\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
h a rather unsavory character by the name of King Gamesh. Gamesh, at their meeting, claimed to have been in contact with someone named Gareth. Gamesh also called you the Dragonmaster.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I am not sure that this will mean anything to you, however I am writing \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 in the hopes that you will be able to use this information to your advantage.

\par }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 In all honesty, Harry didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t really know what to make of the letter, but he would be sure to ask Dumbledore after the press conference. At that time, though, he
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  was very tired, and decided to sleep. With an audible whump, Harry landed in his bed face first.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione remained sleeping for the rest of the previous day and most of the night. She woke up bright and early the next morning, quite cheerful aside f\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
rom being a bit weak. Happily, she trotted down to the common room, in her dressing gown, where she sat and stared into the fire contently.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry came down the stairs to the common room, a look of determination set on his face, and noticed Hermione sitting\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 by the fire. He walked over and sat down beside her and glanced at her a bit nervously.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry," she said as she saw him, "are you ok?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Fine, Hermione\'85\loch\f0  how about you?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Tired. But, otherwise fine. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sorry about attacking you."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, I can sort of unde\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 rstand it," he said guiltily. "I did call you a mudblood, after all."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry, don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t try to turn this on yourself. I could feel it when I was attacking you. You were protecting the others from me," she said seriously. "I know you didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t mean it." She grabbe\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d him and hugged him tightly. "Thank you," she whispered.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He hugged her back. "No worries," he whispered back. "So," he said after they separated, "once you get back to normal, I have to up your training a bit."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione groaned. "Can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t I just almost kill \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 you, then you knock me out? It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s easier."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry chuckled. "Hermione Granger, trying to skive off learning! Wonders never cease."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione rolled her eyes. "Remind me to hurt Fred and George. I remember one of them calling me Hermaninny, and it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s easier to \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
just hurt them both than figure out which one." Harry nodded and laughed. "Why are you up so early," she asked him suddenly. "You rarely ever get up this early."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Um\'85\loch\f0 " he said as he considered what to tell her. "I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t think you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll like it, Miss I-Love-Ru\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 les."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry," she asked, drawing out his name. "What are you planning?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "To overthrow the Minister," he said in a small voice as he looked away guiltily. "But, it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s for a good cause," he added immediately.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, is that all," she stated, her voice raising \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 with each word. "Harry, how exactly were you planning on overthrowing the Minister?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "By proving that he hid from the public the fact that Lucius Malfoy, along with a few other Death Eaters, was broken out of Azkaban, possibly by the Dementors he refused \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 to remove."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione forgot to scold Harry when she heard this. Instead she paled. "Lucius Malfoy is out of Azkaban?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded calmly. "It was Percy who found out and told the Order."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Pin his arse to the wall and let him rot," she said through gritted\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 teeth, her face still pale. "Malfoy knows I was there, and that I was partially responsible for him going to Azkaban. My parents are in danger because of that idiot we call Minister."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t worry," Harry said seriously. "I talked with your parents last n\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ight, with my grandfather. They\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll be joining us here. They\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 re going to take over and teach Muggle Studies for the rest of the year, at least."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face lit up. "Muggles teaching Muggle Studies will definitely make the class more interesting for tho\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 se who aren\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t muggleborn. And I get to see my parents!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry grinned. "Yes," he said with a smile, "they seemed rather excited about it as well. I may be wrong, but I think your parents are a bit disappointed that they are muggles."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione nodded. "Yeah\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ," she admitted. "They both like the idea of learning magic, but when I told them that it doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t work that way they were both crestfallen."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded. "I sort of noticed that. When I mentioned the idea of a couple of muggles teaching Muggle Studies, th\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ey both jumped at it immediately."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Wait," Hermione said curiously, "what about the old professor?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well," Harry said with a smile, "she really preferred the Dark Arts class. I was getting a bit strained, trying to take care of my classes and catch you al\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
l up so that we can get your magus abilities in order."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Umbran Stravarian preferred to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts?!" Hermione asked incredulously. "I can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t believe it. She seems so\'85\loch\f0  meek."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, not that I would tell anyone else about this," Har\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ry said with a grin, "but I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m glad she wanted to teach it. One of her ancestors was a rather cruel Dark King, you see, and I think she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d be excellent at teaching people to defend against it."

ioned swiftly. "And isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t it dangerous to trust her in such a position?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m descended from Salazar Slytherin, Hermione," he said seriously. "Does that mean I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m going to run out and join Voldemort?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Well\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  no\'85\loch\f0 " she trailed off.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes, and you seem to have gotten both of those in spades," she joked.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry pulled back in a mock-shock. "Miss Granger! I am flabbergasted! Are you flirting with me?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione rolled her eyes. "Of course not. I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t thin\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 k I could handle having two Weasley\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You really want to know?" he asked as he gave her an appraising stare. "If you want to know, I\loch\af0\dbch\af15\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll tell you."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 She thought about it, then answered surely. "Yes."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m going to force feed him Veritaserum, then question him in front of a press conference," Harry said with a bit of a shrug.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione looked flabbergasted for a moment, then her look of am\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 azement turned into a giant grin. "Good. He deserves it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded. "This is one of the few times that I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m not completely angry that I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m well known. It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll get more reporters to the conference.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "In any case, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m supposed to pick up your parents before I\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  go. So, if you want to come down to the main hall, you can be there when they arrive."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione grinned. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll shower and then head down," she said before she hugged Harry and ran off up the girls\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  dormitory steps. Harry rolled his eyes and portkeyed out 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 to the Granger residence.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry," Mrs. Granger said with a wide grin after he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d shrunk most of their items small enough that they could fit into a single trunk, "can you possibly help me with something? I have a book case I want to take, but it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s so\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 mewhat large."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry stifled a laugh that Hermione\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s mother would want to take a bookcase. }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, I can see where she gets it,"}{\fs24\kerning0 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  he thought to himself as he followed her upstairs.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "That\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s the one," she said, pointing at a large bookshelf that lined one wall\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
. The bookshelf was probably ten feet tall and twice as wide, stacked with books. "Hermy told us wizards and witches have books on most everything, but things about muggles so I want to take these with us. Can you possibly\'85\loch\f0  ?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry smiled and nodded. With\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  a wave of his hand, the large shelf folded itself into a cube then shrank small enough to fit into the palm of his hand, where he held onto it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I can take it," Mrs. Granger said to him with a smile.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t think that would be a good idea," Harry said w\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ith a soft smile. "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s quite heavy."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Mrs. Granger laughed. "It can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t be that heavy," she said. "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
re putting a muggle on," she said with a grin. Harry shrugged and placed the cube on the floor, softly. Mrs. Granger tilted her head curiously, but reached\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  down to pick it up. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 t lift it. "I guess you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re not," she said as she straightened. "How could you hold it?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m a strong boy," he said with a grin. "I could have made it smaller }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 and}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  lighter, but it was a choice be
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 tween getting it small enough that one person could handle it or making it both small and light. I could possibly have done both, but I might have put so much magic into it, that it destroyed it," he said seriously. "I\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 m still, in some ways, learning my l\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 mits."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Fascinating," Mr. Granger said as he listened to the explanation, from the doorway. "So there are limits to what can be done with magic?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded. "Yes. Each person has a limit to what they can perform, and it varies from person to person. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 not sure how much Hermione told you about what happened to me, but my limits were drastically increased. I can still do most things without much trouble, but shrinking objects is tricky business," he explained. "You have to put in the power to shrink the
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 object, the power to reduce the weight, and then the power to lock the object into that state.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Any object can be shrunk, you see, but it is intricate work. Living things are simple. A potion will work on anything that can drink it. The charm, even, is eas\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
ier on living things because they can adjust to excessive amounts of power almost instantaneously. Objects just\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  well\'85\loch\f0  explode."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Amazing," Mrs. Granger said with a look of awe on her face. "I so wish we could do more than just observe. To practice this wo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 uld be amazing."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry smiled mysteriously. "Well, anything else?" he asked as he bounced the cube in his hand.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No," Mrs. Granger said with a smile. "I do believe that is it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded. "All right, then," Harry said with a smile. "Let\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s get you to Hog\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 warts."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
The three walked downstairs, quickly, with Harry levitating the cube while on the steps, to avoid putting that much compressed weight into one place on non-magically reinforced steps. Once at the bottom, he looked at them a moment. "Forget anything
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ?" Both the Grangers shook their heads no.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ok, sit on the trunk, please," Harry asked of Mrs. Granger. "Anything you want to take has to be in direct contact with you or your clothes." He slowly rolled up his sleeve, where the phoenix on his arm was stret
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ching happily, and Mrs. Granger gasped as she saw it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t that try to bring the house with us, since we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No," Harry said \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 with a smile. "I guess you could call it smart magic. It knows what to bring, and what not to, in a sense. Just touch the mark and we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll be on our way."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The Granger elders reached out and placed a single finger on the wings of the phoenix. Mr. Granger grun\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ted and Mrs. Granger squeaked when they felt the jerk behind their navel. When the world came crashing back an instant later they were in the main hall of Hogwarts, where a streak of bushy-brown hair tackled them both with a giant smile on her face.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hermi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 one," Harry asked, stifling a laugh, "you can show your parents where my grandfather\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione nodded frantically as her \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 parents began to turn blue from lack of oxygen, Mrs. Granger flailing wildly. "Sure!"

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 At two minutes after six, the Minister of Magic, of the British magical community, walked into his office. He had a bad feeling about this day. He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d dreamed the pre\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Here is your coffee, Ministe\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 r," the new secretary he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d hired the week before said sweetly as she leaned over just enough to offer him a view down her loose fitting blouse. He groaned inwardly as he stared at this magnificent display of womanhood, tempting him once more. She smiled s
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 eetly as she noticed where he was looking. He didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t hear her mutter under her breath, as she left the room, "Stupid pig."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Damn that boy!" Fudge muttered as he looked over the papers on his desk. "If not for him, my approval rating would be so much better\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 , right now." He grabbed his coffee and took a small sip of it.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes, damn me," Harry said as he stepped out from under his invisibility cloak and sat down in front of the Minister. "Damn me for trying to save lives. Damn me because I tried so hard to get \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
you to listen. Damn me for not being a fool, like you. Damn me, for not making you look better."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "How did you get in here?! Get out!" the Minister shouted indignantly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sit, Cornelius," Harry said commandingly. "Or I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll make you."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "How }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 dare}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  you?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Did you\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  forget our last encounter, Minister? Sit," he said again firmly as the minister blanched swiftly. "Finish your coffee, while we talk."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fudge dropped into his chair weakly and guzzled down his coffee, hoping it would soothe his frayed nerves. "What do you \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 want, Harry?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Call me Mr. Potter," Harry hissed though gritted teeth. "I hoped after our last encounter you would quit thinking about your precious job and would worry more about people\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "B-Bu-But," he stuttered, "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve been trying to protect people."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes," Harry laughed derisively, "I suppose you have been protecting }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 people}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "That\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s not true," he began but the Veritaserum began to take hold.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Before the Veritaserum fully took hold of Cornelius Fudge, Harry smiled wickedly. "Don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t worry, Cornelius. We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll find the truth very soon."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The last thought that ran through\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  the Minister of Magic\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s mind before the Veritaserum fully had him was, }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Dear god, they

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry Potter walked onto the stage set up for his press conference, pulling the Minister of Magic behind him. With a shove, the Minister fel\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 l into a chair behind him. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ve called you all here, today," Harry said calmly, "to give you the truth, so that you may take it back to the public.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I have, since I know for a fact that some of you can not help but embellish your articles, set up a ward a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
round this area. Anyone with the intention of embellishing this story in the least should note that their parchment will continually burst into flames each time you try."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The only person to make a noise was Rita Skeeter who indignantly demanded that they c\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t take away the press\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No, Rita," he said with a wicked smile. "I am making sure the readers get the truth. You can make the story\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 readable any way you like, so long as you remain strictly to the facts. If, I might add, I find you writing another article like the one in Witch Weekly, that was also riddled with falsities, I will give those assembled another article that will make the

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Minister, please step forward," Harry said, and the Minister walked forward, somewhat reluctantly. "For those wondering, the Minister of Magic is un\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I will ask the questions I most think you need to know the answers to. I would thank you to remain silent while that occurs," Harry said as he stifled a laugh. Rita Skeeter was rapidly flai\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Cornelius Oswald Fudge."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Are you actually the Minister of Magic?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes, I am."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Did you know Voldemort was back before you finally admitted it?" The crowd shuddered as \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 the name was mentioned.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No, but I suspected it." This was met with whispers throughout the crowd as yet again Rita Skeeter\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s parchment burst into a flaming inferno.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Have you been hiding information from the public about Voldemort?" Again the crowd shudde\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 red, and Harry directed his attention to the crowd as Fudge answered.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes," Fudge admitted calmly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry turned and directed his attention to the audience, and spoke clearly, "I would also ask that you all print his name. Not Lord Voldemort, not the Dark \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
Lord, not You-Know-Who, and not He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Print his name. Use Voldemort or Tom Riddle. Preferably the latter."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Who is Tom Riddle?" one of the reporters shouted back.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry pulled out his wand, and wrote, in golden letters, the name \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 Tom Ma\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 rvolo Riddle\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
. With a swish of his wand the words rearranged themselves. "Tom Marvolo Riddle," stated clearly, without pause, "Heir of Salazar Slytherin, half-blood Dark Wizard, is Voldemort," Harry said as whispering broke out among the furious scratchin
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  of dozens of quills.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "His father, Tom Riddle, was a muggle. His mother a witch. Rather curious," Harry said with a smirk, "that the most feared Dark Wizard this century, who proclaims that only pureblooded wizards and witches matter, isn\hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Minister, has their been an escape from Azkaban, since that of Sirius Black?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes," he a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 dmitted. "Malfoy, MacNair, and Dolohov."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Did you hide this from the public?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Why?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I was afraid of losing office. My position is the most important thing in this world to me," he stated for all those present. "I was already ridiculed for being fr\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 iends with a known Death Eater."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Minister," Harry asked with a smirk, "do the lives of your public matter to you?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Absolutely."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Why?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "When they begin to die off, my approval rating drops dramatically."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Standing atop the large, wooden platform Harry wat\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ched as the gathered reporters scribbled furiously. Even Rita Skeeter, who had managed to stop her parchment from bursting into a fiery mess, was writing diligently. "Minister," he asked curiously, "have you hidden anything else from the public?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "P\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 lease, list those items for us."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "The Dementors may have sided with Voldemort, as Dumbledore said they would. He may also have managed to gain the help of a group of werewolves. He has recruited the help of most giants and possibly trolls, as well. There h
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ave been several attacks on muggleborns and half-bloods since Voldemort\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s return that have been downplayed as random violence, regardless of the fact that the Dark Mark was found over the crime scene.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I have also recently began cheating on my wife with my\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 new secretary, whom I hired only because she has a nice backside and firm breasts," he said simply. "She approached me with the promiscuous offer, in return for a promotion to a position as my personal secretary, and I was too weak-willed to resist."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harr\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
y stifled a laugh at that, because said secretary was in the audience and immediately hid her face and disappeared quickly back into the building. "Have you committed any crimes you would prefer not to admit to?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, and what would those be?" Harry\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  asked calmly, but inside he was grinning like a madman. He had, without a doubt, utterly destroyed the Minister of Magic\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s career.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I apparated for two years before I was old enough to get my license. I have also used magic in front of muggles while drunk\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
, and used my position to cover it up, violating Section Thirteen of the Statute of Secrecy."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Minister, after your admissions, do you think you will remain as the Minister of Magic?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "If I can somehow make it seem like you forced me to say these things, p\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ossibly by claiming you put me under the Imperius Curse," the Minister stated calmly, "then I can probably trick the fools that make up the general public into allowing me to remain in office."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Do you think you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll be able to do that, after }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 that}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  statement?\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Minister," Harry asked in a sickeningly sweet voice, "do you have anything else you would like to tell the people assembled, since I am fairly sure you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll not be Minister of Magic much longer?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes. I hate Harry Potter with all of my being."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Mis\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ter Moody," Harry said with a smile. "You can take him to a holding cell, now. The Veritaserum should wear off soon."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Moody and his aurors stepped forward and took the Minister of Magic into custody. Harry watched with an elated smile as the Minister was l\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ed from the platform and into protective custody.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So," Harry said brightly. "Any questions?" Harry Potter\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s question was met with absolute silence as the assembled reporters stared at him in shock.

\par }\pard \sb100\sa100\nowidctlpar\faauto {\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dear Reader,
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I want to apologize for taking so long to get this ready. I finally gave up on keeping ahead of the story and have, since chapter seven, been posting when I get finished. Normally it takes me\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 about two days to write a single chapter, but the main problem is that for about a week I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve not had the urge to write. Depression sucks. Long story short, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m posting this and the Medallion of Seth chapter at the same time to make up for the long drough\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 This also marks the passing of the 100,000 words mark, for this story. Yay! Not much, really (for a story that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s only about a month old, anyway), but I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m proud of it. Hopefully, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll be finished with this story within the next two months. Hopefully. :)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 N\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ormally I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t tell you what will be in the next chapter (because I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t really know until I start writing it). I will give you this bit of information, though. I will, more than likely, address the issue of the new Minister of Magic next chapter and po\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
sibly the first class with the Grangers. I set up the Minister issue in this chapter for that specific reason. I just really wanted to do a battle, so I let that more or less interrupt the entire day.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As always, I appreciate the reviews. I was hoping I wou\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ld reach review number two hundred before I posted this, but I suppose it just wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t meant to be.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Now, to address a few points mentioned in reviews, starting with the issue of Percy. Why does he deserve a second chance\'85\loch\f0  well, the simplest answer is becaus\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e I\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 m the author and I say he does, but that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s probably not the one you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re looking for. ;) Percy isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t a bad guy, unlike Fudge. He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 
s young, na\'ef\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ve, maybe a bit foolish\'85\loch\f0  but, his heart was in the right place. He thought what he was doing was right, and as t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ey say the highway to hell is paved with good intentions.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Why hasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t he apologized publicly\'85\loch\f0  simply put, he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s more useful if people think he and his father aren\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t on the best of terms. Do you think he could have gotten that information from Fudge if people\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  knew he had made up with his father? I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t. So, publicly, he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s the same Percy we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve always seen. Privately is another matter entirely.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As for everyone having powers and abilities, they don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t. Magus abilities, by my standard, are something major. A parse\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 lmouth, for example, isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t a magus, they just have a special ability. A Stormwalker, however, would be considered a magus. And, to give you ample warning, I do plan on making more magi and more gifted people, but I urge you to wait and see before you pass
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 judgment.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
Next, I want to address the issue of the Tear. A lot of people, I think, assumed that I would simply grant Harry loads of power and knowledge without any problems. When you have the memories of thousands of people in your head, sure you know a lo
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t, but you also have to deal with what that does to your mind. He is literally thousands of people all rolled into one, with Harry at the helm doing his best to control the others.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Some might think I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve made it seem as Harry has more political power than F\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 udge. I haven\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t. I have simply demonstrated that he has fame, and a good bit of it. He simply used that fame to accomplish a goal, in this case.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s little fit won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t happen to Ron and Ginny, at least not for the same reason. Her powers are related t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
o the mind. She has to shield herself from those around her to avoid picking up on errant thoughts and feelings. Her powers grew, but her shields stayed the same. As such, she more or less was overwhelmed and lost it. Thankfully she\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 s still not back up to\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 full power so she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s under control until Harry can help her with her shields.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Next, the issue of who Harry will be joined with as far as a relationship goes. Simply put, there are no guarantees. I do have a preference for Harry and Ginny (in general, not ne\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
cessarily for this story), but that is simply over certain other pairings that I really hate.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t stand seeing Hermione with pretty much anyone except for Ron, so you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll likely never see a Hermione and Harry pairing from me, and I generally refuse to r
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ead them. I can see hotheaded Ron being after the analytical bookworm, but it just doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t work when I try to envision it with Harry. At one point, right after I saw the first two movies, I thought a Harry and Hermione relationship would be good, but now \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  just really don\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 t like it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t like Ginny and Draco, so you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll more than likely never see }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 that}{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 from me, either. I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t mind the ones where Draco becomes her friend, but if it becomes more than that, I just can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t fathom it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I also don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t like Harry sla\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 sh. Though I can see Draco being gay and can think of a few interesting story ideas with that concept, I just can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t see it with Harry. So, that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s out for me as well. As for femmeslash\'85\loch\f0  I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 m male and heterosexual\'85\loch\f0  of course I like it. ;)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m not as much agai\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 nst Ginny and Harry with others, though. Harry and Blaise (in a few of the stories I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ve seen) are quite good. The idea of Harry and a Slytherin just grabs my interest quite a bit. With Ginny, I can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t really picture her with anyone but Harry, but I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve trie\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  to keep an open mind on that front.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 So, for those who make a prediction on it being Ginny simply because I said I like Harry and Ginny paired, you might be disappointed. ;)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 How powerful is Harry. Well\'85\loch\f0  really, no one knows. Not even Harry. He has an idea \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 of what he can and can not do, but he has to be careful (as you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ll see in this chapter, when he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s not careful he tends to break things\'85\loch\f0  like ancient magical wards). So, will he figure out how powerful he is? Eventually, yes. As you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ll also see in this cha\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ter, he is still susceptible to magic and harm, though.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The issue of Ginny hexing Fred, would Harry know about it? Yes, to an extent he would. Keep in mind, though, that while he has the memories and can access them, they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re not at the front of his mind al
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 l the time. He has to consciously think about it, which is why he doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know if he can or can not do something until he thinks about it or has a strong emotional reaction.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The best explanation I can give for it is how I think of it, really. Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s mind \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 contains thousands of other minds. Each mind has its own agenda. Ginny\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 s mind, like she used to be, is simply trying to stay out of Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s notice. There are other minds that sometimes try to fight to the surface (a lot like I explained the werewolves\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  be
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 st spirit). Hence why the idea of killing doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t bother him as much as it normally would\'85\loch\f0 
 he has a lot of minds from a time when killing a criminal or one\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s enemy was the expected response. I hope that makes sense, but I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sure it probably doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t.

\par }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 by Rita Skeeter
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Earlier this morning a press conference was called outside the Ministry of Magic under cover of Muggle Repelling Wards. The only information given to those invited was that both the Minister \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
of Magic and Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, would be speaking. Little did we know that the Minister of Magic would incriminate himself multiple times before those assembled.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The Minister, Cornelius Oswald Fudge, under the influence of Veritaserum, admitt\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ed to suspecting Tom Riddle, also known as He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, of returning long before he finally admitted this fact to the magical community of Britain. Rather than admit he was wrong, and risk the security of his position as Minister of Magic, he
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 allowed the magical community of Britain to believe they were safe.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Among other things he admitted were facts and possibilities he intentionally hid from the public. The possibility that the Dementors may have joined Tom Riddle; that a group of werewolves \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
may now be working for him; that since Tom Riddle\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s return our former Minister has downplayed several attacks on muggleborns; and the giants, as well as possibly the trolls, have sided with Riddle.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 While under the influence of Veritaserum, he further admit\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ted to violating the Statute of Secrecy while drunk, acts of infidelity against his wife, and apparating without a license for over two years while still a minor.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Then, after admitting to his crimes, Fudge had the audacity to admit he would have framed the\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  Boy-Who-Lived, claiming that he had somehow }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 forced}{
\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  our \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 illustrious\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 former Minister to say these things. While it is not normally in my nature to print opinions, I believe that immediate action should be taken to ensure that our next Minister has more im\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
portant matters in mind, such as the safety of the public.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Thankfully, the former Minister of Magic is being brought up on criminal charges for his actions against the magical community of Britain. Cornelius Oswald Fudge is facing, at the very least, a two\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
-year term in Azkaban and has already lost his office as Minister of Magic. An office that he admitted was more important to him than the lives of those he is supposed to serve.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The Boy-Who-Lived also took the time at the press conference to provide some i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
nteresting information about You-Know-Who. For those who are wondering why I am referring to You-Know-Who as Tom Riddle, above, that is his real name. Among the aforementioned information was also the fact that Riddle is a half-blood, something he has int
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ntionally hidden from the public, it seems, as it would harm his stance that only purebloods are of consequence. At the request of the Boy-Who-Lived, I will be referring to You-Know-Who as Tom Riddle from this day forward.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The Ministry Council will be conv\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ening in a private location, withheld for safety reasons, to nominate and elect a new Minister of Magic. He, or she, will be announced at a press conference tomorrow afternoon, at which the new Minister will take office. I think it is safe to say that we 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ll hope our new Minister will have better intentions than the disgraceful Cornelius Oswald Fudge.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I know," he said, not feeling like discussing the issue any longer.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Mr. Potter," a stern voice called as she approached. "Is there a reason you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re on the floor?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh," Blaise said softly, as she look\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ed up with a guilty grin. "That was my fault, professor."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Indeed," Professor McGonogall said with an arched brow. "Mr. Potter, as you may know the Quidditch season will be starting soon. I would be most appreciative if you would prepare your team."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Very good, Mr. Potter," she said with a hint of a smile. "I hav\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Blaise poked Harry, who hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t moved since he heard what McGonogall sai\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d, and he turned to face her. She had her face crinkled slightly. "You won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t be mad at me if I join the Slytherin Quidditch team, will you?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry looked confused for a moment, then realized what she meant. "No," he said with a genuine smile. "If you want \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 to play Quidditch, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m not going to be mad. If Malfoy gives you a hard time, let me know and I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Tell me about it," Ron muttered. "Hermione is mad at me because I\'85\loch\f0 " he stopped quickly the moment he realized who he was talking to.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Because you don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t like what\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s going on with me, Gin, and Blaise, and you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d like to beat some sense in to me?" Harry\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 finished with an odd smile on his face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Well\'85\loch\f0  yeah," Ron said, a tinge of pink covering his ears. "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s nothing personal, mind. Brotherly instincts, you understand?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "No," Harry said sadly, "I wish I did\'85\loch\f0  but, what did Hermione say?" he asked curiously.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "She told me that it wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t my business, no matter how much I may not like it. If Ginny told me to stay out of it, I should stay out of it. She did tell me that she doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t like it either, though."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded. "Ron, let me ask you a question. If you had \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
two beautiful young women chasing you, jerking you into a closet here, behind a stature there, and then snogging your brains out, how would you get them to stop without hurting their feelings? Keep in mind that they grab you randomly and kiss you until th
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  only thing you can think about is why it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s so hard to breathe."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded. "Exactly," he said seriously. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve told them both I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m not ready for a relationship. I tried to get them to stop snogging the hell out of me, too. The problem is that every time I tried they snogged me until I sounded like Quirrel!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ro\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n blinked owlishly. "Yeah, I can see how that might cause a problem."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t like the idea of leading either one of them on," Harry said as he collapsed into the seat next to Ron. "If I had my way, they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d give me the time to figure out what I want, befor\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e I had to deal with this. But, they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re not having any of that."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Have you tried simply asking them?" Hermione asked as she sat down opposite Ron with a scowl on her face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes," Ron answered for Harry. "That\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s what he just said. Every time he tried to ask\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  them, they just snogged him out of his head."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione glanced at Harry, her eyes filled with disbelief. "I can see Blaise doing that," she said coolly, "but not Ginny. She\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s too innocent."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hermione, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but Ginny is a \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 rather attractive young woman. She also knows exactly how to make my brain stop working."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ron looked appalled at the thought, and Hermione was just shocked completely. Harry shook his head weakly, and nearly leaped out of his skin when he heard someone whi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
sper in his ear. "Oh, I do, do I?" Ginny asked as her hands slid inside Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s shirt and she bit down on his neck.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry groaned. "BLOODY HELL!" Ron shouted, gaining him glances from most of the people in the Great Hall. "Get a room!" Ginny looked up at R\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
on and a wicked smile spread on her face, and Ron immediately regretted his statement. "I shouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t have said that."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Really, Ron," Hermione muttered. "What was your first clue?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry tried to remember that he was irritated with Ginny. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m still irritat\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ed with you," he muttered, though he didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t sound very convincing with her hand down his shirt and his voice quite shaky.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Ginny let a guilty grin slip onto her face and she dropped into the seat by Harry. "Erm\'85\loch\f0  sorry," she said as she laid her head on his \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
shoulder. "Forgive me?" she said in a rather cute, innocent voice. "Pwease?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry rolled his eyes, then looked at Hermione. "See?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione had an odd, frowning smile on her face. "Yes, it seems I owe you an apology," she muttered.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What for?" Ginny asked\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 , and Harry glanced at her.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Nothing," Harry muttered. "You ready for Quidditch? We only have two weeks to practice before the first game."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny frowned and Ron muttered, "Why are they just now letting us start practice?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "They were still undecided on whe\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ther or not to }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 have}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well," Ginny said brightly, thought it was hard \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 to miss the tinge of sadness in her voice, "at least }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 you}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re good, Ginny," Ron said seriously. "And we need new chasers."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Maybe," Ginny said indecisively\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 . "When are we going to get back to learning about our magus abilities?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, Hermione gets to start back today," Harry said while looking out over the Great Hall. "The rest of you need to finish up what I have you studying. Thankfully Fred and George ca\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
n help you two while I get Hermione to the point that she won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t run off killing people for no reason," Harry said, causing Hermione to duck her head to hide her embarrassment.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry," Ginny whispered into his ear once the others returned to their food. "I\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  really am sorry."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry glanced over at her, and noticed just how sincere she really was. He smiled and winked at her, quickly. "I know."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Suddenly, without warning, a roar rumbled through the school. A roar that Harry recognized far too well. Immediately \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
he jumped up from his seat. "GARETH!" he bellowed, and in an instant he was outside. A moment later his friends were with him, including the twins, who had just entered the Great Hall for breakfast.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s going on?" George asked as he gasped for breath.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "MASTER! HELP ME!" Zanith screamed from where he was. Hagrid was outside his hut, wand firmly in hand, with Zane held protectively behind him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll be a\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 right, Zane," Harry heard him say, though no one else had hearing like his. "Ain\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t no ruddy monster l\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ike 
\hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 im gonna hurt yeh, I promise."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Gareth roared loudly, flame billowing from his nostrils, and smacked Hagrid away. In an instant Hagrid was on his feet again, sprinting the distance back to his adopted son. He tried to shout out the Caustic Agony spell,
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  but couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t get the wand motion right. Finally he just tossed his wand to one side and hurled himself at the large English Black that by then had Zane in his large claw.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 With a furious roar Hagrid latched onto the dragon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s claws and began to pry them ope\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
n. The man, three times the size of a normal human, wrenched open the claws, his muscles sounding as if they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d tear completely off the bone. Hagrid didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t stop though. Finally, with the last of his strength he wrenched the claws open. The only problem was\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 that he was in mid-air.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Zane went into a free fall, screaming as he approached the ground quickly. Without a second thought Hagrid let go of the dragon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s claw. As he fell he quickly caught up with Zane, and wrapped him protectively in his arms. With a fina\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 l mid-air twist, Hagrid crashed to the ground with Zane cradled in his arms.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Fred, and George watched the spectacle in awe. They\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d never seen Hagrid so furious. Without warning an explosion set off in their midst. Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I WARNED YOU GARETH," Harry bellowed, his body\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s lungs amplifying the words so that the entirety of Hogwarts heard Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

 and a roar of pain echoed over the ground. Again Harry slammed his fist into the dragon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s head, as if trying to tear through its thick skull.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Master of Dragons," a dark, gritty voice called from the forest. "I challenge you. Ancient law demands you meet \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
my challenge, Master of Dragons!" Slowly Gamesh stepped from the shadows, a hideous and toothy grin on his face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Who challenges me," Harry hissed, as he continued to ram his fist into Gareth\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s thick skull.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So be it," H\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 arry growled and slammed his fist against Gareth\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s head one final time. The dragon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s roaring ended abruptly and he crashed to the ground, unconscious. Harry rolled as he landed, coming to his feet immediately and stalking towards Gamesh.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I, Harry Potter, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 accept the challenge. Face me, Gamesh, in combat!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 A grin broke across the face of the Daemon King as he stepped forward and looked down on Harry. "You are a tiny man. Breaking you shall be quite pleasurable."

in the stomach, launching the twelve-foot tall monster back into the forest from whence he came. A low, guttural growl pierced the air and Gamesh came running out of the forest, his golden fur glinting as he streaked across the ground like lightning from 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 he sky. With a sickening crunch, his foot slammed into Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s chest knocking him back a good forty feet, and tearing up the lawn as he skidded atop it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You are strong," Gamesh said with a grim smile, "but you are no daemon!" There was a roar of approval \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
from the forest as a host of daemons stepped forth from dark trees. "You see, child? You have no chance."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry was helped to his feet by an inky black arm. "Alright there, Harry?" Ron asked, his shady body seeming like a void in the morning light.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry c\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t help but grin. "Great, Ron." Ron fell in on Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s left, with Hermione\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Just tap into your power," Dumbledore said as he strode up to the group. Unlike his normal self, he radiated power. His eyes changed from their normal blue to a de\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ep purple and his hair fanned out from the crackle of the energy in the air around him. "You may not be able to do anything with it, but it will charge your magic."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry," Ron muttered, "what the bloody hell is going on?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "My grandfather, like your brot\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 hers, is a Stormwalker. If you want to know more, ask him. In the mean time, I suggest you prepare to fight. I hope you fight to kill, but if you don\hich\f0 \rquote

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hearing that was \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
enough for Fred and George. With a crackle they tapped their power, their eyes set to glowing in the process. "Harry," Fred muttered, "you better not get yourself killed. We still have training to do."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry smiled over at Fred. "Deal." Harry turned back t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
o the daemons and grinned at the horde that stood at the edge of the forest. He tilted his head to one side, and a loud crack sounded from the bones in his neck. He did the same to the other side. With a wave of his hand a large broadsword appeared, twist
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
d runes etched into it glowing deep and black. A moment later the blade of the sword burst forth with a black flame. Harry stuck the sword over his back and it floated in the air right behind him, as if sheathed in the air.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 With a growl Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s clothes shi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 fted into those he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "The children will no\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t be harmed. I am here for you and you alone. The children are of no consequence to me."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "The terms are set," Harry roared into the space that would be their battlefield. The flame on his sword exploded. A moment later Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hair was replaced by dark, bl\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ack flames, flickering and dancing in the morning light as if trying to suck the very sun into its dark fire. His eyes turned into empty black voids, looking much like Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s shadowy form. The tips of his boots caught fire, as did the tops of his gloves. "\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry," Dumbledore said wearily, "this is absurd."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes, but I\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  am required to meet his challenge by ancient law. So, I will."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Come out, Master of Dragons! FACE ME!" Gamesh roared loudly. "FACE ME OR FORFEIT!"

he same, gathering shadows to shield himself for the coming battle. Hagrid, who had finally regained consciousness from his fall, joined them with Zane by his side. Dumbledore looked the epitome of power as his body turned into a mass of swirling energy. 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 G\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 inny, who was already prepared, simply watched the battle in fear.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "D-D-Dad," Zane whimpered, his fear finally subsiding. "I need to give you something." Hagrid simply watched as Zane flicked his wand at Hagrid\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s clothes, and slowly they changed into an ou
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 tfit identical to Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s, the only difference was that his was yellow. He flicked his hand once more and Hagrid\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hair and beard braided itself tightly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He looked over at Fred and George and did the same. Both Fred and George\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s were purple, where Hagrid\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  was yellow and Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry, who was still fighting sword to axe with Gamesh chanced a glance at his friends and noticed that Zane was preparing those without control\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  of their power. }{\i\fs24\kerning0 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I knew that boy would be smart,"}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  Harry thought to himself as he whipped his free fist out and slammed the black, flaming glove into Gamesh\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

 toothy grin appeared on his face as he looked up at Harry. Harry waved his hand at Zane, releasing him from his restrictions temporarily.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Quickly, before Gamesh could resume attacking he projected his thoughts at Hermione, and she was nearly knocked from \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 her feet by the force of it. }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
"HERMIONE! TELL ZANE HIS RESTRICTIONS ARE LIFTED! NOW!"}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  Just as suddenly, the voice in her mind was gone.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Zane," Hermione said to the young boy. "Your restrictions are lifted."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Zane looked up at her in surprise, then smiled. S\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
lowly he began to change, and then it became more rapid. When he was done he looked to be as old as Harry. His messy blonde hair had grown to the edge of his shoulder blades and his deep blue eyes sparkled. A smirk, reminiscent of Malfoy, appeared on his 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ace as his ears grew into slight points. He grew from a few short feet to close to six and a half feet. His muscled form looked as if it could give Hagrid a run for his money. Like Harry\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 s before, Zane\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s clothes shifted into a Battle Wizard\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s uniform. Whe\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 In the makeshift battlefield, Harry was being forced\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  back. Gamesh\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s dark laughter rang over the field as he backhanded Harry hard across the jaw. Dazed, Harry\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 s half-limp body flew across the field and skidded across the ground. He stood up and shook his head, trying to shake off the dizziness. He tossed t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Quickly he drew his wand from the glove on his left hand and flicked it toward Gamesh. "}{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 STUPEFY!}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Very good, Master of Dragons," Gamesh hissed. "You learn quickly. Light Magic is useless against me, but your Dark Magic \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ctually felt that," Gamesh laughed. "Interesting." With a lightning-like movement Gamesh was in front of Harry. He leaned over and whispered into Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 A roar of elation swept over the ranks of the daemon horde. "I can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t believe it," Ginny gasped as she tried to hold back her tears, but failed. "I just can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t believe it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Believe it," Za\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ne stated in his new deep baritone. "His heart stopped when he collapsed, so did his lungs. He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s dead, meaning they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 lightning sped from the sky and slammed into Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s lifeless body.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione spoke up. "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s a fact of nature," she told Ginny. "It could jumpstart his heart, and bring him back to us."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "YOU WASTE\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  YOUR TIME!" Gamesh roared with laughter. "His magic is gone, his body is dead!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Again a bolt of lightning slammed into Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s body, only this time it was from all three Stormwalkers. Without the others\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  notice, Fred and George walked over and stuck their
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  hands against Dumbledore\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 tial by measure.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
When the light receded and the sound dissipated, standing over Gamesh was the biggest dragon any of them had seen. Its body was mostly black with glowing emerald eyes. The stomach and claws were brilliantly silver. The horned head let out 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 another resounding roar as it leaned down face to face with a wide-eyed Gamesh. Without warning the large dragon collapsed on the ground.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s alive," Zane said happily. "But, he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s too weak to do anything else. We have three choices. We can leave him to t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "My pleasure," Ron growled as his body vanished in\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
to the ground. Without warning he resurfaced by Gamesh. With a whip of his shadowy arm, his fist engorged to half the side of his body, Gamesh was sailing across the open field. That was the beginning of their battle.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The twins pulled their wands out of th\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
eir gloves and began to shout out spells, still tapped into their core of power. The spells simply bounced away, doing no damage. They glanced at each other with worried faces. George sent a stunner at one of the daemons without result, and Fred was quite
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
worried by that time. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the bottle of shocking salt. He poured a few crystals into his hand and swallowed them down. Power rippled off him like water in a pond. "}{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
Stupefy!}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 " he whispered and his stunner sped across the\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  field and slammed into one of the daemons like a battering ram.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Holy hell," George muttered as the spell bounced off the daemon. The spell didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t stun the daemon but had enough force behind it to physically move him. "How many did you use, Fred?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "About\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  ten," his brother replied with a grin. "There is so much I can barely contain it, but if it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll help I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll do it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 George nodded and dumped ten of the small crystals into his hand, swallowing them back immediately. Again a ripple of power flooded over the b\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 attlefield. "}{\i\fs24\kerning0

" George shouted and his stunner sped across the field and bounced off of one of the daemons. His aim was a bit better because the ricochet caught another of the daemons as it bounced away.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fred and George grinned at each other and sta\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
rted shouting out stunners, back to back with each other to provide better protection. The daemons they hit did managed to get back up, most of the time, but they still managed to keep them back while the others tore them apart.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s electric body \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny was doing her best to hold them back as Hermione tried to tear into their minds, but she wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t able to do much aside from bat them back. Fire didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hagrid was making good time by grabbing most of them and hurling the\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 m into trees with Zane by his side, Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fred, George, and Dumbledore reached Harry at the same time. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m too wea\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 k to move him," Dumbledore told them.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ah, we can cure that," George said with a grin.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fred nodded. "Oh indeed." They poured some of the shocking salt into their hands and handed into Dumbledore. "Swallow it," Fred said with a grin.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore nodded and t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Not missing a s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 tep, the man transformed completely into a wolf and leaped at the throat of another, tearing out its jugular. "That\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fred and George glanced at each other. "They don\loch\af0\dbch\af15\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t?"

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I see him," George said in reply.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Are you prepared for your death?" the daemon hissed at them.

 no, but we have a present for you," Fred said with a grin. George, catching on, nodded. At the same time they fired off point blank stunners. The daemon roared as the stunners mixed and slammed into him. He was out like a light, a moment later.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Wow," Ron muttered. "Fifteen minutes, and the bastard still isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t dead."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Skin\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s too thick," Ron replied casually. "The most I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve been able to do is scratch him. It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s like his skin is made\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fred glanced at George, then without warning he slapped H\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ermione. She immediately snapped out of her shock into outrage at being slapped. "HOW DARE YOU?!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hermaninny," George said, his hands raised in a placating manner, "we had to snap you out of it. We need help!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione looked around, sheepishly, then nodd\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ed. She focused hard and tried to remember how she felt the previous day when she got so angry, but it wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t working. The only thing she }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 could}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  remember was how to form those firebombs, and that she did. Without warning she hurled one of them at a daemon. 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The daemon laughed and made to bat it away. As his hand hit it, it exploded around him. Moments later, all that remained was a charred heap of ash and bone.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The wolf-man loped up beside them. "Well," he said with a wolfish grin, "you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re all doin\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 g rather well."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Uh\'85\loch\f0  who are you," Fred asked, a bit wary at the prospect of a wolf-man near him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The wolf-man\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s response was to shift back into Remus Lupin. Once in his fully human form, he winked at them and shifted straight back. "Surprise?" he growled,\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 a smile in his voice.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "GET AWAY FROM MY SON!" Hagrid roared as one of the daemon host advanced on Zane, who was scrambling across the ground for the sword. Hagrid\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s yellow-clad body stormed at the daemon with his huge hands clasped into a joint fist. With\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 a blow like an explosion the daemon whipped across the ground and into the forest, felling any tree it came into contact with. Hagrid scooped Zane up under one arm and the sword into the other hand and scrambled at a dead run over to the assembling group
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 From the lake there came a blast of water and Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s shadowy body landed in a heap among the group, followed closely by the rain of lake-water. A livid, soaked, daemon King trudged out of the lake, a snarl on his face. "Pathetic."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As the daemon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s advanced \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
on the small group, an army versus an elite squad, a trumpet sounded in the forest. A moment later another sounded, and then another. The clatter of hooves filled the forest and the daemon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s stopped their advance to see what the commotion was. For several\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 minutes the daemon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s watched the forest, no one moving, then an army of centaurs, led by Firenze, burst forth from the forest, many carrying bows, some with spears, and still more with swords.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "MARS WILL BE BRIGHT IN THE SKY TONIGHT!" Firenze roared as the\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 centaur army charged without mercy, stabbing, cutting, impaling, and shooting any daemon that dared to attack them. Several of the centaurs fell back on simply trampling the daemon host.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 In a matter of minutes, the daemon host retreated, Gamesh snarling t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
he entire time. With a crack he disapparated and reappeared by the unconscious Gareth. Laying a large, furry hand on the dragon, he growled for those assembled, "You shall all die," and he pointed at Ron, his eyes glinting dangerously, "and you shall die 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ost painfully."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ron, who had just managed to get to his feet, smiled at Gamesh sadistically. "I look forward to it, Gammy," Ron said with a laugh. "Hugs and kisses until next time!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Erm\'85\loch\f0  Ron," Fred whispered urgently, "it might not be a good idea to mock \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a demon king."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Gamesh roared and disapparated again, taking Gareth with him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Finally, Dumbledore and Harry appeared amidst the assembled group. "That was most prob\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 lematic," Dumbledore said seriously as Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s now human form fell to the ground.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Firenze bowed his head to his centaur brethren. "I thank you," he said simply.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "We didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t do this for you, traitor," Bane growled as he stamped his hooves. "We do not meddle \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
in the affairs of man. Daemons are not men. We will fight against the daemon hordes whenever they arise, but you are not welcome in the forest otherwise."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Firenze nodded his head dejectedly. "Thank you, anyway." With that the centaurs turned and left, tram\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 pling any daemon corpse they happened upon as they left the field.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore, his body back to his normal form, smiled. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sure you all have many questions. First we must attend to our problems, however. Those who are injured, get to the infirmary. Thos
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e who are able, check the demons. Any who are alive need to be bound and brought to the center of the anti-apparation wards, until they can be strengthened and possibly repaired."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hagrid nodded as he clutched Zane close. Zane was covered in cuts and bruise\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
s, as was Hagrid who had a deep gash down his left arm that was freely pouring blood. Fred and George were in good shape, having managed to avoid coming into direct contact with any of the daemons. Harry was exhausted and battered. Ginny had a few scratch
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s, as did Hermione, but otherwise they were fine. Ron, after Gamesh left, fell to the ground clutching his sides with his eyes squinted shut, and hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t changed since. Remus was unscathed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll take Harry," Hagrid said as he scooped Harry up and draped hi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 m over his shoulder. "Le\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s go, Zane. All of yeh tha\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ah, Remus," Dumbledore said as he glanced at the now fully human man. "What are you doing her\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "I got a note\'85\loch\f0 " he said as he reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a plain white envelope and handed it to Dumbledore, who opened it and looked it over.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It is most fortunate that you did," Dumbledor\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e said seriously. "Whoever this person is, we owe them a debt of gratitude."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Dumbledore nodded. "I can feel the charm on the parchmen\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t. He tried several different varieties, I would guess."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll hold \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 im," Hagrid said as he moved to stand, but Zane cut him off.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll do it. Finish cleaning your cuts," the young boy said as he pulled his wand out of his now tiny version of Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Battle \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Wizard uniform. "
}{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Petrifus!}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 " he stated calmly, and Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s body went slack.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Madame Pomfrey was too busy to worry about the fact that a near toddler, covered in cuts and bruises no less, just used magic she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d never heard of. She immediately went to work clea
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ning the cuts, and Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eyes snapped open from the shock of it. A moment later she was done. "Ok, that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s fine," she told Zane and he released the spell. "Harry," she said as she lifted his head and grabbed one of the several bottles, "you need to drink\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 this."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry opened his mouth and swallowed down the contents, a yellowish-green liquid, and immediately began to gag. "Tastes like something Snape would make," he said wryly as a shudder passed through his body.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Very astute," she told him. "Now, drink th\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
is," she said, holding a thick, black sludge up to his mouth and again he swallowed the substance. "And this," she said, holding another bottle to his mouth which he swallowed as well. "Last one," she said softly, and pressed it to his lips and he swallow
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d it back. "Alright," she smiled, "now this is dreamless sleep potion," she told him as she pressed a goblet to his lips and Harry guzzled it down. A moment later he was sleeping.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What was all that," Hagrid asked after Harry was asleep.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "The first was to \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
close his cuts, then a blood restorative, then a physical restorative to deal with any internal injuries, the fourth was to strengthen his heart which was extremely weak, then finally the dreamless sleep potion," Madame Pomfrey stated matter-of-factly. "T
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 at boy never fails to surprise me."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 She moved over to Hagrid and inspected his cuts. "You did a very good job with cleaning these," she told him. "You must have to do this often," she chided, and Hagrid gave a rather guilty, lopsided grin. "Drink these," s
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 he said, handing him the first and second potions that Harry took. Hagrid nodded and swallowed them down.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 When Madame Pomfrey turned on Zane he pointed at Ron. "Him first," Zane said simply. "He probably has a few broken ribs, among other things."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Madame P\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
omfrey eyed him a moment, then nodded and turned to Ron, whose body had finally returned to its human state. She waved her wand over his head and her eyes nearly bugged out of hers. "He\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  his\'85\loch\f0 
 the organs in his body are literally reforming!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Zane looked sur\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 prised, then nodded. "He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s more advanced than I suspected," he said with an approving smile. "He should be fine soon, then."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ron groaned once more, "Tell that to my ribs. Hurts like hell!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well," Zane muttered, "that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll teach you to maintain your transfor\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 med state until the fighting is through, won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Madame Pomfrey listened to this in stunned silence. Finally, she shook off her surprise. "Now," she said glaring at Zane, "your turn! I am going to guess that since you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re in the same clothes, you
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re the \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
young man that brought Mr. Weasley in?" Zane muttered irritably, but sat down on the bed and nodded once. She passed her wand over his head once, then frowned. "A few scrapes and cuts, a concussion, two broken toes, a sprained ankle and a fracture on your
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 wrist. Merlin\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s staff, child!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Zane smiled guiltily. "Um\'85\loch\f0  sorry?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t tell me, sorry," she admonished quickly, "it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s your body you should apologize to. You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
re a tough little one," she said with a half-smile. "Drink this," she said as she handed him a bo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ttle, "and this," she said as she handed him another. "The second will take care of that concussion and the ankle." She immediately began passing her wand over his wrist, and after a few minutes of muttering, she smiled then removed his boot and did the s
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 me to his toes. "There. I want you all to rest. If I see any of you out of bed for the next six hours, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll sedate you properly."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Righ\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  then," Hagrid said seriously. "I suggest we try to get some sleep," he said to Zane and Ron who was doubled up on his b\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ed clutching his ribs. Hagrid frowned then laid back long ways across several of the beds.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Six hours later, Hagrid stood up and stretched with a yawn. He walked over by Zane\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s bed and patted him softly on the back. "Hagrid," Ron said across the young boy\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  bed, "what are we going to do if this happens again?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hagrid frowned. "I really don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  know," he said seriously. "Dumbledore\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll know," he said solemnly. "Great man, Dumbledore."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ron chewed the inside of his lip. "If Harry hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t been there," Ron stated grav\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ely.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I know," Hagrid said as he rested his huge hand on his adopted son. "I migh\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ave lost Zane \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 ere. I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t think I could \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
"Thanks, dad," Zane said as he stretched in the bed, a faint smile on his face. "As for what to do," he said through a yawn, "we need to strengthen the wards on the school, badly. That alone could have prevented a lot of this. Extending it to that to
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 wn down below would help also."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s right," Harry said seriously as he sat up in his bed. "The wards on Hogwarts are weak. I proved that when I tore through them earlier, even if it was an accident."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Madame Pomfrey arrived about that time. "How did you -\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 -"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m a bit different now," Harry said with a smile. "The sleeping potion wore off about two hours ago. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve been lying here, resting, for the past two hours."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well," she said with a frown, "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll just have to double the dose next time."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Next time?" Har\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ry asked with a frown.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t act all innocent, child," she said with a half-frown, half-smile. "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll be in here at least two more times before the end of the school year, and you know it."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "She\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s got you there, Harry," Ron said with a chuckle.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I du\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 nno," Hagrid said with no trace of humor in his voice, "he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s a tough one, now. He might get out with only once more." He then burst out laughing, loudly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Zane, who didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s relationship with the infirmary simply thought that the three older peop\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 le had lost their minds. "}{\i\fs24\kerning0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Wow," Ron muttered, and Madame Pomfrey simply shook her head.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ok, checkup time," she said seriously, walking over to Harry. Harry nodded and she waved her wand over his he\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ad. "You\'85\loch\f0  you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 re\'85\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "So, I can go?" Harry asked happily, for clarification.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I suppose so," she said with a frown, then turned towards Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s bed. "Your turn," she told him as she passed her wand over his head. "Completely n\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What about me?" Zane asked with a bright smile. "Can I go, too?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 She passed her wand over his head, then shook hers. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 m just\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  I\'85\loch\f0  oh, go." Ron, Harry, Hagrid, and Zane grinned wid\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As they walked down the hall, the four previous infirmary inhabitants were deep in thought. Hagrid noticed that his outfit was completely \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ruined, mostly due to the fact that it had a large rip down the arm where one of the daemons ripped through it, and that irritated him a bit since it was Zane that had made it for him. Zane\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s also had various rips and tears, but that wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t the reason for\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 his frown\'85\loch\f0  no, he was more irked that Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d put his restrictions back in place. Ron was muttering about the fact that he didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t have one of the cool outfits, too. Harry was kicking himself because he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d never considered making true Battle Wizards uniform\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  for his friends.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well," Harry said glancing at them. "I think it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s time for Zane and I to make you a set of real Battle Wizard uniforms," Harry declared. Zane glanced over them, the only one of whom that didn\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 t have a transfigured uniform was Harry, and \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 his was also the only one that was in decent shape.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I agree," Zane said finally. "When do we start?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Tonight," Harry said with a decisive nod. "The sooner the better. Hagrid, you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll help?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sure," Hagrid said brightly. "Don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t have a flippin\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  clue \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 bout w\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 hat I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll be doin\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 , but why not?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 ll see," Harry said with a grin, and they continued down to the Great Hall for dinner. He glanced at his wand. "Cracked, great\'85\loch\f0  I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 
t feel like fixing it right this minute, so\'85\loch\f0 " With a wave of his hand, all their clo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
thes were repaired. When they entered all eyes turned on them, most holding a combination of respect, fear, and awe. Harry groaned inwardly. Without warning a streak of blonde hair tackled him to the ground.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Scare me again," Blaise said in a deadly seriou\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s tone as she sat atop his chest, "and I really will tie you up in my bedroom!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry smirked as all eyes turned to him, many of whom were male and grinning stupidly. "Blaise, are you trying to spread the rumor that you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re a scarlet woman?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Blaise looked a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 t him blankly for a moment then blushed furiously. "Umm\'85\loch\f0 
 sorry." She quickly climbed off of him and helped him up. He nodded at his friends to go on and eat. He needed to talk with Blaise.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As his friends walked to their tables, he and Blaise stepped outsid\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e the Great Hall. "You worried me," she told him in a shaky voice.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded softly. "One thing you need to understand is that my life isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t safe," he said bluntly. "You say you want to be with me, but I really don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t think you grasp that there are any n\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 umber of reasons I could end up dead at any time." Blaise\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eyes began to tear up as she heard him state this so calmly. "I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t want to worry you," he said as he rubbed his right thumb under her left eye, wiping away the tear that was about to fall, "bu\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m not going to lie to you and say that I

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 She nodded. "I know," she said shakily. "I just\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  I\'85\loch\f0  I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve never felt about }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 anyone}{\fs24\kerning0

about you, and the idea of losing you scares me so much. I wanted to see if anything more came of getting to know you, and it did," she whimpered softly as she rested her head on his shoulder, tears flowing freely from her eyes. "I\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 m not saying that I lov\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  you," she stated seriously, "I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t think I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 m ready for that\'85\loch\f0 
 yet. But, I do care about you, more than I ever believed I could."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry smiled warmly at her. "Don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t worry. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve done a pretty good job of staying alive, so far," he said. }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Until today, anywa

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "If it isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t the great Harry Potter," Malfoy drawled as Harry walked by the Slytherin table, hand i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t notice Ginny, eyes filled with tears, as she jumped up and ran from her spot at the Gryffindor table. She\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d been un\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
able to check on him in the infirmary, since Madame Pomfrey wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t let anyone in\'85\loch\f0  even the Headmaster, and was truly worried. Seeing him with Blaise, immediately after that, made her feel wretched.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry glanced over at Malfoy, missing Colin Creevey chas\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Just wanted to mention, I happened to look at my listing of people who put my \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 on their favorite authors list, today\'85\loch\f0  it was at exactly one hundred. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m thoroughly amazed that there are one hundred people who find my stories entertaining enough to read. Thank you, very much.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As for those who wished me well, thank you, also. I still d\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 on\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t feel well, but I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m to the point now that I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m just trying to ignore it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Now, on to the review issues. There seems to be a bit of confusion about the press conference. When Harry wrote \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 Tom Marvolo Riddle\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
, I saw no reason to have him say what the audie\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 nce could obviously read. He was explaining who Tom Riddle was, so that wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t a mistake. :)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Someone mentioned two stories that I just thought I should point out. The Order of the Phoenix and The Well of Shadows (not Darkness, though I can see where that m\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
istake would be made) are both by Ruskbyte. For those who haven\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t read his stories\'85\loch\f0  if you like mine then I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m fairly sure you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d love his. He is an excellent writer, in my opinion. His latest story, Divergent Paths, is absolutely hilarious.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 As for my humor\'85\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0  honestly, it comes and goes. Sometimes I find myself writing something that makes me cackle madly. For example the Malfoy flamb\'e9\loch\f0 \hich\f0  scene\'85
\loch\f0  I was laughing like mad when I wrote that. I really don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t remember any scenes like that in this one as it is more of a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 advancement chapter. There is a bit of action (not much) and a prank, but it wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t a very good one (mainly revenge).
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 My language\'85\loch\f0  what can I say. I know a few Brits, and I picked up a bit of the language. Not to mention I use a good bit of the slang in m\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
y every day speech (and have for years, long before I read Harry Potter). As for American speech, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m a bit of a language prude. Certain phrases just really annoy me to no end, like \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 ohmigawd\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 , for example.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The battle scene. What can I say. It may have see\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 med anime like, but that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s probably because that is how I was picturing it as I wrote it. ;) I spent a good bit of time trying to perfect that scene. I still didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t get it }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 quite}{\i\fs24\kerning0 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  where I wanted, but it was close enough. :)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As for Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s reliance on physica\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 l combat, that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s a combination of factors. First, he already knew that the Daemons were rather protected against magic. He didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know they were as tough as they were, but he did know that magic wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t be as useful as physical battle. There is also all \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
he minds floating around in his head. A lot of them are from a time when physical combat was a primary form of battle. Finally, there was the issue of the Black Flame, which was developed specifically to fight the Daemons. Hope that explains it. :)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Now, I \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 need to address the issue of Ginny \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 is a flaming slut\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 . This is far from accurate. This hasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t been addressed in the story, though I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll probably touch on it eventually. Ginny heard Harry and Ron talking, and decided to tease them both. Ron because, as we\hich\f0 \rquote \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 v
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e seen, Ginny is an independent woman. Ron tries to treat her like a baby, so she was reminding him that she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s old enough to make her own decisions. Harry\'85\loch\f0 
 well, she just likes teasing Harry. She isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t out shagging the whole Quidditch team, nor has anythi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 g happened between her and Harry, so you have no worries there.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 On the subject of Ginny and Colin\'85\loch\f0  give her to Zane? That\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s bloody sick! He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s about five years old, and she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s nearly sixteen! That
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s just nasty. Really. :P
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Now, I know some of you are going to\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  read this chapter and be upset at the ending. GOOD! That was the intention! I will, however, give you a hint. The triangle is }{\fs24\kerning0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Thanks again for your reviews. I wonder what the guesses about who \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 A Friend\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  is a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 re going to be like after this chapter. Oh well. :)

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Welcome to Muggle Studies," Preston Granger stated calmly, though both he and his wife were far beyond excited about the idea of teaching in the magica\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
l world. "My name is Preston, and this is my wife Jill. To make things easier, you can simply address us by our first names. We are here today to teach you about our lives. We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re muggles."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll figure something out," his wife continued as she lay restlessly on their bed. "I hope."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry," Hagrid rumbled worriedly, "won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  this hurt yeh a right\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  bit?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded, the grin on his face never leaving. "That\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s why you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re going to collect the scales while Zane keeps the pain relieving charms in place."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Nodding, Zane added, "Don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t worry, dad, we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll be fine. Uncle Harry would never hurt us."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Slowly Ha\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
rry shifted into the huge dragon he had turned into during the battle with the Daemon hordes. He let off a relaxed roar in the night air, resounding like thunder over the grounds. Slowly he laid his head down on the ground where Hagrid climbed up, hefting
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 his adopted son up with him. Harry felt the soothing warmth of the pain relief charm hit his back, where the toughest scales resided.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As a bit of warning, Hagrid patted his trashcan lid sized hands on the scales softly, then began to wrench them loose. Alm\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ost immediately Zane began casting healing charms on the section of exposed hide, so that the scales grew back seconds later. Once again, Hagrid wrenched them loose. This continued for what seemed like hours, to Harry, but was really only about fifteen mi
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 utes.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 With four of Hagrid\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s large pails full of scales Harry, Zane, and Hagrid made their way back to his hut. Harry rubbed his back tenderly. Being rather strong had its benefits, but pain still wasn
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t a picnic to deal with.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You guys can handle making th\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e gloves and boots?" Harry asked, wincing as he sat down on the steps to Hagrid\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s hut. Zane nodded as Hagrid smiled, mumbling for Harry to take care of himself. "Ok, then I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m going to head up to the castle. I really could use some sleep. We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll start the c\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 h

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Zane and Hagrid nodded. Hagrid, at first, hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t seen the need in having a Battle Wizard\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s uniform. He wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t even considered a wizard, really. O
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 nce Harry had explained what they did, though, he relented and agreed to wear one as well. "Righ\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  then."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry stumbled his way up to the castle, holding his sore back. Without warning, Hedwig swooped down on him, a letter tied to her leg. "Hello, Hedwig,"\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 Harry said softly as she perched atop his shoulder and nipped his ear softly. "How did you get a letter?" She looked at him as if it was the stupidest question he could ever have asked. "Right, someone gave you one," Harry muttered as he took the parcel 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 rom her leg. Hedwig nuzzled his neck then soared away towards the owlery.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hello, Harry," Jillianka said as she and Preston jaunted happily towards him. At Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s rather confused look, she elaborated. "You said you wanted to meet us tonight. It was tonigh
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t, right?" she asked a bit of worry seeping into her voice at the possibility of having made a mistake.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Oh, right," Harry muttered as he rubbed his tired eyes. "Ok, well, first I need to wake up\'85\loch\f0  I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll be right back." Before the Grangers could question whe\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
re he was going a pair of enormous, angelic wings sprouted from Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s back. The powerful wings beat in a test and then he lifted into the air. Preston and Jillianka watched in awe as Harry rose higher and higher.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Amazing," Preston mumbled as he watched \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 the spectacle in wide-eyed wonder.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "That doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t quite describe this," Jillianka mumbled back. "Not at all."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 A few hundred feet above the ground, Harry pointed himself at the ground. He was reveling in the feeling of the cool night air. The wind whipping t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
hrough his hair and in his eyes. He snapped his wings to his back and plummeted toward the ground like a rocket.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 In the back of his mind he noticed Jillianka gasp as his body raced toward the ground, but he really couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t bring himself to think about it w\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ith the exhilaration of flying pounding through him. Preston couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t tear his eyes away from the sight, like watching a train wreck. Just as he thought Harry would be unable to pull out of the dive Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s enormous wings flared out with an audible boom.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 J\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 illianka, who had her face pressed into Preston\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s shoulder, simply cringed as she heard a loud thump on the ground. "Love," Preston said soothingly, "he\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 s fine." Jillianka glanced up to her husband\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eyes, which were locked onto something behind her.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hopef\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ully, slowly, she turned around, still afraid of what she might find. When she saw Harry, she simply grabbed him into a tight hug. It really didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t matter to her that she hardly knew him; the fact that he was fine and she was almost sure he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d be splattere\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  on the ground overwhelmed her senses.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Love," Preston said, still in that soothing tone as he tried to pry her arms off of Harry. "Love!" he said more forcefully, when she began to fight him. "He still needs to breathe!" Sheepishly she glanced at Harry wh
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 o had literally begun to turn blue in the face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sorry, Harry," she muttered, her face tinged pink in embarrassment that not only had she nearly choked him, but also because she hardly knew him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Not a problem, Mrs. Granger," Harry said in slight amusement\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  as he unconsciously rubbed the back of his neck. "I just needed to wake up, and flying always does that for me. I\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 m sorry that I scared you."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "That was absolutely amazing," Preston said as he nodded his head approvingly, effectively ending any discussion \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 about the danger of it. Noticing Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s embarrassment, he decided to change the subject, again. "So, what did you need to see us about?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Right," Harry said, his mind now clear and ready to work. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small hourglass\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
. "This is a time turner. It will allow us to get the basics out of the way tonight. It will only last for approximately ten turns. That gives us about ten hours. Eleven or twelve if we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re lucky. Nine if we\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 re not."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "For what, Harry?" Jillianka asked when \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 she noticed he didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t exactly answer the question.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, Mrs. Granger," Harry began, but was immediately interrupted by Jillianka telling him to call her \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 Jill\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
. Nodding, Preston asked to be called by his first name, as well. "Ok, Jill, Preston," he said \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 simply, "I have brought you here to teach you the basics of magic."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Unable to hold it back, a smile crept onto his face as the look of joy appeared on the two adults\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  faces. "I can only teach you the basics of magic. I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t really have the time to do more\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 . I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m just hoping that Hermione inherited her learning skills from the both of you.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "If everything works properly, and I hope that it does, you will be able to do the most basic of magic by the time your first class comes around tomorrow morning. That is, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 if you }{\i\fs24\kerning0 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 want}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 to." At their rather frantic affirmative nods, he continued, "Right then. You will, with Hagrid, be having private lessons with the other professors in the required fields of magic. By the end of the year, I hope you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ll be ready to take your O.\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 W.L.s. Though, if you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re anything like Hermione, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sure you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll both be taking your N.E.W.T.s by then."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "When do we start?" Jill asked excitedly. "Right now?" Laughing, Harry nodded. "GOOD!" she shouted, and grabbed Harry and Preston by the hand and comme\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
nced to dragging them towards the castle. It was about that time that she realized she had no idea where she was going. Preston couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t help but smile. He was thoroughly interested in magic, as well, but his wife simply exuded enthusiasm.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll be studyi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ng in the Room of Requirement," Harry said as he directed for them to follow him. "I already have several types of wood in there, with which I will wright your wands." At this pronouncement there was a giddy giggle from Jill, causing Preston to smile fond
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 y at her.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
Upon arriving in the room, Harry nodded for them to have a seat. "You will both need to drink this," he said holding up a thick, black potion that was glowing a faint blue color. "It will allow you to feel your magical core," he added at the ques
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 tioning looks on their faces. "Muggles have a magical core, as all things do. It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s like a muscle, I suppose you could say. For non-muggles it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s like the heart, always working. For muggles it is more like an arm or leg. You have to control it, instead of j\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 st using it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m afraid this will taste quite terrible, but it is a necessary evil. Once you can feel your core, it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s just a matter of getting you used to pulling on it. Eventually you should be able to use it almost like any other witch or wizard."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Prest\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
on reached out and took one of the vials. With a wink at his wife he tipped back the flask, letting the black goo slide down his throat. "Bloody hell," he shouted, "I think raw sewage would taste better!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He gasped as he felt a tingling sensation explode t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 hrough his body. Slowly the tingle began to race towards his chest. A moment later he was glowing the same faint blue that the potion had been. "It
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s warm," he muttered, his eyes wide and glazed. "The potion is a ruddy nightmare, but it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s worth it just fo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  this feeling."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Noticing her husband\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s exultant expression, Jill reached up and grabbed the second vile. With a last hesitant gulp, she swallowed down the contents. She let out a string of curses that truly surprised Harry. Even Ron would have been both pr\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
oud and awed at her ability. She finished it all up with a violent shudder that quickly turned into a smile as she felt the same sensation as her husband.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Now," Harry said with a slight grimace, "we teach you to do that on your own."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ginny," Colin \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 said softly as he knocked on the door to the closet she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d locked herself into. "You have to come out sometime."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t," she yelled through the door. "Just leave me alone!" Inside, she was hunched into a ball. Her chin rested on her knees as she wonde\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No," Colin stated back sternly, something truly out of character for the Harry-obsessed and rather excitable young man. "I will not leave you here, like this. It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Really?! It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s obvious?!" she scathingly retorted. Then in a softened tone, "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sorry, Colin. I just want to be alone right now." Her mi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
nd was a torrent as she thought back over the time she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d spent with Harry, particularly over the last year and a half. Her heart wrenched in her chest, her thoughts on the first time she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d met the Boy-Who-Lived.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 That first day he was so nervous about how t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 o get onto the platform that he probably didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t even remember her wishing him luck. She had noticed him, even when everyone else had just passed him by without a second glance. She didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know why, but her eyes were drawn to him, while everyone else simpl
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  overlooked him. Even her family hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t noticed him until he spoke up, but she had.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He was so polite and almost obscenely cute, in an odd sort of way. She didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t know who he was, of course, but when she found out she just }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 knew}{
\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  that fate had played a part i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n it. She hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t even planned to go to the platform the day her brothers left. She was supposed to spend the day with a friend of her mother, but the woman had gotten sick the night before.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Too bad," Colin said simply. "If you don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t come out, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m coming i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
n." Colin was a bit affronted at the almost mocking laughter that his statement caused. "Fine. }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Alohomora!}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
" The laughter died abruptly as the lock on the door clicked. Colin opened the door to find a rather surprised, somewhat tear-streaked Ginny Weasley.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 A\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
s the light burst into the room, images flashed through her mind. Her first year passed in a blur of pain and sadness, worry and stress. She really hated even thinking about her first year. There was simply too much pain involved.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Her second year wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t mu\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ch better. When Ron had dismissed her on the train during his third year, as if she weren\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t important, it had hurt
\'85\loch\f0  quite a bit really. But, then Harry had apologized to her later, for that. It was quick, and he probably really hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t thought much about i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
, but to her it was important. He never explained what happened, but he was so sincere that she couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t stay mad at him for it, though she had made Ron pay during the following summer. She\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d gotten her hands on some of her brother\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s creations and used th\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 m mercilessly on Ron. He always blamed the twins, never guessing that she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d been the one doing it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ginny, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sorry, but you need to quit worrying about Harry. Just put him out of your mind, for a while," Colin stated strongly. "I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t think his mind is 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 in the place you want it to be, right now."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I wish I could," she muttered as she wiped her eyes with her index finger. The day they shared their first kiss popped into her mind, followed quickly by the events around the Dragon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Tear. When she
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d thought h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e was dead it felt like she had no reason to continue. Ever since that first day on the platform, her infatuation with }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry Potter}{
\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  had passed. The little black-haired boy who\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d been so sweet and polite, who\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 d captured her attention so completely\'85\loch\f0  that was
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  who she fell in love with. She\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d tried to forget him, but it simply hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t worked.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Finally, the lithe redhead hopped to her feet. Ginny\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s mind was still racing with images of Harry, but the ones in mind now all involved the various times she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d seen Harry 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 with Blaise. Her blood was beginning to boil. The anger mixed with both sadness and a sort of hopelessness, and Ginny really didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t know what she felt, aside from a small amount of gratitude for the young man who\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d attempted to snap her out of her dark th\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ughts.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m going to go for a walk. Thank you, Colin." She wrapped her arms around his neck in a friendly hug and gave him a quick peck on the cheek, then bounded down the hall, her thoughts once again on the young, raven-haired man she couldn\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 t help but t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 hink about. She didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t hear the gasp that escaped from Colin\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s lips as hers touched his face. She also didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t notice the saucers that had replaced Colin\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eyes, the red flush that had invaded his face, or the way he lightly touched the spot where she\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d ki\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
sed him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry Potter is a bloody idiot!" Colin muttered to himself as he watched Ginny bounce around the corner at the end of the hall in her rush to get outside into the night air.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Standing in the center of his forest sanctuary Voldemort\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s blood r\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ed eyes darted about, looking for any signs of invaders. His face was otherwise hidden behind the hood of his cloak. }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I will not fail, not while that infernal }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
child}{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  still lives,"}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  he thought, his anger overwhelming him. Suddenly one of Gamesh\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Daemon horde\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 darted out of the woods toward him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Time seemed to stop as his mind rushed through the events that led up to his current predicament. Gamesh had given him the body of his wife\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s son, for his ritual. He rushed through the preparations, wanting to complete \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 the ritual as quickly as possible. Most of the preparations had been made weeks in advance, so all that was really left was the blood rituals.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 His Death Eaters extracted the half-Daemon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s blood, the golden life force that coursed through his veins. It took\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 far too long. Once the blood was out and heated to body temperature, the Dark Lord slit his hand over the cauldron, allowing his own blood to mix with it. Muttering the incantations to fuse the blood properly, he shoved his cut hand into the blood allowi
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 g it to seep into his veins. Finally, he had the immortality he had so long wanted. He would no longer need to worry about death through old age, though it was only part of what he really wanted.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Suddenly time crashed back on him like a run away freight tr\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ain. "DIE!" Voldemort snarled as he began hurling curses at the animalistic creature bounding towards him from the forest. The familiar green light of the Killing curse bounced away as if it were nothing more than harmless light. "Damn!" he growled as, as
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 time once again slowed to a stop and his mind fell back on the ritual.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Once he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d absorbed enough of the blood into his own system, he removed his hand from the reddish-golden mixture. His pale white hand was healed, though still covered in the thick, slimy
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  substance. "Pour it on me," he snapped at Lucius Malfoy, who was standing as far from Gamesh as possible.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The Death Eater reluctantly stepped forward and hefted the cauldron, along with Goyle, and poured it over Voldemort\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s naked frame. The slimy mix of b\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
lood clung to his body like a cloak, then suddenly slid away. Throughout all of this, Gamesh seemed intrigued, but said nothing. "Where is the corpse?" Voldemort asked Pettigrew, who was quivering nearby, as usual.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I disposed of it, Master," he said quiet\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ly. "King Gamesh told me to get rid of it."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 A look of combined anger and irritation settled onto Voldemort\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face. He looked at Gamesh with visible irritation, clearly wanting to know }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 why}{
\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 . "Don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t worry, you won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t need it," Gamesh said with a laugh, then st\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ated quite calmly to his subjects, "kill them all, except for the Rat."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The result of that one statement was that all of Voldemort\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Death Eaters quickly disapparated, aside from Pettigrew who was captured immediately. Presumably so that they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d have a huma\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n to use to open the portal to the Daemon Realm.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Voldemort did the only thing he could do at the time. With no Death Eaters to back him up and an army of Daemons to face he also disapparated, to another of his forest sanctuaries.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Again, time crashed into h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
im. With a roar of anger Voldemort threw off his cloak. His anger swelled and his inhuman eyes began to glow with power. The Daemon was still coming, and it would pay for its impudence.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Lion-like paws thundered across the ground unerringly toward him. Vold\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
emort put away his wand. If ever there was a time to hope his ritual had worked, this was that time. A triumphant grin spread across the Daemon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face, thinking that Voldemort had given up.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Voldemort unconsciously swallowed loudly. }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 If}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  he was going to die, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 he would }{\i\fs24\kerning0

\loch\f0  lead and run, again. }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Too late now,"}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  he thought gravely. Moving as fast as he could he dropped into a crouch a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
nd brought his fist up hard and fast.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As his fist whistled through the air like a missile towards its target, he hoped with all his being that the ritual had worked, even though the Rat\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s incompetence and the Daemon\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 s plotting had halted the final phase. V\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 oldemort felt his fist make contact with the thick and furry hide of the Daemon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s jaw. It was then that he realized he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d closed his eyes, and they snapped open. He was utterly unprepared for the sight that met his slitted eyes.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The Daemon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s head was torn c\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ompletely off its huge shoulders, that hideous look of triumph still firmly in place. Its body was already falling to the ground even as its decapitated head continued to rise. Golden blood misted in the air like a cloud, shining brightly in the moonlight
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  Before the Daemon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s body could land Voldemort rammed his hand into its chest and pulled out its black heart. "You won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t be needing this any longer," he spat coldly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 With a resigned sigh, he bit into the black heart as it continued to drip golden blood, A \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
smile spread on his face at the somewhat tangy taste that flooded his mouth. "Tastes like an apple, a particularly juicy one," he muttered. Slowly his body began to glow faintly red, and his eyes slammed shut. Pain ripped through his body as a pair of bla
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
k, leathery wings burst forth from his back, golden veins flowing through them. The wings wrapped around him like a cloak as his skin slowly darkened to a more natural complexion, though still rather pale.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 A scream of agony escaped his lips as he fell to t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
he ground clutching his chest. His long, pointed fingers grew thicker as the fingernails vanished and formed into razor-like points. He clutched at the dirt, wishing for the pain to end. Slowly, white hair sprouted from his bald head, feeling like fire bu
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ning through his skull. "AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!" he roared into the night as points of solid bone erupted from the front of his head, growing slowly into curved points.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 His agonizing screams continued far into the night as his body continued to change, mergin\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
g its formerly snake-like appearance with that of the Daemons. There were loud pops and cracks throughout the night as the bones in his legs broke and realigned themselves into the animalistic haunches that the Daemon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s walked on.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 A piece of the ritual\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 xplanation exploded through his mind, and he repeated it aloud, trying to take his mind off the pain through speech. "\hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 
He who bathes in the demon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s blood shall bathe in their strength. He who shares the demon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s blood will share their eternal life. He who \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .oOo.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry stumbled from the Room of Requirement in a tired stupor. He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 d spent eleven hours just teaching the Grangers how to do what every other non-muggle could do naturally\'85\loch\f0 
 to touch their magic. It was a long, slow, and somewhat t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 edious process. Thankfully, or maybe not thankfully when Harry really thought about it, the time turner had one extra turn in it. He was exhausted.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Eleven hours into their lessons the Grangers were still on shaky ground, though they were able to touch thei\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
r magic with a small amount of success. Jill was able to grab her power core almost immediately, but she had a bad tendency to let it slip away in her excitement. Preston was good at holding onto it, but it took him too long to grasp it for it to really b
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  useful in a pinch.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
So, eleven hours in and the main reason he was teaching them turned out to be a bit of a flop. Everyone else, he knew from the memories floating in his head, was able to grasp the concept successfully within eight hours. The longest was
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  ten. At eleven hours they just hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t quite made it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He wanted them to be able to protect themselves, if they had to. But, if you get jumpy and let your power slip away when you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re in the middle of a spell, it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s useless. If you can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t grasp it quick enough\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 to do anything then that is also quite useless. About nine hours in he decided to spend the last hour wrighting their wands. If not for the extra turn in the time turner neither of them would have a wand.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 It seemed like forever as he tried to find the pro\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 per cores for Preston and Jill. They spent nearly an hour going through magical animals, creatures, etc. He stumbled on Preston\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 s by accident, really, since the man had been mumbling about the creature that would produce it since the subject of magical cr\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
atures came up. As the end of the hour passed Harry noticed that the time turner didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t vanish, as expected.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 So, early into the eleventh hour, Preston had been mumbling about a creature from folklore called a Barghest, when Harry finally decided to ask him\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 what it was. When he described it, Harry nearly fell out of his chair in surprise. He had described a Grim, in almost perfect detail. Harry, to make sure they were talking about the same thing, shifted himself into one.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 It was then that he felt the explos\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ive pulse from Preston\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s magical core that they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d been trying to find for nearly forty-five minutes, though it was far stronger than he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d expected. Harry still wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t quite sure if that was significant in any way. He promptly pulled out one of the longer \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 airs from his tail to use as the core of the older man\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s wand.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As far as Harry knew Preston would be the only person in history to ever have the tail hair of a Grim as a wand core. Then again, he was also probably one of the only people to ever have seen a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 Grim without being scared witless by the sight. With Preston\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s wand core in hand, Harry turned to finding Jill\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s wand core.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 She, however, was another matter entirely. After Harry had gone through every magical creature he knew of, he gave up and summoned \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
a book from the library. Slowly he shifted into every creature in the book, hoping to feel the necessary pulse. Sighing loudly as he continued through the book, he shifted into a Thunderbird. His hopes were rapidly deflating, until he felt a faint pulse. 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t nearly strong enough, but it was the first lead they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d had, and it reinvigorated him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Flipping back through the book for anything related to a Thunderbird, he found another creature in a section marked extinct, and he shifted into it. He felt a th\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 underous pulse, much like Preston
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s, as Jill gasped at him. Slowly a large smile settled on her face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He was standing nearly forty feet above her. He tried to control the creature\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s urges, but they were just too great. His beak spread and thunder rolled fo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
rth from his throat as lightning danced in his eyes. He spread his enormous wings in the ever-expanding room, and arcs of energy literally danced around them. Suddenly one of his smaller crown feathers fell from his head and floated to the ground. He quic
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 k\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ly shifted back into his human form, very much afraid he couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t control that creature any longer.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 So, Jill and Preston had their wand cores. The tail hair of a Grim and the crown feather of a Raicho\'85\loch\f0  the Japanese Thunderbird, extinct since the late fifte\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
enth century. Finding the proper wood for the wand was a lot simpler. He had already collected samples the day before, so all he had to do was see which wood would react with their magical core }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 and}{
\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  their wand core.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ten minutes later Jill had come upon Mats\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
u, or Japanese Pine, which was rather fitting considering that the Raicho made its home in that type of tree. It had a nice reddish-golden grain to it. Preston happened upon a golden colored cypress that seemed almost to call him to it. So, twenty minutes
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 later Harry was making their wands.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 They had about ten minutes left to practice with their newly created wands. They weren\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t quite ready to try casting spells, though. So, Harry simply let the wands adjust to his temporary students. As Jill grasped her wan\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
d for the first time, lightning danced over her body, before it slowly faded. When Preston grasped his, though, all that happened was he was surrounded by a faint black glow.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I have finally completed the repai\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 rs to The Burrow, as per your specifications. The requested portals are in place, as well as the hidden tunnels.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The wards you requested are also in place and fortified. There are two anti-apparation wards, one around the house and the other around the sur\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
rounding area. This includes the paddock, which I also added a concealing charm to, to hide it from the muggles.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The anti-portkey wards are also in place, surrounding the same areas as the anti-apparation wards. Anyone attempting to portkey in will be rebo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 unded to their origination point.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I have looked into what you requested about anti-Animagus and anti-Polyjuice wards, but I could find no workable solutions. Much like those you mentioned, the wards I found would kill anyone using those particular forms of
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  magic. I will, however, continue to search.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Only one fireplace is connected to the floo network, as per your request, and it is behind an identification shield. The other fireplaces can be used for travel within the house and to Potter Place, but nowhere 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 else. With the Headmaster\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s permission, I can link them to his office, as well.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The wards can be set to allow accepted parties through, for instance the Weasley family, of course. I have also added identical wards at Potter Place, keyed to the necessary pa\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
rties. I am quite sure you will know of whom I speak.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The house is entirely customizable, also, using a similar design to the twins\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  room at Potter Place. The majority of the house will only accept design changes from Arthur and Molly, but the bedrooms are
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  up to their respective owners. I know this was not requested, however I did not wish to pick a pattern that the family would not like. I hope that this is acceptable.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I have yet to disclose this information to the Weasleys, as I was sure that you would wi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
sh to give them this information personally. Please let me know how you wish to proceed, as I will need to be there to open the wards the first time.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 I hope everything is well with you. Please give my best to Albus, Ronald, Virginia, Fred and George, and H\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ermione.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As she thought about \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry, an image of his face in her mind, her thoughts quickly turned morbid. The idea of him being dead plagued her mind, and she couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Taking a seat, the vampiric-looking Potions Master sighed as he responded. "No, not since the dragon\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Preston climbed out of bed thoroughly exhausted, but feeling exceptionally well. The previous night\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s activities had been mentally and physically tiring in the extreme, but gratifying as well. He would be able to surprise his daughter with\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 the fact that he could now use magic. Not very well, and it took him quite a while to grab his power enough to use it, but he could still use magic. He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
He was excited beyond belief. He picked up his new wand, examining it quietly while his wife continued to sleep quite happily in their new bed. The golden colored wood was beautiful, he felt, as he gripped it. The wand was tailored speci
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 fically for him and just felt so right in his hands. As he gripped it that black glow surrounded him again. Deep in his core he felt a faint pulse.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He considered, momentarily, the idea of trying to go back to sleep, but he knew he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d never wake up in time i\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
f he did. Sighing, he grabbed the book Harry had given them of rudimentary spells. }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The Beginners Guide to Charms Even a Child Could Weave by Miranda Goshawk}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Gripping his wand, he flipped through to the first page. Illusory Butterflies. Preston began reach\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ing for his power ahead of time. After about five minutes he had firmly grabbed hold of it. Watching the motion of the wand movement on the page, a sight that he thought he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d never get used to, he decided to give it a try.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Mocking the wand movement several\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 times until he had a firm grasp on the intricacy of the movements, which were almost unbelievably simple, he said the incantation. He had, as the book instructed, the butterflies firmly pictured in his mind. "}{\i\fs24\kerning0 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Illusio Butterfly!}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 " There was a faint humming \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 noise, then nothing.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Sighing, Preston closed the book with a thump. The sudden noise startled his wife out of her deep sleep. Bleary eyed, she raised up and began to mumble something. Preston was about to apologize, when he noticed his wife
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s wide eyes.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "W\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 hat?" he asked a bit worried. "What\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s wrong, love?" he asked as he crossed over to her\'85\loch\f0  he didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "They\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re beautiful, she gasped," as she looked around in wonder. "Where did th\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ey come from?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Preston glanced around their room, and didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t notice anything that hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t been there the previous day. "Where did what come from?" he asked quickly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "The butterflies! So many butterflies! I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve never seen anything like them," she trailed off \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
as she lifted her hand and smiled at it, as if she were looking at something. After a few minutes, Preston heard that same humming noise.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 His wife\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s smile faded a bit, but he was too busy to notice. He was reading the information on the spell. When he fini\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 shed reading it he had a smile twice as big as his wife
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s was. "It worked!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "What worked?" she asked curiously, a frown on her face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I cast a spell!" he shouted exultantly, a smile on his delighted face. "I thought I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d failed, but when I read the descript\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ion of how the spell worked\'85\loch\f0 
 I did it!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Jillianka Granger was used to her husband\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s peculiar study habits. He tended to glance at the instructions, not really caring how it worked so long as it worked. At university, he\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 d been terrible in chemistry, having\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  blown up many labs in his day. When she thought about the classes they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d have to take, she was quite horrified at the idea of him trying to make potions.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Dear," she said patiently, "would you like to explain }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 what}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  worked, or would you like for me to remai\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 It was the same smile he used whenever he felt embarrassed, which was a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  rare thing for him. He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d been a well-known football player at university. If not for his accident during their last year, he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d likely have gone on to the World Cup afterwards.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well?" she prompted, and he grinned again like an excited child.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Right. I was\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  reading the book Harry gave us, and decided to give it a try. I found a spell that said something about creating illusory butterflies, so I gave it a try. I thought it didn\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t work, but when you woke up and saw butterflies\'85\loch\f0  well. Anyway, this explains it \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 etter," he said as he handed the book to her.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Smirking at him once more, she turned her attention to the book in hand.
\par }{\b\i\fs24\ul\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Illusory Butterflies
\par }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 One of the simplest spells for a beginner is attempting to do nothing. The motion (Figure A) is quite simple as you \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
can see. The most complex component of this charm is picturing the object to create. The example used is only a suggestion.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 In truth, this is one of the simplest, and most versatile, charms around and is great for entertaining small children. The illusions\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
, while not real, do interact with their environment quite realistically when possible.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The charm has one main flaw. The creator of the illusion can not see it, and so can not interact with it without proper planning. The only way to know that it has worke\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
d is that there is a brief humming after the charm is set into place, and another when it ends.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The time limit on this spell, if not set, is approximately five minutes. Depending on the power behind it, it can last for as long as an hour if the creating pa\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 rty wishes.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 For instructions, see the caption under Figure A.
\par }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Jill blinked at the page, then at her husband. "So you created those magnificent looking creatures?" When he nodded, she broke into a wide grin. "They truly were beautiful," she said, smiling. H
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e once again gave her that smile that marked his embarrassment. "Would you try again?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He grinned and picked up his wand. After a few minutes of trying, he once again grabbed his power. "What do you want to see?" he asked with a smile. His wife\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s response \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
left him speechless. Sighing, he glanced at the book again to make sure he remembered the motion. Picturing the image in his mind, firmly, he muttered the charm. "}{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Illusio Raicho!}{\fs24\kerning0 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Once again, he heard that humming sound, and a smile appeared on his wife\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 face, lighting it up in that incredible way that he so loved. "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s a magnificent animal," she said a bit sadly. "It really is too bad that we hunted them into extinction."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You know," Preston said with a bit of a smirk on his face, "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve heard that this H\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
agrid tends to like animals most people would consider dangerous, as well. You two would probably get along brilliantly."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re right," she said smiling. "Maybe I should see if he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s interested," she said mockingly at her husband. "He probably wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t te
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ase me so."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Maybe," Preston said as he crawled onto the bed with his wife, pushing her back and kissing her softly, "but I doubt he could smile at you the way I do."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No, probably not," she mumbled in agreement as she pulled him against her. Half an hour \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
later the Grangers were cuddled happily under the covers, thoroughly naked, and completely content. Against his better judgment, mainly at his wife\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s urging, they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d fallen once more into a deep sleep, again exhausted.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Preston sighed in frustration as he on\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ce again woke, but it quickly faded as his wife\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s naked form pressed against him. As he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d expected, they
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d overslept. Breakfast would wait until after their first class, it seemed. Kissing his wife lightly on the neck, she woke with a happy yawn. "Love," \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
e said a bit sadly, "we need to get up. We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re already running late."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Those last two words, as always, had the desired effect. A moment later his wife had wrenched herself free of his arms and was frantically bounding around the room grabbing clothes. A mom\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ent later she was in their private bathroom, without even a \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 good morning\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  to him. He couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t help but laugh. In the seventeen years they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d been married, she hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t changed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 While he waited on his wife to come out of the shower, he laid out his clothes. S\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 he wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t have objected to him joining her, he knew, but he also knew that they\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 d probably miss the first half-hour of their class, as well. Sighing, he glanced back and flipped through the book, looking for some more interesting charms to try.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 An hour l\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ater, they entered their classroom, which was full of third years. The class was deathly silent as the first two muggle teachers in Hogwarts history entered their classroom. As Preston sat down on top of his desk, Jill beside him, he smiled at the class. 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 T\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 he class remained deathly silent.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Problem?" Jill asked, still smiling.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re muggles, right?" asked a Hufflepuff boy.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Preston nodded. "Yes. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m Preston, and this is my wife Jill," he said while indicating the thin brunette by his side. A bit of chatter \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
broke out among the students at this new piece of information.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 There was silence again, then a snide laugh. "What makes you think you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re good enough to teach us?" a tiny Slytherin girl asked in a derisive tone. What a Slytherin was doing in muggle studies,
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  they could only guess. They\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d been told about the houses, by their daughter. She\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d made it rather clear that Slytherins tended to dislike muggles in general.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Why wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t we be good enough to teach you," Jill replied hotly. "We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re muggles, who better to \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 teach you about muggles than }{\i\fs24\kerning0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "That\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 ll be ten points from Slytherin, Miss \'85\loch\f0  ?" Preston inquired, his smile never leaving.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Malfoy. Layna Malfoy," the girl\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  replied with a smirk. "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d best show respect to your betters."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll keep that in mind for when I see them," Jill muttered irritably.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Preston, however, ignored the comment, and continued to smile happily. "So, you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re all witches and wizards," he said, h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
is smile growing wider. "So are we." There were a few confused looks around the room, but mostly a bit of laughter at what the students thought was a joke. "You don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t believe me?" he asked, and at the chuckles, he shook his head in a mock-saddened fashion\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 .
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He was simply thankful that he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d been practicing with trying to grasp his power all day. He still hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t made any progress, but he had it ready for a little surprise. With a flourish he pulled out his wand. "This," he said, indicating the golden colored w\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ood, "is my wand. Beautiful, isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t it?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 His smile broadened at the somewhat confused looks, and he brought the image he wanted into his mind. "}{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Illusio Grim!}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
" he muttered, the humming noise appearing instantly. The result of his spell was the shrieks of var\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ious students at what he could only imagine they were seeing. He watched as his wife reached and rubbed her hand on the air, as if petting a dog.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "As you can see, Miss Malfoy," he said with a smirk to Layna, "our being muggles is entirely inconsequential. \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 So, shall we get started?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes, I do believe we shall," Jill replied with a smile as she hopped off the desk, ignoring the still frightened children. The Grim continued to amble about the room aimlessly.

dued affair, as the Great Hall was empty aside from the both of them. "Who do you think will show up?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Not sure," Ron mumbled as he grabbed a few sausage links. "I think Ginny wants to try out for chaser. I heard a few of the lower years talking about try\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ing out, too."
\par }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "YAY! Fresh meat!"}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  Leo roared happily.
\par }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "STOP THAT!"}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  Harry thought frantically, his heart jumping excitedly. }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m stressed out enough!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Fine, fine,"}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  Leo muttered a bit irritably.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Breakfast continued in relative silence and half an hour later\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 the Gryffindor Seeker and Captain, along with the Gryffindor Keeper, walked onto the Quidditch pitch, to hear the din of an excited crowd. The whole of Gryffindor, it seemed, had turned out for the tryouts as well as most of the faculty. Neither Ron nor 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 H\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 arry had a clue as to why.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
When the clapping sounded off, they noticed everyone was looking towards the center of the pitch. Following the gazes, Harry noticed a young Gryffindor flying around the pitch, oblivious to everyone watching him. There was an exu
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ltant smile firmly planted on his face as he sped around the pitch. He looked as if nothing mattered except the broom, the sky, and the exhilaration of flying
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Wow," Ron muttered as he watched the boy stand up on his broom and leap forward into the open ai\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
r. A moment later his broom was firmly under him and he was continuing down the pitch at breakneck speeds.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry grinned. "I can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t believe he knows someone who can perform that charm," he said with a smile.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Charm?" Ron asked a bit curiously.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s a bondi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ng charm," Harry said simply. "When Quidditch was first invented, Simon Magus invented a charm to link a person to their broom. It allows the person to push a broom to its absolute limit, because the broom literally becomes an extension of their person. I
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  resulted in a lot of stunts that can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t be done, any longer."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Like?" Ron asked, his eyes never leaving the boy. His long blonde hair was whipping wildly as he soared higher and higher. A moment later he leaped off his broom into a full free fall. A gasp, \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
as well as a few shrieks, traveled through the crowd.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Like that," Harry said simply as the broom cut through the air like a rocket slipping right under the boy, just barely saving him from splattering on the ground. Excited cheers sped through the crowd. 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "The Leap of Faith, invented by none other than Simon Magus himself. The bonding charm is also how the Wronski Feint was invented\'85\loch\f0 
 though Wronski was the first to do it without the bonding charm. I believe it was called Planter Ploy before that.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Shall we?\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 " Harry asked as he walked forward, leaving behind a rather stunned Weasley. "}{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Sonorus!}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 Welcome," Harry boomed, "to the Gryffindor Quidditch tryouts! If you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re here to try out, please stick around. Otherwise, it would be most appreciated if you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d leave." Wh\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
en no one moved, he added, "Now." Minutes later only those trying out for the Quidditch team were still near the pitch.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The boy that had been speeding around the pitch landed, hopping off his broom about three feet off the ground while still speeding forwa\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
rd. His broom came to a floating stop beside him, and he sighed happily. As if noticing everyone for the first time, he glanced around then smiled. "Hullo," he said in an American accent. "What\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s up?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Where\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d you learn to fly like that?!" one of the hopef\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 uls blurted out.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The boy glanced around again, then shrugged. "My dad taught me to fly, if that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s what you mean."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry cleared his throat. "First off, I want to thank you all for showing up. I know it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s early. Please put your name on the parchment along w\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ith the position you\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 re trying out for," he said, indicating a piece of parchment on a table off to the side of the pitch.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The group of hopefuls filed over, signing their name to the parchment. Once everyone had signed, he stood before the assembled group.\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 He was surprised to note that, among the bunch, was Neville Longbottom. A few minutes later the Weasley twins stormed onto the field, followed shortly by Katie Bell.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Sorry we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re late," they gasped in unison. "There was an explosion, and we were cleaning \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
up the mess." At the alarmed look from many on the field, they elaborated. "Experiment. Nothing major."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Not a problem," Harry said, laughing. "Well, let me start by saying that everyone on this team will work for the position they want."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Here here," chee\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 red the existing members of the team, big grins on their faces. The grins faded abruptly when Harry noted that }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 they}{\fs24\kerning0 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  had to work for their positions also.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "No one is safe in their position. If you want it, show me you want it. You want to be a keeper then m\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ake the chasers dread coming near you. You want to be a chaser, make the keeper groan every time they see you coming. You want to be a beater, then make the opposing team }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 eat}{\fs24\kerning0 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  the bludgers. If you want to be seeker, take the snitch. It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s that simple," Harry\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  said with a hunger dancing in his eyes.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "First off, I want to see you all fly." Pointing at the blonde boy, he added, "Not you. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve seen you fly."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Half an hour later several hopefuls had been dismissed due to not being able to stay on their broom. Everyo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ne but Harry was a bit shocked by the fact that Neville was not among those dismissed.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Waving his wand at the bludgers, there was a groaning sound followed by several large cracks. Finally, there was a loud pop and instead of the normal two bludgers there \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
were twelve. "During this next exercise, it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s quite simple. Stay on your broom. With a wave of his wand, the bludgers began trying to attack anything in sight.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry mounted his broom and joined the group. "The rules are simple. If you hit the ground five \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 times, you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re out! I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t care how you stay on your broom, so long as its legal!" The ensuing chaos was spectacular, to say the least.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The young blonde boy seemed to be in his element as bludger after bludger missed him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Neville, too, seemed infinitely mo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
re confident than he had just a year before. A near death experience would do that for you, Harry guessed. He was shakily dodging the bludgers, but an avoided bludger is an avoided bludger. It doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t particularly matter how good it looks so long as you g\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t the job done, Harry acknowledged.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ron was the first to be knocked from his broom by a bludger that caught him square in the chest. The next to fall was a third year girl whom Harry barely recognized.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Colin and Dennis Creevy were doing amazingly well by w\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
orking with each other. They were leading the bludgers into other hopefuls, intentionally knocking them off their brooms. After a few minutes of their tactics, a few more people had been eliminated.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Suddenly the Creevy brothers turned on him and led the bl\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
udgers in his direction. Colin had a malicious smile on his face that quite honestly surprised Harry, to no end. Harry dropped off his broom in a shaky Sloth Grip Roll as the bludger whizzed by where his head had been.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He turned his attention back to watch\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ing the others, listening intently for the whizzing sound that indicated an approaching bludger. After his first hit, Ron seemed rather weary of getting anywhere 
}{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 near}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  another of the damaging balls.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The blonde boy was avoiding the bludger by literally just \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 dropping off his broom and letting it catch him from his free fall. Taking a page out of the Creevy brother\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s book, he began to lead the bludgers into the other hopefuls, trying to eliminate the competition.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny was happily whizzing around the field, com\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 pletely oblivious to the fact that the Creevy brothers had targeted everyone }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 except}{\fs24\kerning0 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  for her. Harry noticed this fact, though, and made a wild guess as to the malicious grin given him by Colin.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The wind whipped in his hair as he dove into a corkscrew spin t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 o avoid an incoming bludger. The bludger didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t relent, though, and remained directly on his tail. Flying at the ground as fast as his broom would go, Harry pushed the broom to its limit. Just as he was about to slam into the ground, he jerked his broom b\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ck, causing it to turn and head straight up. The bludger on his tail slammed into the ground, sending dirt and grass flying into the air in a fountain-like manner.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ron, who\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d been watching him, managed to be caught by another bludger, this time in the back\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 . Ron cried out, but held onto his broom tightly, refusing to fall again. Once he
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d righted himself, he let out a stream of obscenities.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Watch yourself, Ron!" Harry shouted, grinning.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Bugger off!" Ron shouted back, also grinning.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The familiar whizzing so\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
und of the bludgers caught his attention, and he glanced back to see Dennis and Colin leading two bludgers in his direction. Colin still had that malicious grin on his face, as well as a dangerous glint in his eye. Growling inwardly, Harry pushed his broo
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  down the pitch. Cutting the acceleration he whipped his broom around so he was facing in the opposite direction that he was going, facing Colin and Dennis.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He waited a few seconds, then braced himself for the jolt he knew would come. Gripping the broom ti\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ghtly, he accelerated hard causing his broom to slam to a stop before speeding directly towards the two Creevy brothers. Like a lightning bolt he sped directly between them, leaving behind two rather confused boys.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Nice!" the blonde boy shouted as Harry s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ped by him, whipping between people as if they weren\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t there. Finally, he moved up high above the pitch and stopped, still listening for the sound of an impending bludger.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Pride swelled in him as he watched Ginny literally jump off her broom, over a bludge\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
r, then landed back on it. It seemed that all their training had paid off. He continued to watch her, to see if Dennis and Colin were going to try to hit her, as well. They never did, because they seemed to be looking for someone. Harry didn\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 t need to gue\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 s who it was they were looking for.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 He turned his attention back to the pitch, watching as Seamus and Dean worked together to try to }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 disable}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 the bludgers. They were speeding directly at each other, a bludger directly behind each of them, when they suddenly\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 twisted and headed toward the ground just before colliding. The result was that the two bludgers slammed into each other before falling heavily to the ground.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Again the familiar whizzing sound of a bludger caught his ear, and he glanced back to see Colin \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
and Dennis leading two bludgers in his direction. Sighing, he turned and waited on the bludgers. They obviously weren\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t going to be happy until they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d hit him. The brothers came to an abrupt halt as the bludgers continued directly at Harry. With a bit of \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
n irritated growl, Harry jumped off his broom kicking one of the bludgers straight back at Colin who was knocked from his broom with a highly shocked look plastered on his face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Without a pause Harry twisted quickly and slammed his foot into the other. The\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  result was a thunderous crack and an explosion of powder as the destroyed bludger rained down on those around them.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 When Harry landed on his broom, he simply watched as Colin fell. A blur of scarlet tore through the air towards Colin. A moment later he wa\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
s safely on the ground thanks to none other than Ginny Weasley.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry Potter!" she almost shrieked at him from the ground. "You could have killed him!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The bludgers slammed to a stop in the air. Harry stared down at her, his calm, cold stare very unnervin\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
g. "There is a saying that I believe is highly appropriate to this situation," Harry said coldly, his voice loud enough for all to hear. "If you can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen. People have died playing Quidditch. It is a fact of the game.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 f that fact scares you, good. It should."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry stood up on his broom a good fifty feet above the ground. With a wave to the others, he back-flipped off the handle. A moment later he landed in a crouch on the ground. "Is he alright?" Harry asked simply, a 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 hard edge in his voice.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ginny nodded. "You could have hurt him, Harry."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s lucky. My first instinct was to kill him. He was trying to cause me harm. What his problem with me is, I can only guess," he said, giving Ginny a pointed glance.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry, listen t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 o yourself!" Ginny cried loudly, a horrified expression on her face. "I find it hard to believe that Colin Creevy, the boy who }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 idolizes}
{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0  you, was trying to hurt you\'85\loch\f0  I find it ever harder to believe that you just said your impulse was to }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 kill}{\fs24\kerning0 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  him!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry wa\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ved his hand in front of her face and the malicious grin on Colin\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s face as he flew at Harry surfaced in her mind, along with the image of Dennis and Colin looking for him. "Do you believe it now?" Harry asked simply. "Throughout the tryouts they hit ever\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
one but you. Throughout the tryouts I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m the only one he seemed excited about hitting."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 As he turned to the crowd, he noticed Dennis had a scowl set on his face. "Ok, Creevys are out. It won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t do to have someone on the team who has a grudge against the capt\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ain. I need you to have faith in me, and I need to have faith in you. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m sorry to say that after this little episode, that will more than likely not be possible in the near future.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Dennis, take your brother to the infirmary, please. Everyone else who sti\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ll wishes to try out, we\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ve narrowed it down enough that we can have a practice game." Sighing, he thought to Leo, }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Did I make the right decision?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes. You need to be confident in your team, and the way those two were acting, that just seemed rather impo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ssible. Though, with Colin it seemed to be personal. Dennis just seemed to be going along with his brother."
\par }{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry sighed, and they turned to a practice game, switching players in an out until he found the best mix of players. He grinned happily as he watc\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
hed the teams worked their hardest, making the opposing team fight for every goal. Harry lazily floated over to the blonde-haired boy, who was trying out for the position of seeker.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hello," Harry said lazily.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hi," the boy replied, a suspicious look plant\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ed firmly on his face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You fly well," Harry complimented. "Mind if I asked who placed the bonding charm on your broom?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 A tight grin slipped onto the boy\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face. "My great-grandfather. It took him years to perfect it. I was the first to get it, once he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 d \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
managed to perform it without mistake."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Harry Potter," he said, holding out his hand to the boy.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Gabriel Savatus," the boy said, taking his hand. "Nice ta meetcha."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Same here. I noticed you can do the Leap of Faith. Tried the Hammer and Anvil or the Cor\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 kscrew Drop?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Hammer and Anvil? Corkscrew Drop?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry grinned. "Yeah, they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re general moves. Work great against the other team, if you can pull them off properly."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "How?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Ok, the Hammer and Anvil\'85\loch\f0  in a game, the beaters are always going to be trying to \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 hit you with a bludger\'85\loch\f0  that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

 the bludger. You have to act fast, but you can match the bludgers speed, and catch it. It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s almost impos\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
sible to pull off on a normal broom, because you usually need both hands to catch the bludger. Letting go of the handle on most brooms is a bit dangerous."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "That\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s legal?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry nodded. "It just isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t done because, as I said, you generally need both hands \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
to catch a bludger. But, once you have it you can do some real damage to the other team. Imagine catching the bludger and tossing it to your own beaters who can easily bat it into the opponents\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  keeper. Only problem is, there }{
\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 is}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  a rule in the books that sa\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
y you can only keep a bludger out of play for one minute. Any longer and the other team gets a penalty shot."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Wow. What about that Corkscrew thing?" Gabriel asked, his orange eyes sparkling at the chance for new information.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "The Corkscrew Drop?" Harry as\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ked with a grin. "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s usually a scare tactic, sort of like the Transylvanian Tackle. You get up high, dive into a corkscrew and let go of your broom, adding gravity to the mix. The spin doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Why not just knock them off their broom? That I }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 know}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  would be legal."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re sort of right. You have to be in free fall for at least five seconds before colliding with someone, if you plan to get back onto your broom. Then, if you hit someone, it\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 s legal since you were technically in a fall. But, it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s rather hard to \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
hit someone when they have enough time to move. Not only that, but a scared opponent can be even more of an advantage than no opponent."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 When Gabriel looked at him blankly, he continued. "Think about this. If you Corkscrew a chaser and knock them off their\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  broom, they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "By the way, are you going to get that?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Gabriel glanced at him questioningly. Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s response was to dart out his hand and grab the snitch. "Another good tactic is the Cha\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
tterbox. Distract your opponent with talk while your team scores enough goals to win." Harry winked at Gabriel, who had a look of awe on his face.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Landing swiftly on the ground, Harry grabbed everyone\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s attention. "Thanks for coming out," Harry said with a\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  huge smile on his face. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Leaving behind a thoroughly confused team, along with some rather apprehensive returning players, Harry walked away. "This year is going to be great!"

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The gothic style tombstones, moss covered and slimy, were a combination of muggle and non-muggle from centuries passed. Maleficus, Goyer, and Grindelwald lay peacefully by Weaslery, Longbottom, and Dumbledore, among others.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Fog lay\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ered the ground like a gray carpet, hiding from view whatever might be crawling on damp, mushy ground. The smell of rotting leaves filled the air with the scent of death, and it was moldy death at that.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 A person in a thick, black cloak wearing a white, fac\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
eless mask moved swiftly through the cemetery. He moved almost as if he were floating; an appearance greatly reinforced by the fog hiding his feet and the fact that he made no sound. The caw of a murder of crows added to the gloomy atmosphere as he contin

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Wind rustled through the gnarled trees, causing the branches to stretch and sway as if reaching out for something or someone. "Turn back," it seemed to whisper, "before it is too late." The man in the

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The sound of skittering claws echoed off the stone mausoleums, each one marked with the name of a prominent family of years gone by. Again the crows cawed loudly, warning the man away. He walked stead

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 A shuddering groan filled the air, mixing with the skittering claws and the cawing crows in a sort of perverted symphony. Still the man trudged onward through the darkness, with no l\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ight to speak of. Yet, he was unfazed by the darkness, the smells, or the sounds around him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Finally, he arrived at an unmarked mausoleum. The door was marked with a large, hideous face that would give even the Daemons nightmares. He raised his right hand,\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 covered by a thick, black glove, and tapped first the left eye, then the right, and finally the tongue. A moment later the door gave a loud groan and slowly opened inward.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re late," a voice hissed from inside.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The man shook his head, and stepped insi\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 de. "I had something to take care of," he muttered softly. "Is everything still going according to plan?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Yes," the voice hissed back. "The last letter was delivered the night before the new Minister was announced to the public, as you requested."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re already a dead man," the hissing voice mocked, a slight chuckled behind it. "Just be careful."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You, too," he said with a smile, th\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ough it was hidden behind his mask. "I need to get back before they notice I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m missing."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Good luck."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Thanks," he replied as he stepped back outside the mausoleum and made his way back up through the darkness.

\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 not}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  the time, Ron," said Harry warningly. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m not in the mood."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s always about you, isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t it," Ron shouted. "You keep it all bottled up inside, expecting everyone to tiptoe around you!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 A stray breeze wafted through the air, causing a whoosh\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
ing sound among the trees. "Ron," Harry said in a low growl, as a stray breeze caused his messy hair to dance around his face, "leave me alone. Now."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s response was to shift into his Shade form. "It won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t be so easy, this time," Ron growled. "Ginny isn\loch\af0\dbch\af15\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t here to stop me from knocking some sense into you!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry turned toward Ron and stared him down. "No, she isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t, is she. I warn you, you don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t want to do this."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, yes I do. Ginny isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t here to stop me, and this time I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m going to knock some sense into\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  that thick head of yours!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ginny didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t stop you," Harry said, growling, "she stopped }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 me}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
." Without warning Harry backhanded Ron hard, launching him into the air. While Ron was still arcing into the sky, Harry had already apparated above him. "I warned yo\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
u to leave me alone!" he roared as he flipped in midair, slamming his right foot into Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s chest causing him to abruptly hurtle toward the ground.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry floated down to where Ron impacted. "But, no. You just have to have it your way. We give you time, whe\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n you\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
re angry. We let you calm down. You just keep pushing, and pushing. Well, now I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m pissed, and you volunteered to be my stress relief!"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You know, you talk too much," Ron snarled as shadow versions of him appeared all around Harry.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry moved like li\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ghtning, tearing into the shades one by one, searching for the real Ron. "It\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s good to see my lessons with you haven\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t been wasted," Harry said, smiling grimly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione sat down by a large tree, her copy of Hogwarts: A History firmly in hand. She rolled h\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
er eyes at both of them as she turned to reading, a glowing pink shield around her. "I learn fast," Ron retorted, causing Hermione to snort in amusement, though he missed it entirely due to the battle with Harry.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry continued to fight, his eyes growing \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 brighter and brighter the longer he continued. The entire time he was fighting, he was chanting, "}{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
La Luce diffonde questo Anima Scuro!}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 " Hermione looked positively frightened, but she didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t come out of her shield, sure that Harry would never really harm Ro
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 n.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 The light in Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eyes grew to a blinding light to rival the sun itself, and Ron began to fall back before it, trying to hide his eyes from the brilliant light threatening to steal all sight. "}{

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione screamed, though it was l\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ost to the sound of the explosion of light that invaded the area at Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s final incantation. When the light cleared, Harry was standing over an exhausted looking Ron who was back in his human form. Harry, however, looked no worse for wear. "The next tim\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 you try to show me how much of a man you are, try to stay on your feet," he spat in a tone of disgust. Ron would have responded to the insult, if he hadn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t been so exhausted.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Leaning down, Harry whispered in Ron\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s ear, "Remember this next time you think y\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ou\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ll teach me a lesson. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m the teacher here. Not you." Harry stood and spun on his heel, swiftly disappearing into the trees. Ron tried to get to his feet, to go after Harry, but he was simply far too tired.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Hermione walked up. "I tried to tell you, Ron,\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 " she said in her know-it-all tone of voice. "He was }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 not}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 in the mood to put up with you, today."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Ron groaned loudly. "Wha\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 dju mean?" he slurred.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I know that he was more angry than anyone I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve ever felt, and that alone tells me all I need to know."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Unh?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Ron, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 never}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  been able to read Harry. He keeps his mind guarded }{\i\fs24\kerning0 
\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 very}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  well. Today, he was radiating anger like he radiates power. You\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 re lucky he stopped when he did."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "M\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 lucky," Ron mumbled. "M\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 th\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 one onna groun\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ! He\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s a\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 dinck!"

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Further down the path, Harry was walking amongst the trees, trying to clear his head. If he weren\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t so angry, he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
d never have defeated Ron so easily. As it was, he only had one thing in mind while f\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ighting Ron. He would win, and he would win fast. Ron needed to be taught a lesson, and he was the one to do it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You come out here often?" a soft voice asked from behind him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry turned around, prepared for a fight, but relaxed when he saw that it was B\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 laise. "No\'85\loch\f0  only when I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m stressed out. The trees relax me."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Me, too. Lately, I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve wanted to come here more often."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh?" Harry asked, trying to push down his anger.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Well, we haven\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t gotten a chance to talk, lately, what with Quidditch and everything," s\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 he said softly. "Malfoy is planning something, and he has some kind of ability I
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve never seen."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Harry sighed warily. "Great, the Junior Death Eater is following in Daddy\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s footsteps. Do you know what he\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s planning?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Blaise nodded. "I overheard them a few \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 days ago. He wants to hurt you. He has Crabbe and Goyle working on getting the password to Gryffindor tower. I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
m not sure why he wants them. I can only guess he wants to attack you while you sleep."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "You said he had an ability?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Again, she nodded, her brig\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ht blue eyes betraying the worry she felt. "He turned his fingers into metal spikes."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "Oh, bloody perfect!" Harry growled, slamming his fist into a tree, splinters arcing away from it as he did. "A Blademaster is }{\i\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 just}{\fs24\kerning0 \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 
 what I needed right now."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 Blaise moved\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0  closer to Harry, slowly, and enveloped him into a tight hug. Her head rested on his shoulder as her shoulders shook. Strong arms embraced her, pulling her tightly against him. "I
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m worried about you, Harry." Her voice shook as she continued, and she tigh\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 ened her grip on him. "Promise me you won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "We\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve talked about this, Blaise," Harry said weakly as he felt his heart constrict. "I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 m not invincible. The most I can promise is that I\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
ll do my best to stay alive."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 "I kn\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ow," she said as she squeezed him tighter. "I just\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  we\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0  I\'85\loch\f0  I love you, Harry, and I don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0 With her head still firmly pressed against his neck, she couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t see the expression of shock on Harry\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s face, his emerald-green eyes wide, l\hich\af0\dbch\af15\loch\f0
