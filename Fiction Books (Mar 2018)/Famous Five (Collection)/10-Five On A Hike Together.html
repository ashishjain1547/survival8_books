<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter
One<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
LETTER FROM JULIAN<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Anne!’
shouted George, running after her cousin as she went along to her classroom.
‘Anne! I’ve just been down to the letterboard and there’s a letter from your
brother Julian, I’ve brought it for you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
stopped. ‘Oh thanks,’ she said. ‘What can Julian want? He only wrote a few days
ago - it’s most extraordinary for him to write again so soon. It must be
something important.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
open it and see,’ said George. ‘Hurry up - I’ve got a maths class to go to.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
ripped open the envelope. She pulled out a sheet of notepaper and read it
quickly. She looked up at George, her eyes shining.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George!
Julian and Dick have got a few days off at our half-term week-end! Somebody’s
won a wonderful scholarship or something, and the boys have got two days tacked
on to a week-end to celebrate! They want us to join them in a hike, and all go
off together.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
a glorious idea!’ said George, ‘Good old Julian. I bet he thought of that.
Let’s read the letter, Anne.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
before she could read it a mistress came along. ‘<st1:place w:st="on">Georgina</st1:place>!
You should be in class - and you too, Anne.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
scowled. She hated to be called by her full name. She went off without a word.
Anne tucked the letter into her pocket and rushed off joyfully. Half-term with
her brothers, Julian and Dick - and with George and Timmy the dog. Could
anything be better?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
and George talked about it again after morning school. ‘We get from Friday
morning till Tuesday,’ said George. ‘The boys are getting the same. What luck!
They don’t usually have a half-term in the winter term.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
can’t go home because the painters are in our house,’ said Anne. ‘That’s why I
was going home with you, of course. But I’m sure your mother won’t mind if we
go off with the boys. Your father never likes us in the middle of the term.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
he doesn’t,’ said George, ‘He’s always deep in the middle of some wonderful
idea, and he hates to be disturbed. It will suit everyone if we go off on a
hike.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian
says he will telephone to us tonight and arrange everything,’ said Anne. ‘I
hope it will be a nice fine week-end. It will still be October, so there’s a
chance of a bit of warm sunshine.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
woods will be beautiful,’ said George. ‘And won’t Timmy enjoy himself, Let’s go
and tell him the news.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boarding-school that the two girls were at was one that allowed the children to
bring their own pets to school, There were kennels down in the yard for various
dogs, and Timmy lived there during term-time. The two girls went to get him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
heard their footsteps at once and began to bark excitedly. He scraped at the
gate of the kennel yard, wishing for the thousandth time that he could find out
how to open it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
flung himself on the two girls, licking and pawing and barking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Silly
dog. Mad dog!’ said George, and thumped his back affectionately. ‘Listen, Tim -
we’re going off for the week-end with Julian and Dick! What do you think of
that? We’re going on a hike, so you’ll love it. All through the woods and up
the hills and goodness knows where!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
seemed to understand every word. He cocked up his ears, put his head on one
side and listened intently while George was speaking,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
he said, at the end, as if he approved thoroughly. Then off he went with the
girls for his walk, his plumy tail wagging happily. He didn’t like term-time
nearly as much as the holidays - but he was quite prepared to put up with
kennel life so long as he could be near his beloved George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
rang up that night as he had promised. He had got everything planned already.
Anne listened, thrilled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It
sounds super,’ she said. ‘Yes - we can meet where you say, and we’ll be there
as near as we can on time. Anyway, we can wait about if you others aren’t
there. Yes - we’ll bring the things you say. Oh Julian, won’t it be fun?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'What’s
he say?’ asked George impatiently when at last Anne put the receiver down. ‘You
might have let me have a word with Julian. I wanted to tell him all about
Timmy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
doesn’t want to waste an expensive telephone call listening to you raving about
Timmy,’ said Anne. ‘He asked how he was and I said “fine”, and that’s all he
wanted to know about Tim. He’s made all the arrangements. I’ll tell you what
they are.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls went off to a corner of their common-room and sat down. Timmy was there
too. He was allowed in at certain times, and so were three other dogs belonging
to the girls. Each dog behaved well - he knew that if he didn’t he would be
taken back to the kennels at once!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian
says that he and Dick can get off immediately after breakfast,’ said Anne. ‘So
can we, so that’s all right. He says we’ve got to take very little with us -
just night-things, tooth-brush, hair-brush and flannel and a rolled-up mac. And
any biscuits or chocolate we can buy, Have you any money left?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
bit,’ said George. ‘Not much. Enough to buy a few bars of chocolate, I think.
Anyway, you’ve got all the biscuits your mother sent last week. We can take
some of those.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
And the barley sugar one of my aunts sent,” said Anne. ‘But Julian says we’re
not to take much because this is to be a proper hike, and we’ll get tired if we
have to carry a heavy load. Oh, he said put in two pairs of extra socks.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said George, and she patted Timmy who was lying close beside her. ‘There’s
going to be a long walky-walk, Tim. Won’t you love that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
grunted comfortably. He wondered if there would be any rabbits on the walk. A
walk wasn’t really exciting unless there were rabbits all over the place. Timmy
thought it was a pity that rabbits were allowed to live down holes. They always
disappeared most unfairly just when he had nearly caught one!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
and George went to see their house-mistress to tell her that they were not
going to Kirrin Cottage after all, but were going walking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘My
brother says he has written to you,’ said Anne. ‘So you’ll know all about it
tomorrow, Miss Peters. And George’s mother will be writing too. We can go,
can’t we?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
yes - it will be a lovely half-term for you!’ said Miss Peters. ‘Especially if
this sunny weather lasts. Where are you going?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Over
the moors,’ said Anne. ‘In the very loneliest, most deserted parts that Julian
can find! We might see deer and wild ponies and perhaps even a few badgers. We
shall walk and walk.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
where will you sleep if the parts you are going to are so very lonely?’ asked
Miss Peters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
Julian is arranging all that,’ said George. ‘He’s been looking up little inns
and farm-houses on the map, and we shall make for those at night. It will be
too cold to sleep out of doors.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
certainly will!’ said Miss Peters. ‘Well don’t get into trouble, that’s all I
know what you five are when you get together. I imagine Timmy is going with you
too?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course!’ said George. ‘I wouldn’t go if he didn’t go! I couldn’t leave him here
alone.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two girls got their things ready as Friday came near. The biscuits were taken
out of the tin and put into paper bags. The barley sugar was put into a bag
too, and the bars of chocolate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Both
girls had rucksacks with straps for their shoulders. They packed and repacked
them several times. One by one more and more things were added. Anne felt she
must take a book to read. George said they must each take a torch with a new
battery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
what about biscuits for Timmy?’ she said. ‘I simply must take something for him.
He’d like a bone too - a big one that he can chew and chew and that I can put
back into the bag for another time.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
let me carry all the biscuits and chocolate then if you’re going to put a
smelly old bone into your bag,’ said Anne. ‘I don’t see why you want to take
anything for Timmy - he can always have something to eat when we do - wherever
we have a meal.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
decided not to take the bone. She had fetched one from his kennel, and it
certainly was big and heavy, and equally certainly it was smelly. She took it
back to the kennel again, Timmy following her rather puzzled. Why keep carrying
his bone here and there? He didn’t approve at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
seemed a long time till Friday, but at last it came. Both girls woke up very
early indeed. George was out in the kennels before breakfast, brushing and
combing Timmy to make him look spruce and tidy for Julian and Dick. He knew it
was the day they were to set off and he was as excited as the two girls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’d
better eat a good breakfast,’ said Anne. ‘We might have to wait some time
before our next meal. Let’s slip off immediately after breakfast. It’s lovely
to feel free of school and bells and time-tables-but I shan’t feel really free
till I’m outside the school grounds!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
ate an enormous breakfast though really they were too excited to want much.
Then they got their rucksacks, ready-packed the night before, said goodbye to
Miss Peters, and went to fetch Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was waiting impatiently for them, and barked madly when they came near. In a
trice he was out of his kennel-yard and capering round them, almost tripping
them up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good-bye,
Anne and George!’ yelled one of their friends. ‘Have a good time on your hike -
and it’s no good coming back on Tuesday and telling us you’ve had one of your
usual hair-raising adventures, because we just shan’t believe it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, ‘Woof, woof!’ Which meant that he was going to have adventures with
hundreds of rabbits, anyway!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

Two<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>SETTING
OFF<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and Dick were also on their way, very pleased to have such an unexpectedly long
week-end.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
never liked Willis or Johnson much,’ said Dick, as they walked out of the
school grounds. ‘Awful swotters they were - never had any time for games or
fun. But I take my hat off to them today! Because of their swotting they’ve won
medals and scholarships and goodness knows what - and we’ve got a week-end off
in celebration! Good old Willis and Johnson!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hear
hear,’ said Dick. ‘But I bet they’ll sit in a corner with their books all the
week-end - they won’t know if it’s a brilliant day like this, or pouring with
rain like yesterday! Poor mutts!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’d
hate to go off on a hike,’ said Julian. ‘It would be utter misery to them. Do
you remember how awful Johnson was at rugger? He never knew which goal he was
playing against - always ran the wrong way!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
But he must have got terrific brains,’ said Dick. ‘Why are we talking about
Willis and Johnson? I can think of plenty of more interesting things. Anne and
George, for instance - and old Tim. I hope they’ll manage to get off in time
all right.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
had carefully looked up a large-scale map of the moors that lay between the two
schools that he and the girls went to. They were vast stretches of lonely
heathery land, dotted with farms here and there, with a few small cottages, and
some inns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
keep right off the main roads, and the second-and third-grades,’ he said.
‘We’ll take the little lanes and paths. I wonder what Timmy will say if we see
deer. He’ll wonder what in the world they are!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’ll
only be interested in rabbits,’ said Dick. ‘I hope he’s not as fat as he was
last hols. I think we must have given him too many ice-creams and too much
chocolate!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
he won’t get that in term-time!’ said Julian. ‘The girls don’t get as much
pocket money as we do. Buck up - there’s the bus!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
ran for the little country bus that rumbled along the country lanes, taking
people to market, or to the tiny villages that lay here and there tucked away
in the moor. It stopped most obligingly for them, and they leapt in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ha!
Running away from school?’ said the conductor. ‘Have to report you, you know!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Very
funny,’ said Julian, bored at this joke, which the conductor produced regularly
every time a boy got on board with a rucksack over his shoulders.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had to get out at the next village and cut across country to get to another
bus-route, They managed to catch a bus there easily and settled down
comfortably in their seats. It was half an hour’s run from there to where they
had planned to meet the girls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here
you are, young sirs,’ called the conductor, as the bus ran into a village. It
had a wide green on which geese cackled, and a small pond for ducks. ‘You
wanted Pippin Village, didn’t you? We don’t go any farther - we just turn round
and go back.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thanks,’
said the boys and got out. ‘Now - are the girls here or not?’ said Julian.
‘They have to walk from a tiny railway station about two miles away.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were not there. Julian and Dick went to have a drink of orangeade at the
village store. They had hardly finished when they saw the two girls looking in
at the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian!
Dick! We guessed you’d be eating or drinking!’ said Anne, and she rushed at her
brothers. ‘We came as quickly as we could. The engine broke down - it was such
a funny little train! All the passengers got out and advised the engine-driver
what to do!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo!’
said Julian, and gave Anne a hug. He was very fond of his young sister. 'Hallo,
George! My, you’ve grown fat, haven’t you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
have not,’ said George, indignantly. ‘And Timmy isn’t fat either, so don’t tell
him he is.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian’s
pulling your leg as usual,’ said Dick, giving George a friendly slap on the
back. ‘All the same, you’ve grown a bit - you’ll soon be as tall as I am.
Hallo, Timmy! Good dog, fine dog! Tongue as wet as usual? Yes, it is! I never
knew a dog with a wetter tongue than yours!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
went nearly mad with joy at being with all four of his friends. He leapt round
them, barking, wagging his long tail and sending a pile of tins crashing to the
floor in his delight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now,
now!’ said the shop-woman, emerging from a dark little room at the back, ‘Take
that dog out. He’s gone mad!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
you girls want a drink of ginger-beer or something?’ asked Julian, getting hold
of Timmy’s collar. ‘You’d better, because we don’t want to have to carry heavy
bottles of drinkables with us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
are we going to set off to?’ asked George. ‘Yes, I’d like ginger-beer please.
Get down, Timmy. Anyone would think you’d been away from Julian and Dick for at
least ten years!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
probably does seem like ten years to him,’ said Anne. ‘I say - are those
sandwiches?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
pointed to a ledge at the back of the counter. There was a little pile of
sandwiches there, looking most appetizing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
they’re sandwiches, Miss,’ said the shop-woman, opening two bottles of
ginger-beer. ‘I’ve made them for my son who works over at Blackbush Farm -
he’ll be in for them soon.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
suppose you couldn’t make us some, could you?’ asked Julian, ‘We wouldn’t need
to bother about trying to get to some village at lunch time then. They look
jolly good.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I can make you all you want,’ said the shop-woman, putting two glasses down in
front of the girls, ‘What do you want - cheese, egg, ham or pork?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- we’d like some of all of those,’ said Julian, ‘The bread looks so nice too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
make it myself,’ said the woman, pleased, ‘All right - I’ll go and make you
some. You tell me if anyone comes into the shop while I’m gone.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
disappeared. ‘That’s good,’ said Julian. ‘If she makes plenty of those we can
avoid villages all the day and have a really good day of exploration - treading
where no foot has trod before and all that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
many can you manage each?’ asked the woman, suddenly reappearing. ‘My son, he
has six - that’s twelve rounds of bread.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- could you manage eight sandwiches for each of us?’ said Julian. The woman
looked astonished. ‘It’s to last us all day,’ he explained, and she nodded and
disappeared again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
a nice little sum for her,’ said Anne. ‘Eight sandwiches each, making sixteen
rounds of bread - for four people!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
let’s hope she’s got a bread-cutting machine!’ said Dick. ‘Or we’ll be here for
keeps! Hallo - who’s this?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
tall man appeared at the entrance of the shop, a bicycle in his hand. ‘Ma!’ he
called.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children guessed who he was at once - the son who worked over at Blackbush
Farm. He had come for his sandwiches!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Your
mother is hard at work cutting sixty-four rounds of bread,’ said Dick. ‘Shall I
get her for you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
I’m in a hurry,’ said the man and he set his bicycle by the door, came in,
reached over the counter for his sandwiches and then went back to his bicycle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Tell
my mother I’ve been in,’ he said, ‘And you might tell her I’ll be late home
today - got to take some stuff to the prison.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was off at once, sailing away down the road on his bicycle. The old woman
suddenly came in, a knife in one hand, a loaf in the other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Did
I hear Jim?’ she said. ‘Oh yes - he’s got his sandwiches. You should have told
me he was in!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
said he was in a hurry,’ explained Julian. ‘And he said we were to tell you
he’d be late today because he had to take some stuff to the prison.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
got another son there,’ said the woman. The four looked at her. Did she mean he
was a prisoner? And what prison?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
guessed their thoughts and smiled. ‘Oh, my Tom isn’t a prisoner!’ she said.
‘He’s a warder - a fine fellow. Not a nice job there though - I’m always afraid
of those men in prison - a fierce lot, a bad lot!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- I’ve heard there is a big prison on this moor,’ said Julian. ‘It’s marked on
our map too. We’re not going near it, of course.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'No.
Don’t you take the girls near there,’ said the woman, disappearing again. ‘If I
don’t get on with your sandwiches you’ll not have them before tomorrow
morning,’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Only
one customer came in while the children were waiting - a solemn old man smoking
a clay pipe. He looked round the shop, couldn’t see the woman, took a packet of
blancmange powder, which he slipped into his pocket, and put the money down on
the counter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Tell
’er when ’er comes,’ he mumbled with his pipe still in his mouth, and out he
shuffled. Timmy growled. The old man smelt very unwashed and Timmy didn’t like
him.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
At last the sandwiches were finished and the old woman appeared again. She had
packed them up neatly in four parcels of grease-proof paper, and had pencilled
on each what they were, Julian read what she had written and winked at the
others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘My
word - we’re in for a grand time!’ he said. ‘Cheese, Pork, Ham and Egg - and
what’s this?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Oh,
that’s four slices of my home-made fruit cake,’ said the old woman. ‘I’m not
charging you for that, It’s just so that you can taste it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
looks like half the cake!’ said Julian, touched, ‘But we shall pay for it, with
many thanks. How much is all that?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
told him. Julian put down the money and added some extra for the cake. ‘There
you are, and many thanks,’ he said. ‘And that money there was left by an old
fellow with a clay pipe who took a packet of blanc mange powder.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
would be Old Man Gupps,’ said the woman. ‘Well, I hope you’ll enjoy your tour.
Come back here if you want any more sandwiches cut! If you eat all those today
you won’t do badly!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, hoping that he too would share a few. The woman produced a bone for
him, and he took it up in his mouth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thanks!’
Julian said. ‘Come on - now we’ll really start!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>ACROSS

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
set off at last, Timmy running in front. School already seemed far behind them.
The October sun shone down warmly, and the trees in the village glowed yellow
and red and golden, dressed in their autumn colourings. A few leaves floated
down in the breeze, but not until there was a real frost would many come
whirling down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
a heavenly day,’ said George. ‘I wish I hadn’t got my blazer on. I’m cooked
already.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
take it off and carry it over your shoulder,’ said Julian. ‘I’m going to do the
same. Our jerseys are quite warm enough today!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
took off their thick blazers and carried them. Each of them had a rucksack, a
mac rolled up tightly and tied to it, and now a blazer to carry. But none of
them noticed the weight at the outset of their day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
glad you girls took my advice and wore your thickest shoes,’ said Julian,
looking with approval at their brogues. ‘Some of our walking may be wet. Have
you got changes of socks?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
We brought everything you told us to,’ said Anne. ‘Your rucksack looks a bit
fuller than ours, Ju!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I’ve got maps and things in it,’ said Julian. 'It’s a queer place, this moor -
miles and miles and miles of it! Queer names on it too - Blind Valley - Rabbit
Hill - Lost Lake - Coney Copse!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Rabbit
Hill! Timmy would love that,’ said George, and Timmy pricked up his ears.
Rabbits? Ah, that was the kind of place he liked!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
actually we’re going towards Rabbit Hill now,’ said Julian, ‘And after that
there’s Coney Copse, and as coney is a country word for rabbit, Timmy ought to
enjoy himself!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy joyfully and bounded ahead. He felt very happy. His four friends
were with him, their rucksacks were full of delicious-smelling sandwiches, and
a long, long walk lay ahead, teeming, he hoped with rabbits!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was lovely walking along in the sun. They soon left the little village behind
and took a winding lane. The hedges on either side became so high that the four
couldn’t see over the tops at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
a sunken lane!’ said Dick. ‘I feel as if I’m walking in a tunnel! And how
narrow! I wouldn’t like to drive a car along this lane. If I met another car I
might have to back for miles!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
shan’t meet anyone much,’ said Julian, ‘It’s only in the summer that cars come
along these lanes - people on holiday, touring round the countryside. Look - we
take that path now - it leads to Rabbit Hill, according to the map!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
climbed over a stile in the high hedge and walked over a field towards a
curious little hill. Timmy suddenly went mad with excitement. He could smell
rabbits - and he could see them too!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
don’t often see so many rabbits out in the daytime,’ said George, surprised.
‘Big ones and little ones too - what a scampering.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came to the hill and sat down quietly to watch the rabbits. But it was quite
impossible to make Timmy do the same. The sight and smell of so many made him
quite wild. He pulled away from George’s hand and went bounding madly up the
hill, scattering rabbits by the dozen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy!’
yelled George, but for once Timmy paid no attention. He rushed here and rushed
there, getting very angry as first one rabbit and then another neatly popped down
a hole.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
no use calling him,’ said Dick. 'He won’t catch one, anyway - see how nippy
they are, It’s my belief they’re having a game with our Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
did look rather like it. As soon as Timmy had chased two or three rabbits down
one hole, a few more would pop up from another behind him. Tht children
laughed, It was as good as a pantomime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
do you mean to have lunch?’ asked Anne, ‘If we stay here much longer I shall
really have to have something to eat - and it’s not nearly time yet. I wish I
didn’t always feel so hungry in the open air.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
come on then,’ said Julian. ‘We’ve got some way to go before we get to our
lunch-place. I’ve made a pretty good time-table of our tour - we’re going to go
all round the moors and finish at the place we started at! I’ve really marked
it all out pretty well.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
we sleep at farm-houses or something at night?’ asked George. ‘I should like
that. Will they mind having us, do you think? Or do we go to inns?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Farm-houses
for two nights and inns for the other nights,’ said Julian. ‘I’ve marked them
all.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went up Rabbit Hill and down the other side. There were just as many rabbits
there. Timmy chased them till he panted like an engine going uphill! His tongue
hung out, dripping wet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’ve
had enough, Tim,’ said George. ‘Be sensible now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timmy couldn’t be sensible with so many rabbits about. So they left him to
chase and dart and race at top speed and went on down the hill. Timmy came
rushing after them when they got to the bottom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
perhaps you’ll stop tearing about like a mad thing and walk with us,’ scolded
George. But she spoke too soon, for soon they were in a small wood which Julian
informed them was Coney Copse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
as I told you, coney means rabbit, so you can’t expect Timmy to stop being mad
just yet,’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
very nearly lost Timmy in Coney Copse. A rabbit disappeared down a very big
hole, and Timmy was actually able to get down a little way. Then he got stuck.
He scrabbled violently with his feet but it was no good. He was well and truly
stuck.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others soon discovered he wasn’t with them and went back, calling. Quite by
chance they came on the hole he was in and heard the sound of panting and
scraping. A shower of sand flew out of the hole.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
he is! The idiot, he’s down a hole,’ said George in alarm, ‘Timmy! TIMMY! Come
on out!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was nothing that Timmy would have liked better, but he couldn’t come out,
however much he tried. A root of a tree had got wedged into his back, and he
couldn’t seem to push himself out again, past the annoying root.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
took the four children twenty minutes to get Timmy out. Anne had to lie down
and wriggle in a little way to reach him. She was the only one small enough to
get into the hole.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
caught hold of Timmy’s back legs and pulled hard. Somehow the root slid off his
back and he came backwards. He whined loudly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
Anne, you’re hurting him, you’re hurting him!’ shouted George. ‘Let him go!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can’t!’ yelled back Anne. ‘He’ll only go down deeper, if I leave go his legs.
Can you pull me out? If so Timmy will come too - he’ll have to because I’ve got
his legs!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Poor
Anne was pulled out by her legs, and poor Timmy came too, pulled by his. He
whined and went to George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
hurt himself somewhere,’ said George anxiously. ‘I know he has. He wouldn’t
whine like that if he wasn’t hurt.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
ran her fingers over him, pressing here and there. She examined each leg and
each paw. She looked at his head. Still he whined, Where could he have hurt
himself?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Leave
him,’ said Julian, at last. ‘I can’t see that he’s hurt anywhere - except in
his feelings! He probably didn’t like Anne hauling him out by his hind legs.
Most undignified!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
wasn’t satisfied. Although she could find nothing wrong, she couldn’t help
being sure that Timmy had hurt himself somewhere. Ought he to see a vet?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
be silly, George,’ said Julian. ‘Vets don’t grow on trees in a moorland country
like this! Let’s go on walking, You’ll see Timmy will follow quite all right,
and soon forget to whine. I tell you, he’s hurt his doggy feelings, that’s all.
His vanity is wounded!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
left Coney Copse and went on, George rather silent. Timmy trotted beside her,
also rather quiet. Still, there really didn’t seem anything the matter with
him, except that he gave sudden little whines now and again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
here’s where I thought we might have our lunch,’ said Julian, at last,
‘Fallaway Hill! It’s a good name for it too - it falls away steeply, and we’ve
got a marvellous view.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
they had. They had come to the top of a steep hill, not guessing that it fell
away on the other side. They could sit on the tip and see the sun shining on
miles and miles of lonely heather-grown moor. They might see shy deer in the
distance - or little wild ponies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
is heavenly,’ said Anne, sitting down on a great tuft of heather. ‘It’s as warm
as summer too! I do hope it’s like this all over the week-end. We shall all be
burnt brown!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
will also be heavenly having some of those sandwiches,’ said Dick, choosing a
lump of heather too. ‘What comfortable seats are provided for us! I’ve a good
mind to take a tuft of this heather back to school with me to put on the very
hard chair that goes with my desk!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
put the four packets of sandwiches down in the heather. Anne undid them. They
looked wonderful!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Super!’
said Anne. ‘What do you want first?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
speaking for myself I’m going to have one of each, put them all on top of one
another, and have a huge bite of cheese, ham, pork and egg at once,’ said Dick.
Anne laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Even
your mouth isn’t big enough for that,’ she said. But somehow Dick managed,
though it was difficult.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Disgusting
behaviour,’ he said, when he had managed the first mouthful. ‘I think on the
whole that one at a time is more economical. Hie, Timmy - have a bit?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
obliged. He was very quiet, and George was still anxious about him. Still, his
appetite seemed remarkably good, so nobody but George wondered any more if he
had hurt himself. He lay beside George, occasionally putting a great paw on her
knee if he wanted another bit of sandwich.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy
does jolly well,’ said Dick, with his mouth full. ‘He gets bits from us all. I
bet he eats more than any of us. I say - did anyone ever taste such smashing
sandwiches? Have you tried the pork? It must have come from a super pig!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was lovely sitting there in the sun, looking over miles of countryside, eating
hungrily. They all felt very happy. Except George. Was there anything wrong
with Timmy? It would spoil the whole week-end if so!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
lazed for some time in the sun after they had finished their meal. There were
three sandwiches each left, and half a piece each of the fruit cake. No one had
been able to manage a whole piece, much as they would have liked to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
seemed to think he could finish all the cake that was left, but Julian said no.
‘It’s such a gorgeous cake it would be really wasted on Timmy,’ he said.,
‘You’ve had enough, Tim. Greedy dog!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, wagging his tail, and eyeing the cake watchfully. He sighed when he
saw it being packed up. He had only had a bit of George’s half-slice - what a
cake!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
pack three sandwiches and a half-slice of the cake into each of four bags,’
said Julian, ‘Anyone can eat his or hers whenever they like. I expect we shall
have a good meal at the farm-house I’ve chosen for tonight, so you can eat when
you like before then.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
don’t feel as if I could eat anything till tomorrow morning,’ said Anne,
putting her bag of food into her rucksack. ‘But it’s odd how hungry you keep on
getting, even if you feel you can’t possibly be for hours and hours.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
Timmy can wolf anything you don’t want,’ said Julian. ‘Nothing wasted when
Tim’s about. Now are we all ready? We’re going through a little village soon,
where we’ll stop for a drink. I could do with a ginger-beer. And then on we go
to our farm-house. We ought to try and arrive about five, because it gets dark
so soon.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
the farm-house called?’ asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Blue
Pond Farm,’ said Julian. ‘Nice name, isn’t it? I hope it’s still got a blue
pond.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Suppose
they haven’t room for us?’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
they can always put a couple of girls somewhere,’ said Julian. ‘Dick and I can
sleep in a barn if necessary. We’re not particular!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’d
like to sleep in a barn too,’ said Anne, ‘I’d love to. Let’s not ask for a
bedroom, let’s all sleep in a barn - on straw or hay or something.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said Julian. ‘You girls will have to be in the house. It gets cold at night,
and we’ve brought no rugs. We boys will be all right with our macs over us. I’m
not letting you two girls do that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
stupid being a girl!’ said George, for about the millionth time in her life.
‘Always having to be careful when boys can do as they like! I’m going to sleep
in a barn, anyway. I don’t care what you say, Ju!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes you do,’ said Julian, ‘You know quite well that if ever you go against the
orders of the chief - that’s me, my girl, in case you didn’t know it - you
won’t come out with us again. You may look like a boy and behave like a boy,
but you’re a girl all the same. And like it or not, girls have got to be taken
care of.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
should have thought that boys hated having to take care of girls,’ said George,
sulkily. ‘Especially girls like me who don’t like it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
decent boys like looking after their girl cousins or their sisters,’ said
Julian, ‘And oddly enough decent girls like it. But I won’t count you as a
girl, George, decent or otherwise. I’ll merely count you as a boy who’s got to
have an eye on him - my eye, see? So take that look off your face, and don’t
make yourself any more difficult than you already are.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
couldn’t help laughing, and the sulky look went at once. She gave Julian a
punch. ‘All right. You win. You’re so jolly domineering these days I feel quite
afraid of you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
not afraid of anyone,’ said Dick. ‘You’re the bravest girl I ever knew! Aha!
That’s made old George blush like a girl! Let me warm my hands, George!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
Dick held his hands up in front of George’s scarlet face, pretending to warm
them at her fiery blush. She didn’t know whether to be pleased or angry. She
pushed his hands away and got up, looking more like a boy than ever with her
short tousled hair and her well-freckled face!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others got up and stretched. Then they settled their rucksacks on their backs
again, with their macs fastened to them, threw their blazers over their
shoulders and set oft down Fallaway Hill.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
followed, but he didn’t bound about as usual. He went slowly and carefully.
George looked round for him, and frowned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
is the matter with Timmy?’ she said. ‘Look at him! Not a jump or a scamper in
him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all stopped and watched him. He came towards them and they saw that he was
limping slightly with his left hind leg. George dropped down beside him and felt
the leg carefully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think he must have twisted it - sprained it or something, when he was down that
rabbit-hole,’ she said. She patted him gently on the back and he winced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
the matter, Tim?’ said George, and she parted the hair on his back, examining
the white skin underneath to see why he had winced when she had patted him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
got an awful bruise here,’ she said at last, and the others bent to see.
‘Something must have hurt his back down in that hole. And Anne must have hurt
one of his legs when she held on to them and dragged him out. I told you not to
hold on to his legs, Anne.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
how were we to get him out if I didn’t?’ demanded Anne, feeling cross but
rather guilty. ‘Did you want him to stick there for days and days?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t think there’s much damage done,’ said Julian, feeling the hind leg. ‘I
honestly think he’s only just twisted it a bit, George. He’ll be all right
after tonight, I’m sure.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
I must be certain,’ said George. ‘Did you say we come to a village soon, Ju?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- Beacons Village,’ said Julian, ‘We can ask if there’s a vet anywhere in the
district if you like. He’ll look at Timmy’s leg and tell you if there’s
anything much wrong. But I don’t think there is.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
go on to the village then,’ said George. ‘Oh dear - the only time I ever wish
Timmy was a little dog is when he’s hurt - because he’s so very very heavy to
carry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
don’t think of carrying him yet,’ said Dick. 'He can walk on three legs even if
he can’t on four! He’s not as bad as all that, are you, Timmy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, mournfully. He was rather enjoying all the fuss. George patted his
head. ‘Come on,’ she said, ‘we’ll soon get that leg put right. Come on, Tim.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went on, looking round to see how Timmy was getting on. He followed slowly,
and then began to limp more badly. Finally he lifted his left hind leg up from
the ground and ran on three legs only.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Poor
boy,’ said George. ‘Poor Timmy! I do hope his leg will be all right tomorrow. I
can’t possibly go on with the hike if it isn’t.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was rather a gloomy company that came to Beacons Village, Julian made his way
to a little inn that stood in the middle, called Three Shepherds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
woman was shaking a duster out of a window, Julian called up to her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say! Is there a vet anywhere in this district? I want someone to have a look at
our dog’s leg.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
No vet here,’ answered the woman. ‘Not one nearer than Marlins over six miles
away.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George’s
heart sank. Timmy would never be able to walk six miles.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
there a bus?’ she called.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
Not to Marlins,’ said the woman. ‘No bus goes there, missy. But if you want
your dog’s leg seen to, you go up to Spiggy House, up along there. Mr. Gaston
lives there with his horses, and he knows about dogs too. You take the dog
there. He’ll know what to do.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
thank you,’ said George, gratefully. ‘Is it very far?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘About
half a mile,’ said the woman. ‘See that hill? You go up there, take the turning
to the right and you’ll see a big house. That’s Spiggy House. You can’t mistake
it because of the stables built all round it. Ask for Mr. Gaston. He’s nice, he
is. Maybe you’ll have to wait a little if he’s out with his horses though - he
may not be in till it’s almost dark ’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four held a little council. ‘We’d better go up to this Mr. Gaston’s, I think,’
said Julian. ‘But I think you and Anne, Dick, should go on to the farm-house I
planned to stay in for the night, and make arrangements for us. We don’t want
to leave it till the last minute. I’ll go with George and Timmy, of course.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Dick. ‘I’ll take Anne now. It will be dark pretty soon. Got your torch,
Julian?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Julian. ‘And I’m pretty good at finding my way, as you know. I shall come
back to this village after we’ve been to Mr. Gaston’s, and then make straight for
the farm-house. It’s about a mile and a half away.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thanks
awfully for saying you’ll come with me, Julian,’ said George. ‘Let’s go now,
shall we? Well, Dick and Anne - see you later!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
set off with George and Timmy up the hill to Spiggy House. Timmy went on three
legs, and still seemed very sorry for himself. Anne and Dick watched him,
feeling sorry for him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hope he’s all right tomorrow,’ said Dick. ‘It will spoil our week-end if he’s
not, no doubt about that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
turned away and walked through the little village of Beacons. ‘Now for Blue
Pond Farm-house,’ said Dick. ‘Julian didn’t give me very clear directions, I
think I’ll ask someone exactly where it is.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
they met nobody except a man driving a little cart. Dick hailed him and he pulled
up his horse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Are
we on the right road for Blue Pond Farm-house?’ shouted Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ar,’
answered the man, nodding his head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
it straight on - or do we take any paths or little lanes?’ asked Dick,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ar,’
said the man, nodding again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
does he mean - “ar”?’ said Dick. He raised his voice again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
it this way?’ and he pointed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ar,’
said the man again. He raised his whip and pointed up the road where the two
were going, and then across to the west.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
I see - we turn to the right up there?’ called Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ar,’
said the man, nodding, and drove on so suddenly that the horse almost stepped
on Dick’s foot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- if we find the farm-house after all those “ars” we’ll be clever,’ said Dick.
‘Come on!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

AND DICK<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
began to get dark very suddenly. The sun had gone, and a big black cloud slid
smoothly over the sky. ‘It’s going to rain,’ said Dick. ‘Blow! I thought it was
going to be a lovely evening.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’d
better hurry,’ said Anne. ‘I hate sheltering under a hedge in the pouring rain,
with drips down my neck, and puddles round my feet!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
hurried. They went up the road that led out of the village and then came to a
turning on the right. This must be the one the man had meant. They stopped and
looked down it It seemed to be like one of the sunken lanes they had walked
down in the morning, and it looked rather dark and tunnel-like now, in the
twilight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hope it’s right,’ said Dick. ‘We’ll ask the very first person we meet.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
we do meet anyone!’ said Anne, feeling that they never would in this curious
deep lane. They went up it. It wound round and about and then went downhill
into a very muddy bit indeed. Anne found herself sloshing about in thick mud.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
stream or something must run across the lane here,’ she said. ‘Ugh! The water’s
got into my shoes! I’m sure we don’t go this way, Dick. The water’s quite deep
farther on, I’m certain. I was up to my ankles just now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
looked about in the deepening twilight. He made out something above him in the
high hedge that grew on the steep bank each side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
- is that a stile?’ he said, ‘Where’s my torch? At the bottom of my rucksack,
of course! Can you get it out, Anne, to save me taking the thing off?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
found the torch and gave it to Dick. He switched it on, and immediately the
shadows round them grew blacker, and the lane seemed more tunnel-like than
ever. Dick flashed the torch upwards to what he had thought was a stile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- it is a stile,’ he said. ‘I expect that leads up to the farm-house - a short
cut, probably. I’ve no doubt this lane is the one used by the farm-carts, and
probably goes right round to the farm - but if this is a short cut we might as
well take it. It must lead somewhere, anyway!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
scrambled up the bank to the stile. Dick helped Anne over, and they found
themselves in a wide field. In front of them was a narrow path, running between
crops of some sort.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- this is obviously a short cut,’ said Dick, pleased. ‘I expect we’ll see the
lights of the farm-house in a minute.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Or
fall into the blue pond first,’ said Anne, rather dismally. It was just
beginning to rain and she was wondering if it was worth while to untie her mac
from her shoulder and put it on. Or was the farm-house really nearby? Julian
had said it wasn’t very far.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
walked across the field and came to another stile. The rain was coming down
fast now, Anne decided to put on her mac. She stood under a thick bush and Dick
helped her on with it. She had a small sou’wester in the pocket and put that on
too. Dick put his on and they set off again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
second stile led into another endless field, and the path then came at last to
a big field-gate. They climbed over it and found themselves on what looked like
a heathery moor - wild and uncultivated land! No farm-house was to be seen -
though, indeed they could not have seen anything of one unless they had been
very close to it, because the night was on them, dark and rainy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
only we could see some lights somewhere - shining out of a window,’ said Dick.
He shone his torch on to the moor in front of them. ‘I don’t quite know what to
do. There doesn’t seem a path here - and I just hate the idea of going all the
way back across those wet fields, and into that dark little lane.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no - don’t let’s,’ said Anne, with a shiver. ‘I really didn’t like that lane.
There must be a path somewhere! It’s silly for a gate to open on to moorland!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then, as they stood there, with the rain dripping on them and not much else to
be heard, another noise came to their ears.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was so unexpected and so very startling that both of them clutched the other in
a start of alarm. It was certainly a strange noise to hear in that deserted bit
of country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Bells!
Wild, clanging bells sounding without a stop, jangling out over the dark
countryside in peal after peal. Anne held on tightly to Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
is it? Where are those bells? What are they ringing for?’ whispered Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
had no idea. He was as startled as Anne to hear this extraordinary noise. It
sounded some distance away, but every now and again the wind blew hard and then
the noise of the jangling swept round them, close to them it seemed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wish they’d stop, Oh, I wish they’d stop!’ said Anne, her heart beating fast.
‘I don’t like them. They frighten me. They’re not church bells.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
They’re certainly not church bells,’ said Dick. ‘They’re a warning of some
kind. I’m sure - but what for? Fire? We’d see fire if there was one anywhere
near us. War? No - bells and beacons were used to warn people of war long long
ago, Not now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
village was called Beacons,’ said Anne, suddenly remembering. ‘Do you suppose
it has that name because long ago there was a nearby hill where people lighted
a beacon, to send a warning to other towns telling them that the enemy was
coming? Did they ring<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>bells
too? Are we hearing long-ago bells, Dick? They don’t sound like bells I’ve ever
heard in my life before.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
gracious! They’re certainly not long-ago bells!’ said Dick, speaking
cheerfully, though he was really just as puzzled and alarmed as Anne. ‘Those
bells are being rung now, at this very minute!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Quite
suddenly the bells stopped and an enormous silence took the place of the wild
ringing. The two children stood and listened for a minute or two and then
heaved a sigh of relief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’ve
stopped at last,’ said Anne, ‘I hated them! Why did they ring out on this dark
dark night? Oh do let’s find Blue Pond Farm-house as soon as ever we can, Dick.
I don’t like being lost in the dark like this, with bells ringing madly for
nothing at all!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on,’ said Dick. ‘Keep close to the hedge. As long as we follow that we must
come to somewhere. We won’t wander out on to the moorland.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
took Anne’s arm and the two of them kept close to the hedge. They came to
another path at last and followed it. That led to a lane, but not a sunken one
this time - and then, oh wonderful sight, - not far off they saw a light
shining!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
must be Blue Pond Farm-house!’ said Dick, thankfully. ‘Come on, Anne - not much
farther now!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came to a low stone wall and followed it till they came to a broken-down gate.
It opened with a squeak, and Anne stepped through - right into an enormous
puddle!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Blow!’
she said. ‘Now I’m wetter than ever! For a moment I thought I must have stepped
into the blue pond!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it was only a puddle. They went round it and followed a muddy path to a little
door set in a white stone wall. Dick thought it must be the back door. Nearby
was a window, and in it shone the light they had seen so thankfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An
old woman sat near the light, her head bent over some sewing. The children
could see her quite clearly as they stood by the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
looked for a bell or knocker but there was none. He knocked with his bare
knuckles. Nobody answered. The door remained shut. They looked at the old woman
by the lamp, and saw that she was still sewing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Perhaps
she’s deaf,’ said Dick and he knocked again, much more loudly. Still the old
woman sewed on placidly. She must indeed be deaf!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
never get in at this rate!’ said Dick, impatiently. He tried the handle of the
door - it opened at once!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
just have to walk in and announce ourselves,’ said Dick, and he stepped on to
the worn mat inside the door. He was in a narrow little passage that led to a
stone stairway, steep and narrow at the farther end.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
his right was a door, a little ajar. It opened into the room where the old
woman was sitting. The two children could see a streak of light coming through
the crack.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
pushed the door open and walked boldly in, followed by Anne. Still the old woman
didn’t look up. She pushed her needle in and out of her sewing and seemed to
hear and see nothing else whatsoever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
had to walk right up to her before she knew he was in the room. Then she leapt
up in such a fright that her chair fell over with a bang.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
sorry,’ said Dick, upset at frightening the old lady. ‘We knocked but you
didn’t hear!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
stared at them, her hand over her heart. ‘You give me such a fright,’ she said.
‘Where did you come from, this dark night?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
picked up her chair, and she sat down in it, panting a little.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ve
been looking for this place,’ said Dick. ‘Blue Pond Farm-house, isn’t it? We
wondered if we could stay the night here - and two others of us as well.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
old woman pointed to her ears and shook her head. ‘Deaf as a post,’ she said.
‘No good talking to me, my dear. You’ve lost your way, I suppose?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
nodded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you can’t stay here,’ said the old woman. ‘My son won’t have no one here at
all. You’d best be gone before he comes. He have a nasty temper, he have.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
shook his head. Then he pointed out to the dark rainy night, then pointed to
Anne’s wet shoes and clothes. The old woman knew what he meant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’ve
lost your way, you’re wet and tired, and you don’t want me to turn you out,’
she said. ‘But there’s my son, you see. He don’t like strangers here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
pointed to Anne, and then to a sofa in a corner of the room. Then he pointed to
himself, and then outside, Again the old woman understood at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
want me to give your sister shelter, but you’ll go out into the night?’ she
said. Dick nodded. He thought he could easily find some shed or barn for
himself. But Anne really must be indoors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘My
son mustn’t see either of you,’ said the old woman, and she pulled Anne to what
the girl thought was a cupboard. But when the door opened, she saw a very
small, steep wooden staircase leading upwards into the roof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
go up there,’ said the old woman to Anne. ‘And don’t you come down till I call
you in the morning. I’ll get into trouble if my son knows you’re here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Go
up, Anne,’ said Dick, rather troubled. ‘I don’t know what you’ll find there. If
it’s too bad, come down. See if there’s a window or something you can call out
from, and then I’ll know if you’re all right.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Anne, in rather a trembling voice, and she went up the steep, dirty wooden
stairs. They led straight into a little loft. There was a mattress there,
fairly clean, and a chair. A rug was folded up on the chair and a jug of water
stood on a shelf, Otherwise the room was bare.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
tiny window opened out of one side. Anne went to it and called out. ‘Dick! Are
you there? Dick!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
I’m here,’ said Dick. ‘What’s it like, Anne? Is it all right? Listen, I’ll find
somewhere nearby to shelter in - and you can always call me if you want me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
not bad,’ said Anne. ‘There’s a fairly clean mattress and a rug. I’ll be all
right. But what about if the others come, Dick? Will you look out for them? I
almost think George will have to sleep in a barn with you and Julian if she
comes. That old woman won’t let anyone else in, I’m sure!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
look out for them and arrange something,’ said Dick. ‘You eat the rest of your
sandwiches and your cake, and see if you can dry your wet feet and make
yourself really comfortable. There’s a shed or something out here. I shall be
quite all right. Yell for me if you want me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
went back into the room. She felt wet and tired, hungry and thirsty. She ate
all her food, and had a drink from the jug. Then she felt sleepy and lay down
on the mattress, throwing the rug over her. She meant to listen for the others
to come, but she was too tired. She fell fast asleep!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
was prowling about down below. He was careful because he didn’t want to run
into the old woman’s son. He didn’t like the sound of him somehow! He came to a
small barn with piles of straw in one corner. He flashed his torch cautiously
round.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
will do for me,’ he thought. ‘I can be quite comfortable here in that straw.
Poor Anne! I wish old George was with her. I’d better wait about and watch for
the other two, or I’ll fall asleep and miss them, once I bed down in that
straw! It’s only about six o’clock too - but we’ve had a long day. I wonder how
Timmy is. I wish he was here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
thought that probably George and Julian would come in through the same gate as
he and Anne had used. He found a broken-down shed near the gate and sat down on
a box there, waiting for them to come.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
ate his sandwiches while he waited. They were very comforting! He ate every one
and then the cake. He yawned. He felt very sleepy indeed, and his feet were wet
and tired.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>No
one arrived at all - not even the old woman’s son. She could still be seen
sewing under the lamp. But after about two hours, when it was almost eight
o’clock, and Dick was beginning to be very worried about George and Julian, the
old woman got up and put away her work-basket.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
disappeared out of Dick’s sight, and didn’t come back But the light was still
there, shining out of the window. Left for her son, probably, thought Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
tiptoed to the window. The rain had stopped now and the night was much clearer.
The stars were out and a moon was coming up. Dick’s spirits rose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
peered in at the lighted room. Then he saw the old woman lying on a broken-down
sofa in a corner. A blanket was pulled right up to her chin and she seemed to
be asleep. Dick went back to his shed, but now he felt there was no use in
watching for George and Julian. They must have lost their way completely! Or else
Mr. Gaston, or whatever his name was, must have had to do something to Timmy’s
leg, and Julian had decided to stay at the inn in Beacons Village for the
night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
yawned again. ‘I’m too sleepy to watch any more,’ he decided ‘I shall fall off
this box with sleep if I don’t go and lie down in that straw. Anyway I think
I’d hear if the others came.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Using
his torch cautiously again, he made his way to the barn. He shut the door
behind him and bolted it roughly from the inside by running a stick through two
hasps. He didn’t know why he did that - perhaps because he was still thinking
of the old woman’s bad-tempered son!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
flung himself down on the straw, and immediately fell asleep. Outside the sky
became clearer and clearer. The moon came up, not fully, but large enough to
give some light. It shone down on the desolate little stone house and ill-kept
out-buildings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
slept soundly. He lay in the soft straw and dreamed of Timmy and George and
Blue Ponds and bells. Especially bells.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
awoke suddenly, and lay for a moment wondering where he was. What was this
prickly stuff round him? Then he remembered - of course, it was straw and he
was in a barn! He was about to cuddle down again when he heard a noise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>lt
was only a small noise - a scratching on the wooden walls of the barn perhaps.
Dick sat up. Were there rats there? He hoped not!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
listened. The scratching seemed to come from outside the barn, not inside. Then
it stopped. After an interval it began again. Then there came a gentle tapping
at the broken window just above Dick’s head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
felt very startled. Rats scratched and scrabbled about - but they didn’t tap on
windows. Who was tapping so very very cautiously on the little window? He held
his breath and listened, straining his ears.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then he heard a voice - a hoarse whisper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dick!
Dick!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
was amazed. Could it be Julian? If so, how in the world did he know that he,
Dick, was in the barn? He sat listening, stiff with surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
tapping came again, and then the voice, a little louder. ‘Dick! I know you’re
there. I saw you go in. Come here to the window - quiet, now!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
didn’t know the voice. It wasn’t Julian’s, and it certainly wasn’t either
George’s or Anne’s. Then how did the owner know his name and that he was there?
It was astounding. Dick didn’t know what to do!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Buck
up!’ said the voice. ‘I’ve got to go in half a tick. I’ve got that message for
you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
decided to go nearer to the window. He was quite certain that he didn’t want
whoever it was outside to come into the barn. He cautiously knelt up in the
straw and spoke just underneath the window.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
here,’ he said, trying to make his voice deep and grown-up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’ve
been long enough coming,’ grumbled the one outside, and then Dick saw him
through the window - just a face, dim and wild-eyed, with a round bullet-like
head. He crouched back, thankful that the face couldn’t see him in the darkness
of the barn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here’s
the message from Nailer,’ said the voice. ‘Two-Trees. Gloomy Water. Saucy Jane.
And he says Maggie knows. He sent you this. Maggie’s got one too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
bit of paper fluttered in at the broken pane. Dick picked it up in a daze. What
was all this? Was he dreaming?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
voice came again, insistent and urgent. ‘You heard all that, Dick? Two-Trees.
Gloomy Water. Saucy Jane. And Maggie knows too. Now I’m going.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
came the sound of someone cautiously creeping round the barn - and then there
was silence. Dick sat amazed and bewildered. Who was this wild-eyed fellow, who
called him by his name in the middle of the night and gave him extraordinary
messages that meant nothing at all to a sleepy boy? But Dick was wide awake
now. He stood up and looked out of the window. There was nothing and no one to
be seen except the lonely house and the sky.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
sat down again and thought. He put his torch on cautiously and looked at the
piece of paper he had picked up. It was a dirty half sheet, with pencil marks
on it that meant nothing to Dick at all. Words were printed here and there, but
they were all nonsense to him. He simply couldn’t make head or tail of his
visitor, his message or the bit of paper!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
sure I must be dreaming,’ thought Dick, and put the paper into his pocket. He
lay back in his straw, cuddling in deep, because he had got cold by the window.
He lay and thought for a while, puzzling over the curious happenings, and then
he felt his eyes closing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
before he was quite asleep, he heard cautious footsteps again! Was that fellow
back once more? This time someone tried the door - but the wooden stick was in
the hasps. Whoever it was outside shook the door and the stick fell out at
once. The man shook the door again as if thinking it had stuck, and then opened
it. He came inside and shut the door behind him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
caught a quick glimpse of him. No - this wasn’t the same man as before. This
was a man with a head of thick hair, Dick hoped and prayed that he wouldn’t
come over to the straw.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
didn’t. He sat down on a sack and waited. He talked to himself after a while,
but Dick could only make out a word or two.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
happened?’ he heard. ‘How much longer do I wait?’ Then there was a mumble and
Dick could not catch a word.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wait,
wait - that’s all I do,’ muttered the man, and he stood up and stretched
himself. Then he went to the door and looked out. He came back and sat down on
the sack again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
sat still and quiet then, and Dick found his eyes closing once more. Was this
part of a dream too? He didn’t have time to think it out because he was
suddenly in a real dream, walking along ringing bells and seeing trees in twos
everywhere round him!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
slept heavily all night long. When morning came he awoke suddenly and sat up.
He was alone in the barn. Where had the second visitor gone? Or could it all
have been a dream?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
stood up and stretched himself. He felt dirty and untidy. Also he was very
hungry. He wondered if the old woman would let him buy some bread and cheese
and a glass of milk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Anne
must be hungry too,’ he thought ‘I wonder if she’s all right.’ He went cautiously
outside and looked up at the tiny window of the loft where Anne had spent the
night. Her anxious face was already there, watching for Dick!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Are
you all right, Anne?’ called Dick, in a low tone. She pushed open the tiny
window and smiled at him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
But I daren’t go down because that son is downstairs. I can hear him shouting
at the deaf old woman every now and again. He sounds very bad-tempered.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
wait for him to go out to his work then, before I go and see the old woman,’
said Dick. ‘I must pay her something for letting you sleep up in that loft -
and perhaps I can persuade her to let us have something to eat.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wish you could,’ said Anne. ‘I’ve eaten all the chocolate I had in my bag.
Shall I wait till I hear you call me?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
nodded and disappeared into the barn in a hurry. He had heard footsteps!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
man came into sight - a broad, short, hunched-up man, with a shock of untidy
hair. He was the man that Dick had seen in the barn the night before. He was
muttering to himself and looked very bad-tempered indeed. Dick decided to keep
out of his way. He crouched down in the barn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the man did not go in there. He walked past, still muttering. Dick listened for
his footsteps to die away. He heard the opening of a gate somewhere, then it
crashed behind the man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I’d
better take my chance now,’ thought Dick, and he went quickly out of the barn
and up to the little white house. It looked very tumble-down and neglected in
the daylight, and had a most forlorn air.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
knew that it was no good knocking, because the old woman wouldn’t hear him. So
he walked right into the house and found the woman washing up a few dishes in a
cracked old sink. She stared at him in dismay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I’d
forgotten about you! And the girl too! Is she still up there? Get her down
quickly before my son comes back! And then go, both of you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Can
you sell us some bread and cheese?’ shouted Dick But the old woman really was
stone deaf, and all she did was to push Dick away towards the door, jabbing at
him with the wet cloth in her hand. Dick slipped aside and pointed to some
bread on a table,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
no - I tell you, you’re to go,’ said the old woman, obviously terrified in case
her son should come back ‘Get the girl, quickly!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
before Dick could do anything, there were footsteps outside and in came the
hunched-up fellow with the shock of hair! He was back already, holding some
eggs he had been to find.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
walked into the kitchen and stared at Dick. ‘Clear out!’ he said, angrily.
‘What do you want here?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
thought he had better not say he had slept the night in the barn. There were
queer goings-on here, and the man might be very savage if he knew Dick had
slept the night nearby.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wanted to know if your mother could sell us some bread,’ he said, and could
have bitten his tongue out. He had said ‘us’!’ Now the man would guess there
was someone with him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Us?
Who’s “us”?’ said the man, looking round. ‘You fetch him and I’ll tell you both
what I do to boys who come stealing my eggs!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
go and fetch him,’ said Dick, seizing the chance to get away. He ran to the
door. The man made a clumsy dart at him and almost caught him. But Dick was out
and away, running down the path. He hid behind a shed, his heart thumping. He
had to wait for Anne. Somehow he had to go back and get her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
man stood at the door, shouting angrily after Dick. But he didn’t chase him. He
went back into the house and after a while came out again with a pail of
steaming food. Dick guessed he was going to feed the chickens wherever they
were.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
had to take this chance of fetching Anne. He waited till he heard the crash of
the distant gate again and then he rushed to the house. Anne’s face was at the
window, scared. She had heard all that the man had said to Dick, and then to
his mother about allowing boys to come to the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Anne!
Come down at once. He’s gone,’ shouted Dick. ‘Hurry!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne’s
face disappeared from the window, She ran to the door, tumbled quickly down the
stairs, and ran through the kitchen. The old woman flapped a cloth at her,
screaming at her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
ran into the kitchen and put twenty pence on the table. Then he caught Anne’s
arm and both children tore out of the house and down the path. They came to the
hedge they had followed the night before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
was quite scared. ‘That awful man!’ she said. ‘Oh Dick - what a horrible place.
Honestly I think Julian must be mad to choose a place like that to sleep in for
the night - horrible little house! And it didn’t look a bit like a farm. There
were no cows or pigs that I could see and not even a farm-dog!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
know, Anne, I don’t think it could possibly have been Blue Pond Farm-house,’
said Dick, as they walked beside the hedge, looking for the gate that they had
come through the night before. ‘We made a mistake. It was an ordinary cottage. If
we hadn’t lost our way we’d have come to the proper Blue Pond Farm-house I’m
sure.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Whatever
will George and Julian be thinking?’ said Anne. ‘They’ll be dreadfully worried,
won’t they, wondering what has become of us. Do you suppose they’re at the real
Blue Pond Farm-house?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
have to find out,’ said Dick ‘Do I look very messy and untidy, Anne? I feel
awful.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
Haven’t you a comb?’ said Anne. ‘Your hair’s all up on end. And your face is
very dirty. Look, there’s a little stream over there. Let’s get our flannels
out and wash our hands and faces with them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
did a little washing in the cold water of the stream, and Dick combed back his
hair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
look a lot better,’ said Anne, ‘Oh dear - I wish we could have some breakfast.
I’m really starving! I didn’t sleep awfully well, did you, Dick? My mattress
was so hard, and I was rather scared, up in that funny little room all alone.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before
Dick could answer, a boy came whistling through the gate. He looked astonished
to see Dick and Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo!’
he said. ‘You hiking?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Dick. ‘Can you tell me if that place up there is Blue Pond Farm-house?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
pointed back to the old woman’s house. The boy laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
no farm-house. That’s Mrs. Taggart’s place, and a dirty old place it is. Don’t
you go there, or her son will drive you off. Dirty Dick we call him - he’s a
terror! Blue Pond Farm-house is down along there, see? Past the Three Shepherds
Inn and away up to the left.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thanks,’
said Dick, feeling very angry indeed with the man who had said ‘ar’ and sent
them all wrong the day before. The boy waved, and set off across a moorland
path.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
certainly went the wrong way last night,’ said Dick, as they walked over the
fields they had crossed in the dark the night before. ‘Poor Anne! Dragging you
all that way in the dark and the rain to a horrible place that wasn’t Blue Pond
Farm-house after all. I can’t think what Julian is going to say to me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
it was my fault too,’ said Anne. ‘Dick, let’s go down to the Three Shepherds
and telephone Blue Pond Farm-house from there, shall we? If it’s on the phone,
that is. I don’t somehow feel as if I want to walk for miles and perhaps not
find Blue Pond Farmhouse again.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
idea,’ said Dick. ‘The Three Shepherds was where that woman was shaking a
duster out of the window, wasn’t it? She told Julian the way to Spiggy House. I
wonder how old Timmy is. I hope he’s better. I say - this hike isn’t as good as
we hoped it would be, is it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
there’s still time for it to be all right!’ said Anne, much more cheerfully
than she felt. She so badly wanted her breakfast that she felt quite
bad-tempered!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
telephone to Julian from the Three Shepherds to say what happened to us,’ said
Dick, as they came to the lane where they had floundered in the mud the night
before. He helped Anne over the stile and they jumped down to the narrow road.
‘And what’s more, we’ll have breakfast at the Three Shepherds - and I bet we
eat more than ever the Three Shepherds did, whoever they were!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
felt more cheerful at once. She had thought they would have to walk all the way
to find Blue Pond Farm-house before they had breakfast!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘See
- a stream does flow right across the road here,’ she said. ‘No wonder I got my
feet wet yesterday! Come on - the thought of breakfast makes my legs want to
run!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
at last arrived in Beacons Village, and made their way to the inn. On the sign
three shepherds were painted, looking rather gloomy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
look like I feel,’ said Anne, ‘but I shall soon feel different. Oh Dick - think
of porridge - and bacon and eggs - and toast and marmalade!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
must telephone first,’ said Dick, firmly - and then he suddenly stopped, just
as he was going into the inn. Someone was calling him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘DICK!
DICK! ANNE! Look, there they are! Hey, Dick, DICK!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was Julian’s voice! Dick swung round in delight. He saw Julian, George and
Timmy racing along the village street, shouting and waving. Timmy was first to
reach them of course - and there was no sign of limping either! He leapt on
them, barking madly, and licked every bare part of them he could reach.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
Ju! I’m so glad to see you!’ said Anne, in rather a trembling voice. ‘We lost
our way last night. George, is Timmy all right?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Quite,
Absolutely,’ said George. ‘You see...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Have
you had breakfast?’ interrupted Julian. ‘We haven’t. We were so worried about
you we were just going to see the police. But now we can all have breakfast
together and tell our news!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was wonderful to be all together again. Julian took hold of Anne’s arm and
squeezed it. ‘All right, Anne?’ he said, rather worried at her pale face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
nodded. She felt better at once, now she had Julian, George and Timmy, as well
as Dick. ‘I’m only just terribly hungry,’ she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
ask for breakfast straight away,’ said Julian. ‘All news later!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
woman who had leaned out of the window shaking a duster the evening before,
came up to them. ‘I expect it’s a bit late for you,’ said Julian. ‘But we
haven’t had any breakfast. What have you got?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Porridge
and cream,’ said the woman. ‘And our own cured bacon and our own eggs. Our own
honey and the bread I bake myself. Will that do? And coffee with cream?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
could hug you,’ said Julian, beaming at her. The others felt the same. They went
into a small, cosy dining-room and sat down to wait. Soon a smell of frying
bacon and hot strong coffee would come into the room - what joy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Your
news first,’ said Dick, patting Timmy. ‘Did you get to Spiggy House? Was Mr.
Gaston there?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
he wasn’t,’ said Julian. ‘He was out somewhere. He had a very nice wife who
made us wait for him, and said he wouldn’t mind in the least looking at Timmy
when he came back. So we waited and waited,’<span style='mso-tab-count:3'>                             </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
waited till half past seven!’ said George, ‘and we felt rather awkward because
we thought it might be getting near their meal-time. And then at last Mr.
Gaston came.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
was awfully kind,’ said Julian. ‘He looked at Timmy’s leg, and then he did
something, I don’t know what - put it back into place, I suppose - and Timmy
gave a yell and George flung herself on him, and Mr. Gaston roared with
laughter at George...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
he was very rough with Timmy’s leg,’ said George ‘But he knew what he was
doing, of course, and now Timmy is perfectly all right, except for that bruise
on his back, and even that is getting better. He can run as well as ever.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
glad,’ said Anne. ‘I kept thinking of poor old Tim all last night.’ She patted
him, and he licked her lavishly and wetly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
did you do then?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
Mrs. Gaston insisted on us staying to supper,’ said Julian. ‘She simply
wouldn’t take no for an answer, and I must say that by that time we were jolly
hungry. So we stayed - and we had a jolly good meal too. So did Timmy! You
should have seen his tummy afterwards - as round as a barrel. Good thing it’s
gone down today or I was thinking of changing his name to Tummy.’ They all
laughed, George especially.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Idiot,’
she said. ‘Well, we didn’t leave till about nine o’clock. We didn’t worry about
you because we felt sure you would be safely at Blue Pond Farm-house and would
guess we’d had to wait about with Timmy. And when we got there and found you
hadn’t arrived - well, we were in a state!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
then we thought you must have found somewhere else for the night,’ said Julian,
‘but we thought if we heard nothing we’d go down to the police first thing this
morning and report your disappearance!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
down we came - without any breakfast either!’ said George. ‘That shows how
worried we were! Blue Pond Farm-house was nice. They gave us a bed each in two
tiny little rooms, and Timmy slept with me, of course ’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
wonderful smell came creeping into the little dining-room, followed by the
inn-woman carrying a large tray. On it was a steaming tureen of porridge, a bowl
of golden syrup, a jug of very thick cream, and a dish of bacon and eggs, all
piled high on crisp brown toast. Little mushrooms were on the same dish.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
like magic!’ said Anne, staring ‘Just the very things I longed for!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Toast,
marmalade and butter to come, and the coffee and hot milk,’ said the woman,
busily setting everything out. ‘And if you want any more bacon and eggs, just
ring the bell.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Too
good to be true!’ said Dick, looking at the table. ‘For goodness’ sake, help
yourselves quickly, girls, or I shall forget my manners and grab.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was a wonderful breakfast - extra wonderful because they were all so ravenously
hungry. There wasn’t a word said as they spooned up their porridge and cream,
sweetened with golden syrup. Timmy had a dishful too - he loved porridge,
though he didn’t like the syrup - it made his whiskers sticky!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
feel better,’ said Anne, looking at the porridge dish. ‘The thing is - shall I
have some more porridge and risk not enjoying my bacon and eggs so much - or
shall I go straight on with bacon and eggs?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
difficult question,’ said Dick. ‘And one that I am faced with too. On the whole
I think I’ll go on with bacon and eggs - we can always have more of those if we
want to - and those little mushrooms really do make my mouth water! Aren’t we
greedy? But how can anyone help that when they’re so hungry?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
haven’t told us a single word of what happened to you last night,’ said Julian,
serving out the bacon and eggs with a generous hand. ‘Now that you’ve got
something inside you, perhaps you feel able to tell us exactly why you ignored
my instructions and didn’t arrive where you were supposed to last night.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
sound like our headmaster at school!’ said Dick. ‘The plain fact is - we got
lost! And when we did finally arrive somewhere, we thought it was Blue Pond
Farm-house, and we stayed the night there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
see,’ said Julian, ‘But didn’t the people there tell you it wasn’t the right
place? Just so that you could have let us know? You must have known that we
would worry about you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
the old woman there was stone-deaf,’ explained Anne, attacking her bacon and
eggs vigorously. ‘She didn’t understand a word we said, and as we thought it
was Blue Pond Farm-house, we stayed there - though it was a horrible place. And
we were worried because you didn’t arrive!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
chapter of accidents,’ said Julian. ‘All’s well that ends well, however.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
sound so pompous!’ said Dick. ‘Actually we had a pretty poor time, Ju. Poor
Anne had to sleep in a little loft, and I slept in straw in a barn - not that I
minded that - but - well, peculiar things happened in the night. At least - I
think they did. I’m not really sure it wasn’t all a dream.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
peculiar things?’ asked Julian at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- I think perhaps I’ll tell you when we’re on our way again,’ said Dick. ‘Now I
think about it in full daylight I feel that either it was all a silly dream -
or - well, as I said - something very peculiar.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
never told me, Dick!’ said Anne, in surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
to tell you the truth I forgot about it because other things happened,’ said
Dick. ‘Having to get away from that man, for instance - and wondering about
Julian and George - and feeling so hungry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
don’t sound as if you had a good night at all,’ said George. ‘It must have been
awful, too, trying to find your way in the dark. It poured with rain, didn’t
it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Anne, ‘but oh - the thing that frightened me more than anything was the
bells! Did you hear them Julian? They suddenly clanged out, and they made me
terribly scared. I couldn’t think what they were! Whatever were they ringing
out for? They were so loud.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Didn’t
you know what they were ringing for?’ said Julian. ‘They were bells rung from
the prison that nice old woman told us about - they were rung to tell everyone
on the countryside that a prisoner had escaped! Lock your doors. Guard your
folk.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
stared at Julian in silence. So that was why the bells had made such a clamour
and clangour. She shivered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
glad I didn’t know that,’ she said. ‘I would have slept in the straw with Dick
if I’d known there was an escaped prisoner. Have they caught him?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know,’ said Julian. ‘We’ll ask the inn-woman when she comes.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
asked her, and she shook her head. ‘No. He’s not caught yet. But he will be. All
the roads from the moor are guarded and everyone is on the watch. He was a
robber who broke into houses and attacked anyone who tried to prevent him. A
dangerous fellow.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian
- is it all right to go hiking on the moors if there’s an escaped prisoner
about?’ said Anne. ‘I shan’t feel very comfortable.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ve
got Timmy,’ said Julian. ‘He would be strong enough to protect us from three
prisoners if necessary! You needn’t worry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
agreed Timmy, at once, and thumped his tail on the floor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
last everyone had finished breakfast. Even starving Anne couldn’t manage the
last bit of toast. She sighed happily, ‘I feel myself again,’ she announced. ‘I
can’t say I feel very much like walking - but I know it would be good for me
after that enormous meal.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
or not, we’re going on our way,’ said Julian, getting up. ‘I’ll buy some
sandwiches first.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
inn-woman was delighted with their hearty praises. She gave them some packets
of sandwiches and waved good-bye. ‘You come again whenever you can,’ she said.
‘I’ll always have something nice for you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four went down the street and took a lane at the bottom. It wound about for a
short way and then came into a valley. A stream ran down the middle of the
valley. The children could hear it gurgling from where they stood.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Lovely!’
said Anne. ‘Are we going along by the stream? I’d like to.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
looked at his map. ‘Yes - we could,’ he said. ‘I’ve marked the path to follow,
and the stream joins it some way on. So if you like we could go along by it,
though it will be very rough walking.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
made their way to the stream. ‘Now Dick,’ said Julian, when they had left the
path. ‘What about telling us all those peculiar things that happened in the
night? There’s nobody about to hear - not a soul in sight. Let’s hear
everything. We’ll soon tell you whether it was a dream or not.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Dick, ‘Well, here’s the tale. It does sound pretty queer. Listen...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
began his tale - but it really was very difficult to hear it because they
couldn’t walk four abreast, as there was no path to follow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the end Julian stopped and pointed to a thick clump of heather. ‘Let’s go and
sit there and hear Dick’s story properly. I keep missing bits. No one can hear us
if we sit here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
sat down and Dick started again. He told about the old woman who was afraid her
son would be angry if she let them stay the night. He told about his bed in the
straw.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
now here comes the bit I think must have been a dream,’ he said. ‘I woke up to
hear a scratching noise on the wooden walls of the barn...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Rats
or mice?’ said George, and Timmy leapt up at once, of course. He was sure she
had said the words to him!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
thought that too,’ said Dick. ‘But then I heard a gentle tap-tap-tapping on the
window.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
horrid,’ said Anne. ‘I shouldn’t have liked that at all.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Neither
did I,’ said Dick, ‘But the next thing I heard was my name being called! “Dick!
Dick!” Just like that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
must have been a dream then,’ said Anne. 'There was no one there who knew your
name.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
went on. ‘Well, then the voice said - “Dick! I know you’re there, I saw you go
in!” And it told me to go to the window,’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Go
on,’ said Julian. He was puzzled. No one in the world but Anne could have known
that Dick was in the barn - and it certainly wasn’t Anne out there in the
night!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I went to the window,’ said Dick, ‘and I saw, rather dimly, of course, a
wild-eyed looking fellow, He couldn’t see me in the darkness of the barn. I
just mumbled, “I’m here,” hoping he would think I was whoever he wanted.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
did he say next?’ asked George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
said something that sounded stuff and nonsense,’ said Dick, ‘He said it twice.
It was “Two-Trees. Gloomy Water. Saucy Jane.” And he said “Maggie knows.” Just
like that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a silence. Then George laughed. ‘Two-Trees! Gloomy Water! Saucy Jane - and
Maggie knows about it! Well, it must have been a dream, Dick! You know it must.
What do you think, Julian?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- it does sound a bit nonsensical to have someone come in the middle of the
night and call Dick by name and give him a strange message that doesn’t mean a
thing to him!’ said Julian. ‘It sounds more dream-like than real. I’d say it
was a dream too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
began to think they were right - and then a sudden thought struck him. He sat
up straight. ‘Wait a bit!’ he said ‘I’ve remembered something! The man slipped
a bit of paper through the broken pane of the window, and I picked it up!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah
- that’s different,’ said Julian. ‘Now - if you can’t find that paper, it’s all
a dream and you dreamt the paper too - but if you can fmd it, well the whole
thing is true. Very peculiar indeed - but true.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
searched quickly in his pockets, He felt paper in one of them, and drew it out.
It was a dirty, crumpled piece, with a few words on it and a few lines. He held
it out to the others in silence, his eyes shining.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
this the paper?’ asked Julian. ‘My word - so you didn’t dream it after all,
then!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
took the paper. Four heads bent over it to examine it. No, five - because Timmy
wanted to see what they were all so interested in, He thrust his hairy head
between Julian’s and Dick’s.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can’t make any sense of this paper,’ said Julian, ‘It’s a plan of some kind, I
think - but what of, or where, it’s impossible to know.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
fellow said that Maggie had one of these bits of paper too,’ said Dick,
remembering.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who
in the wide world is Maggie?’ said George, ‘And why should Maggie know?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Any
more to tell?’ asked Julian, intensely interested now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- the son of the deaf old woman came into the barn later on,’ said Dick. ‘And
he sat and waited and waited, and muttered and muttered - and then when I woke
up he wasn’t there. So I thought I must have dreamt him too. He didn’t see me,
of course.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
pursed up his lips and frowned. Then Anne spoke excitedly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dick!
Ju! I think I know why the second man came into the barn. It was the second man
that the wild-eyed man wanted to give the message to, and the bit of paper -
not to Dick. He didn’t want Dick. But he had seen him creep into the barn, and
I suppose he thought Dick was the man he really wanted and that he was in the
barn waiting for him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
all very well - but how did he know my name?’ asked Dick,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
didn’t know it! He didn’t know it was you at all!’ said Anne, excitedly. ‘The
other man’s name must have been Dick too! Don’t you see? They must have planned
to meet there, the wild-eyed man and the old woman’s son - and the first man
saw Dick go in, so he waited a bit and then went and tapped on the window! And
when he called “Dick! Dick!” of course Dick thought it was he that he wanted,
and he took the message and everything! And then the other man, the real Dick
came along - and was too late to meet the first one. Our Dick had met him and
got the message!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
was quite breathless after this long speech. She sat and stared at the others
eagerly. Didn’t they think she was right?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
did, of course. Julian clapped her on the back. ‘Well worked out, Anne! Of
course that’s what happened.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
suddenly remembered the boy they had met on the way down from the old woman’s
cottage to Beacons Village - the whistling boy. What had he said about the old
woman and her son?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Anne
- what did that whistling boy say? Wait a bit - he said that was Mrs. Taggart’s
place - and he said we’d better not go there or her son would drive us off. And
he said - yes, I remember now - he said “Dirty Dick we call him - he’s a
terror!” Dirty Dick! His name must be Dick then! Why didn’t I think of it
before?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
proves that Anne is right,’ said Julian, pleased. Anne looked pleased too. It
wasn’t often that she thought of something clever before the others did!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all sat thinking. ‘Would this have anything to do with the escaped prisoner?’
said George at last.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
might,’ said Julian. ‘He might have been the prisoner himself, that fellow who
came with the message. Did he say who the message was from?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Dick, trying to remember, ‘He said it was from Nailer. I think that was
the name - but it was all given in whispers, you know.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
message from Nailer,’ said Julian. ‘Well - perhaps Nailer is in prison - a
friend of the man who escaped. And maybe when he knew this fellow was going to
make a dash for it, he gave him a message for someone - the man at that old
cottage, son of the old woman. They may have had a prearranged plan.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
do you mean?’ asked Dick, looking puzzled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- the old woman’s son, Dirty Dick, may have known that when the bells rang out,
this fellow was making a run for it - and would come to bring him a message. He
was to wait in the barn at night if the bells rang, just in case it was
Nailer’s friend who had escaped.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
I see,’ said Dick ‘I think you’re right. Yes, I’m sure you are. My word, I’m
glad I didn’t know that fellow at the window was an escaped convict!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
you’ve got the message from Nailer!’ said Anne. ‘What a peculiar thing! Just
because we lost our way and went to the wrong place, you get a message from a
prisoner given you by one who’s escaped! It’s a pity we don’t know what the
message means - or the paper either.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Had
we better tell the police?’ said George. ‘I mean - it may be important. It
might help them to catch that man.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Julian. ‘I think we should tell the police. Let’s have a look at our map.
Where’s the next village?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
looked at the map for a minute. ‘I think really we might as well go on with
what I had planned,’ he said. ‘I planned we should reach this village here -
Reebles, look - in time for lunch, in case we hadn’t got sandwiches. We’d have
gone there for drinks anyway. So I vote we just carry on with our ramble, and
call in at Reebles police station - if there is one - and tell them our bit of
news.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all got up. Timmy was glad. He didn’t approve of this long sit-down so soon after
breakfast. He bounded ahead in delight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘His
leg’s quite all right,’ said Anne, pleased. ‘Well I hope it teaches him not to
go down rabbit holes again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
didn’t, of course. He had his head down half a dozen within the next half-hour,
but fortunately he could get no farther, and he was able to pull himself out
quite easily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four saw little wild ponies that day. They came trotting over a hillock
together, small and brown, with long manes and tails, looking very busy indeed.
The children stopped in delight. The ponies saw them, tossed their pretty
heads, turned one way all together and galloped off like the wind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
wanted to go after them, but George held his collar tightly. No one must chase
those dear little wild ponies!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Lovely!’
said Anne. ‘Lovely to meet them as suddenly as that. I hope we meet some more.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
morning was as warm and sunny as the day before. Once again the four of them
had to take off their blazers, and Timmy’s tongue hung out, wet and dripping.
The heather and wiry grass was soft underfoot. They followed the stream
closely, liking its brown colour and its soft gurgling voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
bathed their hot feet in it as they ate one of their sandwiches at half past
eleven. ‘This is bliss!’ said George, lying back on a tuft of heather with her
feet lapped by the water. ‘The stream is tickling my feet, and the sun is
warming my face - lovely! Oh, get away, Timmy, you idiot! Breathing down my
neck like that, and making my face so wet!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
stream at last joined the path that led to the village of Reebles. They walked
along it, beginning to think of dinner. It would be fun to have it in a little
inn or perhaps a farm-house, and keep their sandwiches for tea-time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
first we must find the police-station,’ said Julian. ‘We’ll get our tale told,
and then we’ll be ready for our meal!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a police-station at Reebles, a small one with a house for the policeman
attached. As the one policeman had four villages under his control he felt
himself to be rather an important fellow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was in his house having his dinner when the children walked up to the
police-station. They found nobody there, and walked out again. The policeman
had seen them from his window and he came out, wiping his mouth. He wasn’t very
pleased at having to come out in the middle of a nice meal of sausage and
onions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
do you want?’ he said, suspiciously. He didn’t like children of any sort. Nasty
little things, he thought them - always full of mischief and cheek. He didn’t
know which were worse, the small ones or the big ones!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
spoke to him politely. ‘We’ve come to report something rather strange, which we
thought perhaps the police ought to know. It might help them to catch the
prisoner who escaped last night.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ha!’
said the policeman scornfully. ‘You’ve seen him too, I suppose? You wouldn’t
believe how many people have seen him. ’Cording to them he’s been in every part
of the moor at one and the same time. Clever fellow he must be to split himself
up like that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Well,
one of us saw him last night,’ said Julian politely. ‘At least, we think it
must have been him. He gave a message to my brother here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ho,
he did, did he?’ said the policeman, eyeing Dick in a most disbelieving manner.
‘So he runs about giving messages to school-boys, does he? And what message did
he give you, may I ask?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
message sounded extremely silly when Dick repeated it to the police.
‘Two-Trees. Gloomy Water, Saucy Jane. And Maggie knows.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Really?’
said the policeman, in a sarcastic voice. ‘Maggie knows as well, does she?
Well, you tell Maggie to come along here and tell me too. I’d like to meet
Maggie - specially if she’s a friend of yours.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She’s
not,’ said Dick feeling annoyed. ‘That was in the message. I don’t know who
Maggie is! How should I? We thought perhaps the police could unravel the
meaning. We couldn’t. The fellow gave me this bit of paper too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
handed the piece of dirty paper to the policeman, who looked at it with a
crooked smile ‘So he gave you this too, did he?’ he said. ‘Now wasn’t that kind
of him? And what do you suppose all this is, scribbled on the paper?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
don’t know,’ said Dick. ‘But we thought our report might help the police to
catch the prisoner, that’s all.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
prisoner’s caught,’ said the policeman, with a smirk on his face. ‘You know so
much - but you didn’t know that! Yes, he’s caught - four hours ago - and he’s
safe back in prison now And let me tell you youngsters this - I’m not taken in
by any silly schoolboy spoofing, see?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
not spoofing,’ said Julian, in a very grown-up manner, ‘You should learn to see
the difference between the truth and a joke.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
didn’t please the policeman at all. He turned on Julian at once, his face
reddening<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
you run away!’ he said. ‘I’m not having any cheek from you! Do you want me to
take your names and addresses and report you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
you like,’ said Julian, in disgust. ‘Have you got a notebook there? I’ll give
you all our names, and I myself will make a report to the police in our district
when I get back.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
policeman stared at him. He couldn’t help being impressed by Julian’s manner,
and he calmed down a little.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
go away, all of you,’ he said, his voice not nearly so fierce. ‘I shan’t report
you this time. But don’t you go spreading silly stories like that or you’ll get
into trouble. Serious trouble too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t think so,’ said Julian. ‘Anyway, seeing that you are not going to do
anything about our story, may we have back our bit of paper, please?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
policeman frowned. He made as if he would tear the paper up, but Dick snatched
at it. He was too late. The aggravating policeman had torn it into four pieces
and thrown it into the road!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
you have laws against scattering litter in your village?’ asked Dick, severely,
and carefully picked up the four pieces of paper. The policeman glared at Dick
as he put the bits into his pocket. Then he made a peculiar snorting noise,
turned on his heel and marched back to his sausages and onions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
I hope his dinner’s gone cold!’ said George. ‘Horrid fellow! Why should he
think we’re telling a lot of untruths?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
is rather a queer story of ours,’ said Julian, ‘After all - we found it a bit
dificult to believe when Dick first told it. I don’t blame the policeman for
disbelieving it - I blame him for his manner. It’s a good thing most of our
police aren’t the same. Nobody would ever report anything.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
told us one bit of good news, anyway,’ said Anne. ‘That escaped prisoner is
back in prison again! I’m so relieved to know that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
am too,’ said Dick. ‘I didn’t like the look of him at all. Well, Ju - what do
we do now? Forget the whole business? Do you think there’s anything in that
message to follow up? And if so - can we do anything?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know,’ said Julian. ‘We must think a bit. Let’s go and see if we can
scrounge a meal in some farm-house somewhere. There seem to be plenty around.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
asked a little girl if there was a farm-house anywhere near that would give
them dinner. She nodded and pointed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘See
that farm-house up on the hill there? That’s my Gran’s place. She’ll give you
dinner, I expect. She used to give dinner in the summer to trippers, and I
expect she would give you some too, if you ask her, though it’s late in the
season.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thanks,’
said Julian, and they all went up the lane that curved round the hill-side.
Dogs barked loudly as they came near and Timmy’s hackles went up at once. He
growled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Friends,
Timmy, friends,’ said George. ‘Dinner here, Timmy. Dinner, perhaps a nice bone
for you. Bone!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
understood. The fur down his neck lay flat again and he stopped growling. He
wagged his tail at the two dogs near the farm-gate who sniffed his doggy-smell
suspiciously even when he was some distance away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
man hailed them. ‘What do you kids want? Mind those dogs!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
wondered if we could get a meal here!’ called back Julian. ‘A little girl down
in the village said we might.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
ask my mother,’ said the man, and he yelled in an enormous voice to the
farm-house nearby. ‘Ma! Ma! Four kids out here want to know if you can give
them a meal.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
very fat old lady appeared, with twinkling eyes and red cheeks like an apple.
She took one glance at the four by the gate, and nodded her head, ‘Yes. They
look decent children. Tell them to come along in. Better hold their dog’s
collar though.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four walked to the farm-house, George holding Timmy firmly. The other two dogs
came up, but as Timmy was hoping for a bone, he was determined to be friendly,
and not a single growl came from him, even when the two dogs growled
suspiciously. He wagged his tail, and let his tongue hang out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
other dogs soon wagged theirs, and then it was safe to let Timmy go. He bounded
over to them and there was a mad game of ‘chase-me-roll-me-over’ as George
called it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
your ways in,’ said the plump old lady. ‘Now you’ll have to take what we’ve
got. I’m busy today and haven’t had time for cooking. You can have a bit of
home-made meat-pie, or a slice or two of ham and tongue, or hard-boiled eggs
and salad. Bless you, you look as pleased as Punch! I’ll put the lot on the
table for you and you can help yourselves! Will that do? There’s no vegetables
though. You’ll have to make do with pickled cabbage and my own pickled onions
and beetroot in vinegar.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
sounds too marvellous for words,’ said Julian. ‘We shan’t want any sweet after
that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
no pudding today,’ said the old lady. ‘But I’ll open a bottle or two of our own
raspberries and you can have them with cream if you like. And there’s the cream
cheese I made yesterday too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
tell us any more!’ begged Dick. ‘It makes me feel too hungry. Why is it that
people on farms always have the most delicious food? I mean, surely people in
towns can bottle raspberries and pickle onions and make cream cheese?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
either they can’t or they don’t,’ said George ‘My mother does all those things
- and even when she lived in a town she did. Anyway, I’m going to when I’m
grown-up. It must be so wonderful to offer home-made things by the score when
people come to a meal!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was extraordinary to think that any children could possibly eat the meal the
four did, after having had such a huge breakfast. Timmy ate an enormous dinner
too, and then lay down with a sigh. How he wished he could live at that
farm-house! How lucky those other two dogs were!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
small girl came in shyly as they ate. ‘I'm Meg,’ she said. ‘I live with my
Gran. What are your names?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
told her. Then Julian had an idea, ‘We’re walking over your moor,’ he said.
‘We’ve been to lots of nice places. But there’s one we haven’t been to yet. Do
you know it? It’s called Two- Trees.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
little girl shook her head. ‘Gran would know,’ she said. ‘Gran! Where’s
Two-Trees?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
old lady looked in at the door, ‘What’s that? Two-Trees? Oh, that was a lovely
place once, but it’s all in ruins now. It was built beside a queer dark lake,
in the middle of the moors. Let’s see now - what was it called?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gloomy
Water?’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes!
That’s right. Gloomy Water,’ said the old lady. ‘Are you thinking of going by
there? You be careful then, there’s marshland around there, just when you least
expect it! Now - would you like anything more?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
thank you,’ said Julian, regretfully, and paid the very modest bill. ‘It’s the
nicest lunch we’ve ever had. Now we must be off.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Off
to Two-Trees and Gloomy Water, I hope!’ George whispered to Dick. ‘That would
be really exciting.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

IDEA<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Once
outside the farm-house Julian looked round at the others. ‘We’ll find out how
far Two-Trees is and see if we’ve got time to pay it a visit,’ he said. ‘If we
have, we’ll go along there and snoop round. If we haven’t we’ll go tomorrow.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
can we find out how far it is?’ said Dick eagerly. ‘Will it be on your map?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
may be marked there if the lake is big enough,’ said Julian. They walked down
the hill, and took a path that led once more over the moors. As soon as they
were out of sight and hearing of anyone Julian stopped and took out his big
map. He unfolded it and the four of them crouched over it as he spread it out on
the heather.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
nice old lady said it was in the middle of the moors,’ said Julian. ‘Also we
know there’s a lake or at any rate a big pool of some kind.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
finger traced its way here and there on the map. Then George gave a cry and
dabbed her finger down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There,
look! It’s not really in the middle. See - Gloomy Water! That must be it. Is
Two-Trees marked as well?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said Julian, ‘But perhaps it wouldn’t be if it’s in ruins. Ruins aren’t marked
on maps unless they are important in some way. This can’t be important. Well -
that’s certainly Gloomy Water marked there. What do you say? Shall we have a
shot at going there this afternoon? I wonder exactly how far it is.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
could ask at the post-office,’ said George. ‘Probably once upon a time the
postman had to take letters there. They might know, They could tell us the way
to go.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went back to the village and found the post-office. It was part of the village
store. The old man who kept it looked over the top of his glasses at the
children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gloomy
Water! Now what be you wanting that for? A real miserable place it is, for all
it was so fine years ago.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
happened to it?’ asked Dick,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
was burnt,’ said the old man. ‘The owner was away, and only a couple of
servants were there. It flared up one night, no one knows how or why - and was
burnt almost to a shell. Couldn’t get a fire-engine out there, you see. There
was only a cart-track to the place.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
wasn’t it ever built up again?’ asked Julian. The old man shook his head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
It wasn’t worth it, The owner just let it fall to rack and ruin. The jackdaws
and the owls nest there now, and the wild animals snuggle in the ruins. It’s a
queer place. I once went out to see it, hearing tales of lights being seen
there. But there was nothing to see but the shell of the place, and the dark
blue water. Ah, Gloomy Water’s a good name for that lake!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Could
you tell us the way? And how long would it take us to get there?’ asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
for do you want to go and gaze at a poor old ruin?’ said the old man. ‘Or do
you want to bathe in the lake? Well, don’t you do so - it’s freezing cold!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
just thought we’d go and see Gloomy Water,’ said Julian. ‘Such a strange name.
Which is the way, did you say?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
didn’t say,’ said the old fellow. ‘But I will if so be you’re set on it.
Where’s your map? Is that one in your hand?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
spread it out. The old fellow took a pen from his waistcoat pocket and began to
trace a path over the moor. He put crosses here and there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘See
them crosses? They mark marshland. Don’t go treading there, or you’ll be up to
your knees in muddy water! You follow these paths I’ve inked in for you and
you’ll be all right. Keep your eyes open for deer - there’s plenty about those
parts, and pretty things they are too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thank
you very much,’ said Julian, folding up the map. ‘How long would it take us to
get there from here?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Matter
of two hours or more,’ said the old man. ‘Don’t you try to go this afternoon.
You’ll find yourselves in darkness coming back, and with them dangerous marshy
bits you’re in danger all the time!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Julian. ‘Thanks very much. Er - we’re thinking of doing a bit of camping,
as the weather is so beautiful. I suppose you couldn’t hire us a groundsheet or
two and a few rugs?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
other three stared at him in astonishment. Camping out? Where? Why? What was
Julian thinking of all of a sudden?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
winked at them. The old man was ferreting about in a cupboard. He pulled out
two large rubber ground-sheets and four old rugs. ‘Thought I had them
somewhere!’ he said. ‘Well, better you camping out in October than me! Be
careful you don’t catch your deaths of cold!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
thanks - just what we want,’ said Julian, pleased. ‘Roll them up, you others.
I’ll settle up for them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick,
Anne and George folded up the ground-sheets and the rugs in astonishment.
Surely - surely Julian wasn’t thinking of camping out by Gloomy Water? He must
think the message that Dick had been given was very important!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian!’
said Dick, as soon as they got outside. ‘What’s up? What’s all this for?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
looked a little sheepish. ‘Well - something suddenly came over me in the
store,’ he said. ‘I suddenly felt we ought to go to Gloomy Water and snoop
round. I felt excited somehow. And as we’ve got so little time this week-end I
thought if we took things and camped out in the ruin we might make more of our
few days.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
an idea!’ said George. ‘Not go on with our hiking, do you mean?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,’
said Julian. ‘If we find nothing, we can go on with our hike, of course. But if
there’s anything interesting, it’s up to us to unearth it. I’m quite sure
there’s something up at Two-Trees.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
might meet Maggie there!’ said Anne, with a giggle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
might!’ said Julian. ‘I feel quite free to go and investigate on our own seeing
that we’ve made our report to the police, and it’s been turned down with scorn.
Somebody ought to follow up that message - besides Maggie!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dear
Maggie,’ said Dick. ‘I wonder who in the wide world she is!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Somebody
worth watching if she’s the friend of convicts,’ said Julian, more soberly.
‘Look, this is what I thought we’d do - buy some extra food, and go along to
Gloomy Water this afternoon, arriving there before dark. We’ll find a good
place to shelter in - there must be some good spot in the old ruin - and get
heather or bracken for beds. Then tomorrow we can be up bright and early to
have a look round.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
sounds smashing,’ said Dick, pleased. ‘Sort of thing we like. What do you say,
Tim?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Tim, solemnly, bumping his tail to and fro across Dick’s legs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
if we find there’s absolutely nothing of interest, well, we can come back here
with the things we’ve borrowed, and go on with our hike,’ said Julian. ‘But
we’ll have to sleep the night there because it will be dark by the time we’ve
had a look round.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
bought some loaves of bread, some butter and potted meat, and a big fruit cake.
Also some more chocolate and some biscuits. Julian bought a bottle of orangeade
as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
sure to be a well,’ he said. ‘Or a spring of some sort. We can dilute the
orangeade and drink it when we’re thirsty. Now I think we’re ready. Come on!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
couldn’t go as fast as usual because they were carrying so many things. Timmy
was the only one that ran as fast as ever - but then Timmy carried nothing but
himself!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was a really lovely walk over the moorlands. They climbed fairly high and had
wonderful views all over the autumn country-side. They saw wild ponies again,
in the distance this time, and a little herd of dappled deer, that sped away immediately,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was very careful to take the right paths - the ones traced so carefully on the
map by the old man in the post-office. ‘I expect he knew the way well because
he was once a postman and had to take letters to Two-Trees!’ said Dick, bending
over the map. ‘We’re getting on, Ju - halfway there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sun began to sink low. The children hurried as much as they could because once
the sun had gone darkness would soon come. Fortunately the sky was very clear,
so twilight would be later than it had been the night before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
looks as if the moorland near here gives way soon to a little bit of wooded
country, according to the map,’ said Julian. ‘We’ll look out for clumps of
trees.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
another little stretch of moorland Julian pointed to the right. ‘Look!’ he
said. ‘Trees! Quite a lot - a proper little wood.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
isn’t that water over there?’ said Anne. They stood still and gazed hard. Was
it Gloomy Water? It might be. It looked such a dark blue, They hurried on
eagerly. It didn’t look very far now. Timmy ran ahead, his long tail waving in
the air.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went down a little winding path and joined a cart-track that was very much
overgrown - so overgrown that it hardly looked like a track. ‘This must lead to
Two-Trees,’ said Julian. ‘I wish the sun wasn’t going down so quickly. We’ll
hardly have any time to look round!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
entered a wood. The track wound through it. The trees must have been cleared at
some time to make a road through the wood. And then, quite suddenly, they came
on what had once been the lovely house of Two-Trees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was a desolate ruin, blackened and scorched with fire. The windows had no
glass, the roof had gone, except for a few rafters here and there. Two birds
flew up with a loud cry as the children went near.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Two
Maggies!’ said Anne, with a laugh. They were black and white magpies, their
long tails stretched out behind them. ‘I wonder if they know the message too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
house stood on the edge of the lake. Gloomy Water was indeed a good name for
it. It lay there, smooth and dark, a curious deep blue. No little waves lapped
the edge. It was as still as if it were frozen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t like it,’ said Anne. ‘I don’t like this place at all! I wish we hadn’t
come!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
particularly liked the place. They all stared round and Julian pointed silently
to something. At each end of the house was the great burnt trunk of a big tree.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Those
must be the two trees that gave the place its name,’ said Julian. ‘How horrid
they look now, so stiff and black. Two-Trees and Gloomy Water - all so lonely
and desolate now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sun disappeared and a little chill came on the air. Julian suddenly became very
busy. ‘Come on - we must see if there’s anywhere to shelter at all in this old
ruin!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went to the silent house. The upper floors were all burnt out. The ground floor
was pretty bad too, but Julian thought it might be possible to find a sheltered
corner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
might do,’ he said, coming out of a blackened room and beckoning the others to
him. ‘There is even a mouldy carpet still on the floor! And there’s a big
table. We could sleep under it if it rained - which I don’t think it will do!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
a horrid room!’ said Anne, looking round. ‘I don’t like its smell, either. I
don’t want to sleep here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
find somewhere else then, but be quick about it,’ said Julian. ‘It will soon be
dark. I’m going to collect heather and bracken straight away, before it’s too
dark. Coming, Dick and George?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
three of them went off and came back with vast armfuls of heather and brown
bracken. Anne met them, looking excited.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
found somewhere. Somewhere much better than this horrid room. Come and look.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
took them to what once had been the kitchen. A door lay flat on the floor at
the end of the room, and a stone staivvay led downwards.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
leads down to the cellars,’ said Anne. ‘I came in here and saw that door. It
was locked and I couldn’t open it. Well, I tugged and tugged and the whole door
came off its rusty old hinges and tumbled down almost on top of me! And I saw
there were cellars down there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
stared at Julian beseechingly. ‘They’ll be dry. They won’t be burnt and black
like everywhere else. We’ll be well-sheltered. Can’t we sleep down there? I
don’t like the feel of these horrid burnt rooms.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
an idea,’ said Julian, He switched on his torch and let the beam light up the
cellar below. It seemed spacious and smelt all right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went down the steps, Timmy just in front. He called up in surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
a proper room down here, as well as cellars all round. Maybe it was a kind of
sitting-room for the staff. It’s wired for electricity too - they must have had
their own electricity generator. Yes - we’ll certainly come down here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was a queer little room. Moth-eaten carpets were on the floor, and the
furnishings were moth-eaten too and covered with dust. Spiders had been at work
and George slashed fiercely at the long cobwebs that hung down and startled her
by touching her face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
are still candles in the candle-sticks on this shelf!’ said Dick, surprised.
‘We can light them and have a bit of brightness when it’s dark. This isn’t bad
at all. I must say I agree with Anne. There’s something hateful about those
burnt-out rooms.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
piled heather and bracken into the cellar room on the floor. The furniture was
so old and moth-eaten that it gave beneath their weight, and was useless for
sitting on. The table was all right though, They soon set out their food on it
after George had wiped it free of dust. She caused them all to have fits of
choking because she was so vigorous in her dusting! They were driven up into
the kitchen till the dust had settled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was dark outside now. The moon was not yet up. The wind rustled the dry leaves
left on the trees around, but there was no lap-lap of water. The lake was as
still as glass.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a cupboard in the cellar room. Julian opened it to see what was there.
‘More candles - good!’ he said, bringing out a bundle. ‘And plates and cups.
Did anyone see a well outside? If so we could dilute some orangeade and have a
drink with our supper.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>No
one had noticed a well - but Anne suddenly remembered something queer she had
seen in a corner of the kitchen, near the sink.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
believe I saw a pump up there!’ she said. ‘Go and see, Ju. If so, it might
still work.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went up the cellar-steps with a candle. Yes - Anne was right. That was an old
pump over there in the corner. It probably pumped water into a tank and came
out of the kitchen taps.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
turned on a big tap which was over the large sink. Then he took the handle of
the pump and worked it vigorously up and down. Splash! Splash! Water came
flooding through the big tap and splashed into the sink! That was good.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
pumped and pumped, feeling that he had better get rid of any water running into
the tank for the first time for years. The tank might be dirty or rusty - he
must wash it round with a good deal of pumped water first.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
water seemed to be clean and clear, and was certainly as cold as ice! Julian
held a cup from the cellar cupboard under the tap, and then tasted the water.
It was delicious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
for you, Anne!’ he called, going down the cellar-steps with a cupful of water.
‘Dick, you find some more cups - or a jug or something in that cupboard, and
we’ll wash them out and fill them with water for our orangeade.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
cellar room looked very cheerful as Julian came down the steps. George and Anne
had lighted six more candles, and stuck them about here and there. The light
they gave was very pleasant, and they also warmed the room a little.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I suppose as usual, everyone wants a meal?’ said Julian. ‘Good thing we bought
that bread and potted meat and stuff. I can’t say I’m as hungry as I was at
breakfast, but I’m getting that way.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four squatted round on their beds of heather and bracken. They had put down
their ground-sheets first in case the floor was damp, though it didn’t seem to
be. Over bread and butter and potted meat they discussed their plans. They
would sleep there for the night and then have all the next day to examine
Two-Trees and the lake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
exactly are we looking for?’ asked Anne. ‘Do you suppose there’s some secret
here, Julian?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Julian. ‘And I think I know what it is!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What?’
asked George and Anne, surprised. Dick thought he knew. Julian explained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we know that a prisoner called Nailer sent an important message by his escaped
friend to two people - one he wanted to send to Dirty Dick - but he didn’t get
it - and the other to Maggie, whoever she is. Now what secret does he want to
tell them?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think I can guess,’ said Dick. ‘But go on.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
suppose that Nailer has done some big robberies,’ said Julian. ‘I don’t know
what. Jewellery robberies probably, because they are the commonest with big
criminals. All right - he does a big robbery - he hides the stuff till he hopes
the hue and cry will be over - but he’s caught and put into prison for a number
of years. But he doesn’t tell where the stuff is hidden! He daren’t even write
a letter to tell his friends outside the prison where it is. All his letters
are read before they leave the prison, So what is he to do?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wait
till someone escapes and then give him a message,’ said Dick. ‘And that’s just
what happened, isn’t it, Julian? That round-headed man I saw was the escaped
prisoner, and he was sent to tell Dirty Dick and Maggie where the stolen goods
were hidden - so that they could get them before anyone else did!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I’m sure that’s it,’ said Julian, ‘His friend, the escaped prisoner, probably
wouldn’t understand the message at all - but Dirty Dick and Maggie would,
because they knew all about the robbery. And now Maggie will certainly try to
find out where the stuff is.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we must find it first!’ said George, her eyes gleaming with excitement. ‘We’re
here first, anyway. And tomorrow, as early as possible we’ll begin to snoop
round. What was the next clue in the message, Dick? After Two-Trees and Gloomy
Water.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Saucy
Jane,’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sounds
a silly sort of clue,’ said Anne. ‘Do you suppose Maggie and Jane are both in
the secret?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Saucy
Jane sounds more like a boat to me,’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Of
course!’ said George. ‘A boat! Why not? There’s a lake here, and I imagine that
people don’t build a house beside a lake unless they want to go boating and
bathing and fishing. I bet we shall find a boat called Saucy Jane tomorrow -
and the stolen goods will be inside it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Too
easy!’ said Dick. ‘And not a very clever place either. Anyone could come across
goods hidden in a boat. No - Saucy Jane is a clue, but we shan’t find the stolen
goods in her. And remember, there’s that bit of paper as well It must have
something to do with the hiding-place too, I should think.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
is it?’ asked Julian. ‘That wretched policeman! He tore it up. Have you still
got the pieces, Dick?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course,’ said Dick. He fished in his pocket and brought them out. ‘Four little
pieces! Anyone got some gummed paper?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
had - but George produced a small roll of Elastoplast. Strips were cut and
stuck behind the four portions of paper, Now it was whole again. They all
examined it carefully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
- four lines drawn, meeting in the centre,’ said Julian. ‘At the outer end of
each line there’s a word, so faintly written I can hardly read one of them.
What’s this one? “Tock Hill.” And this next one is “Steeple”. Whatever are the
others?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
made them out at last. ‘ “Chimney,” ’ said Anne. ‘That’s the third.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
“Tall Stone” is the fourth,’ said George. ‘Whatever do they all mean? We shall
never, never find out!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
sleep on it,’ said Julian, cheerfully. ‘It’s wonderful what good ideas come in
the night. It will be a very interesting little problem to solve tomorrow!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
piece of paper was carefully folded and this time Julian took it for safe keeping.
‘I can’t imagine what it means, but it’s clearly important,’ he said. ‘We may
quite suddenly come on something - or think of something - that will give us a
clue to what the words and the lines mean on the paper.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
mustn’t forget that dear Maggie has a copy of the paper too,’ said Dick. ‘She
probably knows better than we do what it all means!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
she does, she will pay a visit to Two-Trees too,’ said Anne ‘We ought to keep a
look-out for her. Should we have to hide if we saw her?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
considered this. ‘No,’ he said, ‘I certainly don’t think we should hide. Maggie
can’t possibly guess that we have had the message from Nailer, and the paper
too, We had better just say we are on a hike and found this place and thought
we would shelter here. All perfectly true.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
we can keep an eye on her, and see what she does if she comes!’ said Dick, with
a grin. ‘Won’t she be annoyed!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She
wouldn’t come alone,’ said Julian, thoughtfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
should think it quite likely that she would come with Dirty Dick! He didn’t get
the message, but she did - and probably part of her message was the statement
that Dirty Dick would know everything too. So she would get in touch with him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- and be surprised that he hadn’t got the message or the paper,’ said George,
‘Still, they’d think that the escaped fellow hadn’t been able to get to Dirty
Dick.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
very complicated,’ said Anne, yawning. ‘I can’t follow any more arguments and
explanations - I’m half asleep. How long are you going to be before you settle
down?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
yawned too. ‘I’m coming now,’ he said. ‘My bed of bracken and heather looks
inviting. It’s not at all cold in here, is it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
only thing I don’t like is the thought of those cellars beyond this little
underground room,’ said Anne. ‘I keep thinking that Maggie and her friends
might be there, waiting to pounce on us when we are asleep.’,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
silly,’ said George, scornfully. ‘Really silly! Do you honestly suppose that
Timmy would lie here quietly if there was anyone in those cellars? You know
jolly well he would be barking his head off!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I know all that,’ said Anne, snuggling down in her heathery bed. ‘It’s just my
imagination. You haven’t got any, George, so you don’t bother about imaginary
fears. I’m not really scared while Timmy is here. But I do think it’s funny the
way we always plunge into something peculiar when we’re together.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Adventures
always do come to some people,’ said Dick. ‘You’ve only got to read the lives
of explorers and see how they simply walk into adventures all the time.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
but I’m not an explorer,’ said Anne. ‘I’m an ordinary person, and I’d be just
as pleased if things didn’t keep happening to me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others laughed, ‘I don’t expect anything much will happen this time,’ said
Julian, comfortingly. ‘We go back to school on Tuesday and that’s not far off.
Not much time for anything to happen!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was wrong of course. Things can happen one after the other in a few minutes!
Still, Anne cuddled down feeling happier. This was better than last night when
she was all alone in that horrid little loft. Now she had all the others with
her, Timmy too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
and George had one big bed between them. They drew their two rugs over
themselves, and put their blazers on top too. Nobody had undressed because
Julian had said that they might be too cold in just their night things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
as usual put himself on George’s feet, She moved them because he was heavy. He
wormed his way up the bed and found a very comfortable place between the knees
of the two girls. He gave a heavy sigh.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
means he’s planning to go to sleep!’ said George. ‘Are you quite comfortable,
Anne?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Anne, sleepily. ‘I like Timmy there. I feel safe!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was blowing out the candles. He left just one burning. Then he got into his bed
of bracken and heather beside Dick. He felt tired too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four slept like logs. Nobody moved except Timmy, who got up once or twice in
the night and sniffed round inquiringly. He had heard a noise in the cellars.
He stood at the closed door that led to the cellars and listened, his head on
one side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
sniffed at the crack. Then he went back to bed, satisfied. It was only a toad!
Timmy knew the smell of toads. If toads liked to crawl about in the night, they
were welcome to!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
second time he awoke he thought he heard something up in the kitchen above. He
padded up the steps, his paws making a click-click-click as he went. He stood
in the kitchen silently, his eyes gleaming like green lamps, as the moon shone
on him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An
animal with a long bushy tail began to slink away outside the house. It was a
fine fox. It had smelt unusual smells near the old ruin - the scent of people
and of a dog, and it had come to find out what was happening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
had slunk into the kitchen and then smelt the strong scent of Timmy in the room
below. As quietly as a cat it had slunk out again - but Timmy had awakened!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
the dog stood watching and waiting - but the fox had gone! Timmy sniffed its
scent and padded to the door. He debated whether to bark and go after the fox.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
scent grew very faint, and Timmy decided not to make a fuss. He padded back to
the steps that led down to the cellar room, and curled up on George’s feet
again. He was very heavy, but George was too tired to wake up and push him off.
Timmy lay with one ear cocked for a while, and then went to sleep again, with
his ear still cocked. He was a good sentinel!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was dark in the cellar when the one candle went out. There was no daylight or
sunshine to wake the children down in that dim little room, and they slept
late.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
woke up first. He found his bed suddenly very hard, and he turned over to find
a comfortable place. The heather and bracken had been flattened with his
weight, and the floor below was very hard indeed! The movement woke him up, and
he lay blinking in the darkness. Where was he?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
remembered at once and sat up. Dick woke too and yawned. ‘Dick! It’s half-past
eight! !’ said Julian, looking at the luminous hands of his wrist-watch. ‘We’ve
slept for hours and hours!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
rolled out of their heathery bed. Timmy leapt off George’s feet and came over
to them, his tail wagging gladly. He had been half-awake for a long time and
was very glad to see Julian and Dick awake too, because he was thirsty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls awoke - and soon there was a great deal of noise and activity going on.
Anne and George washed at the big stone sink, the cold water making them
squeal. Timmy lapped up a big bowlful of water gladly. The boys debated whether
or not to have a splash in the lake. They felt very dirty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
shivered at the thought. ‘Still, I think we ought to,’ he said ‘Come on, Ju!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two boys went down to the lake-side and leapt in. It was icy-cold! They struck
out strongly and came back glowing and shouting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>By
the time they were back the girls had got breakfast in the cellar room. It was
darker than the kitchen, but all of them disliked the look of the burnt,
scorched rooms above. The bread and butter, potted meat, cake and chocolate
went down well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the middle of the meal a sound came echoing into the old house - bells! Anne
stopped eating, and her heart beat fast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
they were not the clanging warning bells she had heard before!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Church
bells,’ said Julian at once, seeing Anne’s sudden look of fright. ‘Lovely sound
I always think!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes,’ said Anne, thankfully. ‘So it is. It’s Sunday and people are going to
church. I’d like to go too, on this lovely sunny October day.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
might walk across the moor to the nearest village if you like,’ said Dick,
looking at his watch, ‘But we should be very late.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was decided that it was much too late. They pushed their plates aside and
planned what to do that day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
first thing, of course, is to see if there’s a boathouse and find out if
there’s a boat called Saucy Jane,’ said Julian. ‘Then we’d better try and puzzle
out what that plan means. We could wander here and there and see if we can find
Tall Stone - and I’ll look at the map to see if Tock Hill is marked. That was
on the plan too, wasn’t it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
boys go and get some more heather and bracken while we clear away and wash up,’
said Anne. ‘That is if you mean us to camp here another night.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I think we will,’ said Julian. ‘I think we may find things rather interesting
here this week-end!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
went out with Dick and they brought in a great deal more bedding. Everyone had
complained that the hard floor came through the amount of heather and bracken
they had used the night before, and poor George was quite stiff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls took the dirty things up to the big sink to wash them. There was nothing
to dry them with but that didn’t matter. They laid them on the old worn
draining board to dry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
wiped their hands on their hankies and then felt ready for exploring round
outside. The boys were ready too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
Timmy bounding here and there they went down to the lake. A path had once led
down to it, with a low wall on each side. But now the wall was broken, moss had
crept everywhere, and the path was choked with tufts of heather and even with
small bushes of gorse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
lake was as still and dark as ever. Some moor-hens chugged across it quickly,
disappearing under the water when they saw the children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now,
what about that boat-house?’ said Dick at last. ‘Is there one - or not?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>WHERE
IS THE ‘SAUCY JANE’?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
walked beside the lake-side as best they could. It was difficult because bushes
and trees grew right down to the edge. It seemed as if there was no boat-house
at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then George came to a little backwater, leading off the lake. ‘Look!’ she
called. ‘Here’s a sort of river running from the lake.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
not a river. It’s only a little backwater,’ said Dick. ‘Now we may find a
boat-house somewhere here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
followed the backwater a little way, and then Julian gave an exclamation.
‘There it is! But it’s so covered up with ivy and brambles that you can hardly
see it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all looked where he pointed. They saw a long low building built right across
the backwater, where it narrowed and came to an end. It was almost impossible
to tell that it was a building, it was so overgrown.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
it!’ said Dick, pleased. ‘Now for the Saucy Jane!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
scrambled through bushes and brambles to get to the entrance of the building.
It had to be entered by the front, which was over the water and completely
open. A broad ledge ran right round the boat-house inside, and the steps that
went up to it from the bank outside were all broken away, completely rotted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Have
to tread warily here,’ said Julian. ‘Let me go first.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
tried the old wooden steps, but they gave way beneath him at once. ‘Hopeless!’
he said. ‘Let’s see if there’s any other way into the boat-house.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
wasn’t - but at one side some of the wooden boards that made the wall of the
boat-house were so rotten that they could be pulled away to make an opening.
The boys pulled them down and then Julian squeezed through the opening into the
dark, musty<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>boat-house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
found himself on the broad ledge that went round the great shed. Below him was
the dark, quiet water with not even a ripple on it. He called to the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
along in! There’s a wooden ledge to stand on here, and it’s hardly rotted at
all. It must be made of better wood.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went through the opening and stood on the ledge, peering down. Their eyes
had to get used to the darkness at first, because the only light came through
the big entrance at the farther end - and that was obscured by big trails of
ivy and other creepers hanging down from roof to water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
are boats here!’ said Dick, excited. ‘Tied up to posts. Look - there’s one just
below us. Let’s hope one of them is the Saucy Jane!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
were three boats. Two of them were half full of water, and their bows were sunk
right down. ‘Must have got holes in them,’ said Julian, peering about. He had
got out his torch and was shining it all round the old boat-house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Oars
were strung along the walls. Dirty, pulpy masses of something lay on the
shelves too - rotted cushions probably. A boat-hook stood in one corner. Ropes
were in coils on a shelf. It was a dreary desolate sight, and Anne didn’t like
the queer echoes of their voices in the damp-smelling, lonely boat-house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
see if any of the boats are called Saucy Jane,’ said Dick. He flashed his torch
on to the nearest one. The name was almost gone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
is it?’ said Dick, trying to decipher the faded letters. ‘Merry something.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Meg!’
said Anne. ‘Merry Meg. Well, she may be a sister of Saucy Jane. What’s the next
boat’s name?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
torch shone steadily on to it. The name there was easier to read. They all read
it at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Cheeky
Charlie!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Brother
to Merry Meg!’ said Dick. ‘Well, all I can say is that these poor old boats
look anything but merry or cheeky.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
sure the last one must be Saucy Jane!’ said Anne, excited. ‘I do hope it is!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went along the broad ledge and tried to read the name on the half-sunk boat
there. ‘It begins with C,’ said George, disappointed. ‘I’m sure it’s C,’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
took out his handkerchief and dipped it in the water, He rubbed at the name to
try and clean it and make it clearer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
could be read then - but it wasn’t Saucy Jane!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Careful
Carrie!’ read the four, mournfully. ‘Blow!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Merry
Meg, Cheerful Charlie, Careful Carrie,’ said Julian. ‘Well, it’s quite obvious
that Saucy Jane belongs to the family of boats here - but where oh where is
she?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sunk
out of sight?’ suggested Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
think so,’ said Julian. ‘The water is pretty shallow in this boat-house - it’s
right at the very end of the little backwater, you see. I think we should be
able to spot a boat sunk to the bottom. We can see the sandy bottom of the
backwater quite clearly by the light of our torches.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Just
to make quite sure they walked carefully all rouncl the broad wooden ledge and
flashed their torches on the water that filled the boat-house. There was no
completely sunken boat there at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
that’s that,’ said Dick. ‘The Saucy Jane is gone. Where? Why? And when?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
flashed their torches round the walls of the boat-house once more. George’s eye
was caught by a large flat wooden thing standing upright on the ledge at one
side of the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
that?’ she said. ‘Oh - a raft, isn’t it? That’s what those paddles are for,
then, that I saw on the shelf above.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went and examined the raft. ‘Yes - and in quite good condition too,’ said
Julian. ‘It would be rather fun to see if it would carry us on the water.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ooooh
yes!’ said Anne, thrilled ‘That would be super. I always like rafts. I’d rather
try that raft than any of those boats.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
there’s only one boat that is possible to use,’ said Julian. ‘The others are
obviously no good - they must have big holes in to sink down like that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hadn’t
we better look into them carefully just to make sure there’s no loot hidden
there?’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
you like,’ said Julian. ‘But I think it’s Saucy Jane that’s got the loot -
otherwise why mention it by name in that message?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
felt that Julian was right. All the same he went to examine the three boats
most methodically. But except for rotted and burst cushions and coils of rope
there was nothing to be seen in the boats at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- where’s the Saucy Jane?’ said Dick, puzzled. ‘All the family are here but
her. Can she be hidden anywhere on the banks of the lake?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'That’s
an idea!’ said Julian, who was trying to shift the big raft. ‘That’s a really
good idea! I think we ought to explore all round the lake and see if we can
find the Saucy Jane hidden anywhere.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
leave the raft for a bit then,’ said George, feeling thrilled at the thought of
possibly finding the Saucy Jane tucked away somewhere, all the loot hidden in
her. ‘Let’s go now!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
made their way round the wooden ledge to the opening they had made in the side
of the boathouse, and jumped down. Timmy leapt down gladly. He hadn’t liked the
dark boat-house at all. He ran into the warm sunshine, wagging his tail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
which side of the lake shall we go first?’ said Anne. ‘The left or the right?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went down to the edge of the silent water and looked to left and right. They
both seemed to be equally thick with bushes!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
going to be difficult to keep close to the edge of the water,’ said Julian.
‘Anyway, we’ll try. The left side looks a bit easier. Come on!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was fairly easy at first to keep close to the water, and examine any tiny creek
or look under over-hanging bushes. But after about a quarter of a mile the
undergrowth became so very thick and grew so close to the water’s edge that it
was quite impossible to force their way through it without completely ruining
their clothes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
give up!’ said Julian at last. ‘I shall have no jersey left in a minute! These
spiteful brambles! My hands are ripped to bits.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- they are spiteful!’ said Anne. ‘I felt that too!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was the only one really enjoying himself. He couldn’t imagine why the four were
scrambling through such thick undergrowth, but as it was just what he liked he
was very pleased. He was disappointed when they decided to give up and go back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shall
we try the right hand side of the lake, do you think?’ said Julian, as they
went back, rather disheartened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
Don’t let’s,’ said Anne. ‘It looks even worse than this side. It’s only waste
of time. I’d rather go out on the raft!’<br clear=all style='page-break-before:
always'>
‘Well - that would surely be a better way of exploring the banks of the lake
than scrambling through prickly bushes, wouldn't it?’ said George. ‘We’d only
need to paddle along slowly and squint into all the little creeks and under
over-hanging trees - it would be easy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course,’ said Dick. ‘We were silly not to think of it before. It would be a
lovely way of spending the afternoon, anyway.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came through the trees and saw the ruined house in the distance. Timmy suddenly
stopped. He gave a low growl, and all the others stopped too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
up, Timmy?’ said George in a low voice, ‘What is it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
growled again. The others cautiously retreated behind bushes and looked
intently towards the house. They could see nothing out of the way. Nobody
seemed to be about. Then what was Timmy growling at?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then a woman came in sight, and with her was a man. They were talking earnestly
together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Maggie!
I bet it’s Maggie!’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
the other is Dirty Dick,’ said Dick. ‘I recognize him - yes - it’s Dirty Dick.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
watched the couple in the distance, and thought quickly. Julian had been
expecting them, so he was not surprised. Dick was looking at Dirty Dick,
recognizing the broad, short man, with his hunched-up shoulders and shock of
hair. He didn’t like the look of him any more than when he had seen him up at
the old cottage!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
and George didn’t like the look of the woman either! She was wearing trousers
and had a jacket draped round her shoulders. She was also wearing sunglasses,
and smoking a cigarette. She walked quickly and they could hear her voice. It
was sharp and determined.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
that’s Maggie,’ thought Julian. ‘Well, I don’t like her. She looks as hard as
nails - a good companion for Nailer!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
moved cautiously towards the other three. George had her hand on Timmy’s
collar, afraid that he might show himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Listen,’
said Julian. ‘You’re none of you to turn a hair! We’ll just walk out into the
open, talking cheerfully together and let them see us. If they ask us what
we’re doing, you all know what to say. Chatter nonsense as much as you like -
put them off and make them think we’re a bunch of harmless kids. If there are
any leading questions asked us - leave me to answer them. Ready?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
nodded. Then Julian swung out from the bushes and walked into the open, calling
to Dick. ‘Here we are again - there’s the old house! My word, it looks worse than
ever this morning!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
and Timmy came bounding out together, and Anne followed, her heart beating
fast. She wasn’t as good as the others at this sort of thing!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
man and the woman stopped abruptly when they saw the children. They said a few
words to one another very rapidly. The man scowled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children went towards them, chattering all the time as Julian had ordered. The
woman called sharply to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who
are you? What are you doing here?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Just
hiking,’ said Julian, stopping. ‘It’s our half-term.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
do you want to come here for then?’ asked the woman. ‘This is private
property.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no,’ said Julian. ‘It’s only a burnout ruin. Anyone can come. We want to
explore this queer lake - it looks exciting.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
man and the woman looked at one another. It was clear that the idea of the
children exploring the lake was surprising and annoying to them. The woman
spoke again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'You
can’t explore this lake. It’s dangerous. People are forbidden to bathe in it or
use a boat.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
weren’t told that,' said Julian, looking astonished. ‘We were told how to get
here, and no one said the lake was forbidden. You’ve been told wrongly.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
want to watch the moor-hens, you see,’ put in Anne, suddenly seeing a moor-hen
on the water. ‘We’re fond of nature.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
we’ve been told there are deer near here,’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
wild ponies,’ said Dick. ‘We saw some yesterday. They were really lovely. Have
you seen any?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
sudden burst of chatter seemed to annoy the man and the woman more than
Julian’s answers. The man spoke roughly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Stop
this nonsense. People aren’t allowed here. Clear out before we make you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
are you here, then, if people aren’t allowed?’ asked Julian, and a hard tone
came into his voice. ‘Don’t talk to us like that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
clear off, I say!’ cried the man, suddenly shouting loudly as he lost his
temper. He took two or three steps towards them, looking very threatening
indeed. George loosed her hold on Timmy’s collar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
also took two or three steps forward. His hackles went up and he emitted a most
fearsome growl. The man stopped suddenly, and then retreated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Take
hold of that dog’s collar,’ he ordered. ‘He looks savage.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Then
he looks what he is,’ said George. ‘I’m not taking hold of his collar while
you’re about. Don’t think it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
took two or three more steps forward, growling loudly, walking stiffly and
menacingly. The woman called out at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
all right, children. My friend here just lost his temper for a moment. Call
your dog back.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
while you are about,’ said George. ‘How long are you staying?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
that to do with you?’ growled the man, but he didn’t say any more because Timmy
at once growled back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
come and have something to eat,’ said Julian, loudly, to the others. ‘After
all, we have as much right to be here as these people have. We don’t need to
take any notice of them - and we shan’t be in their way!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four children marched forward. Timmy was still loose. He barked savagely once
or twice as he came close to the unpleasant couple, and they shrank back at
once. Timmy was such a big dog and he looked so very powerful! They eyed the
children angrily as they went by, and watched them go into the ruined house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘On
guard, Timmy,’ said George, as soon as they were in, pointing to the ruined
doorway. Timmy understood at once, and stood in the doorway, a menacing figure
with hackles up and snarling mouth. The children went down to the cellar room.
They looked round to see if anyone had been there while they were away, but
nothing seemed to have been moved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
probably haven’t even noticed the cellars,’ said Julian. ‘I hope there’s plenty
of bread left. I’m hungry. I wish to goodness we were going to have a dinner
like the one we had yesterday! I say - what an unpleasant pair Maggie and Dick
are!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
Very,’ said Dick. ‘I can’t bear Maggie. Horrid common voice and hard face.
Ugh!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think Dirty Dick is worse,’ said Anne. ‘He looks like a gorilla or something
with his broad hunched-up body. And WHY doesn’t he cut his hair?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Fancies
himself like that, I expect,’ said George, cutting a loaf of bread. ‘His
surname ought to be Golliwog. Or Tarzan. I’m jolly glad we’ve got Timmy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
am I,’ said Anne, ‘Good old Timmy, He hated them, didn’t he? I bet they won’t
come near the doorway with Timmy there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wonder where they are,’ said Dick picking up a great hunk of bread and butter
and potted meat. ‘I’m going to look.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
came back in half a minute. ‘They’ve gone to the boat-house, I think,’ he said.
‘I just caught a sight of one of them moving in that direction. Looking for
Saucy Jane, I expect.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
sit down and eat and talk over what we’ll do next,’ said Julian. ‘And what we
think they will do next! That’s quite important. They may be able to read the
clues on that paper better than we can If we watch what they do it may give us
a guide as to what we must do.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
true,’ said Dick. ‘I imagine that the plan Nailer sent must mean something to
Dirty Dick and Maggie, just as the message did.’ He chewed at his bread,
thinking hard, trying once more to fathom the meaning of that mysterious piece
of paper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think on the whole we will follow out our original plan for this afternoon,’
said Julian, after a little silence. ‘We’ll get out that raft and go on the
lake with it. It’s a harmless looking thing to do. We can examine the banks as
we go - and if Maggie and Dick are out in a boat too, we can keep an eye on
them as well.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
Good idea,’ said George. ‘It’s a heavenly afternoon anyway. I’d love to paddle
about on the lake with that raft. I hope it’s good and sound.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Sure
to be,’ said Dick. ‘The wood it’s made of is meant to last. Pass the cake,
George - and don’t save Timmy any. It’s wasted on him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
isn’t!’ said George. ‘You know he loves it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
But I still say it’s wasted on him,’ said Dick. ‘Good thing we got such an
enormous cake! Are there any biscuits left?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Plenty,’
said Anne. ‘And chocolate too!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good,’
said Dick. ‘I only hope our food will last us out It won’t if George has her
usual colossal appetite.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
about yours?’ said George, indignantly, rising every time to Dick’s lazy
teasing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shut
up, you two,’ said Julian. ‘I’m going to fill the water jug and have some
orangeade. Give me something to take to old Tim.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
spent about half an hour over their lunch, Then they decided to go and tackle
the raft in the boathouse, and see if they could possibly launch it on the
lake. It would be heavy, they knew.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
left the old house and went off to the boathouse. Julian suddenly caught sight
of something out on the lake,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look!’
he said, ‘they’ve got one of the boats out of the boat-house - the one that
wasn’t half-sunk, I suppose! Dirty Dick is rowing hard. I BET they’re looking
for the Saucy Jane!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all stood still and watched. Dick’s heart sank, Would Maggie and Dirty Dick get
there first, and find what he and the other three were looking for? Did they
know where the Saucy Jane was?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on,’ said Julian. ‘We’d better get going if we want to keep an eye on them.
They may be rowing to where the Saucy Jane is hidden!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
climbed in through the wooden side of the boat-house and went to the raft.
Julian saw at once that one of the boats had gone - Merry Meg. It was the only
boat that was fit to take.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four began to man-handle the big raft, They took it to the edge of the ledge.
It had rope-handles on each side which the children held on to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
- ease her gently,’ said Julian. ‘Gently does it. Down she goes!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
down she went, landing with a big splash in the water. She bobbed there gently,
a strong sound raft, eager to go out on the lake!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Get
the paddles,’ said Julian. ‘Then we’ll be off.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>OUT
ON THE RAFT<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
were four little paddles. Dick got them, and gave everyone one each. Timmy
looked down solemnly at the raft. What was it? Surely he was not expected to
ride on that bobbing, floating thing?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was on the raft already, holding it steady for the others, He helped Anne on
and then George stepped down. Dick came last - well, not quite last, because
Timmy was not yet on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on, Tim!’ said George. ‘It’s all right! It’s not the kind of boat you’re used
to, but it acts in the same way. Come on, Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
jumped down and the raft bobbed violently. Anne sat down suddenly with a
giggle. ‘Oh dear - Timmy is so sudden! Keep still, Tim - there isn’t enough
room on this raft for you to walk all over it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
pushed the raft out of the boat-house. It knocked against the wooden ledge as
it went, and then swung out on to the backwater outside. It floated very
smoothly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here
we go!’ said Julian, paddling deftly. ‘I’ll steer, Dick, None of you need to
paddle till I say so. I can paddle and steer at the moment, till we get on to
the lake itself.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were all sitting on the raft except Timmy, who was standing up. He was very
interested in seeing the water flow past so quickly. Was this a boat then? He
was used to boats - but in boats the water was never quite so near. Timmy put
out a paw into the water. It was pleasantly cool and tickled him. He lay down
with his nose almost in the water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
a funny dog, Timmy!’ said Anne. ‘You won’t get up too suddenly, will you, or
you’ll knock me overboard.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
paddled down the little backwater and the raft swung out on to the lake itself.
The children looked to see if there was any sign of Maggie and Dirty Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
they are!’ said Julian. ‘Out in the middle, rowing hard. Shall we follow them?
If they know where the Saucy Jane is they’ll lead us to it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
Follow them,’ said Dick. ‘Shall we paddle now? We’ll have to be quick or we may
lose them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all paddled hard, and the raft suddenly swung to and fro in a most alarming
manner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hey,
stop!’ shouted Julian. ‘You’re all paddling against one another. We’re going
round in circles. Dick and Anne go one side and George the other. That’s
better. Watch how we’re going, all of you, and stop paddling for a moment if
the raft swings round too much.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
soon got into the way of paddling so that the raft went straight ahead. It was
fun. They got very hot and wished they could take off their jerseys. The sun
was quite warm, and there was no wind at all - it was really a perfect October
afternoon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’ve
stopped rowing,’ said George, suddenly. ‘They’re looking at something - do you
suppose they have got a bit of paper like the one we have, with the same marks,
and are examining it? I wish I could see!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all stopped paddling and looked towards the boat in which Maggie and Dirty Dick
sat. They were certainly examining something very carefully - their heads were
close together. But they were too far away for the children to see if they were
holding a piece of paper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on - we’ll get as close to them as we can!’ said Julian, beginning to paddle
again. ‘I expect it will make them absolutely mad to see us so close, but we
can’t help that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
paddled hard again, and at last came up to the boat. Timmy barked. Maggie and
Dirty Dick at once looked round and saw the raft and the four children. They
stared at them savagely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo!’
cried Dick, waving a paddle. ‘We took the raft out. It goes well. Does your
boat go all right?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Maggie
went red with rage. ‘You’ll get into trouble for taking that raft without
permission,’ she shouted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Whose
permission did you ask when you took that boat?’ shouted back Julian. ‘Tell us
and we’ll ask their permission to use this raft!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
laughed. Maggie scowled, and Dirty Dick looked as if he would like to throw his
oars at them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Keep
away from us!’ he shouted. ‘We don’t want you kids spoiling our afternoon!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
like to be friendly!’ called Dick, and made George laugh again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Maggie
and Dirty Dick had a hurried and angry conversation. They glared at the raft
and then Maggie gave an order to Dirty Dick. He took up the oars again, and
began to row, looking rather mutinous.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on - follow,’ said Julian, so the four began to paddle again following after
the boat. ‘Maybe we’ll learn something now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
they didn’t. Dirty Dick rowed the boat towards the west bank, and the raft
followed. Then he swung out into the middle again, and again the raft followed,
the children panting in their efforts to keep up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dirty
Dick rowed right across to the east bank and stayed there till the children
came up. Then he rowed off again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Having
some nice exercise, aren’t you?’ called the woman in her harsh voice. ‘So good
for you all!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boat swung out to the middle of the lake again. Dick groaned. ‘Blow! My arms
are so tired I can hardly paddle. What are they doing?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
afraid they’re just leading us on a wild goose chase,’ said Julian, ruefully.
‘They have evidently made up their minds that they won’t look for the Saucy
Jane while we’re about - they’re just tiring us out!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
if that’s what they’re doing I’m not playing!’ said Dick, and he put down his
paddle and lay flat on his back, his knees drawn up, panting hard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others did the same. They were all tired. Timmy licked each one sympathetically
and then sat down on George. She pushed him off so violently that he nearly
fell into the water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy!
Right on my middle!’ cried George, surprised and indignant. ‘You great clumsy
dog, you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
licked her all over, shocked at being scolded by George. She was too exhausted
to push him away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
happened to the boat?’ asked Anne at last. ‘I’m too tired to sit up and see.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
sat up, groaning ‘Oh my back! Now where is that wretched boat? Oh, there it is
- right away down the lake, making for the landing-place by the house - or for
the boat-house probably. They’ve given up the search for the Saucy Jane for the
time being anyway.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thank
goodness,’ said Anne. ‘Perhaps we can give it up too - till tomorrow anyhow!
Stop snuffling down my neck, Timmy. What do you want us to do, Julian.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think we’d better get back,’ said Julian. ‘It’s too late now to start searching
the banks of the lake - and anyway somehow I think it wouldn’t be much use. The
two in the boat didn’t appear to be going anywhere near the banks - except when
they began to play that trick on us to make us tired out!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
let’s get back then,’ said George. ‘But I simply must have a rest first. Timmy,
I shall push you into the water if you keep sitting on my legs.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a sudden splash. George sat up in alarm. Timmy was not on the raft!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was swimming in the water, looking very pleased with himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There!
He thought he’d rather jump in than be pushed,’ said Dick, grinning at George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
pushed him in!’ said George, looking fierce.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
didn’t,’ said Dick. ‘He just took a header. He’s having a jolly good time. I
say - what about putting a rope round him and getting him to pull us to shore?
It would save an awful lot of paddling.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was just about to say what she thought of that idea, when she caught Dick’s sly
grin. She kicked out at him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
keep baiting me, Dick. I’ll push you in, in a minute.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Like
to try?’ asked Dick, at once, ‘Come on. I’d like a wrestle to see who’d go into
the water first.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George,
of course, always rose to a challenge. She never could resist one. She was up
in a moment and fell on Dick, who very nearly went overboard at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shut
up, you two!’ said Julian, crossly. ‘We haven’t got a change of clothing, you
know that. And I don’t want to take you back with bronchitis or pneumonia. Stop
it, George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
recognized the tone in his voice and she stopped. She ran her hand through her
short curls and gave a sudden grin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right, Teacher!’ she said, and sat down meekly, She picked up her paddle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
picked up his. ‘We’ll get back,’ he said. ‘The sun’s sinking low. I't seems to
slide down the sky at a most remarkable speed in October.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
took a very wet Timmy on board and began to paddle back. Anne thought it was a
truly lovely evening. She gazed dreamily round as she paddled. The lake was a
wonderful dark blue, and the ripples they made turned to silver as they ran
away from the raft. Two moor-hens said ‘crek-crek’ and swam round the raft in
curiosity, their heads bobbing like clockwork.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
gazed over the tops of the trees that grew at the lake-side. The sky was
turning pink. Away in the distance, on a high slope about a mile away she saw
something that interested her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
looked like a high stone. She pointed at it. ‘Look, Julian,’ she said. ‘What’s
that stone? Is it a boundary mark, or something? It must be very big.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
looked where she was pointing. ‘Where?’ he said. ‘Oh, that. I can’t imagine
what it is.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It
looks like a very tall stone,’ said Dick, suddenly catching sight of it too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
tall stone,’ repeated Anne, wondering where she had heard that before. ‘A
tall... oh, of course! It was printed on that plan, wasn’t it - on the piece of
paper Dick was given. Tall Stone! Don’t you remember?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
So it was,’ said Dick and he stared at the faraway stone monument with
interest. Then as the raft swung onwards, high trees hid the stone. It was
gone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Tall
Stone,’ said Julian. ‘It may be only a coincidence, of course. It wants a bit
of thinking about, though. Funny we should suddenly spot it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Would
the loot be buried there?’ asked George, doubtfully. Julian shook his head.
‘Oh, no,’ he said, ‘it is probably hidden in some position explained by that
mysterious map. Paddle up, everyone! We really must get back.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
they arrived at the boat-house there was no sign of Maggie or Dick. But their
boat was in the shed, tied up in front of the other two, where it had been
before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’re
back all right,’ said Julian ‘I wonder where they are. Don’t let’s drag this
clumsy, heavy raft into the boat-house. I don’t feel as if I’ve any strength
left in my arms. Let’s drag it under a bush and tie it there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
thought this a good idea. They pulled the raft up to some thick bushes and tied
it firmly to a root that was sticking out of the ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
they made their way to the ruined house, keeping a sharp look-out for Maggie
and Dick. There was still no sign of them<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went in, Timmy first. He didn’t growl so they knew it was safe. He led the way
to the cellar steps. Then he growled!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
up?’ said Julian. ‘Are they down there, Tim?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
ran straight down the steps into the cellar room. He growled again, but it was
not the fierce growl he always gave when he wanted to warn that enemies or
strangers were near. It was an angry, annoyed growl as if something was wrong.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
expect dear Maggie and Dirty Dick have been down here and found out where our
headquarters are!’ said Julian, following Timmy down the steps, He switched on
his torch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
beds of heather and bracken were there as they had left them, and their macs
and rugs and rucksacks. Nothing seemed to have been disturbed. Julian lighted
the candles on the mantelpiece and the dark little underground room came to
life at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
the matter with Timmy?’ asked George, coming down into the room. ‘He’s still
growling, Timmy, what’s up?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
expect he can smell that the others have been down here,’ said Dick, ‘Look at
him sniffing all round. It’s quite clear that someone has been here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Anyone
hungry?’ asked Anne, ‘I could do with some cake and biscuits.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Julian, and opened the cupboard where they had put the food they had
bought.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was none there! Except for the crockery and one or two odds and ends that had
been in the cupboard before, there was nothing. The bread had gone, the
biscuits, the chocolate - everything!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Blow!’
said Julian, angrily. ‘Look at that! The beasts! They’ve taken all our food -
every bit. Not even a biscuit left. We were mad not to think they might do
that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Clever
of them,’ said Dick. ‘They know we can’t stay here long without food. It’s a
good way of chasing us out. It’s too late to go and get any tonight, anyway -
and if we go tomorrow for some, they’ll do what they have come to do in their
own good time... when we’re not here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
felt distinctly down in the dumps. They were hungry and tired, and a good meal
would have made all the difference. Anne sank down on her bed of heather and
sighed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wish I’d left some chocolate in my rucksack,’ she said. ‘But I didn’t leave any
there at all. And poor Tim - he’s hungry too! Look at him sniffing in the
cupboard and looking round at George. Tim, there’s nothing for you. The
cupboard is bare!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Where
are those two wretches gone?’ suddenly said Julian, fiercely. ‘I’ll tick them
off! I’ll tell them what I think of people who come and rifle cupboards and
take away all the food.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Woof,’
said Timmy, in full agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
went angrily up the stairs. He wondered again where Maggie and Dirty Dick were.
He went to the empty doorway and looked out. Then he saw where they were.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Two
small tents had been put up under some thickly growing trees! So that’s where
the two were going to sleep. He debated whether or not to go and tell them what
he thought of people who stole food. He decided that he would.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
when he got over to the tents with Timmy, there was no one there! Rugs were
laid inside, and there was a primus stove and a kettle and other odds and ends.
At the back of one tent was a pile of something, covered by a cloth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
had a good look into each tent, and then went to see if he could find out where
Maggie and Dirty Dick had gone. He saw them at last, walking through the trees.
They must have gone for an evening stroll, he thought.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
didn’t come back to the tents, but sat down by the lake. Julian gave up the
thought of tackling them and went back to the others. Timmy was left behind,
snufiling about happily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’ve
got tents,’ Julian informed the others when he was back in the cellar room
again. ‘They’re obviously staying put till they’ve got what they came for. They
aren’t in the tents - they’re out by the lake.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
Timmy?’ asked George. ‘You shouldn’t have left him behind, Ju. They might do
something to him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here
he is!’ said Julian, as a familiar noise of claws clattering on the ground came
to their ears. Timmy came down the stone steps and ran to George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
got something in his mouth!’ said George, in surprise, Timmy dropped it into
her lap, She gave a yell.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
a tin of shortbread! Where did he get it from?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
began to laugh. ‘He must have taken it from one of the tents!’ he said. ‘I saw
something covered up with a cloth in one tent - their food, I imagine! Well,
well - tit for tat - they took our food and now Timmy is taking theirs!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Fair
exchange is no robbery,’ grinned Dick. ‘Serves them right! I say - Tim’s gone
again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was back in a minute with something large and paper-covered. It was a big cake!
The four roared with laughter. ‘Timmy! You’re a wonder! You really are!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was pleased at this praise. Off he went again and brought back a cardboard box
in which was a fine pork-pie. The children could hardly believe their eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
a miracle!’ said Anne. ‘Just as I had made up my mind to starve for hours! A
pork-pie of all things! Let’s have some.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I have no second thoughts about it,’ said Julian, firmly. ‘They took our food
and we deserve some of theirs. Good gracious - don’t say Tim’s gone again.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
had! He was enjoying himself thoroughly. He arrived this time with a packet of
ham, and the children couldn’t imagine how he had stopped himself from eating
some on the way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Fancy
carrying it in his mouth and not even tasting a bit!’ said Dick. ‘Tim’s a
better person than I am. I’d just have to have had a lick.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say - we ought to stop him now,’ said Julian, as Timmy ran up the steps again,
his tail wagging nineteen to the dozen. ‘We’re getting a bit too much in
exchange!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
do see what he brings back this time,’ begged Anne. ‘Then stop him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
came back carrying an old flour bag in which something had been packed. Timmy
carried it cleverly by the neck so that nothing had fallen out. George undid
the bag.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Home-made
scones - and buns,’ she said. ‘Timmy, you are very very clever, and you shall
have a wonderful supper. But you are not to go and take any more things,
because we’ve got enough. See? No more. Lie down and be a good dog and eat your
supper.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was quite willing. He wolfed ham and scones and a slice of cake, and then he
went up into the kitchen, jumped into the sink and lapped the water lying
there. He then jumped down and went to the doorway to look out. He barked. Then
he growled loudly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children rushed up the stone steps at once. Outside, at a safe distance, was
Dirty Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Have
you been taking anything of ours?’ he shouted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
more than you have been taking of ours!’ shouted back Julian. ‘Fair exchange,
you know, and all that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
dare you go into our tents?’ raged the man, his shock of hair making him look
very peculiar in the twilight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
didn’t. The dog fetched and carried for us,’ said Julian. ‘And don’t you come
any nearer. He’s just longing to fly at you! And I warn you, he’ll be on guard
tonight, so don’t try any funny tricks. He’s as strong and savage as a lion.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Grrrr,’
said Timmy, so fiercely that the man started back in fright. He went off
without another word, shaking with anger.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and the others went back to finish a very delicious supper. Timmy went with
them - but he planted himself at the top of the cellar steps.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
a bad place for him to be in tonight,’ said Julian. ‘I don’t trust that couple
an inch. We can give him one of our blazers to lie on. I say - this has boiled
up into quite an adventure, hasn’t it? It seems frightful to think we’ll be
back at school on Tuesday!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
must find the loot first!’ said Anne. ‘We really must. Let’s get out that plan
again, Ju. Let’s make sure that Tall Stone is marked on it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
got it out and put it on the table. They bent over it once more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- Tall Stone is marked at the end of one of the lines,’ said Julian. ‘Tock Hill
is at the end of the opposite line. Let’s get the map and see if there is a
Tock Hill,’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
got the map, and studied it. Anne suddenly put her finger down on it. ‘There it
is. On the opposite side of the lake from where we saw the Tall Stone, Tock
Hill on one side. Tall Stone on the other. Surely that means something.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
does, of course,’ said Julian. ‘It is bearings given to show the whereabouts of
the hidden goods. There are four bearings given - Tall Stone. Tock Hill.
Chimney. And Steeple.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Listen!’
said Dick, suddenly. ‘LISTEN! I know how to read that map. It’s easy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Read

VERY EXCITING TIME<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
take all the clues we know,’ said Dick, looking excited. ‘Two Trees. That’s
here. Gloomy Water. That’s where the hidden stuff must be. Saucy Jane. It’s a
boat that contains the stuff, hidden somewhere on Gloomy Water.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Go
on,’ said Julian, as Dick paused to think.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Maggie
is the next clue - well she’s here, probably an old friend of Nailer’s,’ said
Dick. ‘She knows all the clues too,’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
jabbed his finger at the piece of paper. ‘Now for these clues. Listen! We saw
Tall Stone when we were out on the lake, didn’t we? Very well. There must be
SOME spot on the lake from where we can see not only Tall Stone, but also Tock
Hill, Chimney and Steeple, whatever they are! There must be only one spot from
which we can see all those four things at the same time - and that’s the spot
to hunt in for the treasure!’ .<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was an astonished silence after this. Julian drew a long breath and clapped
Dick on the back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course! What idiots we were not to see it before. The Saucy Jane must be
somewhere on - or in - the lake at the spot where all four clues are seen at
the same time. We’ve only got to explore and find out!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- but don’t forget that Maggie and Dirty Dick know what these clues mean too!
They’ll be there first if they possibly can!’ said Dick. ‘And what’s more if
they get the goods we can’t do anything about it. We’re not the police! They’ll
be off and away with their find and disappear completely.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
began to feel intensely excited. ‘I think we’d better set off early tomorrow
morning,’ said Julian, ‘As soon as it’s light. Otherwise Maggie and Dick will
get in first. I wish to goodness we had an alarm clock.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
go on the raft, and we’ll paddle about till we see Tall Stone again - then
we’ll keep that in sight till we see Tock Hill, whatever that is,’ said Dick.
‘And once we’ve spotted that we’ll keep both Tall Stone and Tock Hill in sight
and paddle round to fmd out where we can see a steeple - and then a chimney. I
should think that would be the one chimney left on Two Trees-house! Did you
notice there is just one left, sticking up high?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
I noticed,’ said Anne. ‘What a clever way to hide anything, Dick. Nobody could
possibly know what the clues meant unless they knew something of the secret.
This is awfully exciting!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
talked about it for some time and then Julian said they really must try and go
to sleep or they would never wake up early enough in the morning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
settled down in their beds of heather and bracken. Timmy lay on Julian’s blazer
on the top step of the stairs leading down to the cellar room. He seemed to
think it was quite a good idea to sleep there that night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were all tired and they fell asleep very quickly. Nothing disturbed them in the
night. The fox came again and looked into the old house, but Timmy didn’t stir.
He merely gave a small growl and the fox fled, his bushy tail spread behind
him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
morning came and daylight crept in at the burnt-out doorway and windows. Timmy
stirred and went to the door. He looked towards the two tents. No one was about
there. He went to the cellar steps and clattered down waking Dick and Julian at
once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
the time?’ said Julian, remembering immediately that he was to wake early.
‘Half-past seven. Wake up, everyone! It’s daylight. We’ve heaps to do!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
washed hurriedly, combed out their hair, cleaned their teeth, and tried to
brush down their clothes. Anne got ready some snacks for them - ham, scones and
a piece of shortbread each. They all had a drink of water and then they were
ready to go.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no sign of anyone near the two tents. ‘Good,’ said Julian. ‘We’ll be there
first!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
dragged the raft out and got on to it, taking up the paddles. Then off they
went, Timmy too, all feeling tremendously excited.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
paddle out to where we think we were last night when Anne caught sight of Tall
Stone,’ said Julian. So they paddled valiantly, though their arms were stiff
with yesterday’s paddling and it was really very painful to use the tired
muscles all over again!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
paddled out to the middle of the lake and looked for Tall Stone. It didn’t seem
anywhere to be seen! They strained their eyes for it, but for a long time it
was not to be spotted at all. Then Dick gave a cry. ‘It’s just come into sight.
Look, when we passed those tall trees on the bank yonder, Tall Stone came into
view. It was behind them before that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good,’
said Julian. ‘Now I’m going to stop paddling and keep Tall Stone in sight. If
it goes out of sight I’ll tell you and you must back-paddle. Dick, can you
possibly paddle and look out for something that could be Tock Hill on the
opposite side? I daren’t take my eyes off Tall Stone in case it disappears.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Dick, and paddled while he looked earnestly for Tock Hill.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Got
it!’ he said suddenly. ‘It must be it! Look, over there - a funny little hill
with a pointed top. Julian, can you still see Tall Stone?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Julian. ‘Keep your eyes on Tock Hill. Now it’s up to the girls. George,
paddle away and see if you can spot Steeple.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can see it now, already!’ said George, and for one moment the boys took their
eyes off Tall Stone and Tock Hill and looked where George pointed. They saw the
steeple of a faraway church glinting in the morning sun.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good,
good, good,’ said Julian. ‘Now Anne - look for Chimney - look down towards the
end of the lake - where the house is. Can you see its one chimney?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
quite,’ said Anne. ‘Paddle just a bit to the left - the left, I said, George!
Yes - yes, I can see the one chimney. Stop paddling everyone. We’re here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
stopped paddling but the raft drifted on, and Anne lost the chimney again! They
had to paddle back a bit until it came into sight. By that time George had lost
her steeple!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
last all four things were in view at once, and the raft seemed to be still and
unmoving on the quiet waters of the lake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
going to drop something to mark the place,’ said Julian, still keeping his eyes
desperately on Tall Stone. ‘George, can you manage to watch Tall Stone and
Steeple at the same time? I simply must look what I’m doing for the moment.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
try,’ said George, and fixed her eyes first on Tall Stone, then on Steeple,
then on Tall Stone again, hoping and praying that neither would slip out of
sight if the raft moved on the water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was busy. He had taken his torch and his pocket-knife out of his pocket and had
tied them together with string. ‘I haven’t enough string, Dick,’ he said.
‘You’ve got some, haven’t you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
had, of course. He put his hand into his pocket, still keeping his eyes on Tock
Hill and passed his string over to Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
tied it to the end of the string that joined together the knife and torch. Then
he dropped them into the water, letting out the string as they went down with
their weight. The string slid through his hands. It stopped in a short while
and Julian knew that the knife and torch had reached the bed of the lake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
felt in his pockets again. He knew he had a cork somewhere that he had carved
into a horse’s head. He found it and tied the end of the string firmly round
it. Then he dropped the cork thankfully into the water. It bobbed there, held
by the string, which led right down to the knife and torch on the lake-bed
below.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
done!’ he said, with a sigh of relief. ‘Take your eyes off everything! I’ve
marked the place now, so we don’t need to glue our eyes on the four bearings!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
told them how he had tied together his knife and torch and dropped them on
string to the bottom of the lake, and then had tied a cork to the other end, so
that it would bob and show them the place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all looked at it. ‘Jolly clever, Ju,’ said Dick, ‘But once we slide away from
this spot, and it would be an easy thing to do, we’d find it jolly difficult to
find that cork again! Hadn’t we better tie something else to it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
haven’t got anything else that will float,’ said Julian, ‘Have you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'I
have,’ said George, and she handed him a little wooden box. ‘I keep the
threepenny bits I collect in that,’ she said, putting the money into her
pocket. ‘You can have the box. It will be much easier to see than the cork.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
tied the box to the cork. It was certainly a good deal easier to see! ‘Fine!’
he said. ‘Now we’re quite all right. We must be right over the loot!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all bent over the edge of the raft and looked down - and they saw a most
surprising sight! Below them, resting on the bottom of the lake, was a boat! It
lay there in the shadows of the water, its outline blurred by the ripples the
raft made - but quite plainly it was a boat!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
Saucy Jane!’ said Julian, peering down, feeling amazed and awed to think that
they had read the bearings so correctly that they were actually over the Saucy
Jane herself! ‘The Nailer must have come here with the stolen goods - got out
the Saucy Jane and rowed her to this spot. He must have taken his bearings very
carefully indeed, and then holed the boat so that she sank down with the loot
in her. Then I suppose he swam back to shore.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Most
ingenious,’ said Dick. ‘Really, he must be a jolly clever fellow. But I say,
Julian - how on earth are we going to get the boat up?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can’t imagine,’ said Julian. ‘I simply - can’t - imagine! I hadn’t even thought
of that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
suddenly began to growl. The four looked up quickly to see why.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
saw a boat coming over the water towards them - the Merry Meg, with Maggie and
Dirty Dick in it. And the children felt quite certain that both were reading
the bearings on their piece of paper in exactly the same way as they themselves
had!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were so engrossed in watching for Tall Stone, Tock Hill, Chimney and Steeple
that they took no notice of the children at all. ‘I don’t think they guess for
one moment that we’ve read the bearings and marked the place,’ said Julian.
‘How wild they’ll be when they find we are right over the place they’re looking
for! Watch out for trouble!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boat in which Maggie and Dirty Dick were rowing went this way and that as the
two searched for the same objects that the children had already spotted. The
four watched them, and George put her hand on Timmy to stop him barking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boat came nearer and nearer. Maggie was trying to keep in view two or three of
the bearings at once and her head twisted from side to side continually. The
children grinned at one another. It had been hard enough for the four of them
to keep all the bearings in view - it must be very dificult for Maggie,
especially as Dirty Dick didn’t seem to be helping very much.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
heard Maggie give sharp orders as the boat swung this way and that. Then it
headed for them. Dirty Dick growled something to Maggie, who had her back to
them, and she turned round sharply, losing the view of the things she was
looking for.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Her
face was full of anger when she saw the raft so near - and in the place where
she wanted her boat to go! Afraid of completely losing the view of the things
she was keeping her eyes on, she turned back again and hastily looked to see if
Tock Hill, Tall Stone and Steeple were still all to be seen together. She said
something in a furious voice to Dirty Dick, and he nodded with a sour face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boat came nearer and they heard Maggie say ‘I think I can see it now - yes - a
bit farther to the right, please.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She’s
spotted One Chimney now,’ whispered Anne. ‘I expect they’ve got all the
bearings. Oh dear - the boat will bump right into us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
did! Dirty Dick rowed viciously at them and the bows of the boat gave them a
terrific jolt. Anne would have fallen into the water if Julian hadn’t grabbed
at her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
yelled at Dirty Dick, ‘Look out, you ass! You nearly had us over! What on earth
do you think you’re doing?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Get
out of the way then,’ growled Dirty Dick. Timmy began to bark savagely, and the
boat at once drew away from the raft.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
plenty of room on this lake,’ shouted Julian. ‘What do you want to come and
disturb us for? We aren’t doing any harm.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’re
going to report you to the police,’ called the woman, her face red with anger.
‘Taking a raft that doesn’t belong to you, sleeping in a house where you’ve no
right to be - and stealing our food.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
talk nonsense,’ cried Julian. ‘And don’t you dare to ram us again. If you do
I’ll send our dog after you. He’s longing to come.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Grrrr!’
said Timmy, and showed his magnificent set of gleaming white teeth. Dirty Dick
muttered something quickly to Maggie. She turned round again and called to
them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
look here, you kids - be sensible. My friend and I have come down here for a
quiet week-end, and it isn’t nice to find you four everywhere we go. Go back
and keep out of our way and we won’t report you at all. That’s a fair bargain -
we won’t even say anything about your stealing our food.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’re
going back when we think we will,’ answered Julian. ‘And no threats or bargains
will make any difference to us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a silence. Then Maggie spoke hurriedly to Dirty Dick again. He nodded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
this your half-term?’ she called. ‘When do you have to go back?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Tomorrow,’
said Julian. ‘You’ll be rid of us then. But we’re going to enjoy ourselves on
this raft while we can.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was another hurried conference between the two. Then Dirty Dick rowed round a
little, and Maggie began to peer down into the water. She suddenly looked up,
nodded at Dirty Dick, and he rowed away again towards the end of the lake! Not
another word did the couple say.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can see what they’ve decided to do,’ said Julian, in a pleased voice. ‘They
think we’ll be gone by tomorrow, so they’ll wait till the coast is clear and
then they’ll come and collect the loot in peace. Did you see Maggie looking
down into the water to spot the boat? I was afraid she would also spot our mark
- the cork and the box! But she didn’t.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know why you sound so pleased,’ said George. ‘We can’t get the boat up,
you know that - and I don’t feel pleased that we’ll have to leave tomorrow and
let that horrid pair collect the loot. I imagine they’ll have some clever
grown-up way of pulling up the boat from the bed of the lake - which they will
do when we’ve gone tomorrow.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
not very bright today, George,’ said Julian, watching the boat being rowed
farther and farther away. ‘I told them we’d be gone tomorrow, hoping they would
clear off and wait - and leave us time to get the loot ourselves. I think we
can!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How?’
said three voices at once, and Timmy looked inquiringly at Julian too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we don’t need to pull up the boat,’ said Julian. ‘We only want the loot. What’s
to prevent us from going down and getting it? I’m quite prepared to strip and
dive down to the bottom there and feel about for any sack or bag or box. If I
find one I’ll come up for air, borrow a bit of rope from the raft and go down
again - tie the rope to the sack and you can haul it up to the surface!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
Julian - it sounds so easy - but is it really?’ said Anne. George and Dick
considered the proposal carefully. They were most impressed by Julian’s idea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
it may turn out to be much more difficult than it sounds, but I’m jolly well
going to try it,’ said Julian, and began to strip off his jersey.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
felt the water. It was very very cold to her warm hand. ‘Ugh! I’d hate to dive
down to the bottom of this horrid cold dark lake,’ she said. ‘I think you’re
brave, Ju.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
talk rubbish!’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was ready to go in now. He dived neatly into the water with hardly a splash.
The other three craned over the edge of the raft to watch. They could see him
down, deep down in the water, a ghostly figure. He stayed down such a long time
that Anne got worried.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
can’t hold his breath all that time!’ she said, ‘He can’t!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Julian could. He was one of the star swimmers and divers at his school, and
this was easy to him. He came up again at last, and panted hard, trying to make
up for holding his breath so long. The others waited patiently. At last his
breathing grew more even and he grinned at them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ah
- that’s better! Well - it’s there!’ he said, triumphantly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
it!’ said everyone, thrilled. ‘Oh Julian!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I dived right down to the boat - almost got there with the force of my dive -
had to swim just a couple of strokes perhaps. And there was the poor old boat,
rotting to bits. And in one end is a waterproof bag - almost a sack, it’s so
big. I ran my hands over it, and it’s waterproof all right - so the loot must
be packed in there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Did
it feel heavy?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
gave it a tug and couldn’t move it,’ said Julian, ‘Either it’s wedged in
somehow or is really heavy. Anyway we can’t fetch it out by diving down for it.
I’ll have to dive down again, fix a rope to it, then come up - and we’ll give a
heave-ho and up she’ll come!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was shivering. Anne picked up the blazer she had brought and gave it to him to
dry himself with. Dick looked hurriedly over the raft. There were certainly
bits and pieces of rope sticking out here and there, some of it half-rotten,
and a short length was tucked into a space between two planks of the raft.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was much too short though - and surely the other bits and pieces would never
join to make a long enough rope?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
bits of rope we’ve got won’t do, Julian,’ said Dick. Julian was drying himself
and looking towards the end of the lake, where Two-Trees stood. He was
frowning. The others looked too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boat had reached the bank there, and had been pulled up. One of the couple, the
children couldn’t see which, was standing up on the bank - and something was
glinting in the sun, something he or she was holding!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘See
that glint?’ said Julian ‘Well, that’s either Maggie or Dirty Dick using
field-glasses. They’re going to keep an eye on us while we’re here - just to
make sure we don’t suddenly spot the boat, I suppose! They don’t guess we’ve
already found it. I bet they were worried when they saw I’d taken a header into
the water just over the sunken boat!’<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
- so that’s what the flash is,’ said George. ‘The glint of field-glasses! Yes -
they’re watching us. Blow! That will put an end to us trying to haul up the
loot, Ju. They’d see it and wait for us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
No good trying for that now,’ said Julian. ‘Anyway, as Dick says, we’ve not got
enough rope. We’ll have to get some from the boat-house.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
when do you propose to get the bag out of the sunk boat?’ asked Dick. ‘They’ll
keep those field-glasses on us even if we go out again this afternoon.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
only one time to go when they won’t have their glasses watching us,’ said
Julian, beginning to dress himself very rapidly, ‘and that’s tonight. We’ll go
tonight! My word - what an adventure!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Don’t
let’s,’ said Anne, in a small voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’ll
be a moon,’ said George, excited.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Smashing
idea!’ said Dick, thumping Julian on the back. ‘Let’s go back now so that they
won’t have any suspicions of us, and make our plans for tonight. And we’d
better keep an eye on them too in case they row out to this spot themselves
this afternoon.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
won’t,’ said Julian. ‘They daren’t run any risk of us spotting what they’re
doing. They will be sure to wait till we’ve gone.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'And
till the loot is gone!’ said George with a laugh. ‘I say - I do hope those two
wretches haven’t gone and taken our food again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hid it down in the cellars beyond our room - and locked the door leading there
- and here’s the key,’ grinned Julian, holding up a large key.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
never told us!’ said George. ‘Julian, you’re a genius! How do you manage to
think of things like that?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
- just brains!’ said Julian, pretending to look modest, and then laughing.
‘Come on - if I don’t get warm quickly I’ll have a most almighty chill!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
paddled rapidly away. Dick took a last glance back to make sure that the cork
and the box were still bobbing on the water to mark the place where the sunken
boat lay. Yes - they were still there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’ll
be maddening if it’s cloudy tonight and the moon doesn’t come out,’ said
George, as they paddled. ‘We shouldn’t be able to see Tock Hill, Tall Stone and
the rest - and we might paddle for ages in the dark without spotting our
cork-and-box mark.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
cross your bridges before you come to them,’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
not,’ said George. ‘I was only just hoping that wouldn’t happen.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
won’t,’ said Julian, looking at the sky. ‘The weather’s set fine again.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
soon as Maggie saw the children coming back again, she and Dirty Dick
disappeared into their tents. Julian grinned. ‘They’ve heaved a sigh of relief
and gone to have a snack,’ he said. ‘I could do with one myself.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
felt the same. Paddling was hard work, and the air on the lake was keen - quite
enough to give anyone a large appetite!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
pushed the raft into its hiding-place again. Then they made their way to the
old house. They went down into the cellar room. Timmy growled and sniffed about
again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
bet Maggie and Dirty Dick have been here, snooping round again,’ said George.
‘Looking for their pork-pie and ham! Good thing you locked it up, Ju!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
unlocked the door into the cellars beyond, and brought out the food. ‘A large
toad was looking at it with great interest,’ he said, as he brought it back.
‘Timmy also looked at the toad with interest - but he’s wary of toads by now.
They taste much too nasty when pounced on!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
took the meal up into the sunshine and enjoyed it. The orangeade was finished
so they drank the cold clear water, pumping some vigorously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
you know it’s a quarter to three?’ said Julian amazed. ‘Where has the time
gone? In a couple of hours or so it will be dark. Let me see - the moon will be
well up about eleven o’clock. That’s the time to go, I think.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Please
don’t let’s,’ said Anne. Julian put his arm round her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
you know you don’t mean that, Anne,’ he said. ‘You know you’ll enjoy it all
when the time comes. You couldn’t bear to be left out of it! Could you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
I suppose I couldn’t,’ said Anne. ‘But I don’t like Maggie and Dirty Dick!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nor
do we,’ said Julian, cheerfully. ‘That’s why we’re going to beat them at their
own game. We’re on the side of the right, and it’s worth while running into a
bit of danger for that. Now let’s see - perhaps we’d better just keep an eye on
that couple till it’s dark - just in case they try any funny tricks - and then
we’ll have a snooze, if we can, so as to be sure to be lively tonight.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
they are!’ said Anne. As she spoke Maggie and her companion came out of their
tents. They had a few words together and then walked off to the moorland.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Taking
their usual stroll, I suppose,’ said Dick. ‘Let’s have a game of cricket.
There’s a bit of wood over there for a bat, and I’ve got a ball in my
rucksack.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
idea,’ said Julian. ‘I still feel a bit chilled from my bathe. Brrrrrr! That
water was cold. I don’t feel very thrilled at the thought of diving in
tonight!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
do that,’ said Dick, at once. ‘My turn this time!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
I know exactly where to spot the loot,’ said Julian. ‘I’ll have to go down. But
you can come down too, if you like, and help to tie the rope on to it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Dick, ‘Now look out - I’m going to bowl!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
enjoyed their game. The sun sank lower and lower, then it disappeared. A cloud
came over the sky and darkness came quickly. George looked up at the sky
anxiously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
all right,’ said Julian. ‘It’ll clear. Don’t you worry!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before
they went back into the house Julian and Dick slipped down to the boat-house
for the coil of rope they would want that night. They found it easily enough
and came back, pleased. It was quite good strong rope, frayed only in one
place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was right about the weather. The sky cleared again in about an hour, and the
stars shone crisply. Good!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
put Timmy on guard at the doorway. Then he and the others went into the dark
cellar-room and lighted a couple of candles. They all snuggled down into their
beds of heather.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
shan’t be able to snooze,’ complained Anne. ‘I feel much too excited.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
snooze then,’ said Dick. ‘Just have a rest and wake us up at the right time!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
was the only one who didn’t fall into a comfortable doze. She lay awake,
thinking of this new adventure of theirs. Some children always had adventures
and some didn’t. Anne thought it would be much nicer to read about adventures
than to have them. But then probably the ones who only read about them simply
longed to have the adventures themselves! It was all very difficult.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
woke the others at ten to eleven. She shook George first, and then the boys.
They were all in such a comfortable sleep that it was hard to wake them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
soon they were up and about, whispering. ‘Where’s the rope? Good, here it is.
Better put on blazers and macs. It’ll be freezing on the lake. Everyone ready?
Now - not a sound!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
had come to the cellar room as soon as he had heard them stirring. He knew he
had to be quiet so he didn’t give even one small bark. He was thrilled to find
they were going out into the night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
moon was well up now, and although it was not full, it was very bright. Small
clouds swam across the sky, and every now and again the moon went behind one of
them and the world became dark. But that was only for a minute or two, then out
it came again, as brilliant as ever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'Any
sign of the others?’ whispered Dick. Julian stood at the doorway and looked
towards the tents. No - all was quiet there. Still, it would be better if he
and the others crept round the side of the house and kept in the shadows.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
don’t want to run any risk of them spotting us now,’ whispered Julian, giving
his orders. ‘Keep out of the moonlight, whatever you do. And see that Tim walks
to heel, George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Keeping
well in the shadows the five crept down to the lake-side. The water gleamed in
the moonlight, and a bright moon-path ran all down it, lovely to see. The lake
looked very dark and brooding. Anne wished it had a voice of some kind - even
the little lap-lap-lap of waves at the edge. But there was none.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
pulled out the raft and threw the coil of rope on to it. Then they clambered
on, enjoying its smooth bob-bob-bobbing as they paddled out on the water. They
were off!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was thrilled. He kept licking first one of the four, then another. He loved
going out in the night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
moon shone down on the little company and turned every little ripple to silver
as the raft bobbed over the water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
a heavenly night,’ said Anne, looking round at the silent trees that lined the
banks. ‘The whole place is so quiet and peaceful.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An
owl immediately hooted very loudly indeed from the trees and Anne jumped
violently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
don’t start all the owls hooting by talking about how quiet everything is,’
teased Julian. ‘I agree though that it really is a heavenly evening. How calm
and mirror-like this lake is. I wonder if it ever produces a wave of any sort!
Do you suppose it stays like this even in a storm?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
a queer sort of lake,’ said Dick. ‘Look out, Timmy - that’s my ear. Don’t lick
it all away. I say - anyone looking out for our four bearings?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we know more or less where we’ve got to paddle the raft to,’ said Julian.
‘We’ll go in that direction and then see if we’re spotting the bearings. I’m
sure we’re going right at the moment.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were. George soon saw Tall Stone, and then Tock Hill came into sight. It wasn’t
long before Steeple was seen too, shining in the moonlight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
bet the Nailer came and hid his loot out here on a moonlit night,’ said Julian.
‘All the bearings can be seen so very clearly - even Tall Stone. We really must
find out sometime what it is. It looks like a great stone pointer of some sort,
put up in memory of something or somebody.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
One Chimney now,’ said Anne, ‘We have got them all in view - we should be near
our mark.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
are!’ said Dick, pointing to a little dark bobbing thing nearby. ‘The cork and
the box. How extremely clever we are! I really have a great admiration for the
Five!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Idiot!’
said Julian, ‘Go on, strip now, Dick - we’ll do our job straight away.
Brrrrrrr! It’s cold!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Both
boys stripped quickly, putting their clothes into a neat pile in the middle of
the raft. ‘Look after them, Anne,’ said Julian. ‘Got the rope, Dick? Come on,
then, in we go. We can’t see the boat now, the waters are so dark - but we know
it’s just below the cork and the box!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys dived in one after the other. Splash! Splash! They were both beautiful
divers. The raft rocked as they plunged in and Timmy nearly went in too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
had dived in first. He opened his eyes under the water and found that he could
see the sunken boat just below him. With two strong strokes he reached it, and
tugged at the waterproof bag there. Dick was beside him almost at once, the
rope in his hands. The boys twisted it tightly round the top part of the bag.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Before
they could finish the job they had to rise up to the surface to breathe. Dick
couldn’t hold his breath under water as long as Julian and he was up first,
gasping painfully. Then Julian shot up and the night was full of great, painful
breaths, as the boys gasped in the air they longed for.<span style='mso-tab-count:

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
girls knew better than to ask anything just then. They waited anxiously till
the boys’ breathing grew easier. Julian turned and grinned at them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Everything’s
all right!’ he said. ‘Now - down we go again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Down
went the boys again and once more the raft jerked violently. The girls peered
anxiously over the edge, waiting for them to return.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and Dick were down at the sunken boat in a matter of a second or two. They
finished the task of tying the rope to the waterproof bag. Julian gave it a
hard jerk, hoping to free it if it were wedged tightly into the boat. He took
the rest of the rope length in his hands in order to take it up to the surface.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then,
bursting for breath again, the two boys shot up to the raft, popping out of the
water with loud gasps. They climbed on board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
took a minute to get their breath and then Dick and Julian took the rope
together. The girls watched, their hearts beating fast. Now was the test! Would
that waterproof sack come up - or not?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys pulled strongly but without jerking. The raft slanted and Anne made a grab
at the pile of clothes in the middle. Dick fell off into the water again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
climbed back, spluttering. ‘Have to pull more smoothly,’ he said. ‘I felt the
sack give a bit, didn’t you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
nodded. He was shivering with cold, but his eyes were shining with excitement.
Anne put a macintosh round his shoulders and one round Dick’s too. They never
even noticed!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
- pull again,’ said Julian. ‘Steady does it - steady - steady! It’s coming!
Gosh, it’s really coming. Pull, Dick, pull!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
the heavy bag came up on the end of the rope, the raft slanted again, and the
boys pushed themselves back to the other side of the raft, afraid of upsetting
everyone into the water. Timmy began to bark excitedly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Be
quiet, Timmy,’ said George at once. She knew how easily sound travels over
water, and she was afraid the couple in the tents might hear him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
coming - it’s there, look - just below the surface!’ said Anne. ‘One more pull,
boys!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it was impossible to pull the heavy bag on board without upsetting the raft, As
it was, the girls got very wet when the water splashed over the raft as it
jerked and slanted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
- let’s paddle back to the shore and let the sack drag behind us.’ said Julian,
at last. ‘We shall only upset the raft. Dress again, Dick, and we’ll get back
to the old house and open the sack in comfort. I’m so cold now that I can
hardly feel my fingers.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys dressed as quickly as they could, They were shivering, and were very glad
to take up their paddles and work hard to get the raft back to shore. They soon
felt a welcome warmth stealing through their bodies, and in ten minutes had
stopped shivering. They felt very pleased with themselves indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
looked back at the bulky object following them, dragging along just under the
surface. What was in that bag? Excitement crept over all of them again, and the
paddles struck through the water at top speed as all the four strained to get
back as quickly as possible. Timmy felt the excitement too, and wagged his long
tail without ceasing as he stood in the middle of the raft, watching the thing
that bobbed along behind them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came at last to the end of the lake. Making as little noise as possible they
dragged the raft under its usual bush. They did not want to leave it out on the
bank in case Maggie and Dirty Dick saw that it had been used again, and started
wondering.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
and Julian dragged the waterproof sack out of the water. They carried it
between them as they went cautiously back to the house. It looked a most
miserable, grotesque place with its burnt-out roof, doorways and windows - but
the children didn’t notice its forlorn appearance in the moonlight - they were far
too excited!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
walked slowly up the overgrown path between the two broken-down walls, their
feet making no sound on the soft mossy ground. They came to the doorway and
dragged the bundle into the kitchen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Go
and light the candles in the cellar room,’ said Julian to George. ‘I just want
to make sure that that couple are not snooping anywhere about.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
and Anne went to light the candles, flashing their torches before them down the
stone steps. Julian and Dick stood at the open doorway, facing the moonlight,
listening intently. Not a sound was to be heard, not a shadow moved!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
set Timmy on guard and left him there, dragging the dripping, heavy bundle
across the stone floor of the kitchen. They bumped it down the cellar steps -
and at last had it before them, ready to be opened!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian’s
fingers fumbled at the knots of the rope. George couldn’t bear waiting. She
took a pocket-knife and handed it to Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘For
goodness’ sake, cut the rope!’ she said. ‘I simply can’t wait another moment.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
grinned. He cut the rope - and then he looked to see how to undo the waterproof
wrapping.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
see,’ he said. ‘It’s been folded over and over the goods, and then sewn up to
make a kind of bag. It must have kept the loot absolutely waterproof.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Buck
up!’ said George. ‘I shall tear it open myself in a minute!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
cut the strong stitches that closed the covering. They began to unwrap the
bundle. There seemed to be yards and yards of waterproof covering! But at last
it was off - and there, in the middle of the mass of waterproof, were scores of
little boxes - leather-covered boxes that everyone knew at once were
jewel-boxes!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>'It
is jewellery then!’ said Anne, and she opened a box, They all exclaimed in
wonder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
magnificent necklace glittered on black velvet. It shone and glinted and
sparkled in the candlelight as if it were on fire. Even the two boys gazed
without a word. Why - it was fit for a queen!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
must be that wonderful necklace stolen from the Queen of Fallonia,’ said George
at last. ‘I saw a picture of it in the papers. What diamonds!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oooh
- are they diamonds!’ said Anne, in awe. ‘Oh Julian - what a lot of money they
must be worth! A hundred pounds, do you think?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
hundred thousand pounds more likely, Anne,’ said Julian, soberly. ‘My word - no
wonder the Nailer hid these stolen goods carefully, in such an ingenious place.
No wonder Maggie and Dirty Dick were longing to find them. Let’s see what else
there is.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Every
box contained precious stones of some kind - sapphire bracelets, ruby and
diamond rings, a strange and wonderful opal necklace, ear-rings of such
enormous diamonds that Anne was quite sure no one would be able to bear the
weight of them!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
would never, never dare to own jewellery like this,’ said Anne. ‘I should
always be afraid of its being stolen. Did it all belong to the Queen of
Fallonia?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
Some to a princess who was visiting her,’ said Julian. ‘These jewels are worth
a king’s ransom. I just hate the thought of being in charge of them, even for a
little while.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
it’s better that we should have them, rather than Maggie or Dirty Dick,’ said
George. She held a string of diamonds in her hands and let them run through her
fingers. How they sparkled! No one could have imagined that they had been at
the bottom of a lake for a year or two!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
let’s see,’ said Julian, sitting down on the edge of the table. ‘We’re due back
at school tomorrow afternoon, Tuesday - or is it Tuesday already? It must be
past midnight - gosh, yes, it’s almost half past two! Would you believe it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
feel as if I’d believe anything,’ said Anne, blinking at the glittering
treasure on the table.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’d
better start off fairly early tomorrow,’ went on Julian. ‘We’ve got to get
these things to the police ...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
to that awful policeman we saw the other day!’ said George, in horror,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course not. I think our best course would be to ring up that nice Mr. Gaston
and tell him that we’ve got important news for the police and see which police
station he recommends us to go to,’ said Julian. ‘He might even arrange a car
for us, so that we don’t need to take this stuff about in buses. I’m not
particularly keen on carrying it about with me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Have
we got to carry all these boxes?’ said George, in dismay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
That would be asking for trouble if anyone spotted them,’ said Julian. ‘I fear
we’ll just have to wrap up the jewels in our hankies and stuff them down into
the bottom of our rucksacks. We’ll leave the boxes here. The police can collect
them afterwards if they want to.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was all decided. The four divided up the glittering jewellery and wrapped it
carefully into four handkerchiefs, one for each of them. They stuffed the
hankies into their rucksacks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’d
better use them for pillows,’ said Dick. ‘Then they’ll be quite safe.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What!
These horrid rough bags!’ said Anne. ‘Why? Timmy’s on guard, isn’t he? I’ll put
mine beside me under the rug but I just won’t put my head on it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
laughed, ‘All right, Anne. Timmy won’t let any robber through, I’m quite sure.
Now - we start off first thing in the morning, do we, Julian?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
As soon as we wake,’ said Julian. ‘We can’t have much to eat. There’s only a
few biscuits and a bit of chocolate left.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
shan’t mind,’ said Anne. ‘I’m so excited that at the moment I don’t feel I’ll
ever eat anything again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’ll
change your mind tomorrow,’ said Julian with a laugh. ‘Now - to bed, everyone.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
lay down on their heather and bracken, excited and pleased. What a week-end!
And all because Dick and Anne had lost their way and Dick slept in the wrong
barn!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good-night,’
said Julian, yawning, ‘I feel very very rich - richer than I’ll ever be in my
life again. Well - I’ll enjoy the feeling while I can!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
awoke to hear Timmy barking. It was daylight already. Julian leapt up the steps
to see what was the matter. He saw Maggie not very far away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
do you keep such a fierce dog?’ she called. ‘I just came to see if you wanted
to take any food with you. We’ll give you some if you like.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
too kind of you, all of a sudden!’ said Julian. How anxious Maggie was to get
rid of them! She would even give them food to get rid of them quickly. But
Julian didn’t want any food from Maggie or Dirty Dick!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
you want some, then?’ asked the woman. She couldn’t make Julian out. He looked
a youngster, and yet his manner was anything but childish. She was rather
afraid of him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
thanks,’ said Julian. ‘We’re just about to go, Got to get back to school today,
you know.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you’d better hurry then,’ said the woman. ‘It’s going to rain.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
turned on his heel, grinning. It wasn’t going to rain. Maggie would say
anything to hurry them away! Still, that was just what Julian wanted - to get
away as quickly as possible!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
ten minutes’ time the four children were ready to go. Each had rucksack and mac
on their back - and each had jewels worth thousands of pounds in their charge!
What a very extraordinary thing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
will be a lovely walk across the moors,’ said Anne, as they went along. ‘I feel
like singing now everything’s turned out all right. The only thing is - nobody
at school will believe George or me when we tell them what’s happened,’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
shall probably be set a composition to do - “What did you do on your
half-term?” ’ said George. ‘And Miss Peters will read ours and say “Quite well
written, but rather far-fetched, don’t you think?” ’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
laughed. Timmy looked round with his tongue out and what George called ‘his
smiling face’. Then his ‘smile’ vanished, and he began to bark, facing to the
rear of the children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
looked round, startled. ‘Gosh - it’s Maggie and Dirty Dick - rushing along like
fury!’ said Dick. ‘What’s up? Are they sorry we’ve gone and want us back
again?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’re
trying to cut us off,’ said Julian. ‘Look - they’ve left the path and they’re
going to take a short cut to come across us. There is marshland all round, so
we can’t leave our own path. What idiots they are! Unless they know this bit of
marsh-moor country they’ll get bogged.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Maggie
and Dirty Dick were yelling and shouting in a fury. Dirty Dick shook his fists,
and leapt from tuft to tuft like a goat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
look as if they have gone quite mad,’ said Anne, suddenly afraid. ‘What’s the
matter with them?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
know!’ said George. ‘They’ve been into our cellar room - and they’ve found that
waterproof covering and all those empty boxes. They’ve found out that we’ve got
the goods!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course!’ said Julian. ‘We should have thrown all the boxes into the cellars
beyond. No wonder they’re in a fury. They’ve lost a fortune to us four!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
do they think they can do now, though?’ said Dick. ‘We’ve got Timmy. He’ll
certainly fly at them if they come too near. But Dirty Dick looks mad enough to
fight even Timmy. Honestly, I think he’s gone off his head.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think he has,’ said Julian, startled by the man’s mad shouts and behaviour.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
looked at Anne, who had gone white. Julian felt sure that Timmy would go for
Dirty Dick and bring him to the ground, and he didn’t want Anne to see dog and
man fighting savagely. There was no doubt that Dirty Dick was quite out of his
mind with rage and disappointment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
began to bark fiercely. He snarled, and looked very savage. He could see that
the man was spoiling for a fight with someone. All right - Timmy didn’t mind!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
hurry on,’ said Julian. ‘But no short cuts for us, mind - we’ll keep strictly
to the path. Maggie is in difficulties already.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
she was. She was floundering ankle deep in marshy ground, yelling to Dirty Dick
to help her. But he was too intent on cutting right across the children’s path.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then he got into difficulties too! He suddenly sank up to his knees! He tried
to clamber out and reach a tuft of some sort. He missed his footing and went
down again. He gave an anguished yell. ‘My ankle! I’ve broken it! Maggie, come
over here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Maggie was having her own difficulties and paid no attention. The children
stopped and looked at Dirty Dick. He was sitting on a tuft, nursing his foot,
and even from where the children stood they could see that his face was deathly
white. He certainly had done something to his ankle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ought
we to help him?’ said Anne, trembling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
gracious no!’ said Julian. ‘He may be pretending for all we know - though I
don’t think so. The chase is over, anyway. And if, as I think, Dirty Dick
really has injured his ankle, he won’t be able to get far out of that marsh -
and nor will Maggie by the look of her - down she goes again, look! It may be
that the police will find it very easy to pick up that unpleasant couple when
they come along to look for them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nicely
embedded in the marsh,’ said Dick. ‘Well, personally, I don’t feel sorry for
either of them, They’re bad lots.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went on their way again, Timmy gloomy because he hadn’t had a fight with Dirty
Dick after all. They walked all the way to Reebles. It took them two hours.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
go to the post-office, and telephone from there,’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
old man was pleased to see them again. ‘Had a nice time?’ he said. ‘Did you
find Two-Trees?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
left him talking to the others while he went to look up Mr. Gaston’s telephone
number. He found it - and hoping devoutly that Mr. Gaston wouldn’t mind giving
his help, he rang him up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Gaston answered the telephone himself. ‘Hallo? Who? Oh, yes, of course I
remember you. You want a bit of help? Well, what can I do for you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
told him. Mr. Gaston listened in amazement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘WHAT!
You’ve found the Fallonia jewels! I can’t believe it! In your rucksacks now,
you say! Bless us all! You’re not spoofing me, are you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
assured him that he wasn’t. Mr. Gaston could hardly believe his ears. ‘Right.
Right - of course I’ll put you in touch with the police. We’d better go to
Gathercombe - I know the Inspector there, a fine fellow. Where are you? Oh yes,
I know it. Wait there and I’ll fetch you in my car - in about half an hour,
say.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
rang off and Julian went to find the others, delighted that he had thought of
getting into touch with Mr. Gaston. Some grown-ups were so jolly decent - and
they knew exactly what to do. The other three were delighted too, when he told
them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I must say that although it’s nice to have things happening to us, it’s a sort
of safe, comfortable feeling when we hand over to the grown-ups,’ said George.
‘Now I only want one thing - breakfast!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’d
better have a mixture of breakfast and lunch,’ said Julian. ‘It’s so late.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
yes - let’s have brunch!’ said Anne, delighted, ‘I love brunch.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
they had some ‘brunch’ - sandwiches, buns, biscuits and ginger-beer, which they
bought at a little shop down the road. And just as they were finishing, up
swept Mr. Gaston in an enormous car!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four children grinned at him with pleasure, Julian introduced Anne and Dick.
Timmy was thrilled to see him again and offered him a polite paw, which Mr.
Gaston shook heartily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nice
manners your dog’s got,’ he said, and pressed down the accelerator. Whoooosh!
Away they went at top speed, with Timmy sticking his head out of the window as
he always did in a car.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
told their extraordinary story as they went. Mr. Gaston was full of admiration
for all they had done. ‘You’re a bunch of plucky kids!’ he kept saying. ‘My
word, I wish you were mine!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came to the police station. Mr. Gaston had already warned the inspector they
were coming, and he was waiting for them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
along into my private room,’ he said. ‘Now first of all - where are these
jewels? Have you really got them with you? Let’s have a look at them before you
tell your story.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
children undid their rucksacks - and out of the hankies inside they poured the
shining, glittering jewellery on to the oak table.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
inspector whistled and exchanged a look with Mr. Gaston. He picked up the
diamond necklace.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’ve
got them!’ he said. ‘The very jewels! And to think the police everywhere have
been hunting for them for months and months and months. Where did you find
them, youngsters?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
rather a long story,’ said Julian. He began to tell it, and he told it well,
prompted by the others, when he forgot anything. Mr. Gaston and the inspector
listened with amazement on their faces. When Julian came to the bit where Dirty
Dick and Maggie had been left floundering in the marshes, the inspector
interrupted him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wait!
Would they still be there? They would? Right. Half a minute!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
pressed a bell and a peliceman appeared. ‘Tell Johns to take his three men and
the car, and go to the Green Marshes, near Gloomy Water,’ ordered the
inspector. ‘He’s to pick up two people floundering there - man and woman. Our
old friends Dirty Dick and Maggie Martin! Look sharp!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
policeman disappeared. Anne hugged herself. Now that awful couple would be put
into safe custody for some time, thank goodness - till she had forgotten about
them! Anne hadn’t liked them a bit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian’s
tale came to an end. The inspector looked across at the tousle-headed, dirty,
untidy group and smiled. He held out his hand. ‘Shake!’ he said. ‘All of you!
You’re the kind of kids we want in this country - plucky, sensible, responsible
youngsters who use your brains and never give up! I’m proud to meet you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all shook hands with him solemnly. Timmy held up his paw too, and the inspector
grinned and shook that too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
now - what’s your programme?’ asked Mr, Gaston, getting up,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- we’re all supposed to be back at school by three o’clock,’ said Julian. ‘But
I don’t think we can arrive looking like this. We’d get into awful rows! Is
there a hotel where we can have a bath and clean ourselves up a bit?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
can do that here,’ said the inspector. ‘And if you like I’ll run you back to
your schools in the police car. We can’t do too much for people who produce the
Fallonia jewels out of rucksacks, you know. Bless us all - I can’t believe it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Gaston said good-bye and went, saying that he was very proud to have made
friends with them. ‘And don’t you get stuck down any more rabbit-holes!’ he
said to Timmy, who wuffed happily at him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
bathed and washed every inch of themselves. They found their clothes neatly
folded and brushed, and felt grateful. They brushed their hairs and arrived
looking very clean and tidy in the inspector’s private room. He had a man
there, inspecting the jewels and labelling them before he put them away into
boxes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’ll
be interested to know that we have picked up your couple,’ he told them. ‘The
man had a broken ankle and couldn’t stir a step. The woman was thigh deep in
the marsh when we found her. They quite welcomed the police, they were so fed
up with everything!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
good!’ said the four, and Anne beamed with relief. That settled Maggie and
Dirty Dick then!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
these are the Fallonia jewels,’ said the inspector. ‘Not that I had any doubt
of it. They are now being checked and labelled. I’ve no doubt the Queen of
Fallonia and her titled friend will be extremely pleased to hear of your little
exploit.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
clock struck half past two. Julian looked at it. Half an hour only to get back
in time. Would they do it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
all right,’ said the inspector, with his wide grin. ‘Car’s at the door. I’ll
come and see you off. You’ll all be back at your schools in good time - and if
anyone believes your tale I’ll be surprised. Come along!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
saw them into the car, Timmy too. ‘Good-bye,’ he said, and saluted them all
smartly. I’m proud to have met you - good luck to you, Famous Five!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Yes,
good luck to you, Famous Five - and may you have many more adventures!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
