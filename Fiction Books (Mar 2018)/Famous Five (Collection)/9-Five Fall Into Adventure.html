style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> was at the station to
meet her three cousins. Timmy her dog was with her, his long tail wagging
eagerly. He knew quite well they had come to meet Julian, Dick and Anne, and he
was glad. It was much more fun when the Five were all together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here
comes the train, Timmy!’ said George. Nobody called her <st1:place w:st="on">Georgina</st1:place>,
because she wouldn’t answer if they did. She looked like a boy with her short
curly hair and her shorts and open-necked shirt. Her face was covered with
freckles, and her legs and arms were as brown as a gipsy’s.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was the far-off rumble of a train, and as it came nearer, a short warning hoot.
Timmy whined and wagged his tail. He didn’t like trains, but he wanted this one
to come.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nearer
and nearer it came, slowing down as it reached Kirrin station. Long before it
came to the little platform three heads appeared out of one of the windows, and
three hands waved wildly. George waved back, her face one big smile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
door swung open almost before the train stopped. Out came a big boy, and helped
down a small girl. Then came another boy, not quite so tall as the first one,
with a bag in each hand. He dragged a third bag out, and then George and Timmy
were on him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian!
Dick! Anne! Your train’s late; we thought you were never coming!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo,
George! Here we are at last. Get down, Timmy, don’t eat me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo,
George! Oh, Timmy, you darling - you’re just as licky as ever!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy joyfully, and bounded all round like a mad thing, getting into
everybody’s way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Any
trunk or anything?’ asked George. ‘Only those three bags?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we haven’t come for long this time, worse luck,’ said Dick. ‘Only a fortnight!
Still, it’s better than nothing.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
shouldn’t have gone off to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region>
all those six weeks,’ said George, half-jealously. ‘I suppose you’ve gone all
French now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
laughed, waved his hands in the air and went off into a stream of quick French
that sounded just like gibberish to George, French was not one of her strong
subjects.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shut
up,’ she said, giving him a friendly shove. ‘You’re just the same old idiot.
Oh, I’m so glad you’ve come. It’s been lonely and dull at Kirrin without you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
porter came up with a barrow. Dick turned to him, waved his hands again, and
addressed the astonished man in fluent French. But the porter knew Dick quite
well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Go
on with you,’ he said. ‘Argy-bargying in double-Dutch like that. Do you want me
to wheel these up to Kirrin Cottage for you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
please,’ said Anne. ‘Stop it, Dick. It isn’t funny when you go on so long.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
let him go on,’ said George, and she linked her arms in Anne’s and Dick’s.
‘It’s lovely to have you again. Mother’s looking forward to seeing you all.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
bet Uncle Quentin isn’t,’ said Julian, as they went along the little platform,
Timmy capering round them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Father’s
in quite a good temper,’ said George. ‘You know he’s been to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region> with
Mother, lecturing and hearing other scientists lecturing too. Mother says
everyone made a great fuss of him, and he liked it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George’s
father was a brilliant scientist, well-known all over the world. But he was
rather a difficult man at home, impatient, hot-tempered and forgetful. The
children were fond of him, but held him in great respect. They all heaved a
sigh of relief when he went away for a few days, for then they could make as
much noise as they liked, tear up and down the stairs, play silly jokes and
generally be as mad as they pleased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Will
Uncle Quentin be at home all the time we’re staying with you?’ asked Anne. She
was really rather afraid of her hot-tempered uncle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said George. ‘Mother and Father are going away for a tour in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Spain</st1:place></st1:country-region> - so
we’ll be on our own.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Wizard!’
said Dick. ‘We can wear our bathing costumes all day long then if we want to.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
Timmy can come in at meal-times without being sent out whenever he moves,’ said
George. ‘He’s been sent out every single meal-time this week, just because he
snapped at the flies that came near him. Father goes absolutely mad if Timmy
suddenly snaps at a fly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shame!’
said Anne, and patted Timmy’s rough-haired back. ‘You can snap at every single
fly you like, Timmy, when we’re on our own.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, gratefully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
won’t be time for any adventure these hols,’ said Dick, regretfully, as they
walked down the lane to Kirrin Cottage. Red poppies danced along the way, and
in the distance the sea shone as blue as cornflowers. ‘Only two weeks - and
back we go to school! Well, let’s hope the weather keeps fine. I want to bathe
six times a day!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
they were all sitting round the tea-table at Kirrin Cottage, and their Aunt
Fanny was handing round plates of her nicest scones and tea-cake. She was very
pleased to see her nephews and niece again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
George will be happy,’ she said, smiling at the hungry four. ‘She’s been going
about like a bear with a sore head the last week or two. Have another scone,
Dick? Take two while you’re about it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
idea,’ said Dick, and helped himself. ‘Nobody makes scones and cakes like you
do, Aunt Fanny. Where’s Uncle Quentin?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘In
his study,’ said his aunt. ‘He knows it’s tea-time, and he’s heard the bell,
but I expect he’s buried in something or other. I’ll have to fetch him in a
minute. I honestly believe he’d go without food all day long if I didn’t go and
drag him into the dining-room!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here
he is,’ said Julian, hearing the familiar impatient footsteps coming down the
hall to the dining-room. The door was flung open. Uncle Quentin stood there, a
newspaper in his hand, scowling. He didn’t appear to see the children at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
here, Fanny!’ he shouted. ‘See what they’ve put in this paper - the very thing
I gave orders was NOT to be put in! The dolts! The idiots! The...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Quentin!
Whatever’s the matter?’ said his wife. ‘Look - here are the children - they’ve
just arrived.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Uncle Quentin simply didn’t see any of the four children at all. He went on
glaring at the paper. He rapped at it with his hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
we’ll get the place full of reporters wanting to see me, and wanting to know
all about my new ideas!’ he said, beginning to shout. ‘See what they’ve said!
“This eminent scientist conducts all his experiments and works out all his
ideas at his home, Kirrin Cottage. Here are his stack of notebooks, to which
are now added two more - fruits of his visit to America, and here at his
cottage are his amazing diagrams,” and so on and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
tell you, Fanny, we’ll have hordes of reporters down.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
we shan’t, dear,’ said his wife. ‘And, anyway, we are soon off to Spain. Do sit
down and have some tea. And look, can’t you say a word to welcome Julian, Dick
and Anne?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Uncle
Quentin grunted and sat down. ‘I didn’t know they were coming,’ he said, and
helped himself to a scone. ‘You might have told me, Fanny.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
told you three times yesterday and twice today,’ said his wife.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
suddenly squeezed her uncle’s arm. She was sitting next to him. ‘You’re just
the same as ever, Uncle Quentin,’ she said. ‘You never, never remember we’re
coming! Shall we go away again?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Her
uncle looked down at her and smiled. His temper never lasted very long. He
grinned at Julian and Dick. ‘Well, here you are again!’ he said. ‘Do you think
you can hold the fort for me while I’m away with your aunt?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Rather!’
said all three together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
keep everyone at bay!’ said Julian. ‘With Timmy’s help. I’ll put up a notice:
“Beware, very fierce dog”.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, sounding delighted. He thumped his tail on the floor. A fly came by
his nose and he snapped at it. Uncle Quentin frowned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Have
another scone, Father?’ said George hurriedly. ‘When are you and Mother going
to Spain?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Tomorrow,’
said her mother firmly. ‘Now don’t look like that, Quentin. You know perfectly
well it’s been arranged for weeks, and you need a holiday, and if we don’t go
tomorrow all our arrangements will be upset.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you might have warned me it was tomorrow,’ said her husband, looking indignant.
‘I mean - I’ve all my notebooks to check and put away, and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Quentin,
I’ve told you heaps of times that we leave on September the third,’ said his
wife, still more firmly. ‘I want a holiday, too. The four children will be
quite all right here with Timmy - they’ll love being on their own. Julian is
almost grown-up now and he can cope with anything that turns up.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
snapped twice at a fly, and Uncle Quentin jumped. ‘If that dog does that
again,’ he began, but his wife interrupted him at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There,
you see! You’re as touchy and nervy as can be, Quentin, dear. It will do you
good to get away - and the children will have a lovely two weeks on their own.
Nothing can possibly happen, so make up your mind to leave tomorrow with an
easy mind!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nothing
can possibly happen? Aunt Fanny was wrong of course. Anything could happen when
the Five were left on their own!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
really was very difficult to get Uncle Quentin off the next day. He was shut up
in his study until the last possible moment, sorting out his precious
notebooks. The taxi arrived and hooted outside the gate. Aunt Fanny, who had
been ready for a long time, went and rapped at the study door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Quentin!
Unlock the door! You really must come. We shall lose the plane if we don’t go
now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Just
one minute!’ shouted back her husband. Aunt Fanny looked at the four children
in despair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
the fourth time he’s called out “Just one minute”,’ said George. The telephone
shrilled out just then, and she picked up the receiver.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
she said. ‘No, I’m afraid you can’t see him. He’s off to Spain, and nobody will
know where he is for the next two weeks. What’s that? Wait a minute - I’ll ask
my mother.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who
is it?’ said her mother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
the Daily Clarion,’ said George. ‘They want to send a reporter down to
interview Daddy. I told them he was going to Spain - and they said could they
publish that?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course,’ said her mother, thankfully, ‘Once that’s in the papers nobody will
ring up and worry you. Say, yes, George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
said yes, the taxi hooted more loudly than ever, and Timmy barked madly at the
hooting. The study door was flung open and Uncle Quentin stood in the doorway,
looking as black as thunder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
can’t I have a little peace and quiet when I’m doing important work?’ he began.
But his wife made a dart at him and dragged him down the hall. She put his hat
in one hand, and would have put his stick into the other if he hadn’t been
carrying a heavy despatch case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
not doing important work, you’re off on a holiday,’ she said. ‘Oh, Quentin,
you’re worse than ever! What’s that case in your hand? Surely you are not
taking work away with you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
taxi hooted again, and Timmy woofed just behind Uncle Quentin. He jumped
violently, and the telephone rang loudly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
another reporter coming down to see you, Father,’ said George. ‘Better go
quickly!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Whether
that bit of news really did make Uncle Quentin decide at last to go, nobody
knew - but in two seconds he was sitting in the taxi, still clutching his
despatch case, telling the taxi-driver exactly what he thought of people who
kept hooting their horns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good-bye,
dears,’ called Aunt Fanny, thankfully. ‘Don’t get into mischief. We’re off at
last.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
taxi disappeared down the lane. ‘Poor Mother!’ said George. ‘It’s always like
this when they go for a holiday. Well, there’s one thing certain - I shall
NEVER marry a scientist.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
heaved a sigh of relief at the thought that Uncle Quentin was gone. When he was
over-worked he really was impossible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Still,
you simply have to make excuses for anyone with a brain like his,’ said Julian.
‘Whenever our science master at school speaks of him, he almost holds his
breath with awe. Worst of it is, he expects me to be brilliant because I’ve got
a brilliant uncle.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
It’s difficult to live up to clever relations,’ said Dick. ‘Well - we’re on our
own, except for Joan. Good old Joan! I bet she’ll give us some smashing meals.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
go and see if she’s got anything we can have now,’ said George. ‘I’m hungry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
am I,’ said Dick. They marched down the hall into the kitchen, calling for
Joan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now,
you don’t need to tell me what you’ve come for,’ said Joan, the smiling,
good-tempered cook. ‘And I don’t need to tell you this - the larder’s locked.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
Joan - what a mean thing to do!’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Mean
or not, it’s the only thing to do when all four of you are around, to say
nothing of that great hungry dog,’ said Joan, rolling out some pastry
vigorously. ‘Why, last holidays I left a meat pie and half a tongue and a
cherry tart and trifle sitting on the shelves for the next day’s meals - and
when I came back from my half-day’s outing there wasn’t a thing to be seen.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we thought you’d left them there for our supper,’ said Julian, sounding quite
hurt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right - but you won’t get the chance of thinking anything like that again,’
said Joan, firmly. ‘That larder door’s going to be kept locked. Maybe I’ll
unlock it sometimes and hand you out a snack or two - but I’m the one that’s
going to unlock it, not you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four drifted out of the kitchen again, disappointed. Timmy followed at their
heels. ‘Let’s go down and have a bathe,’ said Dick. ‘If I’m going to have six
bathes a day, I’d better hurry up and have my first one.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
get some ripe plums,’ said Anne. ‘We can take those down with us. And I expect
the ice-cream man will come along to the beach too. We shan’t starve! And we’d
better wear our shirts and shorts over our bathing costumes, so we don’t catch
too much sun.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
they were all down on the sand. They found a good place and scraped out
comfortable holes to sit in. Timmy scraped his own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can’t imagine why Timmy bothers to scrape one,’ said George. ‘Because he always
squeezes into mine sooner or later. Don’t you, Timmy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
wagged his tail, and scraped so violently that they were all covered with sand.
‘Pooh!’ said Anne, spitting sand out of her mouth. ‘Stop it, Timmy. As fast as
I scrape my hole, you fill it up!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
paused to give her a lick, and then scraped again, making a very deep hole
indeed. He lay down in it, panting, his mouth looking as if he were smiling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
smiling again,’ said Anne. ‘I never knew a dog that smiled like Timmy. Timmy,
it’s nice to have you again.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, politely, meaning that it was nice to have Anne and the others back
again, too. He wagged his tail and sent a shower of sand over Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all wriggled down comfortably into their soft warm holes. ‘We’ll eat the plums
first and then we’ll have a bathe,’ said Dick. ‘Chuck me one, Anne.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Two
people came slowly along the beach. Dick looked at them out of half-closed
eyes. A boy and a man - and what a ragamuffin the boy looked! He wore tom dirty
shorts and a filthy jersey. No shoes at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
man looked even worse. He slouched as he came, and dragged one foot. He had a
straggly moustache and mean, clever little eyes that raked the beach up and
down. The two were walking at high-water mark and were obviously looking for
anything that might have been cast up by the tide. The boy already had an old
box, one wet shoe and some wood under his arm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
a pair!’ said Dick to Julian. ‘I hope they don’t come near us. I feel as if I
can smell them from here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two walked along the beach and then back. Then, to the children’s horror, they
made a bee-line for where they were lying in their sandy holes, and sat down
close beside them. Timmy growled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An
unpleasant, unwashed kind of smell at once came to the children’s noses. Pooh!
Timmy growled again. The boy took no notice of Timmy’s growling. But the man
looked uneasy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on - let’s have a bathe,’ said Julian, annoyed at the way the two had sat down
so close to them. After all, there was practically the whole of the beach to
choose from - why come and sit almost on top of somebody else?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
they came back from their bathe the man had gone, but the boy was still there -
and he had actually sat himself down in George’s hole.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Get
out,’ said George, shortly, her temper rising at once. ‘That’s my hole, and you
jolly well know it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Findings
keepings,’ said the boy, in a curious singsong voice. ‘It’s my hole now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
bent down and pulled the boy roughly out of the hole. He was up in a trice, his
fists clenched. George clenched hers, too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
came up at a run. ‘Now, George - if there’s any fighting to be done, I’ll do
it,’ he said. He turned to the scowling boy. ‘Clear off! We don’t want you
here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boy hit out with his right fist and caught Dick unexpectedly on the jawbone.
Dick looked astounded. He hit out, too, and sent the tousle-headed boy flying.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yah,
coward!’ said the boy, holding his chin tenderly. ‘Hitting someone smaller than
yourself! I’ll fight that first boy, but I won’t fight you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
can’t fight him,’ said Dick. ‘He’s a girl. You can’t fight girls - and girls
oughtn’t to fight, anyway.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ses
you!’ said the dirty little ragamuffin, standing up and doubling his fists
again. ‘Well, you look here - I’m a girl, too - so I can fight her all right,
can’t I?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
and the ragamuffin stood scowling at one another, each with fists clenched.
They looked so astonishingly alike, with their short, curly hair, brown
freckled faces and fierce expressions that Julian suddenly roared with
laughter. He pushed them firmly apart.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Fighting
forbidden!’ he said. He turned ta the ragamuffin. ‘Clear off!’ he ordered. ‘Do
you hear me? Go on - off with you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
gipsy-like girl stared at him. Then she suddenly burst into tears and ran off
howling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She’s
a girl all right,’ said Dick, grinning at the howls. ‘She’s got some spunk
though, facing up to me like that. Well, that’s the last we’ll see of her!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
he was wrong. It wasn’t!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
five curled up in their holes once more. Dick felt his jaw-bone. ‘That
ragamuffin of a girl gave me a good bang,’ he said, half-admiringly. ‘Little
demon, isn’t she! A bit of live wire!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can’t see why Julian wouldn’t let me have a go at her,’ said George sulkily.
‘It was my hole she sat in - she meant to be annoying! How dare she?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Girls
can’t go about fighting,’ said Dick. ‘Don’t be an ass, George. I know you make
out you’re as good as a boy, and you dress like a boy and climb trees as well
as I can - but it’s really time you gave up thinking you’re as good as a boy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
sort of speech didn’t please George at all. ‘Well, anyway, I don’t burst into
howls if I’m beaten,’ she said, turning her back on Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
you don’t,’ agreed Dick. ‘You’ve got as much spunk as any boy - much more than
that other kid had. I’m sorry I sent her flying now. It’s the first time I’ve
ever hit a girl, and I hope it’ll be the last.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
jolly glad you hit her,’ said George. ‘She’s a nasty little beast. If I see her
again I’ll tell her what I think of her.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
you won’t,’ said Dick. ‘Not if I’m there, anyway. She had her punishment when I
sent her flying.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
shut up arguing, you two,’ said Anne, and sent a shower of sand over them.
‘George, don’t go into one of your moods, for goodness’ sake - we don’t want to
waste a single day of this two weeks.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here’s
the ice-cream man,’ said Julian, sitting up and feeling for the waterproof
pocket in the belt of his bathing trunks. ‘Let’s have one each.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, and thumped his tail on the sand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
all right - one for you, too,’ said Dick. ‘Though what sense there is in giving
you one, I don’t know. One lick, one swallow, and it’s gone. It might be a fly
for all you taste of it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
gulped his ice-cream down at once and then went into George’s hole, squeezing
beside her, hoping for a lick of her ice, too. But she pushed him away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
Timmy. Ice-cream’s wasted on you! You can’t even have a lick of mine. And do
get back into your hole - you’re making me frightfully hot.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
obligingly got out and went into Anne’s hole. She gave him a little bit of her
ice-cream. He sat panting beside her, looking longingly at the rest of the ice.
‘You’re melting it with your hot breath,’ said Anne. ‘Go into Julian’s hole now!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
five of them had a thoroughly lazy morning. As none of them had a watch they
went in far too early for lunch, and were shooed out again by Joan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
you can come in at ten past twelve for a one o’clock lunch, I don’t know!’ she
scolded. ‘I haven’t even finished the housework yet.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- it felt like one o’clock,’ said Anne, disappointed to find there was so long
to wait. Still, when lunch-time came, Joan really did them well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Cold
ham and tongue - cold baked beans - beetroot - crisp lettuce straight from the
garden - heaps of tomatoes - cucumber - hard-boiled egg!’ recited Anne in glee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Just
the kind of meal I like,’ said Dick, sitting down. ‘What’s for pudding?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
it is on the sideboard,’ said Anne. ‘Wobbly blancmange, fresh fruit salad and
jelly. I’m glad I’m hungry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
don’t you give Timmy any of that ham and tongue,’ Joan warned George. ‘I’ve got
a fine bone for him. Coming, Timmy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
knew the word ‘bone’ very well indeed. He trotted after Joan at once, his feet
sounding loudly in the hall. They heard Joan talking kindly to him in the
kitchen as she found him his bone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
old Joan,’ said Dick. ‘She’s like Timmy - her bark is worse than her bite.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy’s
got a good bite, though,’ said George, helping herself to three tomatoes at
once. ‘And his bite came in useful heaps of times for us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
ate steadily, thinking of some of the hair-raising adventures they had had,
when Timmy and his bite had certainly come in very useful. Timmy came in after
a while, licking his lips.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nothing
doing, old chap,’ said Dick, looking at the empty dishes on the table. ‘Don’t
tell me you’ve chomped up that bone already!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
had. He lay down under the table, and put his nose on his paws. He was happy.
He had had a good meal, and he was with the people he loved best. He put his
head as near George’s feet as he could.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Your
whiskers are tickling me,’ she said, and screwed up her bare toes. ‘Pass the
tomatoes, someone.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
can’t manage any more tomatoes, surely!’ said Anne. ‘You’ve had five already.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They’re
out of my own garden,’ said George, ‘so I can eat as many as I like.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
lunch they lazed on the beach till it was time for a bathe again. It was a
happy day for all of them - warm, lazy, with plenty of fun and romping about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
looked out for the ragamuffin girl, but she didn’t appear again. George was
half sorry. She would have liked a battle of words with her, even if she
couldn’t have a fight!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
were all very tired when they went to bed that night. Julian yawned so loudly
when Joan came in with a jug of hot cocoa and some biscuits that she offered to
lock up the house for him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
no, thank you, Joan,’ said Julian at once. ‘That’s the man’s job, you know,
locking up the house. You can trust me all right. I’ll see to every window and
every door.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,
Master Julian,’ said Joan, and bustled away<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>
to wind up the kitchen clock, rake out the fire, and go up to bed. The children
went up, too, Timmy, as usual, at George’s heels. Julian was left downstairs to
lock up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was a very responsible boy. Joan knew that he wouldn’t leave a single window
unfastened. She heard him trying to shut the little window in the pantry, and
she called down:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Master
Julian! It’s swollen or something, and won’t shut properly. You needn’t bother
about it, it’s too small for anyone to get into!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right!’
said Julian, thankfully, and went upstairs. He yawned a terrific yawn again,
and set Dick off, too, as soon as he came into the bedroom they both shared.
The girls, undressing in the next room, laughed to hear them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
wouldn’t hear a burglar in the middle of the night, Julian and Dick!’ called
Anne. ‘You’ll sleep like logs!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Old
Timmy can listen out for burglars,’ said Julian, cleaning his teeth vigorously.
‘That’s his job, not mine. Isn’t it, Timmy?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, clambering on to George’s bed. He always slept curled up in the
crook of her knees. Her mother had given up trying to insist that George didn’t
have Timmy on her bed at night. As George said, even if she agreed to that,
Timmy wouldn’t!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
stayed awake for more than five seconds. Nobody even said anything in bed,
except for a sleepy good night. Timmy gave a little grunt and settled down,
too, his head on George’s feet. It was heavy, but she liked it there. She put out
a hand and stroked Timmy gently. He licked one of her feet through the
bed-clothes. He loved George more than anyone in the world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was dark outside that night. Thick clouds had come up and put out all the
stars. There was no sound to be heard but the wind in the trees and the distant
surge of the sea - and both sounded so much the same that it was hard to tell
the difference.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Not
another sound - not even an owl hooting to its mate, or the sound of a hedgehog
pattering in the ditch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
why did Timmy wake up? Why did he open first one eye and then another? Why did
he prick up his ears and lie there, listening? He didn’t even lift his head at
first. He simply lay listening in the darkness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
lifted his head cautiously at last. He slid off the bed as quietly as a cat. He
padded across the room and out of the door. Down the stairs he went, and into
the hall, where his claws rattled on the tiled floor. But nobody heard him.
Everyone in the house was fast asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
stood and listened in the hall. He knew he had heard something. Could it have
been a rat somewhere? Timmy lifted his nose and sniffed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then he stiffened from head to tail, and stood as if turned into stone.
Something was climbing up the wall of the house. Scrape, scrape, scrape - rustle,
rustle! Would a rat dare to do that?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Upstairs,
in her bed, Anne didn’t know why she suddenly woke up just then, but she did.
She was thirsty, and she thought she would get a drink of water. She felt for
her torch, and switched it on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
light fell on the window first, and Anne saw something that gave her a terrible
shock. She screamed loudly, and dropped her torch in fright. George woke up at
once. Timmy came bounding up the stairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian!
wailed Anne. ‘Come quickly. I saw a face at the window, a horrible, dreadful
face looking in at me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
rushed to the window, switching on her torch as she did so. There was nothing
there. Timmy went with her. He sniffed at the open window and growled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hark
- I can hear someone running quickly down the path,’ said Julian, who now
appeared with Dick. ‘Come on, Timmy - downstairs with you and after them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
down they all went - Anne too. They flung the front door wide and Timmy sped
out, barking loudly. A face at the window? He’d soon find out who it belonged
to!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four children waited at the open front door, listening to Timmy’s angry,
excited barking. Anne was trembling, and Julian put his arm round her
comfortingly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
was this dreadful face like?’ he asked her. Anne shivered in his arm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
didn’t see very much,’ she said. ‘You see, I just switched on my torch, and the
beam was directed on the window nearby - and it lighted up the face for a
second. It had nasty gleaming eyes, and it looked very dark - perhaps it was a
black man’s face! Oh, I was frightened!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Then
did it disappear?’ asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know,’ said Anne. ‘I was so frightened that I dropped my torch and the
light went out. Then George woke up and rushed to the window.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
on earth was Timmy?’ said Dick, feeling suddenly surprised that Timmy hadn’t
awakened them all by barking. Surely he must have heard the owner of the face
climbing up to the window?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know. He came rushing into the bedroom when I screamed,’ said Anne.
‘Perhaps he had heard a noise and had gone down to see what it was.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
about it,’ said Julian. ‘Never mind, Anne. It was a tramp, I expect. He found
all the doors and windows downstairs fastened - and shinned up the ivy to see
if he could enter by way of a bedroom. Timmy will get him, that’s certain.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timmy didn’t get him. He came back after a time, with his tail down, and a
puzzled look in his eyes. ‘Couldn’t you find him, Timmy?’ asked George,
anxiously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, mournfully, his tail still down. George felt him. He was wet
through.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Goodness!
Where have you been to get so wet?’ she said, in surprise. ‘Feel him, Dick.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
felt him, and so did the others. ‘He’s been in the sea,’ said Julian. ‘That’s
why he’s wet. I guess the burglar, or whatever he was, must have sprinted down
to the beach, when he knew Timmy was after him - and jumped into a boat! It was
his only chance of getting away.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
Timmy must have swum after him till he couldn’t keep up any more,’ said George.
‘Poor old Tim. So you lost him, did you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
wagged his tail a little. He looked very downhearted indeed. To think he had
heard noises and thought it was a rat - and now, whoever it was had got away
from him. Timmy felt ashamed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
shut and bolted the front door. He put up the chain, too. ‘I don’t think the
Face will come back again in a hurry,’ he said. ‘Now he knows there’s a big dog
here he’ll keep away. I don’t think we need worry any more.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went back to bed again. Julian didn’t go to sleep for some time. Although
he had told the others not to worry, he felt worried himself. He was sorry that
Anne had been frightened, and somehow the boldness of the burglar in climbing
up to a bedroom worried him, too. He must have been determined to get in
somehow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Joan,
the cook, slept through all the disturbance. Julian wouldn’t wake her. ‘No,’ he
said, ‘don’t tell her anything about it. She’d want to send telegrams to Uncle
Quentin or something.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
Joan knew nothing about the night’s happenings, and they heard her cheerfully
humming in the htchen the next morning as she cooked bacon and eggs and
tomatoes for their breakfast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
was rather ashamed of herself when she woke up and remembered the fuss she had
made. The Face was rather dim in her memory now. She half wondered if she had
dreamed it all. She asked Julian if he thought she might have had a bad dream.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Quite
likely,’ said Julian, cheerfully, very glad that Anne should think this. ‘More
than likely! I wouldn’t worry about it any more, if I were you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
didn’t tell Anne that he had examined the thickly-growing ivy outside the
window, and had found clear traces of the night-climber. Part of the sturdy
clinging ivy-stem had come away from the wall, and beneath the window were
strewn broken-off ivy leaves. Julian showed them to Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
was somebody,’ he said. ‘What a nerve he had, climbing right up to the window
like that. A real cat-burglar! ’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
were no footprints to be seen anywhere in the garden. Julian didn’t expect to
find any, for the ground was dry and hard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
day was very fine and warm again. ‘I vote we do what we did yesterday - go off
to the beach and bathe,’ said Dick. ‘We might take a picnic lunch if Joan will
give us one.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
help her to make it up for us,’ said Anne, and she and George went off to beg
for sandwiches and buns. Soon they were busy wrapping up a colossal lunch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
for twelve, I should think!’ said Joan, with a laugh. ‘Here’s a bottle of
home-made lemonade, too. You can take as many ripe plums as you like as well. I
shan’t prepare any supper for you tonight - you’ll not need it after all this
lunch.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
and Anne looked at her in alarm. No supper! Then they caught the twinkle in her
eye and laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
make all the beds and do our rooms before we go,’ said Anne. ‘And is there
anything you want from the village?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
not today. You hurry up with your jobs and get along to the beach,’ said Joan.
‘I’ll be quite glad of a peaceful day to myself. I shall turn out the larder
and the hall cupboards and the scullery, and enjoy myself in peace!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
seemed quite to have forgotten her fright of the night before as they went down
to the beach that day, chattering and laughing together. Even if she had
thought about it, something soon happened that swept everything else from her
mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
little ragamuffin girl was down on the beach again! She was alone. Her dreadful
old father, or whatever he was, was not there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
saw the girl first and scowled. Julian saw the scowl and then the girl, and
made up his mind at once. He led the others firmly to where rocks jutted up
from the beach, surrounded by limpid rock-pools.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
be here today,’ he said. ‘It’s so hot we’ll be glad of the shade from the
rocks. What about just here?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
all right,’ said George, half sulky and half amused at Julian for being so firm
about things. ‘Don’t worry. I’m not having anything more to do with that smelly
girl.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
glad to hear it,’ said Julian. They had now turned a corner, and were out of
sight of the girl. Big rocks ran in an upwards direction behind them, and
jutted up all around them. Julian sat down in a lovely little corner, with
rocks protecting them from the sun and the wind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
have a read before we bathe,’ said Dick. ‘I’ve got a mystery story here. I
simply MUST find out who the thief is.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
settled himself comfortably. Anne went to look for sea anemones in the pool.
She liked the petal-like creatures that looked so like plants and weren’t. She
liked feeding them with bits of biscuit, seeing their ‘petals’ close over the
fragment and draw them quickly inside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
lay back and stroked Timmy. Julian began to sketch the rocks around, and the
little pools. It was all very peaceful indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly
something landed on George’s middle and made her jump. She sat up, and so did
Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
was that?’ said George indignantly. ‘Did you throw something at me, Dick?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said Dick, his eyes glued to his book.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Something
else hit George on the back of the neck, and she put her hand up with an
exclamation. ‘What’s happening? Who’s throwing things?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
looked to see what had hit her. Lying on the sand was a small roundish thing.
George picked it up. ‘Why - it’s a damson stone,’ she said. And ‘Ping’! Another
one hit her on the shoulder. She leapt up in a rage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
could see nobody at all. She waited for another damson stone to appear, but
none did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
just wish I could draw your face, George,’ said Julian, with a grin. ‘I never
saw such a frown in my life. Ooch!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
‘ooch!’ was nothing to do with George’s frown; it was caused by another damson
stone that caught Julian neatly behind the ear.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He leapt to his feet too. A helpless giggle came from behind a rock some
way behind and above them. George was up on the ledge in a second.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Behind
one of the rocks sat the ragamuffin girl. Her pockets were full of damsons,
some of them spilling out as she rolled on the rocks, laughing. She sat up when
she saw George, and grinned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
do you mean, throwing those stones at us?’ demanded George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wasn’t throwing them,’ said the girl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
tell lies,’ said George scornfully. ‘You know you were.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘l
wasn’t. I was just spitting them,’ said the awful girl. ‘Watch!’ She slipped a
stone into her mouth, took a deep breath and then spat out the stone. It flew
straight at George and hit her sharply and squarely on the nose. George looked
so extremely surprised that Dick and Julian roared with laughter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Bet
I can spit stones farther than any of you,’ said the ragamuffin. ‘Have some of
my damsons and see.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right!’
said Dick promptly. ‘If you win I’ll buy you an ice-cream. If I do, you can
clear off from here and not bother us any more. See?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said the girl, and her eyes gleamed and danced. ‘But I shall win!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
came slowly back from her pool, wondering why the others were up on the rocks.
Damson stones began to rain round her. She stopped in astonishment. Surely -
surely it couldn’t be the others doing that? A stone hit her on her bare arm,
and she squealed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
ragamuffin girl won handsomely. She managed to get her stones at least three
feet farther than Dick. She lay back, laughing, her teeth gleaming very white
indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
owe me an ice-cream,’ she said, in her sing-song voice. Julian wondered if she
was Welsh. Dick looked at her, marvelling that she managed to get her stones so
far.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
buy you the ice-cream, don’t worry,’ he said. ‘Nobody’s ever beaten me before
like that, not even Stevens, a boy at school with a most enormous mouth.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
do think you really are dreadful,’ said Anne. ‘Go and buy her the ice-cream and
tell her to go home.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
going to eat it here,’ said the girl, and she suddenly looked exactly as mulish
and obstinate as George did when she wanted something she didn’t think she
would get.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
look like George now!’ said Dick, and immediately wished he hadn’t. George
glared at him, furious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What!
That nasty, rude tangly-haired girl like me!’ stormed George. ‘Pooh! I can’t
bear to go near her.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shut
up,’ said Dick, shortly. The girl looked surprised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
does she mean'?’ she asked Dick. ‘Am I nasty? You’re as rude as I am, anyway.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
an ice-cream man,’ said Julian, afraid that the hot-tempered George would fly
at the girl and slap her. He whistled to the man, who came to the edge of the
rocks and handed out six ice-creams.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here
you are,’ said Julian, handing one to the girl. ‘You eat that up and go.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all sat and ate ice-creams, George still scowling. Timmy gulped his at once as
usual. ‘Look - he’s had all his,’ marvelled the girl. ‘I call that a waste.
Here, boy - have a bit of mine!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
George’s annoyance, Timmy licked up the bit of ice-cream thrown to him by the
girl. How could Timmy accept anything from her?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
couldn’t help being amused by this queer, bold little girl, with her tangled
short hair and sharp darting eyes. He suddenly saw something that made him feel
uncomfortable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
her chin the girl had a big black bruise. ‘I say,’ said Dick, ‘I didn’t give
you that bruise yesterday, did I?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
bruise? Oh, this one on my chin?’ said the girl, touching it. ‘Yes, that’s
where you hit me when you sent me flying. I don’t mind. I’ve had plenty worse
ones from my Dad.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
sorry I hit you,’ said Dick, awkwardly. ‘I honestly thought you were a boy.
What’s your name?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Jo,’
said the girl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
that’s a boy’s name,’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So’s
George. But you said she was a girl,’ said Jo, licking the last bits of
ice-cream from her fingers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
but George is short for Georgina,’ said Anne. ‘What’s Jo short for?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
know,’ said Jo. ‘I never heard. All I know is I’m a girl and my name is Jo.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
probably short for Josephine,’ said Julian. They all stared at the possible
Josephine. The short name of Jo certainly suited her - but not the long and
pretty name of Josephine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
really queer,’ said Anne, at last, ‘but Jo is awfully like you, George - same
short curly hair - only Jo’s is terribly messy and tangly - same freckles,
dozens of them - same turned-up nose...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Same
way of sticking her chin up in the air, same scowl, same glare!’ said Dick.
George put on her fiercest glare at these remarks, which she didn’t like at
all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
all I can say I hope I haven’t her layers of dirt and her sm -’ she began,
angrily. But Dick stopped her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She’s
probably not got any soap or hair-brush or anything. She’d be all right cleaned
up. Don’t be unkind, George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
turned her back. How could Dick stick up for that awful girl? ‘Isn’t she ever
going?’ she said. ‘Or is she going to park herself on us all day long?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
go when I want to,’ said Jo, and put on a scowl, so exactly like George’s that
Julian and Dick laughed in surprise. Jo laughed, too, but George clenched her
fists furiously. Anne looked on in distress. She wished Jo would go, then
everything would be all right again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
like that dog,’ said Jo, suddenly, and she leaned over to where Timmy lay
beside George. She patted him with a hand that was like a little brown paw.
George swung round.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
touch my dog!’ she said. ‘He doesn’t like you, either!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
but he does,’ said Jo, surprisingly. ‘All dogs like me. So do cats. I can make
your dog come to me as easy as anything.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Try!’
said George, scornfully. ‘He won’t go to you! Will you, Tim?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
didn’t move. She began to make a queer little whining noise down in her throat,
like a forlorn puppy. Timmy pricked up his ears at once. He looked inquiringly
at Jo. Jo stopped making the noise and held out her hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
looked at it and turned away - but when he heard the whining again he got up,
listening. He stared intently at Jo. Was this a kind of dog-girl, that she
could so well speak his language?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
flung herself on her face and went on with the small, whining noises that
sounded as if she were a small dog in pain or sorrow. Timmy walked over to her
and sat down, his head on one side, puzzled. Then he suddenly bent down and
licked the girl’s half-hidden face. She sat up at once and put her arms round
Timmy’s neck.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
here, Timmy,’ said George, jealously. Timmy shook off the brown arms that held
him and walked over to George at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘See?
I made him come to me and give me one of his best licks! I can do that to any
dog.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
can you?’ asked Dick, in wonder. He had never seen Timmy make friends before
with anyone who was disliked by George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know, really,’ said Jo, pushing back her hair again, as she sat up. ‘I
reckon it’s in the family. My mother was in a circus, and she trained dogs for
the ring. We had dozens - lovely they were. I loved them all.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
is your mother?’ asked Julian. ‘Is she still in the circus?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
She died,’ said Jo. ‘And I left the circus with my Dad. We’ve got a caravan.
Dad was an acrobat till he hurt his foot.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four children remembered how the man had dragged his foot as he walked. They
looked silently at dirty little Jo. What a strange life she must have led!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She’s
dirty, she’s probably very good at telling lies and thieving, but she’s got
pluck,’ thought Julian. ‘Still, I’ll be glad when she goes.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wish I hadn’t given her that awful bruise,’ thought Dick. ‘I wonder what she’d
be like cleaned up and brushed? She looks as if a little kindness would do her
good.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
sorry for her, but I don’t much like her,’ thought Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t believe a word she says!’ thought George angrily. ‘Not one word! She’s a
humbug. And I’m ashamed of Timmy for going to her. I feel very cross with him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
your father?’ asked Julian at last.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gone
off somewhere to meet somebody,’ said Jo vaguely. ‘I’m glad. He was in one of
his tempers this morning. I went and hid under the caravan.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a silence. ‘Can I stay with you today till my Dad comes back?’ said Jo
suddenly, in her sing-song voice. ‘I’ll wash myself if you like. I’m all alone
today.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
We don’t want you,’ said George, feeling as if she really couldn’t bear Jo any
longer. ‘Do we, Anne?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
didn’t like hurting anyone. She hesitated. ‘Well,’ she said at last, ‘perhaps
Jo had better go.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Julian. ‘It’s time you scooted off now, Jo. You’ve had a long time with
us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
looked at Dick with mournful eyes, and touched the bruise on her chin as if it
hurt her. Dick felt most uncomfortable again. He looked round at the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
you think she could stay and share our picnic?’ he said. ‘After all - she can’t
help being dirty and - and...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
all right,’ said Jo, suddenly scrambling up. ‘I’m going! There’s my Dad!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
saw the man in the distance, dragging his foot as he walked. He caught sight of
Jo and gave a shrill and piercing whistle. Jo made a face at them all, an
impudent, ugly, insolent face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t like you!’ she said. Then she pointed at Dick. ‘I only like him - he’s
nice. Yah to the rest of you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
off she went like a hare over the sand, her bare feet hardly touching the
ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
an extraordinary girl!’ said Julian. ‘l don’t feel we’ve seen the last of her
yet!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>WHAT
HAPPENED IN THE NIGHT?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>That
night Anne began to look rather scared as darkness fell. She was remembering
the Face at the Window!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
won’t come again, Ju, will it?’ she said to her big brother half a dozen times.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
Anne. But if you like I’ll come and lie down on George’s bed instead of George
tonight, and stay with you all night long,’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
considered this and then shook her head. ‘No. I think I’d almost rather have
George and Timmy. I mean - George and I - and even you - might be scared of
Faces, but Timmy wouldn’t. He’d simply leap at them.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
quite right,’ said Julian. ‘He would. All right then, I won’t keep you company
- but you’ll see, nothing whatever will happen tonight. Anyway, if you like,
we’ll all close our bedroom windows and fasten them, even if we are too hot for
anything - then we’ll know nobody can possibily get in.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
that night Julian not only closed all the doors and windows downstairs as he
had done the night before (except the tiny pantry window that wouldn’t shut),
but he also shut and fastened all the ones upstairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
about Joan’s window ?’ asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She
always sleeps with it shut, summer and winter,’ said Julian, with a grin.
‘Country folk often do. They think the night air’s dangerous. Now you’ve
nothing at all to worry about, silly.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
Anne went to bed with her mind at rest. George drew the curtains across their
window so that even if the Face came again they wouldn’t be able to see it!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let
Timmy out for me, Julian, will you?’ called George. ‘Anne doesn’t want me to
leave her, even to take old Timmy out for his last walk. Just open the door and
let him out. He’ll come in when he’s ready.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right!’
called Julian, and opened the front door Timmy trotted out, tail wagging. He
loved his last sniff round. He liked to smell the trail of the hedgehog who was
out on his night-rounds; he liked to put his nose down a rabbit-hole and listen
to stirrings down below; and he loved to follow the meanderings of rats and mice
round by the thick hedges.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Isn’t
Timmy in yet?’ called George from the top of the stairs. ‘Do call him, Ju. I
want to get into bed. Anne’s half-asleep already.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’ll
be in in a moment,’ said Julian, who wanted to finish his book. ‘Don’t fuss.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
no Timmy had appeared even when he had finished his book. Julian went to the
door and whistled. He listened for Timmy to come. Then, hearing nothing, he
whistled once more.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
time he heard the sound of pattering footsteps coming up the path to the door.
‘Oh there you are, Tim,’ said Julian. ‘What have you been up to? Chasing
rabbits or something?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timothy
wagged his tail feebly. He didn’t jump up at Julian as he usually did. ‘You
look as if you’ve been up to some mischief, Tim,’ said Julian. ‘Go on - up to
bed with you - and mind you bark if you hear the smallest sound in the night.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, in rather a subdued voice, and went upstairs. He climbed on to
George’s bed and sighed heavily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
a sigh!’ said George. ‘And what have you been eating, Timmy? Pooh - you’ve dug
up some frightful old bone, I know you have. I’ve a good mind to push you off
my bed. I suppose you suddenly remembered one you buried months ago. Pooh!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
wouldn’t be pushed off the bed. He settled down to sleep, his nose on George’s
feet as usual. He snored a little, and woke George in about half an hour.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shut
up, Timmy,’ she said, pushing him with her feet. Anne woke up, alarmed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
is it, George?’ she whispered, her heart thumping.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nothing.
Only Timmy snoring. Hark at him. He won’t stop,’ said George, irritated. ‘Wake
up, Timmy, and stop snoring.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
moved sleepily and settled down again. He stopped snoring and George and Anne
fell sound asleep. Julian woke once, thinking he heard something fall - but hearing
Timmy gently snoring again through the open doors of the two rooms, he lay
down, his mind at rest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
the noise had really been a noise Timmy would have heard it, no doubt about
that. George always said that Timmy slept with one ear open.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
heard nothing more till Joan went downstairs at seven o’clock. He heard her go
into the kitchen and do something to the kitchen grate. He turned over and fell
asleep again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was wakened suddenly twenty minutes later by loud screams from downstairs. He
sat up and then leapt out of bed at once. He rushed downstairs. Dick followed
him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
at this! The master’s study - turned upside down - those drawers ransacked! The
safe’s open, too. Mercy me, who’s been here in the night - with all the doors
locked and bolted, too!’ Joan wailed loudly and wrung her hands as she gazed at
the untidy room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
say!’ said Dick, horrified. ‘Someone’s been searching for something pretty
thoroughly! Even got the safe open - and wrenched the drawers out.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
did he get in?’ said Julian, feeling bewildered. He went round the house,
looking at doors and windows. Except for the kitchen door, which Joan said she
had unlocked and unbolted herself as soon as she came down, not a window or
door had been touched. All were fastened securely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
came down, looking scared. ‘What’s the matter?’ she said. But Julian brushed
her aside. How did that burglar get in? That was what he wanted to know.
Through one of the upstairs windows, he supposed - one that somebody had opened
last night after he had fastened it. Perhaps in the girls’ room?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
no - not one window was open. All were fastened securely, including Joan’s.
Then a thought struck him as he looked into George’s room. Why hadn’t Timmy
barked? After all, there must have been quite a bit of noise, however quiet the
thief had been. He had himself heard something and had awakened. Why hadn’t
Timmy, then?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was trying to pull Timmy off the bed. ‘Ju, Ju! There’s something wrong with
Timmy. He won’t wake up!’ she cried. ‘He’s breathing so heavily, too - just
listen to him! And what’s the matter downstairs? What’s happened?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
told her shortly while he examined Timmy. ‘Somebody got in last night - your
father’s study’s in the most awful mess - absolutely ransacked from top to bottom,
safe and all. Goodness knows how the fellow got in to do it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
awful!’ said George, looking very pale. ‘And now something’s wrong with Tim. He
didn’t wake up last night when the burglar came - he’s ill, Julian!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
he’s not. He’s been doped,’ said Julian, pulling back Timmy’s eyelids. ‘So
that’s why he was so long outside last night! Somebody gave him some meat or
something with dope in - some kind of drug. And he ate it, and slept so soundly
that he never heard a thing - and isn’t even awake yet.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
Julian - will he be all right?’ asked George anxiously, stroking Timmy’s
motionless body. ‘But how could he take any food from a stranger in the night?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Maybe
he picked it up - the burglar may have flung it down hoping that Timmy would
eat it, said Julian. ‘Now I understand why he looked so sheepish when he came
in. He didn’t even jump up and lick me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
dear - Timmy, do, do wake up,’ begged poor George, and she shook the big dog
gently. He groaned a little and snuggled down again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Leave
him,’ said Julian. ‘He’ll be all right. He’s not poisoned, only drugged. Come
down and see the damage!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was horrified at the state of her father’s study. ‘They were after his two
special books of American notes, I’m sure they were,’ she said. ‘Father said
that any other country in the world would be glad to have those. Whatever are
we to do?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Better
get in the police,’ said Julian, gravely. ‘We can’t manage this sort of thing
ourselves. And do you know your father’s address in Spain?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
wailed George. ‘He and Mother said they were going to have a real holiday this
time - no letters to be forwarded, and no address left till they had been
settled somewhere for a few days. Then they’d telegraph it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we’ll certainly have to get the police in, then,’ said Julian, looking rather
white and stern. George glanced at him. He seemed suddenly very grown-up
indeed. She watched him go out of the room. He went into the hall and rang up
the police station. Joan was very relieved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
get in the police, that’s what we ought to do,’ she said. ‘There’s that nice
Constable Wilkins, and that other one with the red face, what’s he called - Mr.
Donaldson. I’ll be making some coffee for them when they come.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
cheered up considerably at the thought of handing out cups of her good hot
coffee to two interested policemen, who would ask her plenty of questions that
she would be only too delighted to answer. She bustled off to the kitchen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four children stared silently at the ruins of the study. What a mess! Could it
ever be cleared up? Nobody would know what was gone till Uncle Quentin came
back. How furious he would be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hope nothing very important has been taken,’ said Dick. ‘It looks as if
somebody knew there was something valuable here, and meant to get it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
has probably got it,’ said Julian. ‘Hallo - that must be the police! Come on -
I can see it will be a long time before we get our breakfast this morning!’<span

IN THE HOUSE<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
police were very, very thorough. The children got tired of them long before
lunch-time; Joan didn’t. She made them cups of coffee and put some of her
homemade buns on a plate and sent Anne to pick up ripe plums. She felt proud to
think that it was she who had discovered the ransacked study.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
were two policemen. One was a sergeant, rather solemn and very correct. He
interviewed each of the children and asked them exactly the same questions. The
other man went over the study bit by bit, very thoroughly indeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Looking
for finger-prints, I suppose,’ said Anne. ‘Oh dear - when can we go and bathe?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
thing that puzzled everyone, the police included, was - how did the thief or
thieves get in? Both policemen went round the house, slowly and deliberately
trying every door and window still locked or fastened. They stood and looked at
the pantry window for some time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Got
in there, I suppose,’ said one of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Must
have been as small as a monkey then,’ said the other. He turned to Anne, who
was the smallest of the four children. ‘Could you squeeze through there, Missy,
do you think?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said Anne. ‘But I’ll try if you like.’ So she tried - but she stuck fast before
she got even half-way through, and Julian had to pull hard to get her down
again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Have
you any idea what has been stolen, sir?’ the sergeant asked Julian, who seemed
extraordinarily grownup that morning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
sergeant - none of us has,’ said Julian. ‘Not even George here, who knows her
father’s work better than any of us. The only thing we know is that my uncle
went to America to lecture a short time ago - and he brought back two
notebooks, full of valuable diagrams and notes. He did say that other countries
might be very glad to get hold of those. I expect they were in that safe.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- they’ll certainly be gone then,’ said the sergeant, shutting his own fat
notebook with a snap. ‘Pity when people leave such things in an ordinary safe -
and then go off without leaving an address. Can’t we possibly get in touch with
him? This may be terribly important.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
know,’ said Julian, looking worried. ‘We shall have an address in a day or two
- but I honestly don’t see how we can get in touch before then.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said the sergeant. ‘Well - we’ll go now - but we'll bring back a photographer
with us after lunch to photograph the room - then your cook can tidy it up. I
know she’s longing to.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Coming
back again!’ said Anne, when the two men had solemnly walked down the path,
mounted very solid-looking bicycles, and gone sailing down the lane. ‘Good
gracious! Have we got to answer questions all over again?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we’ll go down to the beach and take a boat and go rowing,’ said Julian, with a
laugh. ‘We’ll be out of reach then. I don’t see that we can give them any more
help. I must say it’s all very peculiar - I wish to goodness I knew how the
thief got in.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
had been very quiet and subdued all the morning. She had worried about Timmy,
fearing that he had been poisoned, and not merely drugged, as Julian had said.
But Timmy was now quite recovered, except that he seemed a bit sleepy still,
and not inclined to gambol round in his usual ridiculous way. He looked
extremely sheepish, too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can’t think why Timmy looks like that,’ said George, puzzled. ‘He usually only
puts that look on when he’s done something he’s ashamed of - or got into
mischief. He couldn’t possibly know, could he, that whatever he picked up and
ate last night was something he shouldn’t eat?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said Dick. ‘He’s sensible though, I think, not to touch poisoned meat - but he
couldn’t know if some harmless sleeping powder had been put into anything. It
might have no smell and no taste. Perhaps he’s just ashamed of being so
sleepy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
only he’d been awake!’ groaned George. ‘He would have heard any noise
downstairs at once - and he’d have barked and waked us all, and flown
downstairs himself to attack whoever was there! Why, oh why didn’t I take him
out myself last night as I usually do?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
was a chapter of accidents,’ said Julian. ‘You didn’t take him out, so he was
alone - and it happened that someone was waiting there with drugged food -
which he either found or took from the thief....’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said George. ‘Timmy would never, never take anything from someone he didn’t
know. I’ve always taught him that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
he got it somehow - and slept through the very night he should have been
awake,’ said Julian. ‘What I’m so afraid of, George, is that the thieves have
got your father’s two American notebooks. They seem to have left most of the
stuff - piles and piles of books of all kinds, filled with your father’s tiny
handwriting.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Joan
came in to say lunch was ready. She told the children that the policemen had
eaten every one of her home-made buns. She still felt important and excited,
and was longing to get out to the village and tell everyone the news.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’d
better stay in and give the policemen a good tea,’ said Julian. ‘They’re coming
back with a photographer.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Then
I’d better do another baking,’ said Joan, pleased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
Make one of your chocolate cakes,’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
do you think they’d like one?’ said Joan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
for them, Joan - for us, of course!’ said George. ‘Don’t waste one of your
marvellous chocolate cakes on policemen. Can you make us up a picnic tea? We’re
fed up with being indoors - we’re going out in a boat.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Joan
packed them a good tea after they had had their lunch and they all set off
before the police came back. Timmy was much less sleepy now and did a little
caper round them as they walked to the beach. George brightened up at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
getting better,’ she said. ‘Timmy, I simply shan’t let you out of my sight now!
If anyone’s going to dope you again they’ll have to do it under my very nose.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had a lovely time out in George’s boat. They went half-way to Kirrin Island and
bathed from the boat, diving in and having swimming races till they were tired
out. Timmy joined them, though he couldn’t swim nearly as fast as they could.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
doesn’t really swim,’ said Anne. ‘He just tries to run through the water. I
wish he’d let me ride on his back like a sea-dog - but he always slips away
under me when I try.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
got back about six o’clock to find that the policemen had eaten the whole of
the chocolate cake that Joan had made, besides an extraordinary amount of
scones and buns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Also
the study was now tidied up, and a man had come to mend the safe. Everything
was safely back there, though the police had told Joan that if there was
anything of real value it should be handed to them till George’s father came
back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
we don’t know which of all those papers are valuable!’ said Julian. ‘Well -
we’ll have to wait till Uncle Quentin cables us - and that may not be for days.
Anyway, I don’t expect we’ll be worried by the thief again - he’s got what he
wanted.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
exciting happenings of the day had made them all tired except Julian. ‘I’m off
to bed,’ said Dick, about nine o’clock. ‘Anne, why don’t you go? You look
fagged out.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
I will,’ said Anne. ‘Coming, George?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
going to take Timmy out for his last walk,’ said George. ‘I shall never let him
go out alone at night again. Come on, Timmy. If you want to go to bed I’ll lock
up the front door, Ju.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Julian. ‘I’ll go up in a minute. I don’t fancy staying down here by myself
tonight. I’ll fasten everything and lock up, except the front door. Don’t
forget to put up the chain, too, George - though I’m pretty certain we don’t
need to expect any more burglaries!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Or
faces at the window,’ said Anne, at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said Julian. ‘There won’t be any more of those either. Good night, Anne - sleep
well!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
and Dick went upstairs. Julian finished the paper be was reading, and then got
up to go round the house and lock up. Joan was already upstairs, dreaming of
policemen eating her chocolate cakes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
went out with Timmy. He ran eagerly to the gate and then set off down the lane
for his usual night walk with George. At a gate in the lane he suddenly stood
still and growled as if he saw something unusual.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Silly,
Timmy!’ said George, coming up. ‘It’s only somebody camping in a caravan!
Haven’t you seen a caravan before! Stop growling!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went on, Timmy sniffing into every rathole and rabbit-hole, enjoying himself
thoroughly. George was enjoying the walk, too. She didn’t hurry - Julian could
always go up to bed if he didn’t want to wait.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
did go up to bed. He left the front door ajar, and went yawning upstairs,
suddenly feeling sleepy. He got into bed quietly and quickly seeing that Dick
was already asleep. He lay awake listening for George. When he was half asleep,
he heard the front door shut.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
she is,’ he thought, and turned over to go to sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it wasn’t George. Her bed was empty all that night, and nobody knew, not even
Anne. George and Timmy didn’t come back!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
woke up in the night, feeling thirsty. She whispered across the room:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George!
Are you awake?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no answer, so, very cautiously and quietly Anne got herself a drink from
the decanter on the washstand. George was sometimes cross if she was awakened
in the middle of the night. Anne got back into bed, not guessing that George
hadn’t answered because she wasn’t there!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
fell asleep and didn’t wake till she heard Dick’s voice. ‘Hey, you two - get
up; it’s a quarter to eight. We’re going for a bathe!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
sat up, yawning. Her eyes went to George’s bed. It was empty. More than that,
it was all neat and tidy, as if it had just been made!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well!’
said Anne in astonishment. ‘George is up already, and has even made her bed.
She might have waked me, and I could have gone out with her. It’s such a lovely
day. I suppose she’s taken Timmy for an early morning walk, like she sometimes
does.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
slipped into her bathing costume and ran to join the boys. They went downstairs
together, their bare feet padding on the carpet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George
has gone out already,’ said Anne. ‘I expect she woke early and took Timmy; I
never even heard her!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was now at the front door. ‘Yes,’ he said. ‘The door isn’t locked or bolted -
George must have slipped down, undone it and then just pulled the door softly
to. How very considerate of her! Last time she went out early she banged the
door so hard that she woke everyone in the house!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She
may have gone fishing in her boat,’ said Dick. ‘She said yesterday she’d like
to some early morning when the tide was right. She’ll probably arrive complete
with stacks of fish for Joan to cook.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
looked out to sea when they got to the beach. There was a boat far out on the
water with what looked like two people in it, fishing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
bet that’s George and Timmy,’ said Dick. He yelled and waved his hands, but the
boat was too far away, and nobody waved back. The three of them plunged into
the cold waves. Brrr-rrr-rrr!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Lovely!’
said Anne, when they came out again, the drops of sea-water running down their
bodies and glistening in the early morning sun. ‘Let’s have a run now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
chased one another up and down the beach, and then, glowing and very hungry,
went back to breakfast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
George?’ asked Joan, as she brought in their breakfast. ‘I see her bed’s made
and all - what’s come over her?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think she’s out fishing with Timmy,’ said Dick. ‘She was up and about long
before we were.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
never heard her go,’ said Joan. ‘She must have been very quiet. There you are
now - there’s a fine breakfast for you - sausages and tomatoes and fried eggs!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘O-o-o-h,
lovely,’ said Anne. ‘And you’ve done the sausages just how I like them, Joan -
all bursting their skins. Do you think we’d better eat George’s too? She’s
still out in the boat. She may not be back for ages.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
then you’d better eat her share,’ said Joan. ‘I’ve no doubt she took something
out of the larder before she went. Pity I didn’t lock it last night, as usual!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
finished George’s share between them and then started on toast and marmalade.
After that Anne went to help Joan make the beds and dust and mop. Julian and
Dick went off to the village to do the morning’s shopping at the grocer’s.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nobody
worried about George at all. Julian and Dick came back from their shopping and
saw the little boat still out on the sea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George
will be absolutely starving by the time she comes back,’ said Julian. ‘Perhaps
she’s got one of her moods on and wants to be alone. She was awfully upset
about Timmy being drugged.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
met the ragamuffin Jo. She was walking along the beach, collecting wood, and
she looked sullen and dirtier than ever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo,
Jo!’ called Dick. She looked up and came towards them without a smile. She
looked as if she had been crying. Her small brown face was streaked where the
tears had run through the dirt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo!’
she said, looking at Dick. She looked so miserable that Dick felt touched.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
the matter, kid?’ he said, kindly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tears
trickled down Jo’s face as she heard the kindness in his voice. She rubbed them
away and smudged her face more than ever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nothing,’
she said. ‘Where’s Anne?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Anne’s
at home, and George is out in that boat with Timmy fishing,’ said Dick,
pointing out to sea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh!’
said Jo, and turned away to go on with her collecting of wood. Dick went after
her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hey!’
he said. ‘Don’t go off like that. You just tell me what’s wrong with you this
morning.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
caught hold of Jo and swung her round to face him. He looked closely at her and
saw that she now had two bruises on her face - one going yellow, that he had
given her when he had sent her flying two or three days before - and a new one,
dark purple.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
did you get that bruise?’ he said, touching it lightly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
was my dad,’ said Jo. ‘He’s gone off and left me - taken the caravan and all! I
wanted to go, too; but he wouldn’t let me into the caravan. And when I hammered
at the door, he came out and pushed me down the steps. That’s when I got this
bruise - and I’ve got another on my leg, too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
and Julian listened in horror. What kind of a life was this that Jo had to
live? The boys sat down on the beach, and Dick pulled Jo down between them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
surely your father is coming back?’ said Julian. ‘Is the caravan your only
home?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Jo. ‘I’ve never had another home. We’ve always lived in a caravan. Mum
did, too, when she was alive. Things were better then. But this is the first
time Dad’s gone off without me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
- how are you going to live’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dad
said Jake would give me money to buy food,’ said Jo. ‘But only if I do what he
tells me. I don’t like Jake. He’s mean.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who’s
Jake?’ asked Julian, most astonished at all this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Jake’s
a gipsy fellow. He knows my father,’ said Jo. ‘He’s always turning up for a day
or two, and going away again. If I wait about here, he’ll come and give me five
pence or so, I expect.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
will he tell you to do?’ said Dick, puzzled. ‘It all seems very queer and
horrible to me. You’re only a kid.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
he may tell me to go poaching with him or - or - well, there’s things we do
that folks like you don’t,’ said Jo, suddenly realizing that Dick and Julian
would not at all approve of some of the things she did. ‘I hope he gives me
some money today, though I haven’t got any at all, and I’m hungry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
and Julian looked at one another. To think that in these days there should be a
forlorn waif like Jo, going in fear of others, and often hungry and lonely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
put his hand in the shopping basket and pulled out a packet of chocolate and
some biscuits. ‘Here you are,’ he said. ‘Tuck into these - and if you’d like to
go to the kitchen door some time today and ask Joan, our cook, for a meal,
she’ll give you one. I’ll tell her about you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Folks
don’t like me at kitchen doors,’ said Jo, cramming biscuits into her mouth.
‘They’re afraid I’ll steal something.’ She glanced up at Dick. ‘And I do,’ she
said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
shouldn’t do that,’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
wouldn’t you, if you were so hungry you couldn’t even bear to look at a baker’s
cart?’ said Jo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
- I don’t think so. At least, I hope not,’ said Dick, wondering what he really
would feel like if he were starving. ‘Where’s this Jake fellow?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know. Somewhere about,’ said Jo. ‘He’ll find me when he wants me. I’ve
got to stay on the beach, Dad said. So I couldn’t come to your house, anyway. I
dursent leave here.’<span style='mso-tab-count:3'>                              </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys got up to go, worried about this little ragamuffin. But what could they
do? Nothing, except feed her and give her money. Dick had slipped five pence
into her hand, and she had pocketed it without a word, her eyes gleaming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was still not home by lunch-time; and now Julian for the first time began to
feel anxious. He slipped out to the beach to see if the boat was still at sea.
It was just pulling in - and with a sinking heart Julian saw that it was not
George and Timmy who were in it, but two boys.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went to look for George’s boat - and there it was, high up on the boat-beach
with many others. George had not been out in it at all!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
ran back to Kirrin Cottage and told the others. They were at once as anxious as
he was. What could have become of George?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
wait till tea-time,’ said Julian. ‘Then if she’s not back we’ll really have to
do something about it - tell the police, I should think. But she has sometimes
gone off for the day before, so we’ll just wait a bit longer.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tea-time
came - but no George, and no Timmy. Then they heard someone pattering up the
garden path - was it Timmy? They leaned out of the window to see.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
Jo,’ said Dick, in disappointment, ‘She’s got a note or something. Whatever
does she want?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
opened the front door. Jo silently gave him a plain envelope. Julian tore it
open, not knowing what in the least to expect. Jo turned to go - but Julian put
out his hand and caught hold of her firmly, whilst he read the note in complete
amazement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dick!’
he called. ‘Hold on to Jo. Don’t let her go. Better take her indoors. This is
serious.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
wasn’t going to be taken indoors. She squealed, and wriggled like an eel. Then
she began to kick Dick viciously with her bare feet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let
me go! I’m not doing any harm. I only brought you that note!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Stop
squealing and being silly,’ said Dick. ‘I don’t want to hurt you, you know
that. But you must come indoors.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Jo wouldn’t stop wriggling and pulling and kicking. She looked scared out of
her life. It was as much as Dick and Julian could do to get the little wriggler
into the dining-room and shut the door. Anne followed, looking very frightened.
Whatever was happening?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Listen
to this,’ said Julian, when the door was shut. ‘It’s unbelievable!’ He held out

Julian! George can’t have come back from her walk with Timmy last night! She

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
looked very grim and white. He was thinking hard. ‘Yes - someone was lying in
wait, I’ve no doubt - and she and Timmy were kidnapped. Then the kidnapper - or
one of them - came back to the house and shut the front door to make it seem as
if George was back. And someone has probably been hanging round all day to find
out whether we’re worried about George, or just think she’s gone off for the
day!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who

trembled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

looked sullen. Dick shook her, and she tried to get away. But he held her far
too tightly. ‘Go on - tell us what the fellow was like,’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
was tall and had a long beard and a long nose and brown eyes,’ rattled off Jo
suddenly. ‘And he was dressed in fisherman’s clothes, and - he spoke foreign.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two boys looked sternly at her. ‘I believe you’re making all that up, Jo,’ said
Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
not,’ said Jo sulkily. ‘I’d never seen him before, so there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Jo,’
said Anne, taking Jo’s brown little paw in hers, ‘tell us truly anything you
know. We're so very worried about George.’ Tears sprang out of her eyes as she
spoke, and she gave a little wail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Serve
that George-girl right if she’s got taken away,’ said Jo fiercely. ‘She was
rude to me - she’s crool and unkind. Serve her right, I say. I wouldn’t tell
you anything - not even if I knew something to tell.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
do know something,’ said Dick. ‘You’re a bad little girl, Jo. I shan’t have
anything more to do with you. I felt sorry and unhappy about you, but now I
don’t.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
looked sullen again, but her eyes were bright with tears. She turned away. ‘Let
me go,’ she said. ‘I tell you, that fellow gave me fifteen pence to bring this
note to you, and that’s all I know. And I’m glad George is in trouble. People
like her deserve it, see!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let
her go,’ said Julian wearily. ‘She’s like a savage little cat - all claws and
spite. I thought there might be some good in her, but there isn’t.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
thought so, too,’ said Dick, letting go Jo’s arm. ‘I quite liked her. Well, go,
Jo. We don’t want you any more.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
rushed to the door, wrenched it open, and fled down the hall and out of the
house. There was a silence after she had gone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian,’
whispered Anne. ‘What are we going to do?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
said nothing. He got up and went into the hall. He picked up the telephone
receiver and put his ear to it, listening for the faint crackling that would
tell him he was connected to the exchange. After a moment he put it back again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
connection,’ he said. ‘The wires have been cut, as the note said. And no doubt
there’s somebody on watch to see we don’t slip out to give warning. This is all
crazy. It can’t be true.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
it is,’ said Dick. ‘Horribly true. Julian, do you know what notebook they want?
I’ve no idea!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nor
have I,’ said Julian. ‘And it’s impossible to go and hunt for it, because the
safe has been mended and locked - and the police have the key.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
that’s that, then,’ said Dick. ‘What are we going to do? Shall I slip out and
warn the police?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
considered. ‘No,’ he said at last. ‘I think these people mean business. It
would be terrible if anything happened to George. Also, you might be caught and
spirited away yourself. There are people watching the house, don’t forget.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
Julian - we can’t just sit here and do nothing!’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
know. This will have to be thought about carefully.’ said Julian. ‘If only we
knew where George had been taken to! We could rescue her then. But I can’t see
how we can find out.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
one of us went and hid down the bottom of the garden and waited to see whoever
came to take up the notebook - we could follow the fellow and maybe he’d lead
us to where George is hidden,’ suggested Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
forget that we’ve all got to sit in the lighted front room, so it would easily
be spotted if one of us were missing,’ said Julian. ‘Even Joan has to sit
there. This is all very stupid and melodramatic.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Does
anyone come to the house this evening? Any of the tradesmen, for instance?’
asked Anne, again in a whisper. She felt as if people must be all round the
house, listening and watching!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
Else we could give them a note,’ said Julian. Then he gave the table a rap that
made the others jump. ‘Wait a bit! Yes, of course - the paper-boy comes! Ours
is almost the last house he delivers at. But perhaps it would be risky to give
him a note. Can’t we think of something better?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Listen,’
said Dick, his eyes shining. ‘I’ve got it! I know the paper-boy. He’s all
right. We’ll have the front door open and yank him in as soon as he appears.
And I’ll go out immediately, with his cap on, and his satchel of papers,
whistling - jump on his bike and ride away. And none of the watchers will know
I’m not the boy! I’ll come back when it’s dark, sneak round the garden at the
bottom and hide to watch who comes for the hidden notebook - and I’ll follow
him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
idea, Dick!’ said Julian, turning it quickly over in his mind. ‘Yes - it’s
possible. It would be better to watch and see who comes rather than tell the
police - because if these kidnappers mean business, George would certainly be
in trouble once they knew we’d been able to get in touch with the police.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Won’t
the newspaper boy think it’s queer?’ asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
very. He’s a bit simple,’ said Dick. ‘He believes anything he’s told. We’ll
make up something to satisfy him and give him such a good time that he’ll want
to keep visiting us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘About
this notebook,’ said Julian. ‘We’d better get some kind of book out of one of
the drawers and wrap it up with a note inside to say we hope it’s the one. The
fellow who comes to collect it will have to have some kind of parcel to take
off with him to give to the kidnappers. It isn’t likely he’d undo it and look
at it - or even know if it was the right one or not.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Go
and hunt out a book, Anne,’ said Dick. ‘I’ll be looking out for the newspaper
boy. He’s not due till half-past seven, but I don’t dare to risk missing him -
and he may be early, you never know.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
shot off to the study, thankful to have something to do. Her hands were
trembling as she pulled out drawer after drawer to look for a big notebook that
would do to wrap up in a parcel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
went with Dick to the front door, to help him to deal with the unsuspecting
newspaper boy. They stood there, patiently waiting, hearing the clock strike
six o’clock, then half-past, then seven.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here
he comes!’ said Dick, suddenly. ‘Now - get ready to yank him in! Hallo, Sid!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sid,
the paper-boy, was most amazed to find himself yanked quickly through the front
door by Julian. He was even more amazed to find his very lurid check cap
snatched off his head, and his bag of papers torn from his shoulder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘
’Ere!’ he said feebly. ‘What you doing?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
all right, Sid,’ said Julian, holding him firmly. ‘Just a joke. We’ve got a
little treat in store for you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sid
didn’t like jokes of this sort. He struggled, but soon gave it up. Julian was
big and strong and very determined. Sid turned and watched Dick stride out with
his bright check cap sideways on his head, and his paper-bag over his shoulder.
He gasped when he saw Dick leap on the bicyle that he, Sid, had left by the
gate, and go sailing off up the lane on it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
he doing?’ he asked Julian, amazed. ‘Funny sort of joke this.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
know. Hope you don’t mind,’ said Julian, leading him firmly into the
sitting-room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Somebody
betted him he wouldn’t deliver the papers, maybe?’ said Sid. ‘So he’s taken the
bet on?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
clever, you are, Sid,’ said Julian, and Sid beamed all over his round, simple
face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I hope he’ll deliver them all right,’ he said. ‘Anyway, there’s only two more,
up at the farm. Yours is the last house but one that I go to. When’s he coming
back?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Soon,’
said Julian. ‘Will you stay and have supper with us, Sid?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sid’s
eyes nearly fell out of his head. ‘Supper with you folks?’ he said. ‘Coo!
That’d be a rare treat!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right. You sit and look at these books,’ said Julian, giving him two or three
story books belonging to Anne. ‘I’ll just go and tell our cook to make a
specially nice supper for you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sid
was all at sea about this unexpected treat, but quite willing to accept a free
meal and sit down. He sat beaming on the couch, turning over the pages of a
fairy-story book. Coo! What would his mother say when she heard he’d had supper
at Kirrin Cottage? She wouldn’t half be surprised, thought Sid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
now Julian had to tackle Joan, and get her to join in their little plot. He
went into the kitchen and shut the door. He looked so grave that Joan was
startled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What’s
the matter?’ she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
told her. He told her about the kidnapping of George, and the strange note. He
gave it to her to read. She sat down, her knees beginning to shake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
the kind of thing you read in the papers, Master Julian,’ she said, in rather a
shaky voice. ‘But it’s queer when it happens to you! I don’t like it - that’s
flat, I don’t.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nor
do we,’ said Julian, and went on to tell Joan all they had arranged to do. She
smiled a watery smile when he told her how Dick had gone off as the paper-boy
in order to watch who took the notebook that night, and described how surprised
Sid was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
Sid!’ she said. ‘We’ll never hear the last of it, down in the village - him
being invited here to supper. He’s simple, that boy, but there’s no harm in
him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
get him a fine supper, don’t you worry. And I’ll come and sit with you tonight
in the lighted room - we’ll play a card game, see? One that Sid knows - he’s
never got much beyond Snap and Happy Families.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
a very good idea,’ said Julian, who had been wondering how in the world they
could amuse Sid all the evening. ‘We’ll play Snap - and let him win!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sid
was quite overcome at his wonderful evening. First there was what he called a
‘smasher of a supper,’ with ham and eggs and chip potatoes followed by jam
tarts and a big chocolate mould, of which Sid ate about three-quarters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
partial to chocolate mould,’ he explained to Anne. ‘Joan knows that - she knows
I’m partial to anything in the chocolate line. She’s friendly with my Mum, so
she knows. The things I’m partial to I like very much, see?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
giggled and agreed. She was enjoying Sid, although she was very worried and
anxious. But Sid was so comical. He didn’t mean to be. He was just enjoying
himself hugely, and he said so every other minute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
fact, he was really a very nice guest to have. It wasn’t everybody who could
welcome everything with so much gusto and say how wonderful it was half a dozen
times on end.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went out to the kitchen after supper and offered to wash up for Joan. ‘I always
do it for Mum,’ he said. ‘I won’t break a thing.’ So he did the washing up and
Anne did the drying. Julian thought it was a good thing to give her as much to
do as possible, to stop her worrying.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sid
looked a bit taken-aback when he was asked to play games later on. ‘Well - I
dunno,’ he said. ‘I’m not much good at games. I did try to learn draughts, but
all that jumping over one another got me muddled. If I want to jump over things
I’ll play leap-frog and do the thing properly.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- we did think of playing Snap,’ said Julian, and Sid brightened up at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Snap!
That’s right up my street!’ he said. And so it was. His habit of shouting snap
and collecting all the cards at the same moment as his shout, led to his
winning quite a lot of games. He was delighted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
is a smasher of an evening,’ he kept saying. ‘Don’t know when I’ve enjoyed
myself so much. Wonder how that brother of yours is getting on - hope he brings
my bike back all right.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
he will,’ said Julian, dealing out the cards for the sixth game of Snap. They
were all in the lighted sitting-room now, sitting round a table in the window -
Julian, Joan, Anne and Sid. Anyone watching would see them clearly - and would
certainly not guess that Sid, the fourth one, was the paper-boy and not Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
eleven o’clock Julian left to put the parcel that Anne had carefully wrapped up
under the stone at the bottom of the garden. She had found a big notebook she
thought would do, one that didn’t seem at all important, and had wrapped it in
paper and tied it with string. Julian had slipped a note inside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Here
is the notebook. Please release our cousin at once. You will get into serious
trouble if you hold her any longer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
slipped down the garden and shone his torch on the crazy paving there. When he
came to the last stone he found that it had been loosened. He lifted it up
easily and put the parcel into a hollow that seemed to have been prepared ready
for it. He took a cautious look round, wondering if Dick was hidden anywhere
about, but could see no one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was back in the lighted sitting-room in under two minutes, yelling ‘Snap’ with
the others. He played stupidly, partly because he wanted the delighted Sid to
win and partly because he was wondering about Dick. Was he all right?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An
outbreak of owls hooting loudly made them all jump. Julian glanced at Joan and
Anne, and they nodded. They guessed that it was the signal to tell them that
the parcel had been found and collected. Now they could get rid of Sid, and
wait for Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Joan
disappeared and came back with cups of chocolate and some buns. Sid’s eyes
gleamed. Talk about an evening!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
hour was spent in eating and drinking and hearing Sid relate details of all the
most exciting games of Snap he had ever played. He then went on to talk of
Happy Families and seemed inclined to stay a bit longer and have a garne at
that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Your
Mum will be getting worried about you,’ said Julian, looking at the clock.
‘It’s very late.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
my bike?’ said Sid, realizing with sorrow that his ‘smasher of an evening’ was
now over. ‘Hasn’t that brother of yours come back yet? Well, you tell him to
leave it at my house in time for my paper-round tomorrow morning. And my cap,
too. That’s my Special Cap, that is. I’m very partial to that cap - it’s a bit
of a smasher.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
certainly is,’ agreed Julian, who was now feeling very tired. ‘Now listen, Sid.
It’s very late, and there may be bad folks about. If anyone speaks to you, run
for your life, and don’t stop till you get home.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Coo,’
said Sid, his eyes nearly falling out of his head. ‘Yes, I’ll run all right.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
shook hands solemnly with each of them and departed. He whistled loudly to keep
his spirits up. The village policeman came unexpectedly round a corner on
rubber soles and made him jump.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
then, young Sid,’ said the policeman, sternly. ‘What you doing out this time of
night?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sid
didn’t wait to answer. He fled and when he got home there was his bicycle by
the front gate, complete with checked cap and paper-bag. ‘That was a bit of all
right!’ thought Sid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
glanced in disappointment at the dark windows of his house. Mum was in bed and
asleep. Now he would have to wait till morning to tell her of his most
remarkable evening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
now, what had happened to Dick? He had shot out of the house and sailed away on
Sid’s bicycle, with Sid’s dazzling cap on his head. He thought he saw a
movement in the hedge nearby and guessed someone was hidden there, watching. He
deliberately slowed down, got off his bicycle and pretended to do something to
the wheel. Let the watcher see his bag of papers and be deceived into thinking
he was without any doubt the paper-boy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
rode to the farm and delivered the two papers there, then down to the village
where he left Sid’s things outside his house. Then he went into the cinema for
a long while - until it was dark and he could safely creep back to Kirrin
Cottage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
set off at last, going a very roundabout way indeed. He came to the back of
Kirrin garden. Where should he hide? Was anyone already hidden there? If so,
the game was up - and he’d be caught, too!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
stood and listened, holding his breath. He could hear no sound except for the
rustling of the trees around, and the sudden squeak of a field-mouse. It was a
dark night and cloudy. Was there anyone hidden nearby, or could he find a
hiding-place in safety and wait?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
thought for a few minutes, and decided that there wouldn’t be anyone watching
the back of the house now that it was dark. Julian and the others would be in
full view of any watcher at the front, seated as they were in the lighted
sitting-room - there would be no need for anyone to watch the back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
debated where to hide and then made a quick decision. ‘I’ll climb a tree,’ he
thought. ‘What about that one just near the crazy paving path? If the clouds
clear away I could perhaps catch a glimpse of what the man’s like who comes to
collect the parcel. Then I’ll shin quietly down the tree and stalk him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
climbed up into an oak tree that spread its broad branches over the path. He
wriggled down in a comfortable fork and set himself to wait patiently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
time had that note said? Eleven o’dock. Yes - Julian was to go down at eleven
o’clock and put the parcel under the stone. He listened for the church clock to
strike. If the wind was in the right direction he would hear it clearly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
struck just then. Half-past ten. Half an hour to wait. The waiting was the
worst part. Dick put his hand into his pocket and brought out a bar of
half-melted chocolate. He began to nibble it very gently, to make it last a
long time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
church clock struck a quarter to eleven. Dick finished the chocolate, and
wondered if Julian would soon be along. Just as the clock began to chime the
hour at eleven, the kitchen door opened and Dick saw Julian outlined in the
opening. He had the parcel under his arm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
saw Julian go swiftly down the path and sensed him looking all about. He dared
not give the slightest hint to him that he was just above his head!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
heard Julian scrabble about in the path, and then drop the big stone back into
its place. He watched the light of Julian’s torch bobbing back up the path to
the kitchen door. Then the door shut with a bang.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
now Dick could hardly breathe! Who would come for the parcel? He listened,
stiff with excitement. The wind blew and a leaf rustled against the back of his
neck making him jump. It felt as if a finger had touched him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Five
minutes went by and nobody came. Then he heard the slightest sound. Was that
somebody crawling through the hedge? Dick strained his eyes but could only make
out a deeper shadow that seemed to be moving. Then he could most distinctly
hear somebody breathing hard as they tugged at the heavy stone! The parcel was
being collected as arranged!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
stone plopped back. A shadow crept over to the hedge again. Whoever had the
parcel was now going off with it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
dropped quietly down. He had rubber shoes on and made no noise. He slipped
through a big gap in the hedge nearby and stood straining his eyes to find the
man he wanted to follow. Ah - there was a shadow moving steadily down the
field-path to the stile. Dick followed, keeping close to the hedge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
kept well behind the moving shadow till it reached the stile, got over it and
went into the lane beyond. When it got there it stopped, and a perfect
fusillade of loud owl-hoots came to Dick’s startled ears.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
course! That was the signal that the parcel had been collected. Dick admired
the excellent imitation of a little owl’s loud, excited hooting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
shadow stopped hooting and went on again. It obviously did not suspect that it
might be followed and, although it moved quietly, it did not attempt to keep
under cover. Down the lane it went and into a field.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
was about to follow when he heard the sound of voices. They were very low, and
he couldn’t hear a word. He crouched in the shadow of the gate, which was swung
right back, leaving an entry into the field.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
loud noise made him jump. Then a brilliant light dazzled him and he felt glad
he could duck down behind the gate. There was a car in the field. A car that
had just started up its engine and switched on its lights. It was going, moving
slowly down to the gate!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
tried his hardest to see who was in the car. He could make out only one man,
and he was driving. It didn’t seem as if anyone else was in the car at all.
Where was the other fellow, then - the one who must have collected the parcel
and given it to the man in the car? Had he been left behind? If so, Dick had
better be careful!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
car was soon out in the lane. It gained speed and then Dick heard it roaring
off in the distance. He couldn’t stalk a car, that was certain! He held his
breath, listening for some movement of the other man who, he felt certain, was
still there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
heard a sniff and crouched lower still. Then a shadow passed quickly through
the gate, turned back in the direction of Kirrin Cottage and was lost in the
darkness of the lane.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
a trice Dick was after it again. At least he could track down this fellow! He
must be going somewhere!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Down
the lane to the stile. Over the stile and into the field. Across the field and
back at the hedge that grew at the bottom of Kirrin Cottage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Why
was this fellow going back there? Dick was puzzled. He heard the shadow
creeping through the hedge and he followed. He watched it go silently up the
path and peer in at a darkened window.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Going
to get into the house again and ransack it, I suppose!’ thought Dick, in a
rage. He considered the shadowy figure by the window. It didn’t look big. It
must be a small man - one that Dick could tackle and bring to the ground. He
could yell loudly for Julian, and maybe he could hold the fellow down till
Julian came.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
then perhaps we could do a little kidnapping, and a little bargaining, too,’
thought Dick grimly. ‘If they hold George as a hostage, we’ll hold one of them,
too! Tit for tat!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
waited till the shadow left the window, and then he pounced. His victim went
down at once with a yell.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
was surprised how small he was - but how he fought! He bit and scratched and
heaved and kicked, and the two of them rolled over and over and over, breaking
down Michaelmas daisies in the beds, and scratching legs and arms and faces on
rose bushes. Dick yelled for Julian all the time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian!
Julian! Help! Julian!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
heard. He tore out at once. ‘Dick, Dick, where are you? What is it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
flashed his torch towards the shouting and saw Dick rolling on top of somebody.
He ran to help at once, throwing his torch on the grass so that both hands were
free.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
wasn’t long before they had the struggling figure firmly in their grasp and
dragged it, wailing, to the back door. Dick recognized that wailing voice! Good
gracious - no, it couldn’t be - it couldn’t be Jo!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it was! When they dragged her inside she collapsed completely, sobbing and
wailing, rubbing her scratched and bruised legs, calling both boys all the
names she could think of. Anne and Joan looked on in complete amazement. Nore
what had happened?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Put
her upstairs,’ said Julian. ‘Get her to bed. She’s in a awful state now. So am
I! I wouldn’t have lammed her like that if I’d known it was only Jo.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
never guessed,’ said Dick, wiping his filthy face with his handkerchief. ‘My
word, what a wild-cat! See how she’s bitten me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
didn’t know it was you, Dick; I didn’t know,’ wailed Jo. ‘You pounced on me,
and I fought back. I wouldn’t have bitten you like that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
a savage, deceitful, double-dealing little wildcat,’ said Dick, looking at his
bites and scratches. ‘Pretending you know nothing about the man who gave you
that note - and all the time you’re in with that crooked lot of thieves and
kidnappers, whoever they are.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
not in with them,’ wept Jo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
tell lies,’ shouted Dick, in a fury, ‘I was up in a tree when you came and took
that parcel from under the stone - yes, and I followed you right to that car -
and followed you back again! You came back here to steal again, I suppose?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
gulped. ‘No, I didn’t.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
did! You’ll be handed over to the police tomorrow,’ said Dick, still furious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
didn’t come back to steal. I came back for something else,’ insisted Jo, her
eyes peering through her tangled hair like a frightened animal’s.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ho!
So you say! And what did you come back for? To find another dog to dope?’
jeered Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said Jo, miserably. ‘I came back to tell you I’d take you to where George was,
if you wouldn’t tell on me. My Dad would half kill me if he thought I’d split
on him. I know I took the parcel - I had to. I didn’t know what it was or
anything. I took it to the place I was told to. Jake told me. And then I came
back to tell you all I could. And you set on me like that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Four
pairs of eyes bored into Jo, and she covered her face. Dick took her hands away
and made her look at him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
here,’ he said, ‘this matters a lot to us, whether you are speaking the truth
or not. Do you know where George is?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
nodded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
will you take us there?’ said Julian, his voice stern and cold.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
nodded again. ‘Yes I will. You’ve been mean to me, but I’ll show you I’m not as
bad as you make out. I’ll take you to George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
hall clock suddenly struck loudly. DONG!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘One
o’clock,’ said Joan. ‘One o’clock in the morning! Master Julian, we can’t do
any more tonight. This gipsy child here, she’s not fit to take you trapesing
out anywhere else. She’s done for - she can hardly stand.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
you’re right Joan,’ said Julian, at once giving up the idea of going out to
find George that night. ‘We’ll have to wait till tomorrow. It’s a pity the
telephone wires are cut. I do really think we ought to let the police know
something about all this.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
looked up at once. ‘Then I won’t tell you where George is,’ she said. ‘Do you
know what the police will do to me if they get hold of me? They’d put me into a
Home for Bad Girls, and I’ll never get out again - because I am a bad girl and
I do bad things. I’ve never had a chance.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Every
one gets a chance sooner or later,’ said Julian gently. ‘You’ll get yours, Jo -
but see you take it when it comes. All right - we’ll leave the police out of it
if you promise you’ll take us to where George is. That’s a bargain.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
understood bargains. She nodded. Joan pulled her to her feet and half led, half
carried her upstairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
a couch in my room,’ she told Julian. ‘She can bed down there for the night -
but late or not she’s going to have a bath first. She smells like something the
dog brought in!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
half an hour’s time Jo was tucked up on the couch in Joan’s room, perfectly
clean, though marked with scratches and bruises from top to toe, hair washed,
dried, and brushed so that it stood up in wiry curls like George’s. A basin of
steaming bread and milk was on a tray in front of her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Joan
went to the landing and called across to Julian’s room. ‘Master Julian! Jo’s in
bed. She wants to say something to you and Master Dick.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
and Julian put on dressing-gowns and went into Joan’s neat room. They hardly
recognized Jo. She was wearing one of Anne’s old nightgowns and looked very
clean and childish and somehow pathetic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
looked at them and gave them a very small smile. ‘What do you want to say to
us?’ asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ve
got some things to tell you,’ said Jo, stirring the bread round and round in
the basin. ‘I feel good now - good and clean and - and all that. But maybe
tomorrow I’ll feel like I always do - and then I wouldn’t tell you everything.
So I’d better tell you now.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Go
ahead,’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I let the men into your house here, the night they came,’ said Jo. Julian and
Dick stared in astonishment. Jo went on stirring her bread round and round.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
true,’ she said. ‘I got in at that tiny window that was left unfastened, and
then I went to the back door and opened it and let the men in. They did make a
mess of that room, didn’t they? I watched them. They took a lot of papers.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
couldn’t possibly squeeze through that window,’ said Dick at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I did,’ said Jo. ‘I’ve - I’ve squeezed through quite a lot of little windows. I
know how to wriggle, you see. I can’t get through such tiny ones as I used to,
because I keep on growing. But yours was easy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Phew!’
said Julian, and let out a long breath. He hardly knew what to say. ‘Well, go
on. I suppose when the men had finished you locked and bolted the kitchen door
after them and then squeezed out of the pantry window again?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Jo, and put a piece of milky bread into her mouth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
about Timmy? Who doped him so that he slept all that night?’ demanded Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
did,’ said Jo. ‘That was easy, too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Both
boys were speechless. To think that Jo did that, too! The wicked little misery!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
made friends with Timmy on the beach, don’t you remember?’ said Jo. ‘George was
cross about it. I like dogs. We always had dozens till Mum died, and they’d do
anything I told them. Dad told me what I was to do - make friends with Timmy so
that I could meet him that night and give him meat with something in it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
see. And it was very, very easy, because we sent Timmy out alone - straight
into your hands,’ said Dick bitterly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
He came to me at once, he was glad to see me. I took him quite a long walk,
letting him sniff the meat I’d got. When I gave it to him, he swallowed it all
at once with hardly a chew!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
slept all night long so that your precious friends could break into the house,’
said Julian. ‘All I can say is that you are a hardened little rogue. Aren’t you
ashamed of anything?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know,’ said Jo, who wasn’t really quite certain what feeling ashamed meant.
‘Shall I stop telling you things?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
For goodness’ sake go on,’ said Dick, hastily. ‘Had you anything to do with
George’s kidnapping?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
just had to hoot like an owl when she and Timmy were coming,’ said Jo. ‘They
were ready for her with a sack to put over her head - and they were going to
bang Timmy on the head with a stick to knock him out - then put him into a sack
too. That’s what I heard them say. But I didn’t see them. l had to creep back
here and shut the front door, so that if nobody missed George till morning
they’d just think she’d gone out early somewhere.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Which
is what we did think,’ groaned Dick. ‘What mutts we are! The only clever thing
we thought of was to stalk the person who collected the parcel.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
was only me, though,’ said Jo. ‘And anyway, I was coming back to tell you I
would take you to George. Not because I like her - I don’t. I think she’s rude
and horrible. I’d like her to stay kidnapped for years!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
a nice, kind nature!’ said Julian to Dick, helplessly. ‘What can you do with a
kid like this?’ He turned to Jo again. ‘Seeing that you wish George would stay
kidnapped for years, what made you decide to come and tell us where to find
her?’ he asked, puzzled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I don’t like George - but I do like him!’ said Jo, pointing with her spoon at
Dick. ‘He was nice to me, so I wanted to be nice back. I don’t often feel like
that,’ she added hurriedly, as if being kind was some sort of weakness not
really to be admired. ‘I wanted him to go on liking me,’ she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
looked at her. ‘I shall like you if you take us to George,’ he said. ‘Not
unless. If you deceive us, I shall think you’re like one of those sour damson
stones - only fit to be spat out as far away as possible.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
take you tomorrow,’ said Jo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
is George?’ asked Julian, bluntly, thinking it would be as well to know now, in
case Jo changed her mind by the morning, and became her wicked little self
again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
hesitated. She looked at Dick. ‘It would be very nice of you to tell us,’ said
Dick, in a kind voice. Jo loved a bit of kindness and couldn’t resist this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,’
she whispered, ‘you know I told you my Dad had gone off and left me to Jake.
Dad didn’t tell me why - but Jake did. He shut George and Timmy into our
caravan, harnessed Blackie the horse, and drove away in the night with them
both. And I guess I know where he’s gone - where he always goes when he wants
to hide.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where?’
asked Julian, feeling so astounded at these extraordinary revelations that he
really began to wonder if he was dreaming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘In
the middle of Ravens Wood,’ said Jo. ‘You don’t know where that is, but I do.
I’ll take you tomorrow. I can’t tell you any more now.’ She began to spoon up
her bread and milk very fast indeed, watching the boys through her long
eyelashes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
considered her. He felt pretty sure she had told them the truth, though he was
equally certain she would have told lies if she could have got more by doing
so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
thought her a bad, cold-blooded, savage little monkey, but he pitied her, and
admired her unwillingly for her courage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
caught sight of her bruises and grazes, and bit his lip as he remembered how he
had pounced on her and pummelled her, giving her back kick for kick and blow
for blow - he hadn’t guessed for one moment it was Jo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
sorry I hurt you so,’ he said. ‘You know I didn’t mean to. It was a mistake.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
looked at him as a slave might look at a king. ‘I don’t mind,’ she said. ‘I’d
do anything for you, straight I would. You’re kind.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Joan
knocked impatiently at the door. ‘Aren’t you ready yet, you boys?’ she said. ‘I
want to come to bed. Tell Jo to stop talking, and you come on out too, and go
to bed.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys opened the door. Joan took one look at their solemn faces and guessed that
what Jo had told them was important. She took the empty basin from the girl’s
hands and pushed her down on the couch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
you go straight off to sleep - and mind, if I hear any hanky-panky from you in
the night I’ll get up and give you such a spanking you won’t be able to sit
down for a month of Sundays,’ she said roughly, but - not unkindly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
grinned. She understood that kind of talk. She snuggled down into the rugs,
marvelling at the warmth and softness. She was already half-asleep. Joan got
into bed and switched off her light.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Two
o’clock in the morning!’ she muttered as she heard the hall clock strike. ‘Such
goings-on! I’ll never wake up in time to tell the milkman I want more milk.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
only Julian was awake. He worried about whether he was doing right or not. Poor
George - was she safe? Would that scamp of a Jo really lead them to the caravan
next day - or might she lead them right into the lion’s mouth, and get them all
captured? Julian simply didn’t know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Joan
was the only one in the household who woke up reasonably early the next morning
- but even she was too late ta catch the milkman. She scurried downstairs at
half-past seven, an hour later than usual, tying up her apron as she went.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Half-past
seven - what a time to wake up!’ she muttered, as she began to do the kitchen
fire. She thought of all the happenings of the night before - the queer evening
with young Sid, Dick’s capture of Jo - and Jo’s extraordinary tale. She had had
a look at Jo before she went down, half expecting that lively young rogue to
have disappeared in the night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Jo was curled up like a kitten, her brown cheek on her brown paw, her hair,
unusually bright and tidy, falling over her tightly-shut eyes. She didn’t even
stir when Joan scurried about the bedroom, washing and dressing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
others were fast asleep, too. Julian woke first, but not till eight o’clock. He
remembered immediately all that had happened, and jumped out of bed at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went to Joan’s room. He could hear Joan downstairs talking to herself as usual.
He peeped round the open door of her bedroom. Thank goodness - Jo was still
there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went and shook her gently. She wriggled away, turned over and buried her face
in the pillow. Julian shook her more vigorously. He meant to get her up and
make her take them to where George was as soon as possible!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Most
miraculously everyone was down at half-past eight, eating porridge and looking
rather subdued. Jo had hers in the kitchen, and the others could hear Joan
scolding her for her manners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Have
you got to stuff yourself like that, as if the dog’s going to come and lick
your plate before you’ve finished? And who told you to stick your fingers into
the syrup and lick them? I’ve eyes in the back of my head, so just you be
careful what you’re doing!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
liked Joan. She knew where she was with her. If she kept on Joan’s right side
and did what she was told, Joan would feed her well and not interfere too much
- but if she didn’t, then she could expect something else she understood very
well indeed - scoldings and a sharp slap. Joan was good-hearted but impatient,
and no child was ever afraid of her. Jo followed her about like a little dog
when she had finished her breakfast.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
came out into the kitchen at nine o’clock. ‘Where’s Jo?’ he said. ‘Oh, there
you are. Now, what about taking us to where you father’s caravan is? You’re
sure you know the way?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
laughed scornfully. ‘Course I do! I know everywhere round here for miles.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Julian, and he produced a map, which he spread out on the kitchen table.
He put a finger on one spot. ‘That’s Kirrin,’ he said. ‘And here’s a place
called Ravens Wood. Is that the place you mean? How do you propose to get there
- by this road, or that one?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
looked at the map. It meant nothing to her at all. She gazed vaguely at the
spot that Julian had pointed to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well?’
said Julian, impatiently. ‘Is that the Ravens Wood you mean?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know,’ said Jo, helplessly. ‘The one I mean is a real wood - I don’t know
anything about yours on this map.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Joan
gave a little snort. ‘Master Julian, maps are wasted on her. I don’t expect
she’s ever seen one in her life! She can’t even read!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Can’t
she?’ said Julian, amazed. ‘Then she can’t write either.’ He looked
questioningly at Jo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
shook her head. ‘Mum tried to learn me to read,’ she said, ‘but Mum wasn’t very
good herself. What’s the good of reading, anyway? Won’t help you to trap
rabbits or catch fish for your dinner, will it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
It’s used for other things,’ said Julian, amused. ‘Well - maps are no good to
you, I can see.’ He rolled his map up, looking thoughtful. It was very
difficult to know exactly how to deal with a person like Jo, who knew so little
of some things and so much of others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She’ll
know the way all right,’ said Joan, scraping out a saucepan. ‘They’re like
dogs, these folk - they can smell out any road they want.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
you smell out your way like a dog?’ asked Anne, curiously. She had come in to
see what was going on, and was quite willing to believe that Jo really could
smell her way here and there, as Timmy did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
I don’t,’ said Jo. ‘I just know the way I have to go. And I don’t go by the
roads, either! They take too long to get to a place. I take the shortest way,
see?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
do you know it’s the shortest way?’ asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
shrugged her thin shoulders. All this was very boring to her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
that other boy?’ she said. ‘Isn’t he coming? I want to see him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She’s
just crazy on Dick,’ said Joan, taking up another saucepan. ‘Here he is - now
you can go and lick his boots if you want to, young Jo!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo,
Jo!’ said Dick, with one of his amiable grins. ‘Ready to take us travelling?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Better
go at night,’ said Jo, staring at Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
no!’ said Dick. ‘We’re going now. We’re not going to be put off like that. Now,
Jo, now!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
my Dad sees us coming he’ll be mad,’ said Jo obstinately.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Very
well,’ said Dick, looking at Julian. ‘We’ll go by ourselves. We’ve found Ravens
Wood on the map. We can easily get there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Pooh,’
said Jo, rudely. ‘You can get there all right - but it’s a big place, Ravens
Wood is - and nobody but me and Dad knows where we hide the caravan there. And
if Dad wants to keep George quite safe, he’ll take her to our hidey-hole in the
middle of the wood, see? You can’t go without me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right.
Then we’ll get the police to take us,’ said Julian, quite cheerfully. ‘They
will help us to comb the wood from end to end. We’ll soon find George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No!’
cried Jo, in alarm. ‘You said you wouldn’t! You promised!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
made a promise too,’ said Julian. ‘It was a bargain. But I see you’re not
really to be trusted. I’ll just get on my bike and ride down to the
police-station.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
before he could go out of the room Jo flung herself on him and clung to his arm
like a cat. ‘No, no! I’ll take you. I’ll keep my promise! But it would be best
to go at night!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
not putting things off any more,’ said Julian, shaking Jo off his arm. ‘If you
mean what you say, you’ll come with us now. Make up your mind.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
come,’ said Jo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hadn’t
we better give her another pair of shorts or something?’ said Anne, suddenly
seeing a tremendous hole in Jo’s grubby shorts. ‘She can’t go out like that.
And look at her awful jersey. It’s full of holes.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys looked at it. ‘She’d smell a bit better if she had clean clothes,’ said
Joan. ‘There’s that old pair of shorts I washed for George last week, and
mended up. Jo could have those. And there’s an old shirt of hers she could
have, too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
five minutes’ time Jo was proudly wearing a pair of perfectly clean,
much-mended shorts of George’s, and a shirt like the one Anne had on. Anne
looked at her and laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
she’s more like George than ever! They might be sisters.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Brothers,
you mean,’ said Dick. ‘George and Jo - what a pair!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
scowled. She didn’t like George, and she didn’t want to look like her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She’s
even got George’s scowl!’ said Anne. Jo turned her back at once, and Joan then
got the benefit of the scowl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘My
word, what an ugly creature you are!’ said Joan. ‘You be careful the wind
doesn’t change - you might get your face stuck like that!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
come on,’ said Julian, impatiently. ‘Jo! Do you hear me? Come along now and
take us to Ravens Wood.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Jake
might see us,’ said Jo, sulkily. She was determined to put off going as long as
she could.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
he might,’ said Julian, who hadn’t thought of that. ‘Well - you go on a long
way ahead, and we’ll follow. We won’t let Jake know you’re leading us
anywhere.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
last they set off. Joan had packed them up a meal in case they wanted one.
Julian slipped the package into a bag and slid it over his shoulder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
slipped out the back way, went down to the bottom of the garden and made her
way out to the lane through a little thicket. The others went out of the front
gate and walked up the lane slowly, watching for Jo to appear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
she is,’ said Julian. ‘Come on. We must keep the little wretch in sight. I
wouldn’t be surprised if she gave us the slip even now!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
danced on in front, a good way ahead. She took no notice of the others behind,
and they followed steadily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
suddenly something happened. A dark figure strode out from the hedge, stood in
front of Jo, and said something to her. She screamed and tried to dodge away.
But the man caught hold of her and firmly pulled her into the hedge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
was Jake!’ said Dick. ‘I’m sure it was Jake. He was watching out for her. Now
what do we do?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all hurried up to the place where Jake had caught hold of Jo. There was
absolutely nothing to be seen except a few broken twigs in the hedge there. No
Jake, no Jo. There was not a sound to be heard, either. Not a scream from Jo,
not a shout from Jake. It was as if both had faded into the hedge and
disappeared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
squeezed through the hedge and into the field beyond. Nobody was there either,
except a few cows who looked at him in surprise, their tails whisking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
a little copse at the end of the field,’ called back Dick. ‘I bet they’re
there. I’ll go and see.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
ran across the field to the copse. But there was nobody there either. Beyond
the copse was a row of huddled-up cottages. Dick looked along the untidy row,
exasperated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
suppose Jake’s taken her to one of those,’ he thought, angrily. ‘Probably lives
there! Well, he won’t let her go, that’s certain. He most likely guesses that
she’s in with us now. Poor Jo!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went back to the others and they had a low-voiced conference in the lane.
‘Let’s tell the police now,’ begged Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
Let’s go to Ravens Wood ourselves,’ said Dick. ‘We know where it is. We
wouldn’t be able to go the way Jo would have taken us - but at least we can go
by the map.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I think we will,’ said Julian. ‘Come on, then. Quick march!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went on up the lane, took a field path and came out eventually on to a road. A
bus passed them in the opposite direction to which they were going.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘When
we come to a bus stop we’ll find out if one goes anywhere near Raven’s Wood,’
said Julian. ‘It would save a lot of time if we caught a bus.' We’d be there
long before Jake, if he thinks of going to warn Jo’s father we’re on the way! I
bet Jo will tell him. You might as well trust a snake as that slippery little
thing.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hate Jo!’ said Anne, almost in tears. ‘I don’t trust her a bit. Do you, Dick?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know,’ said Dick. ‘I can’t make up my mind. She hasn’t really proved
whether she’s trustable or not yet. Anyway, she came back to tell us all she
knew last night, didn’t she?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t believe she did come back for that,’ said Anne obstinately. ‘I believe
she was coming back to pry and snoop.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
may be right,’ said Dick. ‘Look, here’s a bus-stop - and a time-table!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
bus did apparently go quite near Ravens Wood, and was due in five minutes’
time. They sat down on the bus-stop seat and waited. The bus was punctual and
came rumbling down the road, full of women going to Ravens Market. They all
seemed very plump women and had enormous baskets, so it was difficult to
squeeze inside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Everyone
got out at Ravens Market. Julian asked his way to Ravens Wood. ‘There it is,’
said the conductor, pointing down the hill to where trees grew thickly in the
valley. ‘It’s a big place. Don’t get lost! And look out for the gipsies.
There’s usually hordes of them there!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thanks,’
said Julian, and the three of them set off down the hill into the valley. They
came to the wood.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
a proper wood,’ said Anne. ‘Nothing but trees and trees. I should think it gets
very thick in the middle - like a forest.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
came to a clearing where there was a little gipsy camp. Three rather
dirty-looking caravans stood together, and a crowd of brown gipsy children were
playing some sort of a game with a rope. Julian took a quick look at the
caravans. All had their doors open.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
George here,’ he said in a low voice to the others. ‘I wish I knew exactly
where to go! I suppose if we follow this broad pathway it would be best. After
all, Jo’s caravan must have a fairly broad way to go on.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Can’t
we ask if anyone knows if Jo’s caravan is anywhere about?’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
don’t know her father’s name,’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
we could say it’s a caravan drawn by a horse called Blackie, and that a girl
called Jo lives in it with her father,’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
I’d forgotten the horse,’ said Julian. He went up to an old woman who was
stirring something in a black pot over a fire of sticks. Julian thought she
looked very like a witch. She peered up at him through tangled grey hair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Can
you tell me if there’s a caravan in the wood drawn by a horse called Blackie?’
he asked politely. ‘A girl called Jo lives in it with her father. We want to
see her.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
old woman blinked. She took an iron spoon out of the pot and waved it to the
right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Simmy’s
gone down-away there,’ she said. ‘I never saw Jo this time - but the caravan
door was shut so maybe she was inside. What you want with Jo?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
- only just to see her,’ said Julian, quite unable to think up a good reason
for going to visit a gipsy-child on the spur of the moment. ‘Is Simmy her
father?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
old woman nodded and began to stir her pot again. Julian went back to the
others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘This
way,’ he said, and they went down the rutted path. It was just wide enough for
a caravan to go down. Anne looked up. Tree branches waved overhead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
should think they brush against the roof of a caravan all the time,’ she said.
‘What a queer life to live - in a little caravan day in and day out, hiding
yourself away in woods and fields!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
walked on down the path, which wound about through the trees, following the
clear spaces. Sometimes the trees were so close together that it seemed
impossible for a caravan to go between. But the wheel-ruts showed that caravans
did go down the path.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
a time the wood became thicker, and the sunlight could hardly pierce through
the branches. Still the path went on, but now it seemed as if only one set of
wheel-ruts was marked on it. They were probably the wheels of Simmy’s caravan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Here
and there a tree was shorn of one of its branches, and a bush uprooted and
thrown to one side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Simmy
meant to go deep into the wood last time he came,’ said Julian, pointing to
where a bush lay dying by the side of the path. ‘He’s cleared the way here and
there. Actually we aren’t on a proper path any longer - we’re only following
wheel-ruts.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was true. The path had faded out. They were now in a thick part of the wood,
with only the ruts of the caravan wheels to guide them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
fell silent, The wood was very quiet. There were no birds singing, and the
branches of the trees were so thick that there was a kind of green twilight
round them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wish we had Timmy with us,’ half-whispered Anne at last.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
nodded. He had been wishing that a long time. He was also wishing he hadn’t
brought Anne - but when they had started out, they had Jo with them to guide
them, and warn them of any danger. Now they hadn’t.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think we’d better go very cautiously,’ he said, in a low voice. ‘We may come on
the caravan unexpectedly. We don’t want Simmy to hear us and lie in wait.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
go a little way in front and warn you if I hear or see anything,’ said Dick.
Julian nodded to him and he went on ahead, peering round the trees when he came
to any curve in the wheel-rut path. Julian began to think of what they would do
when they reached the caravan. He was pretty certain that both George and Timmy
would be found locked up securely inside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
we can undo the door and let them out, Timmy will do the rest,’ he thought.
‘He’s as good as three policemen! Yes - that’s the best plan.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
suddenly stopped and lifted up his hand in warning. He peered round the bole of
a big tree, and then turned and nodded excitedly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
found the caravan!’ said Anne, and her heart began its usual thump-thump-thump
of excitement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Stay
here,’said Julian to Anne, and went on quietly to join Dick. Anne crept under a
bush. She didn’t like this dark, silent wood, with the green light all round.
She peered out, watching the boys.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
had suddenly seen the caravan. It was small, badly needed painting, and
appeared quite deserted. No fire burned outside. No Simmy was sitting anywhere
about. Not even Blackie the horse was to be seen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys watched intently for a few minutes, not daring to move or speak. There was
absolutely no sound or movement from the tiny clearing in which the caravan
stood.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Windows
and doors were shut. The shafts rested crookedly on the ground. The whole place
seemed deserted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Dick,’
whispered Julian at last, ‘Simmy doesn’t seem to be about. This is our chance!
We’ll creep over to the caravan and look into the window. We’ll attract
George’s attention, and get her out as soon as we can. Timmy, too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Funny
he doesn’t bark,’ said Dick, also in a whisper. ‘I suppose he can’t have heard
us. Well - shall we get over to the caravan now?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
ran quietly to the little caravan, and Julian peered through the dirty window.
It was too dark inside to see anything at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George!’
he whispered. ‘George! Are you there?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no answer from inside the caravan. Perhaps George was asleep - or drugged!
And Timmy, too. Julian’s heart sank. It would be dreadful if George had been
ill-treated. He tried to peer inside the window again, but what with the
darkness of the wood and the dirt on the pane, it really was impossible to see
inside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shall
we bang on the door?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
That would only bring Simmy if he’s anywhere about - and if George is inside
and awake, our voices would have attracted her attention,’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went quietly round the caravan to the door at the back. It had no key in the
lock. Julian frowned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Simmy
must have got the key with him. That would mean breaking down the door and
making a noise. He went up the few steps and pushed at the door. It seemed very
solid indeed. How could he break it down, anyway? He had no tools, and it
didn’t look as if kicking and shoving would burst it in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
knocked gently on the door - rap-rap-rap. Not a movement from inside. It seemed
very strange. He tried the round handle, and it turned easily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
not only turned easily - but the door opened! ‘Dick! It’s not locked!’ said
Julian, forgetting to whisper in his surprise. He went inside the dark caravan,
hardly hoping now to see George or Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
pushed in after him. There was a nasty sour smell and it was very untidy.
Nobody was there. It was quite empty, as Julian had feared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
groaned. ‘All this way for nothing. They’ve taken George somewhere else. We’re
done, now, Dick - we haven’t a clue where to go next.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
fished his torch out of his pocket. He flashed it over the untidy jumble of
things in the caravan, looking for some sign that George had been there. But
there was nothing at all that he could see to show him that either Timmy or
George had been there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
quite likely that Jo made the whole story up about her father taking George
away,’ he groaned. ‘It doesn’t look as if they’ve been here at all.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>His
torch flashed on to the wooden wall of the caravan, and Dick saw something that
arrested his attention. Somebody had written something on the wall!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
looked more closely. ‘Julian! Isn’t that George’s writing? Look! What’s written
there?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Both
boys bent towards the dirty wall. ‘Red Tower, Red Tower, Red Tower,’ was
written again and again, in very small writing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Red
Tower!’ said Dick. ‘What does that mean? Is it George’s writing?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
I think so,’ said Julian. ‘But why should she keep writing that? Do you suppose
that’s where they have taken her to? She might have heard them saying something
and scribbled it down quickly - just in case we found the caravan and examined
it. Red Tower! It sounds queer.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
must be a house with a red tower, I should think,’ said Dick. ‘Well - we’d
better get back and tell the police now - and they’ll have to hunt for a red
tower somewhere.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Bitterly
disappointed the boys went back to Anne. She scrambled out from under her bush
as they came.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘George
is not there,’ said Dick. ‘She’s gone. But she has been there - we saw some
scribbled writing on the wall of the caravan inside.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
do you know it’s hers?’ said Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
she’s written “Red Tower” ever so many times, and the R’s and the T’s are just
like hers,’ said Dick. ‘We think she must have heard someone talking and say
they were taking her to Red Tower, wherever it is. We’re going straight back to
the police now. I wish we hadn’t trusted Jo. We’ve wasted such a lot of time.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let’s
have something to eat,’ said Julian. ‘We won’t sit down. We’ll eat as we go.
Come on.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
somehow nobody wanted anything to eat. Anne said she felt sick. Julian was too
worried to eat, and Dick was so anxious to go that he felt he couldn’t even
wait to unpack sandwiches! So they started back down the path, following the
wheel-ruts as before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
suddenly grew very dark indeed, and on the leaves of the trees heavy rain fell
with a loud, pattering sound. Thunder suddenly rolled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
caught hold of Julian’s arm, startled. ‘Julian! It’s dangerous to be in a wood,
isn’t it, in a storm? Oh, Julian, we’ll be struck by lightning.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
we shan’t,’ said Julian. ‘A wood’s no more dangerous than anywhere else. It’s
sheltering under a lone tree somewhere that’s dangerous. Look - there’s a
little clearing over there; we’ll go to that, if you like.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
when they got to the little clearing the rain was falling down in such heavy
torrents that Julian could see that they would immediately be soaked through.
He hurried Anne to a clump of bushes, and they crouched underneath, waiting for
the storm to pass.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Soon
the rain stopped, and the thunder rolled away to the east. There had been no
lightning that they could see. The wood grew just a little lighter, as if
somewhere above the thick green branches the sun might be shining!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hate this wood,’ said Dick, crawling out from the bushes. ‘Come on, for
goodness’ sake. Let’s get back to the wheel-rut path.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
led the way through the trees. Julian called to him. ‘Wait, Dick. Are you sure
this is right?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
stopped, anxious at once. ‘Well,’ he said uncertainly. ‘I thought it was. But I
don’t know. Do you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
thought it was through those trees there,’ said Julian. ‘Where that little
clearing is.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went to it. ‘It’s not the same clearing, though,’ said Anne at once. ‘The other
clearing had a dead tree at one side. There’s no dead tree here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Blow!’
said Julian. ‘Well - try this way, then.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
went to the left, and soon found themselves in a thicker part of the wood than
ever. Julian’s heart went cold. What an absolute idiot he was! He might have
known that it was madness to leave the only path they knew without marking it
in some way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
he hadn’t the very faintest idea where the wheel-rut way was. It might be in
any direction! He hadn’t even the sun to guide him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
looked gloomily at Dick. ‘Bad show!’ said Dick. ‘Well - we’ll have to make up
our minds which way to go! We can’t just stay here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
might go deeper and deeper and deeper,’ said Anne, with a sudden little gulp of
fear. Julian put his arm round her shoulder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
if we go deeper and deeper, we shall come out on the other side!’ he said.
‘It’s not an endless wood, you know.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
let’s go straight on through the wood, then,’ said Anne. ‘We’ll have to come
out the other side some time.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys didn’t tell her that it was impossible to go straight through a wood. It
was necessary to go round' clumps of bushes, to double back sometimes when they
came to an impenetrable part, and to go either to the left or right when clumps
of trees barred their way. It was quite impossible to go straight through.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘For
all I know we’re probably going round and round in circles, like people do when
they’re lost in the desert,’ he thought. He blamed himself bitterly for having
left the wheel-ruts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
made their way on and on for about two or three hours, and then Anne stumbled
and fell. ‘I can’t go on any further,’ she wept. ‘I must have a rest.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
glanced at his watch and whistled. Where ever had the time gone? It was almost
three o’clock. He sat down by Anne and pulled her close to him. ‘What we want
is a jolly good meal,’ he said. ‘We’ve had nothing since breakfast.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
said she still wasn’t hungry, but when she smelt the meat sandwiches that Joan
had made she changed her mind. She was soon eating with the others, and feeling
much better.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
nothing to drink, unfortunately,’ said Dick. ‘But Joan’s packed tomatoes and
plums, too - so we’ll have those instead of a drink. They’re nice and juicy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
ate everything, though secretly Julian wondered if it was a good thing to wolf
all their food at once. There was no telling how long they might be lost in
Ravens Wood! Joan might get worried sooner or later and tell the police they
had gone there, and a search would be made. But it might be ages before they
were found.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Anne
fell asleep after her meal. The boys talked softly over her head. ‘I don’t much
like this,’ said Dick. ‘We set out to find George - and all we’ve done is to
lose ourselves. We don’t seem to be managing this adventure as well as we
usually do.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
we don’t get out before dark we’ll have to make up some kind of bed under a
bush,’ said Julian. ‘We’ll have another go when Anne wakes - and we’ll do a bit
of yelling, too. Then if we’re still lost, we’ll bed down for the night.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
when darkness came - and it came very early in that thick wood, they were still
as much lost as ever. They were all hoarse with shouting, too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
silence they pulled bracken from an open space and piled it under a sheltering
bush. ‘Thank goodness it’s warm tonight,’ said Dick, trying to sound cheerful.
‘Well - we’ll all feel much more lively in the morning. Cuddle up to me, Anne,
and keep warm.That’s right. Julian’s on the other side of you! This is quite an
adventure.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t like adventures,’ said Anne, in a small voice, and immediately fell
asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
took a long time for Julian and Dick to fall asleep. They were both worried -
worried about George and worried about themselves, too. They were also very
hungry, and their hunger kept them awake as much as their anxiety.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
fell asleep at last. Julian still lay awake, hoping that Anne was nice and warm
between them. He didn’t feel very warm himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
heard the whisper of the leaves in the trees, and then the scamper of tiny paws
behind his head. He wondered what animal it was - a mouse?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Something
ran lightly over his hair and he shivered. A spider, perhaps. Well he couldn’t
move, or he would disturb Anne. If it wanted to make a web over his hair it
would have to. He shut his eyes and began to doze off. Soon he was dreaming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
awoke very suddenly, with a jump. He heard the hoot of an owl. That must have
been what wakened him. Now it would be ages before he slept again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
shut his eyes. The owl hooted again and Julian frowned, hoping that Anne would
not wake. She stirred and muttered in her sleep. Julian touched her lightly.
She felt quite warm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
settled down again and shut his eyes. Then he opened them. He had heard
something! Not an owl or the pattering of some little animal’s feet - but
another sound, a bigger one. He listened. There was a rustling going on
somewhere. Some much bigger animal was about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was suddenly panic-stricken. Then he reasoned sternly with himself. There were
no dangerous wild animals in this country, not even a wolf. It was probably a
badger out on a nightly prowl. He listened for any snuffling sound, but he
heard none, only the rustling as the animal moved about through the bushes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
came nearer. It came right over to him! He felt warm breath on his ear and made
a quick movement of revulsion. He sat up swiftly and put out his hand. It fell
on something warm and hairy. He withdrew his hand at once, feeling for his
torch in panic. To touch something warm and hairy in the pitch darkness was too
much even for Julian!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Something
caught hold of his arm, and he gave a yell and fought it off. Then he got the
surprise of his life. The animal spoke.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian!’
said a voice. ‘It’s me!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian,
his hands trembling, flashed his torch round. The light fell on a dirty dark
face, with tangled hair over its eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Jo!’
said Julian. ‘Jo! What on earth are you doing here? You scared me stiff. I
thought you were some horrible hairy animal. I must have touched your head.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
did,’ said Jo, squeezing in under the bush. Anne and Dick, who had both wakened
up at Julian’s yell, gazed at her, speechless with surprise. Jo of all people,
here in the middle of the wood. How had she got there?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’re
surprised to see me, aren’t you?’ said Jo. ‘I got caught by Jake. But he didn’t
know you were following behind. He dragged me off to the cottage he lives in
and locked me up. He knew I’d spent the night at Kirrin Cottage, and he said he
was going to take me to my Dad, who would give me the worst hiding I’d ever had
in my life. So he would, too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘So
that’s what happened to you!’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Then
I broke the window and got out,’ said Jo. ‘That Jake! I’ll never do a thing he
tells me again - locking me up like that. I hate that worse than anything!
Well, then I came to look for you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
did you find us?’ said Julian, in wonder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
first I went to the caravan,’ said Jo. ‘Old Ma Smith - the one who always sits
stirring a pot - she told me you’d been asking for my Dad’s caravan. I guessed
you’d go off to find it. So along I went after you - but there was the caravan
all by itself, and nobody there. Not even George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
is George, do you know?’ asked Anne.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
I don’t,’ said Jo. ‘Dad’s taken her somewhere else. I expect he put her on
Blackie, because Blackie’s gone, too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
about Timmy?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
looked away. ‘I reckon they’ve done Timmy in,’ she said. Nobody said anything.
The thought that Timmy might have come to harm was too dreadful to speak about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
did you find us here?’ asked Julian at last.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
was easy,’ said Jo. ‘I can follow anybody’s trail. I’d have come quicker, but
it got dark. My, you did wander round, didn’t you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes.
We did,’ said Dick. ‘Do you mean to say you followed all our wanderings in and
out and round about?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
yes,’ said Jo. ‘Properly tired me out, you did, with all your messing round and
round. Why did you leave the wheel-ruts?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
told her. ‘You’re daft,’ said Jo. ‘If you’re going somewhere off the path, just
mark the trees with a nick as you go along - one here and one there - and then
you can always find your way back.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
didn’t even know we were lost till we were,’ said Anne. She took Jo’s hand and
squeezed it. She was so very, very glad to see her. Now they would be able to
get out of this horrible wood.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
was surprised and touched, but she withdrew her hand at once. She didn’t like
being fondled, though she would not have minded Dick taking her hand. Dick was
her hero, someone above all others. He had been kind to her, and she was glad
she had found him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
found something written on the caravan wall,’ said Julian. ‘We think we know
where George has been taken. It’s a place called Red Tower. Do you know it?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
no place called Red Tower,’ said Jo at once. ‘It’s...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
be silly, Jo. You can’t possibly know if there’s no place called Red Tower,’
said Dick, impatiently. ‘There may be hundreds of places with that name. That’s
the place we’ve got to find, anyway. The police will know it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
gave a frightened movement. ‘You promised you wouldn’t tell the police.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- we promised that - but only if you took us to George,’ said Dick. ‘And you
didn’t. And anyway if you had taken us to the caravan George wouldn’t have been
there. So we’ll jolly well have to call in the police now and find out where
Red Tower is.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Was
it Red Tower George had written down?’ asked Jo. ‘Well, then - I can take you
to George!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
can you, when you say there’s no place called Red Tower?’ began Julian,
exasperated. ‘I don’t believe a word you say, Jo. You’re a fraud - and I
half-believe you’re still working for our enemies too!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
not,’ said Jo. ‘I’m NOT! You’re mean. I tell you Red Tower isn’t a place. Red
Tower is a man.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a most surprised silence after this astonishing remark. A man! Nobody had
thought.of that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
spoke again, pleased at the surprise she had caused. ‘His name’s Tower, and
he’s got red hair, flaming red - so he’s called Red Tower. See?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Are
you making this up, by any chance?’ asked Dick, after a pause. ‘You have made
up things before, you know.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right. You can think I made it up, then,’ said Jo, sulkily. ‘I’ll go. Get
yourselves out of this the best you can. You’re mean.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
wriggled away, but Julian caught hold of her arm. ‘Oh, no, you don’t! You’ll
just stay with us now, if I have to tie you to me all night long! You see, we
find it difficult to trust you, Jo - and that’s your fault, not ours. But we’ll
trust you just this once. Tell us about Red Tower, and take us to where he
lives. If you do that, we’ll trust you for evermore.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Will
Dick trust me, too?’ said Jo, trying to get away from Julian’s hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Dick shortly. He felt as if he would dearly like to smack this
unpredictable, annoying, extraordinary, yet somehow likeable ragamuffin girl.
‘But I don’t feel as if I like you very much at present. If you want us to like
you as well as to trust you, you’ll have to help us a lot more than you have
done.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right,’ said Jo, and she wriggled down again. ‘I’m tired. I’ll show you the way
out in the morning, and then I’ll take you to Red’s. But you won’t like Red.
He’s a beast.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
would say nothing more, so once again they tried to sleep. They felt happier
now that Jo was with them and would show them the right way out of the wood.
Julian hardly thought she would leave them in the lurch now. He shut his eyes
and was soon dreaming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
woke first. She uncurled like an animal and stretched, forgetting where she
was. She woke up the others, and they all sat up, feeling stiff, dirty and
hungry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
thirsty as well as hungry,’ complained Anne. ‘Where can we get something to eat
and drink?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Better
get back home for a wash and a meal, and to let Joan know where we are,’ said
Julian. ‘Come on, Jo - show us the way.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
led the way immediately. The others wondered how in the world she knew it. They
were even more astonished when they found themselves on the wheel-rut path in
about two minutes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Gracious!
We were as near to it as that!’ said Dick. ‘And yet we seemed to walk for miles
through this horrible wood.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
did,’ said Jo. ‘You went round in an enormous circle, and you were almost back
where you started. Come on - I’ll take you my way back to your house now - it’s
much better than any bus!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
bustled about after this outburst, and was soon frying sausages and tomatoes

great hunks of bread and butter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can’t even go and wash till I’ve had something,’ said Anne. ‘I’m glad you knew

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
had really been amazing to see the deft, confident manner in which Jo had taken

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
didn’t mind remarks of this sort at all. She chewed her bread and grinned. She
wolfed the breakfast with no manners at all - but the others were nearly as
bad, they were so hungry!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
a spade and trowel you want for your food this morning, not a knife and fork,’
said Joan, disapprovingly. ‘You’re just shovelling it in. No, I can’t cook you
any more, Master Julian. There’s not a sausage left in the house nor a bit of
bacon either. You fill up with toast and marmalade.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
bath water ran vigorously after breakfast. All four had baths. Jo didn’t want
to, but Joan ran after her with a carpet beater, vowing and declaring she would
beat the dust and dirt out of her if she didn’t bath. So Jo bathed, and quite
enjoyed it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
had a conference after breakfast. ‘About this fellow, Red Tower,’ said Julian.
‘Who is he, Jo? What do you know about him?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
much,’ said Jo. ‘He’s rich, and he talks queer, and I think he’s mad. He gets
fellows like Dad and Jake to do his dirty work for him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
dirty work?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
- stealing and such,’ said Jo, vaguely. ‘I don’t really know. Dad doesn’t tell
me much; I just do what I’m told, and don’t ask questions. I don’t want more
slaps than I get!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where
does he live?’ said Anne. ‘Far away?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
taken a house on the cliff,’ said Jo. ‘I don’t know the way by land. Only by
boat. It’s a queer place - like a small castle almost, with very thick stone
walls. Just the place for Red, my Dad says.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Have
you been there?’ asked Dick, eagerly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
nodded. ‘Oh, yes,’ she said. ‘Twice. My Dad took a big iron box there once, and
another time he took something in a sack. I went with him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why?’
asked Julian. ‘I shouldn’t have thought he’d wanted you messing round!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
rowed the boat,’ said Jo. ‘I told you, Red’s place is up on the cliff. We got
to it by boat; I don’t know the way by road. There’s a sort of cave behind a
cove we landed at, and we went in there. Red met us. He came from his house on
the cliff, he said, but I don’t know how.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
looked at Jo closely. ‘I suppose you’ll say next that there’s a secret way from
the cave to the house!’ he said. ‘Go on!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Must
be,’ said Jo. She suddenly glared at Dick. ‘Don’t you believe me? All right,
find the place yourself!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- it does sound like a tale in a book,’ said Julian. ‘You’re sure it is all
true, Jo? We don’t want to go on a wild-goose chase again, you know.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
no wild goose in my story,’ said Jo, puzzled. She hadn’t the faintest idea what
a wild-goose chase was. ‘I’m telling you about Red. I’m ready to go when you
are. We’ll have to have a boat, though.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
take George’s,’ said Dick, getting up. ‘Look, Jo - I think we’d better leave
Anne behind this time. I don’t like taking her into something that may be
dangerous.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
want to come,’ said Anne at once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
you stay with me,’ said Joan. ‘I want company today. ‘I’m getting scared of
being by myself with all these things happening. You stay with me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
Anne stayed behind, really rather glad, and watched the other three go off
together. Jo slipped into the hedge to avoid being seen by Jake, in case he was
anywhere about. Julian and Dick went down to the beach and glanced round to
make sure the gipsy was nowhere in sight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
beckoned to Jo, and she came swiftly from hiding, and leapt into George’s boat.
She lay down in it so that she couldn’t be seen. The boys hauled the boat down
to the sea. Dick jumped in, and Julian pushed off when a big wave came. Then he
jumped in too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
far up the coast is it?’ he asked Jo, who was still at the bottom of the boat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know,’ said Jo, with her usual irritating vagueness. ‘Two hours, three
hours, maybe.’<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>     </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Time
didn’t mean the same to Jo as it did to the others. For one thing Jo had no
wrist-watch as they had, always there to be glanced at. She wouldn’t have found
one any use if she had, because she couldn’t tell the time. Time was just day
and night to her, nothing else.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
put up the little sail. The wind was in their favour, so he thought he might as
well use it. They would get there all the more quickly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Did
you bring the lunch that Joan put up for us?’ said Julian to Dick. ‘I can’t see
it anywhere.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Jo!
You must be lying on it!’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
won’t hurt it,’ said Jo. She sat up as soon as they were well out to sea, and
offered to take the tiller.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
was very deft with it, and the boys soon saw that they could leave her to guide
the boat. Julian unfolded the map he had brought with him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wonder whereabouts this place is where Red lives,’ he said. ‘It’s pretty
desolate all the way up to the next place, Port Limmersley, If there is a
castle-like building, it must be a very lonely place to live in. There’s not
even a little fishing village shown for miles.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boat went on and on, scudding at times before a fairly strong wind. Julian took
the tiller from Jo. ‘We’ve come a long way already,’ he said. ‘Where is this
place? Are you sure you’ll know it, Jo?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of
course,’ said Jo, scornfully. ‘I think it’s round that far-off rocky cliff.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
was right. As they rounded the high cliff, which jutted fiercely with great
slanting rocks, she pointed in triumph.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There
you are! See that place up there? That’s Red’s place.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys looked at it. It was a dour, grey stone building, and was, as Jo had said,
a little like a small castle. It brooded over the sea, with one square tower
overlooking the waves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
a cove before you come to the place,’ said Jo. ‘Watch out for it - it’s very
well hidden.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
certainly was. The boat went right past it before they saw it. ‘There it is!’
cried Jo, urgently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
took the sail down and then rowed back. The cove lay between two high layers of
rock that jutted out from the cliff. They rowed right into it. It was very
quiet and calm there, and their boat merely rose and fell as the water swelled
and subsided under it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Can
anyone see us from the house above?’ asked Dick, as they rowed right to the
back of the cove.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t know,’ said Jo. ‘I shouldn’t think so. Look - pull the boat up behind
that big rock. We don’t know who else might come here.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
dragged the boat up. Dick draped it with great armfuls of seaweed, and soon it
looked almost like a rock itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now,
what next?’ said Julian. ‘Where’s this cave you were talking about?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Up
here,’ said Jo, and began to climb up the rocky cliff like a monkey. Both the
boys were very good climbers, but soon they found it impossible to get any
further.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
scrambled down to them. ‘What’s the matter?’ she said. ‘If my Dad can climb up,
surely you can!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Your
Dad was an acrobat,’ said Julian, sliding down a few feet, much too suddenly.
‘Oooh! I don’t much like this. I wish we had a rope.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
one in the boat. I’ll get it,’ said Jo, and slithered down the cliff to the
cove below at a most alarming rate. She limbed up again with the rope. She went
on a good bit higher, and tied the rope to something. It hung down to where
Dick and Julian stood clinging for dear life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was much easier to climb up with the help of a rope. Both boys were soon
standing on a ledge, looking into a curious shaped cave. It was oval-shaped,
and very dark.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘In
here,’ said Jo, and led the way. Dick and Julian followed stumblingly. Where in
the world were they going to now?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
led them into a narrow rocky tunnel, and then out into a wider cave, whose
walls dripped with damp. Julian was thankful for his torch. It was eerie and
chilly and musty. He shivered. Something brushed his face and he leapt back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
was that?’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Bats,’
said Jo, ‘there’s hundreds of them here. That’s why the place smells so sour.
Come on. We go round this rocky bit here into a better cave.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
squeezed round a rocky corner and came inta a drier cave that did not smell so
strongly of bats. ‘I haven’t been any farther than this,’ said Jo. ‘This is
where me and Dad came and waited for Red. He suddenly appeared, but I don’t
know where from.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
he must have come from somewhere,’ said Dick, switching on his torch, too.
‘There’s a passage probably. We’ll soon find it.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
and Julian began to hunt round the cave, looking for a passage or little
tunnel, or even a hole that led into the cliff, upwards towards the house.
Obviously Red must have come down some such passage to reach the cave. Jo
stayed in a corner, waiting. She had no torch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Suddenly
the boys had a tremendous shock. A voice boomed into their cave, a loud and
angry voice that made their hearts beat painfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘SO!
YOU DARE TO COME HERE!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
slipped behind a rock immediately, like an animal going to cover. The boys
stood where they were, rooted to the spot. Where did the voice come from?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who
are you?’ boomed the voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who
are you?’ shouted Julian. ‘Come out and show yourself! We’ve come to see a man
called Red. Take us to him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a moment’s silence, as if the owner of the voice was rather taken aback.
Then it boomed out again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Why
do you want to see Red? Who sent you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nobody.
We came because we want our cousin back, and her dog, too,’ boomed Julian,
making a funnel of his hands and trying to outdo the other voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was another astonished silence. Then two legs appeared out of a hole in the low
ceiling, and someone leapt lightly down beside them. The boys started back in
surprise. They hadn’t expected that the voice came from the roof of the cave!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
flashed his torch on the man. He was a giantlike fellow with flaming red hair.
His eyebrows were red, too, and he had a red beard that partly hid a cruel
mouth. Julian took one look into the man’s eyes and then no more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
mad,’ he thought. ‘So this is Red Tower. What is he? A scientist like Uncle
Quentin, jealous of uncle’s work? Or a thief working on a big scale, trying to
get important papers and sell them? He’s mad, whatever he is.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Red
was looking closely at the two boys. ‘So you think I have your cousin,’ he
said. ‘Who told you such a stupid tale?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
didn’t answer. Red took a threatening step towards him. ‘Who told you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
tell you that when the police come,’ said Julian boldly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Red
stepped back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
police! What do they know'' Why should they come here? Answer me, boy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
a lot to know about you, Mr. Red Tower,’ said Julian, ‘Who sent men to steal my
uncle’s papers? Who sent a note to ask for another lot? Who kidnapped our
cousin, so that she could be held till the papers were sent? Who brought her
here from Simmy’s old caravan. Who...?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Aaaaaah!’
said Red, and there was panic in his voice. ‘How do you know all this? It isn’t
true! But the police - have they heard this fantastic tale, too?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
do you suppose?’ said Julian, wishing with all his heart that the police did
know, and that he was not merely bluffing. Red pulled at his beard. His green
eyes gleamed as he thought quickly and urgently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
suddenly called loudly, turning his head up to the hole in the ceiling.
‘Markhoff! Come down!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Two
legs were swung down through the hole, and a short burly man leapt down beside
the two startled boys,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Go
down the cliff. You will find a boat in the cove, somewhere - the boat we saw
these boys coming in,’ said Red sharply. ‘Smash it to pieces. Then come back
here and take the boys to the yard. Tie them up. We must leave quickly, and
take the girl with us.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
man stood listening, his face sullen. ‘How can we go?’ he said. ‘You know the
helicopter is not ready. You know that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Make
it ready then,’ snapped Red. ‘We leave tonight. The police will be here - do
you hear that? This boy knows everything - he has told me - and the police must
know everything too. I tell you, we must go.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
about the dog?’ said the man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Shoot
it,’ ordered Red. ‘Shoot it before we go. It’s a brute of a dog. We should have
shot it before. Now go and smash the boat.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
man disappeared round the rocky corner that led into the cave of bats. Julian
clenched his fist. He hated to think of George’s boat being smashed to bits.
Red stood there waiting, his eyes glinting in the light of the torches.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’d
take you with us too, if there was room!’ he suddenly snarled at Julian. ‘Yes,
and drop you into the sea!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
can tell your uncle he’ll hear from me about his precious daughter - we’ll make
an exchange. If he wants her back he can send me the notes I want. And many
thanks for coming to warn me. I’ll be off before the police break in.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
began to pace up and down the cave, muttering. Dick and Julian watched in
silence. They felt afraid for George. Would Red really take her off in his
helicopter? He looked mad enough for anything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
sullen man came back at last. ‘It’s smashed,’ he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right,’
said Red. ‘I’ll go first. Then the boys. Then you. And boot them if they make
any trouble.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Red
swung himself up into the hole in the roof. Julian and Dick followed, not
seeing any point in resisting. The man behind was too sulky to stand any
nonsense. He followed immediately.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
had been no sign of Jo. She had kept herself well hidden, scared stiff. Julian
didn’t know what to do about her. He couldn’t possibly tell Red about her - and
yet it seemed terrible to leave her behind all alone. Well - she was a
sharp-brained little monkey. Maybe she would think up something for herself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Red
led the way through another cave into a passage with such a low roof that he
had to walk bent almost double.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
man behind had now switched on a very powerful torch, and it was easier to see.
The passage sloped upwards and was obviously leading to the building on the
cliff. At one part it was so steep that a hand-rail had been put for the
climber to help himself up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
came a flight of steps hewn out of the rock itself - rough, badly-shaped steps,
so steep that it was quite an effort to climb from one to the next.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
the top of the steps was a stout door set on a broad ledge. Red pushed it open
and daylight flooded in. Julian blinked. He was looking out on an enormous yard
paved with great flat stones with weeds growing in all the crevices and cracks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the middle stood a helicopter. It looked very strange and out-of-place in that
old yard. The house, with its one tall square tower, was built round three
sides of the yard. It was covered with creeper and thick-stemmed ivy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
high wall ran along the fourth side, with an enormous gate in the middle. It
was shut, and from where he stood Julian could see the huge bolts that were
drawn across.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
almost like a small fort,’ thought Julian, in astonishment. Then he felt
himself seized and taken to a shed nearby. His arms were forced behind him and
his wrists were tightly tied. Then the rope was run through an iron loop and
tied again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
glared at the burly fellow now doing the same to Dick. He twisted about to try
to see how the rope was tied, but he couldn’t even turn, he was so tightly
tethered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
looked up at the tower. A small, forlorn face was looking out of the window
there. Julian’s heart jumped and beat fast. That must be poor old George up
there. He wondered if she had seen them. He hoped not, because she would know
that he and Dick had been captured, and she would be very upset.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Where
was Timmy? There seemed no sign of him. But wait a minute - what was that lying
inside what looked like a summer-house on the opposite side of the yard? Was it
Timmy? Surely he would have barked a welcome when he heard them coming into the
yard, if it was Timmy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
that my cousin’s dog?’ he asked the sullen man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
man nodded. ‘Yes. He’s been doped half the time, he barked so. Savage brute,
isn’t he? Ought to be shot, I reckon.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Red
had gone across the yard and had disappeared through a stone archway. The
sullen man now followed him. Julian and Dick were left by themselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ve
muddled things again,’ said Julian, with a groan. ‘Now these fellows will be
off and away, and take George with them - they’ve been nicely warned!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
said nothing. He felt very miserable, and his bound wrists hurt him, too. Both
boys stood there, wondering what would happen to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Psssssst!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
was that? Julian turned round sharply and looked in the direction of the door
that led from underground into the yard. Jo stood there, half-hidden by the
archway over the door. ‘Pssssst! I’ll come and untie you. Is the coast clear?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Jo!’
said the boys together, and their spirits lifted at once. ‘Come on!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no one about in the yard. Jo skipped lightly across from the doorway and
slipped inside the shed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
a knife in my back pocket,’ said Julian. ‘Get it out. It would be quicker to
cut these ropes than to untie them. My word, Jo - I was never so pleased to see
anyone in my life!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
grinned as she hauled out Julian’s sturdy pocketknife. She opened it and ran
her thumb lightly over the blade. It was beautifully sharp. She set to work to
saw the blade across the thick rope. It cut easily through the fibres.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
waited behind,’ she said, rapidly. ‘Then I followed when it was safe. But it
was very dark and I didn’t like it. Then I came to that door and peeped out. I
was glad when I saw you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Good
thing the men didn’t guess you were there,’ said Dick. ‘Good old Jo! I take
back any nasty thing I’ve ever said about you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
beamed. She cut the last bit of rope that bound Julian, and he swung himself
away from the iron loop and began to rub his stiff, aching wrists. Jo set to
work on Dick’s bonds. She soon had those cut through, too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
George?’ she asked, after she had helped Dick to rub his wrists and arms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Up
in that tower,’ said Julian. ‘If we dared to go out in that yard you could look
up and see her. And there’s poor old Tim, look - half-doped - lying in that
summerhouse place over there.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
shan’t let him be shot,’ said Jo. ‘He’s a nice dog. I shall go and drag him
down into those caves underground.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
now!’ said Julian, horrified. ‘If you’re seen now, you’ll spoil everything.
We’ll all be tied up then!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Jo had already darted over to the summer-house and was fondling poor old Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
slam of a door made the boys jump and sent Jo into the shadows at the back of
the summer-house at once. It was Red, coming across the yard!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Quick!
He’s coming over here!’ said Dick, in a panic. ‘Let’s get back to the iron
loops and put our hands behind us so that he thinks we’re still bound.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So,
when Red came over to the door of the shed, it looked exactly as if the boys
still had their hands tied behind them. He laughed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
can stay here till the police come!’ he said. Then he shut the shed door and
locked it. He strolled over to the helicopter and examined it thoroughly. Then
back he went to the door he had come from, opened it, and slammed it shut. He
was gone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
everything was quiet Jo sped back from the summer-house to the shed. She
unlocked the door of the shed. ‘Come out,’ she said. ‘And we’ll lock it again.
Then nobody will know you aren’t here. Hurry!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was nothing for it but to come out and hope there was nobody looking. Jo locked
the shed door after them and hurried them back to the door that led
underground. They slipped through it and half-fell down the steep steps.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thanks,
Jo,’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
sat down. Julian scratched his head, and for the life of him could not think of
anything sensible to do. The police were not coming because they didn’t know a
thing about Red, or where George was or anything. And before long George would
be flown off in that helicopter, and Timmy would be shot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
thought of the high square tower and groaned. ‘There’s no way of getting George
out of that tower,’ he said aloud. ‘It’ll be locked and barred, or George would
have got out at once. We can’t even get to her. It’s no good trying to make our
way into the house - we’d be seen and caught at once.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
looked at Dick. ‘Do you badly want George to be rescued?’ she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
a silly question,’ said Dick. ‘I want it more than anything else in the world.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well
- I’ll go and get her, then,’ said Jo, and she got up as if she really meant it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Don’t
make jokes now,’ said Julian. ‘This really is serious, Jo.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
so am I,’ retorted Jo. ‘I’ll get her out, you see if I don’t. Then you’ll know
I’m trustable, won’t you? You think I’m mean and thieving and not worth a
penny, and I expect you’re right. But I can do some things you can’t, and if
you want this thing, I’ll do it for you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How?’
said Julian, astonished and disbelieving.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
sat down again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
saw that tower, didn’t you?’ she began. ‘Well, it’s a big one, so I reckon
there’s more than one room in it - and if I can get into the room next to
George’s I could undo her door and set her free.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
how do you think you’re going to get into the room next to hers?’ said Dick,
scornfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Climb
up the wall, of course,’ said Jo. ‘It’s set thick with ivy. I’ve often climbed
up walls like that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boys looked at her. ‘Were you the Face at the Window by any chance?’ said
Julian, remembering Anne’s fright. ‘I bet you were. You’re like a monkey,
climbing and darting about. But you can’t climb up that great high wall, so
don’t think it. You’d fall and be killed, We couldn’t let you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Pooh!’
said Jo, with great scorn. ‘Fall off a wall like that! I’ve climbed up a wall
without any ivy at all! There’s always holes and cracks to hold on to. That one
would be easy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was quite dumbfounded to think that Jo really meant all this. Dick remembered
that Jo’s father was an acrobat. Perhaps that kind of thing was in the family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
just ought to see me on a tight-rope,’ said Jo earnestly. ‘I can dance on it -
and I never have a safety-net underneath - that’s baby-play! Well, I’m going.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Without
another word she climbed the steep steps lightly as a goat and stood poised in
the archway of the door. All was quiet. Like a squirrel she leapt and bounded
over the courtyard and came to the foot of the ivy-covered tower. Julian and
Dick were now at the doorway that led into the yard, watching her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She’ll
be killed,’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Talk
about pluck!’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
never saw such a kid in my life. There she goes - just like a monkey.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And,
sure enough, up the ivy went Jo, climbing lightly and steadily. Her hands
reached out and tested each ivy-stem before she threw her weight on it, and her
feet tried each one, too, before she stood on it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Once
she slipped when an ivy-stem came away from the wall. Julian and Dick watched,
their hearts in their mouths. But Jo merely clutched at another piece of stem
and steadied herself once. Then up she went again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Up
and up, Past the first storey, past the second, and up to the third. Only one
more now and she would be up to the topmost one. She seemed very small as she
neared the top.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
can’t bear to look and I can’t bear not to,’ said Dick, pretending to shield
his eyes and almost trembling with nervousness. ‘If she fell now - what should
we do?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
shut up,’ said Julian, between his teeth. ‘She won’t fall. She’s like a cat.
There - she’s making for the window next to George’s. It’s open at the bottom.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
now sat triumphantly on the broad window-sill of the room next to George’s. She
waved impudently to the boys far below. Then she pushed with all her might at
the window to open it a little more. It wouldn’t budge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
Jo laid herself flat, and by dint of much wriggling and squeezing, she managed
to slip through the narrow space between the bottom of the window-pane and the
sill. She disappeared from sight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Both
boys heaved heartfelt sighs of relief. Dick found that his knees were shaking.
He and Julian retired into the underground passage below the steep steps and
sat there in silence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Worse
than a circus,’ said Dick at last. ‘I’ll never be able to watch acrobats again.
What’s she doing now, do you suppose?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
was very busy. She had fallen off the inside windowsill with a bump, and
bruised herself on the floor below. But she was used to bruises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
picked herself up and shot behind a chair in case anyone had heard her. Nobody
seemed to have heard anything, so she peeped cautiously out. The room was
furnished with enormous pieces of furniture, old and heavy. Dust was on
everything, and cobwebs hung down from the stone ceiling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
tiptoed to the door. Her feet were bare and made no sound at all. She looked
out. There was a spiral stone stairway nearby going downwards, and on each side
was a door - there must be four rooms in the tower then, one for each corner,
two windows in each. She looked at the door next to the room she was in. That
must be the door of George’s room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a very large key in the lock, and a great bolt had been drawn across. Jo leapt
across and dragged at the bolt. It made a loud noise and she darted back into
the room again. But still nobody came. Back she went to the door again, and
this time turned the enormous key. It was well oiled and turned easily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
pushed open the door and put her head cautiously round. George was there - a
thin and unhappy George, sitting by the window. She stared at Jo as if she
couldn’t believe her eyes!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Psssst!’
said Jo, enjoying all this very much indeed. ‘I’ve come to get you out!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

pinch. Then she pulled at her arm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
got up as if she was in a dream. She went across to the door. She and Jo
slipped out, and stood at the top of the spiral staircase.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Have
to go down here, I suppose,’ said Jo. She cocked her head and listened. Then
she went down a few steps and turned the first spiral bend.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
before she had gone down more than a dozen steps she stopped in fright.

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
panic Jo ran up again and pushed George roughly into the room she had climbed
into first of all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Someone’s
coming,’ she panted. ‘Now we’re finished.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
that red-haired man, I expect,’ said George. ‘He comes up three or four times a
day and tries to make me tell him about my father’s work. But I don’t know a
thing. What are we to do?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
slow steps came up and up, sounding hollowly on the stone stairs. They could
hear a panting breath now, too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An
idea came to Jo. She put her mouth close to George’s ear. ‘Listen! We look
awfully alike. I’ll let myself be caught and locked up in that room - and you
take the chance to slip down and go to Dick and Julian. Red will never know I’m
not you - we’ve even got the same clothes on now, because Joan gave me old ones
of yours.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said George, astounded. ‘You’ll be caught. I don’t want you to do that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’ve
got to,’ whispered Jo, fiercely. ‘Don’t be daft. I can open the window and
climb down the ivy, easy as winking, when Red’s gone. It’s your only chance.
They’re going to take you off in that helicopter tonight.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
footsteps were now at the top. Jo pushed George well behind a curtain and
whispered fiercely again: ‘Anyway, I’m not really doing this for you. I’m doing
it for Dick. You keep there and I’ll do the rest.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a loud exclamation when the man outside discovered the door of George’s
room open. He went in quickly and found nobody there. Out he came and yelled
down the stairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Markhoff!
The door’s open and the girl’s gone! Who opened the door?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Markhoff
came up two steps at a time, looking bewildered. ‘No one! Who could? Anyway,
the girl can’t be far off! I’ve been in the room below all the time since I
locked her in last time. I’d have seen her if she’s gone.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Who
unlocked the door?’ screamed Red, quite beside himself with anger. ‘We’ve got
to have that girl to bargain with.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
she must be in one of the other rooms,’ said Markhoff, stolidly, quite unmoved
by his master’s fury. He went into one on the opposite side to the room where
Jo and George crouched trembling. Then he came into their room, and at once saw
the top of Jo’s head showing behind the chair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
pounced on her and dragged her out. ‘Here she is!’ he said, and didn’t seem to
realize that it was not George at all, but Jo. With their short hair, freckled
faces and their similar clothes they really were alike. Jo yelled and struggled
most realistically. Nobody would have guessed that she had planned to be caught
and locked up!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
shook and shivered behind the curtain, longing to go to Jo’s help, but knowing
that it wouldn’t be of the least use. Besides - there might be a chance now of
finding Timmy. It had almost broken George’s heart to be parted from him for so
long.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
was dragged yelling and kicking into the room and locked in again. Red and
Markhoff began to quarrel about which of them must have left the door unlocked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
were there last,’ said Red.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
if I was, I tell you I didn’t leave the door unlocked,’ Markhoff raged back. ‘I
wouldn’t be so fatheaded. That’s the kind of thing you do.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’ll
do,’ snapped Red. ‘Have you shot that dog yet? No, you haven’t! Go down and do
it before he escapes too!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George’s
heart went stone-cold. Shoot Timmy! Oh no! Dear darling old Timmy. She couldn’t
let him be shot!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
didn’t know what to do. She heard Red and Markhoff go down the stone stairway,
their boots making a terrific noise at first, and then gradually becoming
fainter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
slipped down after them. They went into a nearby room, still arguing. George
risked being seen and shot past the open door. She came to another stairway,
not a spiral one this time, and went down it so fast that she almost lost her
footing. Down and down and down. She met nobody at all. What a very strange
place this was!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
came into a dark, enormous hall that smelt musty and old. She ran to the great
door at the front and tried to open it. It was very heavy, but at last it swung
slowly back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
stood there in the bright sunlight, peering out cautiously. She knew where
Timmy was. She had been able to see him sometimes, flopping queerly in and out
of the summer-house. She knew that because of his continual barking he had been
doped. Red had told her that when she had asked him. He enjoyed making her
miserable. Poor George!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
tore across the courtyard and came to the summerhouse. Timmy was there, lying
as if he were asleep. George flung herself on him, her arms round his thick
neck.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy,
oh Timmy!’ she cried, and couldn’t see him for tears. Timmy, far away in some
drugged dream, heard the voice he loved best in all the world. He stirred. He
opened his eyes and saw George!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
was too heavy with his sleep to do more than lick her face. Then his eyes dosed
again. George was in despair. She was afraid Markhoff would come and shoot him
in a very short time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy!’
she called in his ear. ‘TIMMY! Do wake up. TIMMY!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Tim
opened his eyes again. What - his mistress still here! Then it couldn’t be a
dream. Perhaps his world would soon be right again. Timmy didn’t understand at
all what had been happening the last few days. He staggered to his feet somehow
and stood swaying there, shaking his head. George put her hand on his collar.
‘That’s right, Tim,’ she said. ‘Now you come with me. Quick!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Timmy couldn’t walk, though he had managed to stand. In despair George glanced
over the courtyard, fearful that she would see Markhoff coming at any moment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
saw somebody else. She saw Julian standing in an archway opposite, staring at
her. She was too upset about Timmy even to feel much astonishment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ju!’
she called. ‘Come and help me with Timmy. They’re going to shoot him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
a trice Julian and Dick shot across the courtyard to George. ‘What happened,
Jo?’ said Julian. ‘Did you find George?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Ju
- it’s me, George!’ said George, and Julian suddenly saw that indeed it was
George herself. He had been so certain that it was still Jo that he hadn’t
known it was George!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Help
me with Timmy,’ said George, and she pulled at the heavy dog. ‘Where shall we
hide him?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Down
underground,’ said Dick. ‘It’s the only place. Come on!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>How
they managed it they never quite knew, but they did drag the heavy, stupid
Timmy all the way across the yard and into the archway. They opened the door
and shoved him inside. Poor Timmy fell over and immediately rolled down the
steep steps, landing at the bottom with a frightful thud. George gave a little
scream.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’ll
be hurt!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
astonishingly enough Timmy didn’t seem to be hurt at all. In fact the shaking
seemed to have done him good. He got up and looked round him in rather a
surprised way. Then he whined and looked up at George. He tried to climb the
steep steps, but wasn’t lively enough.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
was down beside him in a moment, patting him and stroking him. The two boys
joined in. Timmy began to feel that things might be all right again, if only he
could get rid of the dreadful, heavy feeling in his head. He couldn’t
understand why he kept wanting to lie down and go to sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Bring
him right down to the caves,’ said Dick. ‘Those men are sure to hunt for him
and for us too when they find Timmy gone, and us not in the shed.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
down the narrow passages and into the little cave with the hole in the roof
they all went, Timmy feeling as if he didn’t quite know which of his legs to
use next.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all sat down in a heap together when they got there, and George got as close to
Timmy as she could. She was glad when the boys switched off their torches. She
badly wanted to cry, and as she never did cry it was most embarrassing if
anyone saw her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
told the boys in a low voice all that had happened with Jo. ‘She made me stay
hidden so that she could be caught,’ she said. ‘She’s wonderful. She’s the
bravest girl I ever knew. And she did it all even though she doesn’t like me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She’s
a queer one,’ said Dick. ‘She’s all right at heart, though - very much all
right.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
talked quickly, in low voices, exchanging their news. George told them how she
had been caught and taken to the caravan with Timmy, who had been knocked out
with a cudgel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We
saw where you had written Red’s name,’ said Dick. ‘That gave us the clue to
come here!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Listen,’
said Julian, suddenly. ‘I think we ought to make a plan quickly. I keep
thinking I hear things. We’re sure to be looked for soon, you know. What can we
do?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
soon as Julian had said that he kept hearing noises, the others felt as if they
could hear some, too. They sat and listened intently, George’s heart beating so
loudly that she was certain the boys would be able to hear it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
think perhaps it’s the sound of the sea, echoing in through the caves and the
tunnels,’ said Julian at last. ‘In the ordinary way, of course, we wouldn’t
need to bother to listen - Timmy would growl at once! But, poor old chap, he’s
so doped and sleepy that I don’t believe he hears anything.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Will
he get all right again?’ asked George, anxiously,' fondling Timmy’s silky ears.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
yes,’ said Julian, sounding much more certain than he really felt. Poor Timmy -
he really did seem ill! There wasn’t even a growl in him,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You’ve
had an awful time these last few days, haven’t you George?’ asked Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said George. ‘I don’t much want to talk about it. If I’d had Timmy with me it
wouldn’t have been so bad, but at first, when they brought me here, all I knew
of Timmy was hearing him bark and snarl and bark and snarl down below in that
yard. Then Red told me he had doped him.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
did you get to Red’s place?’ asked Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
you know I was locked in that horrible-smelling caravan,’ said George. ‘Then
suddenly a man called Simmy - he’s Jo’s father, I think - came and dragged us
out. Timmy was all stupid with the blow they’d given him - and they put him in
a sack and put us both on the caravan horse and took us through the wood and
along a desolate path by the coast till we came here. That was in the middle of
the night.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Poor
old George!’ said Julian. ‘I wish Tim was himself again - I’d love to set him
loose on Red and the other fellow!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wonder what’s happening to Jo,’ said Dick, suddenly remembering that Jo was now
imprisoned in the tower room where George had been kept so long.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
do you suppose Red and Markhoff have discovered that we’ve got out of that
shed, and that Timmy has disappeared, too?’ said Julian. ‘They’ll be in a fury
when they do discover it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Can’t
we get away?’ said George, feeling suddenly scared. ‘You came in a boat, didn’t
you'? Well, can’t we get away in that and go and fetch help for Jo?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a silence. Neither of the boys liked to tell George that her beloved boat
had been smashed to pieces by Markhoff. But she had to know, of course, and
Julian told her in a few short words.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
said nothing at all. They all sat silently for a few minutes, hearing nothing
but Timmy’s heavy, almost snoring, breathing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Would
it be possible, when it’s dark, to creep up into the courtyard, and go round
the walls to the big gate?’ said Dick, breaking the silence. ‘We can’t escape
anywhere down here, it’s certain - not without a boat, anyhow.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Should
we wait till Red and Markhoff have gone off in the helicopter?’ said Julian.
‘Then we’d be much safer.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- but what about Jo?’ asked Dick. ‘They think she’s George, don’t they? - and
they’ll take her away with them, just as they planned to do with George. I
don’t see how we can try to escape ourselves without first trying to save Jo.
She’s been a brick about George.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
talked round and round the idea of trying to save Jo, but nobody could think of
any really sensible plan at all. Time went on, and they all felt hungry and
rather cold. ‘If only we could do something, it wouldn’t be so bad!’ groaned
Dick. ‘I wonder what’s happening up at the house.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Up
at the grey stone house with its big square-tower, plenty was happening!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
begin with, Markhoff had gone to shoot Timmy, as Red had ordered. But when he
got to the summerhouse there was no dog there!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Markhoff
stared in the greatest amazement! The dog had been tied up, even though he was
doped - and now, there was the loose rope, and no dog attached to it!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Markhoff
gazed round the summer-house in astonishment. Who could have loosed Timmy? He
darted across to the locked shed where he had tied Julian and Dick with rope to
the iron staples. The door was still locked, of course - and Markhoff turned
the key and pushed it open.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here,
you...’ he began, shouting roughly. Then he stopped dead. Nobody was there!
Again there was loose rope - this time cut here and there, so that it lay in
short pieces - and again the prisoners had gone. No dog. No boys.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Markhoff
couldn’t believe his eyes. He looked all round the shed. ‘But it was locked
from the outside!’ he muttered. ‘What’s all this? Who’s freed the dog and the
boys? What will Red say?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Markhoff
looked at the helicopter standing ready for flight in the middle of the yard,
and half decided to desert Red and get away himself. Then, remembering Red’s
mad tempers, and his cruel revenges on anyone who dared to let him down, he
changed his mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’d
better get off now, before it’s dark,’ he thought. ‘There’s something queer
going on here. There must be somebody else here that we know nothing about. I’d
better find Red and tell him.’.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went in through the massive front door, and in the hall he came face to face
with two men waiting there. At first he couldn’t see who they were, and he
stepped back hurriedly. Then he saw it was Simmy and Jake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
are you doing here?’ shouted Markhoff. ‘Weren’t you told to keep watch on
Kirrin Cottage and make sure the police weren’t told anything?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Jake, sulkily. ‘And we’ve come to say that that cook - woman called Joan -
went down to the police this morning. She had one of the kids with her - a
girl. The boys don’t seem to be about.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
They’re here - at least, they were,’ said Markhoff. ‘They’ve disappeared again.
As for the police, we’ve heard they’re on the way, and we’ve made our plans. You’re
a bit late with your news! Lot of good you are, with your spying! Clear off now
- we’re taking the girl off in the helicopter before the police come. How did
anyone know where the girl was? Have you been spilling the beans?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Pah!’
said Simmy, contemptuously. ‘Think we want to be messed up with the police? You
must be mad. We want some money. We’ve done all your dirty work, and you’ve
only paid us half you promised. Give us the rest.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
can ask Red for it!’ growled Markhoff. ‘What’s the good of asking me? Go and
ask him!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right.
We will,’ said Jake, his face as black as thunder. ‘We’ve done all he told us -
took the papers for him, took the girl - and that savage brute of a dog too -
see where he bit me on my hand? And all we get is half our money! I reckon
we’ve only just come in time, too. Planning to go off in that there heli-thing
and do us out of our pay. Pah!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Where’s
Red?’ demanded Simmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Upstairs,’
said Markhoff. ‘I’ve got some bad news for him, so he won’t be pleased to see
you and your ugly mugs. Better let me find him for you and say what I’ve got to
say - then you can chip in with your polite little speeches.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Funny,
aren’t you?’ said Jake, in a dangerous voice. Neither he nor Simmy liked
Markhoff. They followed him up the broad stairway, and then up again till they
came to the room that lay below the spiral staircase.<span style='mso-tab-count:

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Red
was there, scanning through the papers that had been stolen from the study of
George’s father. He was in a black temper. He flung down the papers as Markhoff
came in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘These
aren’t the notes I wanted!’ he began, loudly. ‘Well, I’ll hold the girl till I
get... why, Markhoff, what’s up? Anything wrong?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Plenty,’
said Markhoff. ‘The dog’s gone - he wasn’t there when I went to shoot him - and
the two boys have gone too - yes, escaped out of a locked shed. Beats me!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
here are two visitors for you - they want money! They’ve come to tell you what
you already know - the police have been told about you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Red
went purple in the face, and his strange eyes shone with rage. He stared first
at Markhoff, then at Simmy and Jake. Markhoff looked uneasy, but Simmy and Jake
looked back insolently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
- you - you dare to come here when I told you to keep away!’ he shouted.
‘You’ve BEEN paid. You can’t blackmail me for any more money.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
he would have said next nobody knew because from up the spiral stairs there
came yells and screams and the noise of someone apparently trying to batter
down a door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That’s
that girl, I suppose,’ muttered Markhoff. ‘What’s up with her? She’s been quiet
enough before.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’d
better get her out now and go,’ said Red, his face still purple. ‘Jake, go and
get her. Bring her down here, and knock some sense into her if she goes on
screaming.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Fetch
her yourself,’ said Jake, insolently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Red
looked at Markhoff, who immediately produced a revolver.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘My
orders are always obeyed,’ said Red in a suddenly cold voice. ‘Always, you
understand?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Not
only Jake scuttled up the stairs then but also Simmy! They went to the locked
and bolted room at the top and unlocked the door. They pulled back the bolt and
door. Simmy stepped into the room to deal with the imprisoned girl.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
he stopped dead and gaped. He blinked, rubbed his eyes and gaped again. Jake
gaped too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hallo,

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Jo’
said Simmy. ‘Well, of all the... well... Jo!’ Jake recovered first. ‘What’s all
this?’ he said, roughly, to Simmy. ‘What’s Jo doing here? How did she get here?
Where’s the other kid, the one we caught?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘How
do I know?’ said Simmy, still staring at Jo. ‘Look here, Jo - what are you
doing here? Go on, tell us. And where’s the other kid?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Hunt
round the room and see if you can find her!’ said Jo, brightly, keeping on her
toes in case her father or Jake was going to pounce on her. The two men looked
hurriedly round the room. Jake went to a big cupboard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes
- she might be in there,’ said Jo, enjoying herself. ‘You have a good look.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
two bewildered men didn’t know what to think. They had come to get George - and
had only found Jo!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
how - why - what had happened? They didn’t know what to do. Neither of them
wanted to go back and tell Red. So they began to search the room feverishly,
looking into likely and unlikely places, with Jo jeering at them all the time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Better
take the drawers out of that chest and see if she’s here. And don’t forget to
look under the rug. That’s right, Jake, poke your head up the chimney. Mind
George doesn’t kick soot down into your eyes.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
lam you in a minute!’ growled Jake, furiously, opening a small cupboard door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An
angry voice came up the stairway. ‘Jake! What are you doing up there? Bring
that kid down.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She’s
not here!’ yelled back Jake, suddenly losing his temper. ‘What have you done
with her? She’s gone!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Red
came tearing up, two steps at a time, his eyes narrow with anger. The first
thing he saw in the room was Jo - and, of course, he thought she was George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
do you mean - saying she’s not here!’ he raged. ‘Are you mad?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Nope,’
said Jake, his eyes narrow too. ‘Not so mad as you are, anyway, Red. This kid
isn’t that fellow’s daughter - the scientist chap we took the papers from -
this is Simmy’s kid - Jo.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Red
looked at Jake as if he had gone off his head. Then he looked at Jo. He could
see no difference between Jo and the absent George at all - short hair,
freckles, turned-up nose - he couldn’t believe that she was Simmy’s daughter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
fact, he didn’t believe it. He thought Jake and Simmy were suddenly deceiving
him for some strange reason.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Jo had a word to say, too. ‘Yes, I’m Jo,’ she said. ‘I’m not Georgina. She’s
gone. I’m just Jo, and Simmy’s my Dad. You’ve come to save me, haven’t you,
Dad?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Simmy
hadn’t come to do anything of the sort, of course. He stared helplessly at Jo,
completely bewildered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Red
completely lost his temper. As soon as he heard Jo’s voice he realized she was
not George. Somehow or other he had been deceived - and seeing that this was
Simmy’s daughter, then it must be Simmy who had had a hand in the deception!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>He
went suddenly over to Simmy and struck him hard, his eyes blazing. ‘Have you
double-crossed me?’ he shouted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Simmy
was sent flying to the floor. Jake came up immediately to help him. He tripped
up Red, and leapt on him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
looked at the three struggling, shouting men, and shrugged her shoulders. Let
them fight! They had forgotten all about her, and that suited her very well.
She ran to the door and was just going down the stairs, when an idea came into
her sharp little mind. With an impish grin she turned back. She pulled the door
to quietly - and then she turned the key in the lock, and shot the bolt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
three men inside heard the key turn, and in a trice Jake was at the door,
pulling at the handle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She’s
locked us in!’ he raged. ‘And shot the bolt, too.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yell
for Markhoff!’ shouted Red, trembling with fury. And Markhoff, left down in the
room at the bottom of the stairs, suddenly heard yells and shouts and
tremendous hammerings at the door! He tore up at once, wondering what in the
world had happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
was hiding in the next room. As soon as Markhoff went to the door and shot back
the bolt she slipped out and was down the spiral stairway in a trice, unseen by
Markhoff. She grinned to herself and hugged something to her thin little chest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was the big key belonging to the door upstairs. Nobody could unlock that door
now - the key was missing. Jo had it!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Unlock
the door!’ shouted Red. ‘That kid’s gone.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
no key!’ yelled back Markhoff. ‘She must have taken it. I’ll go after her.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it was one thing to go after Jo and quite another to find her. She seemed to
have disappeared into thin air.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Markhoff
raged through every room, but she was nowhere to be seen. He went out into the
courtyard and looked round there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Actually
she had made her way to the kitchen and found the larder. She was very hungry
and wanted something to eat. There was nobody in the kitchen at all, though a
fine fire burned in the big range there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
slipped into the larder, took the key from the outer side of the door and
locked herself in. She saw that there was a small window, and she carefully
unfastened it so that she could make her escape if anyone discovered that she
was locked in the larder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
she tucked in. Three sausage rolls, a large piece of cheese, a hunk of bread,
half a meat pie and two jam tarts went the same way. After that Jo felt a lot
better. She remembered the others and thought how hungry they must be feeling,
too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
found a rush bag hanging on a nail and slipped some food into it - more sausage
rolls, some rock-buns, some cheese and bread. Now, if only she could find the
others, how they would welcome her!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
put the big key at the bottom of the rush basket. She was feeling very, very
pleased with herself. Red and Simmy and Jake were all nicely locked up and out
of the way. She didn’t fear Markhoff as much as Red. She was sure she could get
away from him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
wasn’t even sorry for her father, Simmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
had no love for him and no respect, because he was everything that a father
shouldn’t be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
heard Markhoff come raging into the kitchen and she clambered quickly up on the
larder shelf, ready to drop out of the window if he tried the door. But he
didn’t. He raged out again, and she heard him no more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
unlocked the door very cautiously. There was now an old woman in the kitchen,
standing by the table, folding some clothes she had brought in from the clothes
line in the yard. She stared in the greatest surprise at Jo peeping out of the
larder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What...?’
she began, indignantly; but Jo was out of the room before she had even got out
the next word. The old dame waddled over to the larder and began to wail as she
saw all the empty plates and dishes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
went cautiously into the front hall. She could hear Markhoff upstairs, still
tearing about. She smiled delightedly and slipped over to the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
undid it and pulled it open. Then, keeping to the wall, she sidled like a
weasel to the door that led underground. She opened it and went through,
shutting it softly behind her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
to find the others. She felt sure they must be down in the caves. How pleased
they would be with the food in her bag!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
half-fell down the steep steps, and made her way as quickly as she could down
the slanting passage. She had no torch and had to feel her way in the dark. She
wasn’t in the least afraid. Only when she trod on a sharp stone with her bare
foot did she make a sound.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
other three - Julian, Dick and George - were still sitting crouched together
with Timmy in the centre. Julian had been once up to the door that led into the
yard and had cautiously peered out to see what was to be seen - but had seen
nothing at all except for an old woman hanging out some clothes on a line.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
three had decided to wait till night before they did anything. They thought
maybe Timmy might have recovered a little then, and would be of some help in
protecting them against Red or Markhoff. They half-dozed, sitting together for
warmth, enjoying the heat of Timmy’s big body.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
growled! Yes, he actually growled - a thing he hadn’t done at all so far.
George put a warning hand on him. They all sat up, listening. A voice came to
them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Julian!
Dick! Where are you? I’ve lost my way!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
Jo!’ cried Dick, and switched on his torch at once. ‘Here we are, Jo! How did
you escape? What’s happened?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Heaps,’
said Jo, and came gladly over to them. ‘My, it was dark up in those passages
without a torch. Somehow I went the wrong way. That’s why I yelled. But I
hadn’t gone far wrong. Have a sausage roll?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What?’
cried three hungry voices, and even Timmy lifted his head and began to sniff at
the rush basket that Jo carried.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
laughed and opened the basket. She handed out all the food and the three of
them fell on it like wolves. ‘Jo, you’re the eighth wonder of the world,’ said
Dick. ‘Is there anything left in the basket?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Jo, and took out the enormous key. ‘This, look! I locked Red and Jake and
Simmy into that tower room, and here’s the key. What do you think of that?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She
is,’ said Dick, and to Jo’s enormous delight he gave her a sudden quick hug. ‘I
never knew such a girl in my life. Never. She’s got the pluck of twenty!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It

any of you, will you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Of

did it all for Dick, really,’ she said. ‘But next time I’ll do it for you!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Goodness,
I hope there won’t be a next time,’ said George, with a shiver. ‘I can’t say I
enjoyed one single minute of the last few days.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
suddenly put his head on Jo’s knee. She stroked him. ‘Look at that!’ she said.
‘He remembers me. He’s better, isn’t he, George?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>George
carefully removed Timmy’s head from Jo’s knee to her own. She felt decidedly
friendly towards Jo now, but not to the extent of having Timmy put his head on
Jo’s knee. She patted him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
he’s better,’ she said. ‘He ate half the sausage roll I gave him, though he
sniffed at it like anything first. I think he knows something has been put into
his food and now he’s suspicious of it. Good old Timmy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all felt much more lively and cheerful now that they were no longer so
dreadfully empty. Julian looked at his watch. ‘It’s getting on towards evening
now,’ he said. ‘I wonder what all those fellows are doing.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Three
of them were still locked up! No matter how Markhoff had tried to batter in the
door, it held. It was old and immensely strong, and the lock held without
showing any sign of giving way even an eighth of an inch. Two other men had
been called in from the garage to help, but except that the door looked
decidedly worse for wear, it stood there just the same, sturdy and unbreakable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Simmy
and Jake watched Red as he walked up and down the tower room like a caged lion.
They were glad they were two against one. He seemed like a madman to them as he
raged and paced up and down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Markhoff,
outside with the other two men he had brought up to help, was getting very
worried. No police had arrived as yet (and wouldn’t either, because Joan hadn’t
been able to tell them anything except that she knew Julian and Dick had gone
to see a man called Red - but where he lived she had no idea!).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
Red and Markhoff didn’t know this - they felt sure that a police ambush was
somewhere nearby. If only they could get away in the helicopter before anything
else happened!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Markhoff!
Take Carl and Tom and go down into those underground caves,’ ordered Red at
last. ‘Those children are sure to be there - it’s the only place for them to
hide. They can’t get out of here because the front gate is locked and bolted,
and the wall’s too high to climb. Get hold of the kids and search them for the
key.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
Markhoff and two burly fellows went downstairs and out of the door. They
crossed the yard to the door that led to the caves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
got down the steep steps and were soon stumbling along the narrow, slanting
passage, their nailed boots making a great noise as they went. They hung on to
the hand-rail when they came to the difficult stretch of tunnel, and finally came
out into the cave that had the hole in the floor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was nobody there. The children had heard the noise of the coming men, and had
hurriedly swung themselves down through the hole into the cave below.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
ran through into another cave, the sour smelling one where bats lived and
slept. Then round the rocky corner into the first cave, the curious oval-shaped
one that led out to the ledge of rock overlooking the steep cliff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘There’s
nowhere to hide,’ groaned Julian. He looked back into the cave. At least it was
better in there than out on this ledge, outlined by the daylight. He pulled the
others back into the cave, and shone his torch up and down the walls to find
some corner that they could squeeze behind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Half-way
up the wall was a shelf of rock. He hoisted George up there, and she dragged
Timmy up too. Poor Timmy - he wasn’t much use to them; he was still so bemused
and so very sleepy. He had growled at the noise made by the coming men, but had
dropped his head again almost immediately.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Dick
got up beside George. Julian found a jutting-out rock and tried to hide behind
it, while Jo lay down in a hole beside one wall and covered herself cleverly
with sand. Julian couldn’t help thinking how sharp Jo was. She always seemed to
know the best thing to do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
as it happened, Jo was the only one to be discovered! It was quite by accident
- Markhoff trod on her. He and the other two men had let themselves down
through the hole into the cave below, had then gone into the cave of bats, seen
no sign of anyone there, and were now in the cave that led to the cliff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Those
kids aren’t here,’ said one of the men. ‘They’ve gone to hide somewhere else.
What a horrible place this is - let’s go back.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Markhoff
was flashing his torch up and down the walls to see if any of the children were
crouching behind a jutting rock - and he trod heavily on Jo’s hand. She gave an
agonized yell, and Markhoff almost dropped his torch!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
a trice he had pulled the girl out of her bed of sand and was shaking her like
a rat. ‘This is the one we want!’ he said to the others. ‘She’s got the key.
Where is it, you little rat? Give it to me or I’ll throw you down the cliff!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
was horrified. He felt quite certain that Markhoff really would throw Jo down
the cliff, and he was just about to jump down to help her, when he heard her
speak.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘All
right. Let me go, you brute. Here’s the key! You go and let my Dad out before
the police come! I don’t want him caught!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Markhoff
gave an exclamation of triumph, and snatched a shining key out of Jo’s hand. He
gave her a resounding box on the ear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
little toad! You can just stay down here with the others, and it’ll be a very,
very long stay! Do you know what we’re going to do? We’re going to roll a big
rock over the hole in that other cave’s roof - and you’ll be prisoners!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
can’t escape upwards - and you won’t be able to escape downwards. You’ll be
dashed on the rocks by the sea if you try to swim away. That’ll teach you to
interfere!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
other two men guffawed. ‘Good idea Mark,’ said one. ‘They’ll all be nicely
boxed up here and nobody will know where they are! Come on - we’ve no time to
lose. If Red isn’t unlocked soon he’ll go mad!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
made their way into the heart of the cliff again, and the listening children
heard their footsteps getting fainter. Finally they ceased altogether, as one
by one the men levered themselves up through the hole in the roof of the last
cave, and disappeared up the narrow, low-roofed tunnel that led to the
courtyard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
came out from his hiding-place, looking grim and rather scared. ‘That’s done
it!’ he said. ‘If those fellows really do block up that hole - and I bet they
have already - it looks as if we’re here for keeps! As he said, we can’t get
up, and we can’t escape down - the sea’s too rough for us to attempt any
swimming, and the cliff’s unclimbable above the ledge!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’ll
go and have a look and see if they have blocked up that hole,’ said Dick. ‘They
may be bluffing.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it hadn’t been bluff. When Julian and Dick shone their torches on to the hole
in the roof, they saw that a great rock was now blocking it up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
could not get through the hole again. It was impossible to move the rock from
below. They went soberly back to the front cave and sat out on the ledge in the
light of the sinking sun.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
a pity poor Jo was found,’ said George. ‘And an even greater pity she had to
give up the key! Now Red and the others will go free.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘They
won’t,’ said Jo, surprisingly. ‘I didn’t give them the key of the tower room.
I’d another key with me - the key of the kitchen larder! And I gave them that.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
I’m blessed!’ said Julian, astounded. ‘The things you do, Jo! But how on earth
did you happen to have the key of the larder?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
told them how she had taken it out and locked herself in when she was having a
meal there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
had to unlock the door to get out again, of course,’ 'she said. ‘And I thought
I’d take that key, too, because, who knows? - I might have wanted to get into
that larder again and lock myself in with the food!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No
one will ever get the better of you, Jo,’ said Dick with the utmost conviction.
‘Never. You’re as cute as a bagful of monkeys. So you’ve still got the right
key with you?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Jo. ‘And Red and my Dad and Jake are still locked up in the tower room!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
suddenly a most disagreeable thought struck Dick. “Wait a bit!’ he said.
‘What’s going to happen when they find they’ve got the wrong key? They’ll be
down here again, and my word, what’ll happen to us all then!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
thought that the men might soon return even angrier than they had been before
was most unpleasant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘As
soon as Markhoff tries the key in the door of the tower room he’ll find it
won’t unlock it, and he’ll know that Jo has tricked him!’ said George.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
then he’ll be in such a fury that he’ll tear down here again, and goodness
knows what will happen to us!’ groaned Julian. ‘What shall we do? Hide again?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,’
said Dick. ‘Let’s get out of here and climb down the cliff to the sea. I’d feel
safer there than up here in this cave. We might be able to find a better
hiding-place down on the rocks in that little cove.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
a pity my boat’s smashed,’ said George, with a sigh for her lovely boat. ‘And,
I say - how are we going to get old Timmy down?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was a conference about this. Timmy couldn’t climb down, that was certain. Jo
remembered the rope still hanging down the side of the cliff to the ledges
below - the one she had tied there to help Julian and Dick climb up the steep
sides of the cliff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
know,’ she said, her quick mind working hard again. ‘You go down first, Julian,
then Dick. Then George can go - each of you holding on to the rope as you climb
down, in case you fall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Then
I’ll haul up the rope and tie old Timmy to it, round his waist - and I’ll lower
him down to you. He’s so sleepy still, he won’t struggle. He won’t even know
what’s happening!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
what about you?’ said Dick. ‘You’ll be last of all. Will you mind? You’ll be
all alone up on this ledge, with the men coming behind you at any minute.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No,
I don’t mind,’ said Jo. ‘But let’s be quick.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
went down first, glad of the rope to hold to as his feet and hands searched for
crevices and cracks. Then came Dick, almost slipping in his anxiety to get
down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
George climbed down, slowly and anxiously, not at all liking the steep cliff.
Once she glanced down to the sea below, and felt sick. She shut her eyes for a
moment and clung with one hand to the rope.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was a dreadful business getting Timmy down. George stood below, anxiously
waiting. Jo found it very difficult to tie Timmy safely. He was big and heavy,
and didn’t like being tied up at all, though he really seemed hardly to know
what was going on. At last Jo had got the knots well and securely tied, and
called out to the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here
he comes. Watch out that the rope doesn’t break. Oh, dear - I wish he wouldn’t
struggle - now he’s bumped himself against the cliff!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was not at all a nice experience for poor Timmy. He swung to and fro on the
rope as he was slowly let down, and was amazed to find that he was suspended in
mid air. Above him Jo panted and puffed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
he’s so awfully heavy! I hope I shan’t have to let go. Look out for him!’ she
screamed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
weight was too much for her just at the last, and the rope was let out with
rather a rush. Fortunately Timmy was only about six feet up then, and Julian
and George managed to catch him as he suddenly descended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
coming now,’ called Jo, and without even holding the rope, or looking at it,
she climbed down like a monkey, seeming to find handholds and footholds by
magic. The others watched her admiringly. Soon she was standing beside them.
George was untying Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Thanks
awfully, Jo,’ said George, looking up gratefully at Jo. ‘You’re a wonder. Tim
must have been frightfully heavy.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
was,’ said Jo, giving him a pat. ‘I nearly dropped him. Well - what’s the next
move?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
hunt round this queer little cove a bit and see if there’s any place we can
hide,’ said Julian. ‘You go that way, George, and we’ll go this.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
parted, and began to hunt for a hiding-place. As far as Julian and Dick could
see there was none at all, at least on the side they were exploring. The sea
swept into the cove, swelling and subsiding - and just outside the great waves
battered on to the rocks. There was certainly no chance of swimming out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was suddenly an excited shriek from George. ‘Ju! Come here. Look what I’ve
found!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all rushed round to where George was standing, behind a big ledge of rock. She
pointed to a great mass of something draped with seaweed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
boat! It’s covered with seaweed - but it’s a boat!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
your boat!’ yelled Dick, suddenly, and began to pull the fronds of seaweed
madly off the hidden boat. ‘Markhoff didn’t smash it! It’s here, perfectly all
right. He couldn’t find it - it was hidden so well with seaweed - so he just
came back to Red and told him a lie.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He
didn’t smash it!’ shouted Jo, and she, too, began to pull away the seaweed.
‘It’s quite all right - there’s nothing wrong with it. He didn’t smash it!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four children were so tremendously surprised and joyful that they thumped each
other ridiculously on the back, and leapt about like mad things. They had their
boat after all - George’s good, sound boat. They could escape, hip hip hurrah!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
roar from above made them fall silent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
gazed up, startled. Markhoff and the other two men were on the ledge far above,
shouting and shaking their fists.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
wait till we get you!’ yelled Markhoff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Quick,
quick!’ said Julian, urgently, pulling at the boat. ‘We’ve got just a chance.
Pull her down to the water, pull hard!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Markhoff
was now coming down the cliff, and Jo wished she had untied the rope before she
herself had climbed down, for Markhoff was finding it very useful. She tugged
at the boat with the others, wishing it wasn’t so heavy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boat was almost down to the water when something happened. Timmy, who had been
gazing at everything in a most bewildered manner, suddenly slid off the ledge
he was on and fell straight into the sea. George gave a scream.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh,
Timmy! He’s in the water, quick, quick - he’s too doped to swim! He’ll drown!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and Dick didn’t dare to stop heaving at the boat, because they could see that
Markhoff would soon be down beside them. George rushed to Timmy, who was
splashing around in the waves, still looking surprised and bemused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
the water had an amazing effect on him. It was cold and it seemed to bring him
to his senses quite suddenly. He became much more lively and swam strongly to
the rock off which he had slipped. He clambered out with George’s help, barking
loudly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
boat slid into the water, and Julian grabbed at George. ‘Come on. In you get.
Buck up!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
was in the boat and so was Dick. George, trying to clutch at Timmy, was hauled
in, too. Julian took a despairing look at Markhoff, who was almost at the end
of the rope, about to jump down. They just wouldn’t get off in time!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
suddenly slipped out of George’s grasp and tore madly over to the cliff barking
warningly. He seemed to be perfectly all right. The sudden coldness of the sea
had washed away all his dopeyness and sleepiness. Timmy was himself again!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Markhoff
was about five feet above the ledge when he heard Timmy barking. He looked down
in horror and saw the big dog trying to jump up at him. He tried to climb up
quickly, out of Timmy’s reach.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof!’
barked Timmy. ‘Woof, woof, woof! Grrrrrrr!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Look
out - he’ll have your foot off!’ yelled one of the men above on the ledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
mad - angry - he’s savage. Look out Mark!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Markhoff
was looking out! He was terrified. He clambered up another few feet, and then
found that Timmy was making runs at the cliff to try and get up after him. He
went up a bit further and clung to the rope with one hand, afraid of falling
and being pounced on by the furious Timmy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Come
on, Timmy!’ suddenly cried George. ‘Come on!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
four of them had now got the boat on the waves, and if only they had Timmy they
could set off and row round the rocks at the cave entrance before Markhoff
could possibly reach them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy!
Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
heard, cast a last regretful look at Markhoff’s legs, and bounded across to the
boat. He leapt right in and stood there, still barking madly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Markhoff
dropped down the rope to the ledge - but he was too late. The boat shot out to
the entrance of the cove and rounded it. In half a minute it had disappeared
round the rocky corner and was out at sea.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
and Dick rowed steadily. George put her arms round Timmy and buried her face in
his fur. Jo did the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘He’s
all right again, quite all right,’ said George, happily.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
falling into the cold water did it,’ agreed Jo, ruffling up his fur. ‘Good old
Timmy!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Timmy
was now snuffling about in the bottom of the boat joyfully. He had smelt a
lovely smell. Jo wondered what he had found. Then she knew.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
the packet of sandwiches we brought with us in the boat and never ate!’ she
cried. ‘Good old Timmy - he’s wolfing the lot!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Let
him!’ said Julian, pulling hard at the oars. ‘He deserves them all! My word,
it’s nice to hear his bark again and see his tail wagging.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
wag it certainly did. It never stopped. The world had come right again for
Timmy, he could see and hear properly again, he could bark and caper and jump -
and he had his beloved George with him once more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
for home,’ said Julian. ‘Anne will be pleased to see us. Gosh, what a time
we’ve had!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was getting dark as George’s boat came into Kirrin Bay. It had seemed a very
long pull indeed, and everyone was tired out. The girls had helped in the
rowing when the boys had almost collapsed from exhaustion, and Timmy had
cheered everyone up by his sudden high spirits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Honestly,
his tail hasn’t stopped wagging since he got into the boat,’ said George. ‘He’s
so pleased to be himself again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
small figure was on the beach as they came in, half-lost in the darkness. It
was Anne. She called out to them in a trembling voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
it really you? I’ve been watching for you all day long! Are you all right?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Rather!
And we’ve got George and Timmy, too!’ shouted back Dick, as the boat scraped on
the shingle. ‘We’re fine!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
jumped out, Timmy too, and hauled the boat up the beach. Anne gave a hand,
almost crying with joy to have them all again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’s
bad enough being in the middle of an adventure,’ she said, ‘but it’s much, much
worse when you’re left out. I’ll never be left out again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Woof,’
said Timmy, wagging his tail in full agreement. He never wanted to be left out
of adventures either!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>They
all went home - rather slowly, because they were so tired. Joan was on the
look-out for them, as she had been all day. She screamed for joy when she saw
George. ‘George! You’ve got George at last! Oh, you bad children, you’ve been
away all day and I didn’t know where and I’ve been worried to death. George,
are you all right?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,
thank you,’ said George, who felt as if she was about to fall asleep at any
moment. ‘I just want something to eat before I fall absolutely sound asleep!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘But
where have you been all day? What have you been doing?’ cried Joan, as she
bustled off to get them a meal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
got so worked up I went to the police - and what a silly I felt - I couldn’t
tell them where you’d gone or anything. All I could say was you’d gone to find
a man called Red, and had rowed away in George’s boat!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘The
police have been up and down the coast in a motor-boat ever since,’ said Anne.
‘Trying to spot you, but they couldn’t.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘No.
Our boat was well hidden,’ said Dick. ‘And so were we! So well hidden that I
began to think we’d stay hidden for the rest of our lives.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
telephone bell rang. Julian jumped. ‘Oh, good - you’ve had the telephone
mended. I’ll go and ’phone the police when you’ve answered this call, Joan.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it was the police themselves on the telephone, very pleased to hear Joan saying
excitedly that all the children were back safely. ‘We’ll be up in ten minutes,’
they said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
ten minutes’ time the five children and Timmy were tucking into a good meal.
‘Don’t stop,’ said the police sergeant, when he came into the room with the
constable the children had seen before. ‘Just talk while you’re eating.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
they talked. They told about every single thing. First George told a bit, then
Jo, then Dick then Julian. At first the sergeant was bewildered, but then the
bits of information began to piece themselves together in his mind like a
jigsaw puzzle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Will
my father go to prison?’ asked Jo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I’m
afraid so,’ said the sergeant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Bad
luck, Jo,’ said Dick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t mind,’ said Jo. ‘I’m better off when he’s away - I don’t have to do
things he tells me then.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘We’ll
see if we can’t fix you up with a nice home,’ said the sergeant kindly. ‘You’ve
run wild, Jo - you want looking after.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
don’t want to go to a Home for Bad Girls,’ said Jo, looking scared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
shan’t let you,’ said Dick. ‘You’re one of the pluckiest kids I’ve ever known.
We’ll none of us let you go to a Home. We’ll find someone who’ll be kind to you
someone like - like...’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Like
me,’ said Joan, who was listening, and she put her arm rouund Jo and gave her a
squeeze. ‘I’ve got a cousin who’d like a ragamuffin like you - a bad little
girl with a very good heart. Don’t you fret. We’ll look after you.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
wouldn’t mind living with somebody like you,’ said Jo, in an offhand way. ‘I
wouldn’t be mean any more then, and I daresay I wouldn’t be bad. I’d like to
see Dick and all of you sometimes, though.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘You
will if you’re good,’ said Dick, with a grin. ‘But mind - if I ever hear you’ve
got in at anyone’s pantry window again, or anything like that, I’ll never see
you again!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
grinned. She was very happy. She suddenly remembered something and put her hand
into the little rush basket she still carried. She took out an enormous key.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Here
you are,’ she said to the sergeant. ‘Here’s the key to the tower room. I bet
Red and the others are still locked up there, ready for you to catch! My, won’t
they get a shock when you unlock the door and walk in!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Quite
a lot of people are going to get shocks,’ said the sergeant, putting away his
very full note-book. ‘Miss Georgina, you’re lucky to get away unharmed, you and
your dog. By the way, we got in touch with a friend of your father’s, when we
tried to find out about those papers that were stolen. He says your father gave
him all his important American papers before he went - so this fellow Red
hasn’t anything of value at all. He went to all his trouble for nothing.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Do
you know anything about Red?’ asked Julian. ‘He seemed a bit mad to me.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘If
he’s the fellow we think he is, he’s not very sane,’ said the sergeant. ‘We’ll
be glad to have him under lock and key - and that man Markhoff too. He’s not as
clever as Red, but he’s dangerous.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘I
hope he hasn’t escaped in that helicopter,’ said Dick. ‘He meant to go
tonight.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Well,
we’ll be there in under an hour or so,’ said the sergeant. ‘I’ll just use your
telephone, if I may, and set things going ’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Things
were certainly set going that night! Cars roared up to Red’s house, and the
gate was broken in when no one came to open it. The helicopter was still in the
yard - but alas! it was on its side, smashed beyond repair. The children were
told afterwards that Markhoff and the other two men had tried to set off in it,
but there was something wrong - and it had risen some way and then fallen back
to the yard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
old woman was trying to look after the three hurt men, who had crawled from
their seats and gone to bathe their cuts and bruises. Marthon had hurt his
head, and showed no fight at all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘And
what about Red?’ the sergeant asked Markhoff. ‘Is he still locked up?’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Yes,’
said Markhoff, savagely. ‘And a good thing, too. You’ll have to break that door
down with a battering-ram to get him and the others out.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Oh
no, we shan’t,’ said the sergeant, and produced the key. Markhoff stared at it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘That
kid!’ he said. ‘She gave me the key of the larder. Wait till I get her - she’ll
be sorry.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It’ll
be a long wait, Markhoff,’ said the sergeant. ‘A long, long wait. We’ll have to
take you off with us, I’m afraid.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Red,
Simmy and Jake were still locked up, and were mad with rage. But they saw that
the game was up, and it wasn’t long before all of them were safely tucked away
in police cars.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘A
very, very nice little haul,’ said the sergeant to one of his men. ‘Very neat,
too - three of them all locked up ready for us!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘What
about that kid, Jo?’ said the man. ‘She seems a bad lot, and as clever as they
make them!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘She’s
going to have a chance now,’ said the sergeant. ‘Everybody has a chance
sometimes, and this is hers. She’s just about half-and-half. I reckon - half
bad and half good. But she’ll be all right now she’s got a chance!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jo
was sleeping in Joan’s room again. The rest were in their own bedrooms, getting
ready for bed. They suddenly didn’t feel sleepy any more. Timmy especially was
very lively, darting in and out of the rooms, and sending the landing mats
sliding about all over the place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Timmy!
If you jump on my bed again I’ll slam the door on you!’ threatened Anne. But
she didn’t, of course. It was so lovely to see old Timmy quite himself once
more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
telephone bell suddenly rang, and made everyone jump.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Now
what’s up?’ said Julian, and went down in the hall to answer it. A voice spoke
in his ear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Is
that Kirrin 011? This is Telegrams. There is a cable for you, with reply
prepaid. I am now going to read it.’<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>   </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Go
ahead,’ said Julian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘It
is from Seville in Spain,’ said the voice, ‘and reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“HERE

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Julian
repeated the message to the others, who had now crowded round him in the hall.
‘What reply shall I give?’ he asked. ‘No good upsetting them now everything is
over!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Not
a bit of good,’ said Dick. ‘Say what you like!’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Right!’
said Julian, and turned to the telephone again. ‘Hallo - here is the reply
message, please. Ready?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>“HAVING
A MOST EXCITING TIME, WITH LOTS OF FUN AND GAMES, EVERYTHING OKAY - JULIAN”.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>‘Everything
okay,’ repeated Anne, as they went upstairs to bed once more ‘That’s what I
like to hear at the end of an adventure. Everything okay.’<span
